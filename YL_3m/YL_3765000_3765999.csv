* For those of you who insist on asking how much cash I will take despite the fact that it is a for trade only listing, Send me what you will pay cash for it. I do not want to negotiate a price I want to trade it. If you must make an offer, make it. But you only get one chance. Don't ask what the least I will take for it is, because I am not a motivated seller, I wouldn't mind trading it for something different but I also wouldn't mind keeping it as the worlds nicest pocket carry gun. I just prefer something that fits my large hands a little better in sacrifice of carry ease. Make your cash offer if you want, but make it your real offer, I do not understand the point or waste of time dickering over the price of a gun that I don't want to sell. Thank you."

As the title says, I'm getting out of reloading. Don't shoot the volume I used to before I had my daughter so I cant justify keeping it around anymore. I have ALOT of stuff I've accumulated.  You can literally pick the stuff up from me, take it to your home, have it setup and be reloading within an hour. I WILL NOT SEPARATE THE POWDER!!! So don't ask. Everything will go as a whole and no less. I will list it in sections so it's easier to see as it is alot. Great Christmas gift for that person in the family that has wanted to get into reloading! Will not ship anything, ANYWHERE. I challenge you to price everything you can that I've listed and come up with a cheaper price. The desk I'm offering is worth 1/2 of what I am asking for everything. $800 firm. Not willing to negotiate.  Text or call REDACTED. This is priced to move. Not interested in trades.

This is one nice rifle!  As stated it's the second generation model,  not to be confused with the first gen that had quality control problems or the newer Xi versions.  This Gen 2 runs great, uses standard ak Mags.   I have used Tapco,  Magpul,  Yugo,  and Chinese ak Mags and all ran perfect with no issues.  It's very accurate,  I have shot targets out to 200 yards repeatedly with ease.  It's a solid piston driven design that runs smooth and clean.  It has a folding stock and will fire with it folded.  I have put exactly 500 rds of silver bear through it with no problems at all.  I have added the following:

Samson Star-556 quad rail,  $300 value 
Samson Sig Flip Up iron Sights,  $200 value
Vltor Flash Hider
Hogue pistol grip and rail covers. 
Comes with 3 Tapco Mags 

This is a beautiful rifle,  in excellent condition,  that shoots cheap ammo accurately.  Selling because it just sits in the safe and it's time to thin the collection.  Cash only,  will not respond to low ball offers,  this is a steal at thus price.  Do your research,  this is a great gun.   Will meet in North  Phoenix at Sportsmans for sale."

In addition, the jacket has a U.S. Air Force-regulation snap down leather lined collar, shoulder epaulets, two snap down pockets,

-you can try me with other offers (no ruger pistols other than the lcp, no non gen 4 glocks, I'm set with 9mms and subcompacts, I don't care for the FS glocks so not intersted in a g17/22/22, hunting rifles, etc.) but above is mostly what I'm in the market for.

I am not interested in trades at this time.  This is a custom build for a customer who had to back out of the deal.  It is a solid firearm and a fair price, especially considering you will not be paying taxes.  I am not desperate to get rid of this weapon but I do want to recuperate what I have into it."

BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE 380 Auto +P Ammo - 80 gr. Barnes TAC-XP (1275fps/ME 289 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box

This load is the direct result of customers wanting the deep penetration of the expanding Barnes X style bullet in a 380 auto+P load. See the below real world velocities from my stock real world pistols. We always use over-the-counter firearms to establish our velocities as using extra long laboratory test barrels gives false high velocity readings and is misleading to the customer who will be firing the ammunition in the real world, not a lab.

1231 — fps - Browning Double Action-3.75 inch barrel
1235 — fps - Walther PPK-3.5 inch barrel - (faster than longer barrel above, no typo)
1130 — fps - Kel Tec PA3T-2.75 inch barrel
1136 — fps - Kahr P380-2.75 inch barrel
The all copper, long-for-weight, Barnes bullet is so long that when seated to an OAL of .940 to .950 inch, the base of the bullet will make a slight bulge in the case, but this DOES NOT affect feeding or chambering as the bulge is not pronounced enough to cause any problems, but in order to avoid endless emails, I’m mentioning it here. In fact, that bulge provides enough resistance to the bullet base, to stop the bullet from being battered deeper into the case upon feeding, which is a very good thing. If we load to a longer cartridge OAL, to eliminate the bulge, the cartridge will be too long to fit some magazines. Feeding was 100% in our over-the-counter test guns.

We are using a flash suppressed powder so the shooter will not be blinded if dropping the hammer in low light, which is when almost all civilian shootings occur in America."

Price dropped to reflect that.

I have a 12 Ga. Mossberg 500 Persuader for sale. It has a 20 inch barrel and an 8 round capacity and comes with a Raptor grip and Hogue fore-end and ATI Talon Heat shield. I will also include the factory butt-stock and recoil pad. Shooting with the Raptor grip is very controllable, and even comfortable as it soaks up a lot of the recoil, even with magnum loads. I've only fired about 200 rounds through it because it is a fun range toy but it mostly sits in the safe and I could use the cash to fund something new. I will also include some assorted target and self defense ammo. 

May trade for .357, 9mm, or .45 handguns, AR-15 Optics, or even a beater AK if you have one laying around. Anything else just ask. May add cash either way depending on what's out there. Asking $300 cash OBO. FTF in Milwaukee area.

Capacity: (1) 30 Round Magazine

Barrel: 16.5"" Mil-Spec, chrome lined, cold-hammer forged CrMoV barrel, 6 groove 1:7 RH twist

The brand new bullpup-rifle from IWI that's taking the world of modern semi-auto rifles by storm. After more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Bullpup configuration; short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy

Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles

Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies

GET THE LATEST IN PISTOL PERFORMANCE
The FNX™ service pistol was introduced in 2009 and incorporates many of the ergonomic improvements initially developed under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program for the FNP™-45 USG. The FNX™ is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol optimized for the 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel, and the checkered polymer frame has two interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.
FNX™-40

The FNX™ offers all of the features that dedicated handgunners want. The ergonomic polymer frame has a low-bore axis for less felt recoil and improved control. The grip panels are checkered and ribbed for comfortable, no-snag carry. Two interchangeable backstraps quickly adapt the FNX™ to fit your hand size. The profiled stainless steel slide has cocking serrations front and rear, and the 4-inch cold hammer-forged, stainless steel barrel delivers pinpoint accuracy. Ambidextrous operating controls make the FNX™ perfect for competition or personal defense. Every FNX™ is made in the USA

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7SF. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its unique right-side folding tubular buttstock to its 24x1.5mm muzzle threads with muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7SF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7SF rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7SF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability
