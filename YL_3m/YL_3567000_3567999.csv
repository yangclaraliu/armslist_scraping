So, I am Military, and my wife has informed me that we are moving to California when I retire. DPMS Panther Arms is on the by name banned list, which means I cannot just add a bullet button to make it legal.

I have been waiting to buy the right sight, so, it has never been to the range.

CA is weird, and I can put together a different, non-DPMS, lower to make the rifle CA legal. So, I will sell just the lower for $550 or the complete rifle with seven mags for $1400.

Cash is preferred; however, I will trade for rifles or pistols, with or without cash on either end for the right deal. If interested in a trade, tell me what you have, and what you think it is worth in your first email. For the survivalists out there, I will take gold or silver @ spot, but no junk coins.

I will pay for the background check at a dealer or my choice, or you can pay for it at a dealer of your choice."

If you actually have to take time to think about it.....don't bother reading this ad. I was a child of the late 40's and early 50's. Back then you did not worry about people killing others or breaking into your house, car, etc. Well those days are gone forever. This is not a scare tactic... This is Reality in today's world.  Watch the news. Read the paper. Crime is bad and getting worse daily. Criminals don't care about us. It is all about them and their habits. 

I bought four of these to send to my 3 adult kids in different states and 1 for myself, but decided to not go through the hassle of shipping a firearm and just sent them the money to pickup one locally, so I will offer the 3 extras I bought for sale and keep one for myself. The $240 price is firm. This weapon is perfect for Home Defense. With the 18 1/2"" barrel you can maneuver around the doors and hallway of your home. Protect Yourself. Don't expect anyone else to protect your home, property or family in a break-in situation, as the response time for assistance takes too long. I very recently had about $1000 worth of stuff stolen by my garage. I figured I would just call the insurance company and they would take care of my loss. NOPE, The theft deductible is 1% of the value of your home. So if you have a $200,000 home, the 1st $2000 comes out of your pocket, so I got nothing back for my loss. I will tell you that now if someone breaks into my home or steals from me, I will shoot to kill....not shoot to wound. I don't want them coming back later. A shotgun shell is less than 50 cents and that is now my new insurance policy in addition to my homeowners insurance against theft.

STEVENS SAVAGE ARMS MODEL 320 12G PUMP SHOTGUN WITH PISTOL GRIP, GHOST RING SIGHTS- NEW IN UNOPENED BOX $240.00. The pictures I have attached are only stock pictures.

The Ghost Ring Sights model runs an additional $35.00 + over the bead sight model and is favored. This model is not carried by Walmart as they only sell the cheaper model. Be legal to buy a shotgun and have your FL drivers license with you. I will fill out a bill of sale.

It comes with the SA aceesory kit which includes two magazines, an outside the waistband holster and an outside the other waistband double magazine carrier; neither of the holsters have ever been used. I also added a Wilson Combat frontstrap checkering piece which can be removed easily. This gun is like new with well under 500 rounds shot through it. After every shooting, it was stripped, cleaned and lubricated.

This would make a fantastic competition gun or range gun with the adjustable sights or even a carry gun with the accessory kit. I have shot and owned numerous 1911s, including Colts, Kimbers and a Rock River and I will say with absolutely honesty this Springfield is one of the best I've owned. Essentially, the Range Officer is custom, match-level 1911, just not from Springfield's custom shop and therefore without the price. Check Springfield's website for details.

The reason I'm selling it is because my late father was so taken with my this Range Officer, he bought one for himself and so now I have two.  No low-ball offers, I am not needing to sell this and I don't mind waiting to get the money it's worth.

The buyer must have a Michigan driver's license with either a valid CPL with RI-060 or purchase permit, no exceptions."

The barrel nut is separated into two parts. A tri-lug is attached to a standard AR15 upper receiver. A lock collar captures the barrel and gas tube, and is attached to a free float handguard. To employ the system, carefully insert the gas tube and barrel into the upper receiver and twist the lock collar up to 1/3 of a turn. You will hear and feel the ratchet lock as the lock collar seats into the tri-lug. Your barrel is now securely attached and your rifle ready for battle. Any standard front gas block can be used with the Dolos, from an A pillar sight post to a low profile or railed gas block. Simply purchase a free float tube for your particular gas system. Why do I need Dolos? •Real firepower right here, right now. Handguns have a place - to get you to the rifle you should have had in the first place. •Fast deployment A Dolos equiped rifle can be ready to stop long distance threats and save lives in less than 10 seconds. •Small package The Dolos enables you to pack any AR into a very small package. It is easy to transport on a motorcycle or any small vehicle. When do I need Dolos? •Backpacking •Bugout bag •Active shooter response •When you want to legally carry or transport a rifle without fear of harrassment, intimidation or arrest SEARCH YOUTUBE UNDER HUNTERTOWN ARMS"

It's in as-new condition with less than 100rds through it. It includes an aftermarket soft case that fit's it well. It has a ghost ring rear site as well as a picitiny rail built into the receiver for a red dot or optic sight.

Action was made in Belgium and the 26” barrel has a muzzle break. It was embedded in a nice walnut stock by CD miller. Has recoil pad built in. Comes with padded leather tooled case and loaded ammo and empty brass. The rifling in the barrel has a bit to slow of a twist (1-11) so it will not stabilize bullets heavier than 160 grain bullets, but there is no need for those unless you go to Africa to hunt.  I suggest that ammo for this gun be hand loaded to the listed safe max, which I have done. I shot two rounds of 160 grain bullets in a 9/16 group and three bullets into a 1 ¼” group at 150 yards. It is a very powerful cartridge. All my kills on deer and a very large elk have been one shot instant kills. In fact, this cartridge is too powerful for deer unless you plan on long range shots over 200 yards. It is excellent for elk. I have had this rifle since late 60. I hunted for about 15 years then quit about 25 years ago due to my age. Most all my successful hunts had me firing one shot per year."

The Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic) was designed with the input of current and former professionals to create the most dynamic Red Dot sight available. Featuring band-pass lens coating, the PRO is compatible with every generation of night vision devices and provides a crystal clear 1x image for quick target acquisition in close quarter situations. The modular QRP2 mount securely attaches to standard picatinny rails and includes a removable spacer that provides optimal height for co-witness with iron sights on carbine style weapons. Additionally, the QRP2 incorporates a torque limiting knob to completely eliminate over tightening. You won't need to worry about turning the battery on and off with the PRO. The 3-year battery life allows you to turn the unit on out of the box and leave it on for an always ready sight. Other features include a see through ocular lens cap and standard objective flip-up lens cap that are both recessed to prevent impact damage, a rugged 30mm tube, threaded objective bell for use of ARD (Anti-Reflective Device), 4 Night vision settings and 6 daylight settings, battery and adjustment cap retainers to prevent them from being lost in the field, and a ten year pesronal use warranty.

The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols.

This scope is designed so you don't have to turn turrets for multiple target engagement at various distances. This is good for everything from combat to hog hunting. This scope is no longer needed because I just cut a bolt gun down to 16"" barrel. The extra yardage is kind or a waste for my short barreled handy rifle. This will come with steel TPS 30mm rings for a Piccatinney rail, new Nightforce steel two piece 6/48"" base for a Remington 700, padded scope cover, Butler Creek scope caps and all the disc, paperwork, sticker, sunshade and box items that it came with. This scope is less than a year old and only 450 rounds fired using it. You will not be disappointed. All this stuff total cost well over $2,000.00! Shoot me an offer, I may consider it.

I haven't gotten around to cleaning them or freshening up the paint on those that might need it.

The scope is no longer mounted on the rifle anymore. 

Hi Im selling my Leupold Mark 4 illuminated TMR reticle 4.5-14x50mm (30mm main tube). I had this scope for a little over a month (still have box). Reason Im selling is that I was planning on doing more long range shooting than I actually have time for (or the money). This scope was going to be used as duel use for long range shooting and (long range) hunting. I did not try and cheap out on this scope. I bought what would be best for the scope. Also I put in a lot of time lapping the rings so there would be equal pressure around the body of the scope. 

The scope is in like brand new condition. It is currently held by Burris extreme tactical rings (low), that have been lapped. 

The anti-cant is a Holland Signature Series. Best in my opinion. 

I paid:
Scope $1400
Rings $63
Anti cant $65
----------------------------
Total $1528

Asking $1250 for all 
This is a package deal My loss is your gain!

You are more than welcome to check out the scope but only serious inquiries.
