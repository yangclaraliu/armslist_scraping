It was purchased new in September and has only seen less than 5 hours of use since. It’s in perfect condition. 

I’ve owned or used some of the other thermals in this price range (Eotech X320, ATN OTS-X) and the Pulsar blows them away in my opinion. The clarity is really very impressive and its super easy to operate. The other thing that is a huge plus for the Pulsar Quantum line is the independent manual gain and brightness controls. None of the others in the price range have this feature. I didn’t realize how beneficial this feature was until I used some other units. In fact I originally had another HD19s and sold it because I got a great deal on the more expensive Eotech X320. It didn’t hold a candle to the Pulsar so I so wound up selling it and getting this one. 

The only reason I’m selling is I’m moving to the exact same unit except with more magnification (HD38). 

The unit comes with the original purchase documentation, manual, all cables, etc., plus a bonus; it has a Pulsar hard case, very similar to a pelican. 

Link for specs:

http://pulsarnv.com/pl77313.html

Due to ITAR regulations you must be a U.S. Citizen to own or use a thermal device. 

It's hard to get good photos through any NV unit, however, there are several youtube videos that offer a pretty good representation of the image quality. If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. Thanks for looking!"

124,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3906124,For Trade:  1991 GMC Sonoma 4.3L Stakeback Auto 2wd,"Winchester, Northern Virginia, Virginia",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, January 22, 2015",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hi, thanks for looking!

For trade today is a 1991 GMC Sonoma pickup truck with stakeback bed.  This truck features a powerful 4.3L V6 TBI engine, automatic transmission with overdrive, and a mount for a towing ball.  Recent new parts include the battery, fuel pump, water pump, upper control arms, and more.  It has approximately 161,000 miles.

This is a very reliable truck!  Tires and exhaust are good, all the glass is good, and there is not much noteworthy rust except around a wheel well.

It's a quirky truck that has its nuisance problems, which are easy to fix but not really very pressing.  I removed the stereo and planned to replace it, but I should still have all of the parts to put the old one back in.  The headliner is removed (which I actually prefer).  The heater blower switch is dirty.  The driver's side mirror needs a cheap set screw, which I never got around to adding.  The turn signal arm doesn't automatically click back off after completing a turn.  The left side of the rear bumper is a little bent from where my friend borrowed my truck and then proceeded to back into my Shelby with it.  >_<  These minor issues are easily ignored.  It's a truck!

The stakeback conversion makes for a heavy duty 5'6"" x 8' flat bed area, and the side rails and box are attached with simple bolts and wingnuts.  You can even leave just the box and the flat bed for carrying tools and sheets of lumber, for instance.  It's a simple modular design, so if you can cut and drill, you can make new things to bolt on.  The pressure treated lumber has dried, so it could use some touch-up and a deck treatment.

Thanks for looking, and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask!"

Haven't done that for 3 years now so I don't use it anymore and am into collectable hand guns more. Gun comes with 3 mags a nice Bianchi basket weave high ride leather duty holster and Safariland 2 mag carrier. I hate to sell this one but finiances won't let me keep guns anymore just to have them sit in the closet. Gun has always functioned well and never had a malfunction except when the instructor put in dummy rounds to force a jamb clearing. These guns retail new at Cabella's new with only 2 mags for $600 and that doesn't include tax and backgroud check. Leather retails at least $125. Not interested in traveling or parking lot meets. Must be willing to come to me. and a ccw permit with valid ID is also required with no exception.

I recently decided to change to a Glock 23 as my current daily carry piece is a 27. I just figured I'd pass this cheap gun on to someone else. Obviously if you are looking at this post you are looking for a cheap pistol that gets the job done every time and not worried about looks or weight. It is heavy and Hi-Point gives a lifetime warranty so no worries about it breaking down on you and making a large paperweight. The gun holds 10 in the mag and 1 in the chamber so a pretty decent truck or bag gun with a long sight radius for decent shots. It does have the ghost ring rear sight. I never had a problem hitting whatever target I was going for, just strictly upgrading so my mags will interchange with the new truck gun vs my carry gun. Feel free to text or email if you have questions. If by chance you have an extra Glock 23 gen 3 or 4 you are willing to barter with I'd be willing to make a trade for mine plus cash for yours.

The pistol comes with 1 mag, and the pistol. for an extra 10 bucks you can have an extra holster I have.

I will not sell it to someone that does not have a CCW permit or permit to purchase.

I'm now looking for a truck gun to compliment my Glock and I have no need for this one. It is basically a Glock 42 clone but a little smaller. It breaks down just like a Glock and shoots very well with the 3 dot sight system. Check out TNP guy and he talks very highly of these little pistols mine has no malfunctions after shooting 200 rounds through it. Yes it is used but it is flawless which is more than a gun dealer can say with a brand new pistol. It comes with 1 mag, the pistol, a leather pocket holster, and the plastic box that came with it. I'm looking for 300 boo. If you by chance have an extra Glock 23 I'd be willing to trade mine plus some cash for a Glock.

I do know that this is not the same zoli that is currently importing high end shotguns. Gun has some blueing loss and some light scattered rust speckling here and there I tried to photograph. 

Here’s the ugly about the gun: I get light strikes on the bottom barrel about 1 out of 15-20 rounds with rio shells. (haven’t tried others) I don’t know the complete history of the gun, but I do know it has been to a gunsmith before for the top barrel not firing. I don’t know what that guy did, but I do know that if the bottom barrel fires, the top has always fired for me. Gun locks up tight. I have about 300 rounds through it. It might just need a washer under the hammer spring to give it some extra oomph to fire, I don’t know and don’t want to mess with it. Complete photo album here http://imgur.com/a/1z3nu#0

385,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3906385,For Sale:  AR-15 dual magazine pouches,"west, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 15,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 10, 2015",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I've been making gear for my co-workers and myself for a few years.  I just recently started selling gear on the internet.  If you have something you would like custom made, please don't hesitate to contact me.  I mainly do chest rigs, MOLLE pouches, slings, dog leashes, and riggers belts, but can do other stuff as well.

Up for sale are coyote tan dual AR-15 magazine pouches made by me.  Price is $15 if we meet face to face, or $22 if I ship it.  If I ship it, I prefer you purchase it through my Etsy shop to protect us both.  (https://www.etsy.com/listing/218024774/ar-15-dual-magazine-pouch-coyote-brown?)  

This is a heavy duty dual magazine pouch for AR-15 and similarly sized magazines. This pouch is made in the USA, with materials that are made in the USA. All materials are mil-spec, and Berry Amendment compliant.

The shell of this pouch is made from a double layer of 3"" nylon webbing that conforms to mil-spec 17337. This provides a great amount of strength and abrasion resistance. The body is made from 1000 Denier Cordura, which is the same material used to make plate holders for body armor.

This will fit two AR-15 magazines, both standard aluminum and Magpul polymer magazines in either the bullet-up or bullet-down configuration.

The flap of the pouch secures to the body of the pouch with a generous portion of hook and loop fabric. With one or two magazines inside this pouch, the allowance of the hook and loop will keep your magazines tight to your kit.

On the back of this magazine pouch is a 5 inch PALS strip for attachment to MOLLE gear. Two black MALICE clips are included.

This item was sewn on an industrial sewing machine using size 92 bonded nylon thread. The industry standard is only size 69 bonded nylon thread. Even though it is more time consuming to change bobbins, and more costly, I choose to use a stronger thread because I make gear that people depend their life on."

 If you aren't familiar with the Cougar design it is the precursor to the Beretta PX4 and uses a rotating barrel action to improve accuracy and lower recoil. Identical to the Beretta Cougar aside from the name on the slide; Beretta transferred the tooling and manufacturing equipment to Stoeger, Stoeger being a subdivision of Benelli, which is in turn owned by Beretta. Has the same manual of arms as a Beretta 92/M9, so its a great choice if you're looking for a more compact version for carry.

 Has some light holster wear from being carried but overall is in good shape, bought new about two months ago and only has about 200 rounds through it. Will come with two 13 round magazines. Depending on what you have I can also include an extra 15 round magazine (modified Beretta 92 mag) and I have a fair amount of 9mm ammo.

Just picked up a different compact carry gun, so I'd like to swap this for a bigger 9mm.  Looking for a mid or full sized 9mm.  First choice would be a Springfield XD9 or Ruger SR9, but would consider similar 9mm's in this size range.  Only looking for 9mm's though, and no Taurus or Kel Tecs please.

If not interested in trading I will sell it with the three mags and 50 rounds of 9mm for $350 FIRM.

 I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested, texts preferred.

Model # G4211-1ST (no longer available).  Not a firesafe.

I constructed an interior that included 1/2 with adjustable shelves and 1/2 for long guns with 44"" under the top shelf (see third photo below).  The white item between the barrel cradles is a styrofoam spacer which I used as a fourth barrel cradle. Can easily be converted back to open interior (just remove a half dozen screws).  Original manual and extra barrel cradles.  Sold the pistols and rifles that we used to keep in this safe - so no longer need it. Looks and works like new.

I have a SW MP9c.   I've only shot 1 box of ammo through this piece.  Shot great.  No marks, nicks, etc.  Like a new gun.

Comes with 3 mags.  2 came with it, one that ends flat with the grip, the other slightly extended.  The other one is a full-size (17 rd) MP 9m magazine with a grip extender that matches perfect to the grip.  Make it feel like you're shooting a full size pistol.  Mag and extension was $70 bucks by themselves.

This gun is a competitor to the Glock 26/baby glock - almost exactly the same size.

Looking to sell outright, or possibly trade.  Not much I'm looking for but try me."
