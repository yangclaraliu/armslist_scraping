This rifle has a removable barrel to allow for storage in a pack. The rifle features a rotary internal magazine with built in round counter visible on the side of the receiver.

Rifle is in perfect working order and could be used for hunting immediately if desired. Rifle has some surface rust on one side of the receiver and barrel. Stock has minor damage at the buttstock.

For hunting North American game the Savage 99 is still one of the finest hunting rifles of all time. In fact, it was a solid performer well into the later part of the last century, nearly one hundred years after its creation. It was manufactured for nearly a century with over a million rifles produced before the Savage 99 was discontinued due to decrepit machinery and increased cost.

The design of the 99 is superior to lever actions such as the Winchester 94 and the Marlin 336, because it can handle high intensity cartridges. It has several superior design features that make it more comparable to the Browning BLR and even modern bolt actions like the Winchester Model 70. The rotary spool magazine allows for the use of pointed bullets, which retain greater velocity downrange than the flat point bullets required by lever guns with tubular magazines. Its strong action allowed it to be chambered in many modern, short-action, high intensity cartridges. 

For a rifle designed in the last decade of the 1800's, it had many modern day features that are still prevalent on currently produced rifles. It has a cocking indicator on top of the tang and it ejected spent cartridges at an angle, which made it easily adaptable to the use of telescopic sights."

What you get:
An awesome Sig M400 Enhanced that has a Midwest Industries rail, BCM Medium latch charging handle, Stark Equipment grip with a QD port, and a Magpul MS4 QD sling to attach to the multitude of QD ports on the rifle so you can sling up your freedom delivery device as needed. This piece of equipment has not been able to stretch it's freedom wings like it should and I feel bad so I am putting it up for sale. I bought it brand new and have put 834mm (150 rounds) of freedom through it, so basically it isn't even broken in yet. She has been cleaned and well maintained, I even bought a sweet little bag for it to nest in so she stays clean. Now by now you may be asking yourself, ""self, why does he ask the same price as a new one?"" Well that is a good question and I'm going to answer it. It is because I have installed $230 worth of extras on it and am in no way looking to loose too much money. If she don't sell I will keep her. I might be interested in some trades plus cash such as MP shield, AR lower, AR upper, etc. You could always ask if I'm interested."

So here's the deal.  I have way too many milsurp guns and the wife has had it.  She wants me to sell a whole safes worth, so I chose the smallest one :p

What's left after my friends have purchased I offer for sale/trade here.

So let's be clear.  I am selling/trading these BUT I am not hurting for money so lowballers keep moving.  This is just a wife calming move ;) If you are married you will understand.

1) 1943 Enfield no 1 mk 3* SMLE  in 303 british. This rifle is Australian and comes from the coveted Lithgow plant.  It has gone through a refurb in 1947 so non matching numbers.  The bore is dark grooves but shiny landings with minor pitting.  Crown is still tight and passes the bullet test.  During the refurb it was equipped with a highly decorated WWI era stock dated 1915.  All parts on this rifle are genuine Australian enfield parts. Brass butt plate and brass fasteners throughout.  Feels very high quality compared to other enfields I've held. Metal finish is about 75-80% no rust.  Valued at $350 CASH or $400 trade.  


2)1944 Turkish Mauser in 8mm mauser. K Kale marked receiver.  This rifle is cool! It has a great condition stock with original 1944 armory rack number painted on (lucky number 13) the butt.  What blows my mind about it is that it still has the original hand drawn penciled paper stencil under the wooden hand guard.  This was used to actually carve the stock.... and its still there!  Wow... A true collectors piece!  The bore is dark grooves with shiny landings and no pitting.  The crown is tight and passes the bullet test. The numbers do not match.  The metal finish is about 75-80% no rust.  I shot 2 liter bottles at 200 yards last week with this rifle. Surprisingly low recoil for the huge round since it has such a robust stock (this is a big rifle).  Awesome!  I also have 300 rounds on clips in bandoliers that I can add to this, Turkish made ammo of era of course.  I value the rifle alone at $275 cash $300 trade.  We can discuss the addition of ammo if the time comes.

3) 1944 Russian M44 carbine in 7.62x54R.  The stock on this one is laminated, looks amazing.  All numbers matching, the mag and buttplate have been force matched in a refurb.  The action is very smooth.  The bore is just slightly dark with crisp solid landings.  The crown is tight and passes the bullet test. I've shot 30-40 rounds through this rifle and LOVE the fireballs.  Very accurate for an m44.  I value this rifle at $275 CASH or $300 trade.

4) 1939 1891/30 Russian Mosin Nagant.  This is not a crate picked rifle.  The numbers match but mag is force matched in a refurb.  The stock is great looking with some cool, very small,  woodworking repairs from the factory.  The bore is almost new like.  Mirror like with no pitting and tight crown that passes bullet test.  The metal finish is about 95%, looks great!  Comes with sling, leather ammo pouch, non matching # bayonet, and maybe some original tools if I can find them.  Do NOT email me with offers for a crate pick mosin.  I value this rifle at $225 CASH and $275 trade.


That's all that's left fella's.  I am open to all trades, worst I can do is say NO THANK YOU.
I will try to respond to all emails, I hate it when people don't respond.  I can provide tons of pictures of any of the rifles.  Questions?  Please ask!

Military 5.45×39mm rounds offer better penetration over (fragmenting) military 5.56×45mm NATO rounds.[7][8] However, unlike its 5.56mm counterpart, the 5.45mm round “does not deform or fragment when striking soft tissues.”[7][8] Nevertheless, during the Afghan war the Mujahedeen called the 5.45×39mm round the ""Poison Bullet"" due to the severe wounds it produced to extremities and the resulting need to amputate.The 5.45×39mm cartridge is a rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge. It was introduced into service in 1974 by the Soviet Union for use with the new AK-74 assault rifle. It gradually supplemented then largely replaced the 7.62×39mm round in serviceThe 5.45×39mm cartridge was developed in the early 1970s by a group of Soviet designers and engineers under the direction of M. Sabelnikov. Further group members were: L. I. Bulavsky, B. B. Semin, M. E. Fedorov, P. F. Sazonov, V. Volkov, V. A. Nikolaev, E. E. Zimin and P. S. Korolev.

The 5.45×39mm is an example of an international tendency towards relatively small sized, light weight, high velocity military service cartridges. Cartridges like the 5.45×39mm, 5.56×45mm NATO and Chinese 5.8×42mm allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges and produce relatively low bolt thrust and free recoil impulse, favouring light weight arms design and automatic fire accuracy.[2]

The Soviet original military issue 7N6 cartridge variant introduced in 1974 are loaded with full metal jacket bullets that have a somewhat complex construction. The 3.43 g (52.9 gr) boat-tail projectile has a gilding-metal-clad jacket. The unhardened 1.43 g (22.1 gr) steel (steel 10) rod penetrator core is covered by a thin lead inlay which does not fill the entire point end, leaving a hollow cavity inside the nose. The bullet is cut to length during the manufacturing process to give the correct weight. The 7N6 uses a boat-tail design to reduce drag and there is a small lead plug crimped in place in the base of the bullet. The lead plug, in combination with the air space at the point of the bullet, has the effect of moving the bullet's center of gravity to the rear; the hollow air space also makes the bullet's point prone to deformation when the bullet strikes anything solid, inducing yaw. The brown-lacquered steel case is Berdan primed. Its 39.37 mm (1.55 in) length makes it slightly longer than the 7.62×39mm case which measures exactly 38.60 mm (1.52 in). The primer has a copper cup and is sealed with a heavy red lacquer. The propellant charge is a ball powder with similar burning characteristics to the WC844 powder used in 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. The 7N6 cartridge weight is 10.75 g (165.9 gr).

Tests indicate the free recoil energy delivered by the 5.45×39 mm AK-74 assault rifle is 3.39 J (2.50 ft·lb), compared to 6.44 J (4.75 ft·lb) delivered by the 5.56×45mm NATO in the M16 assault rifle and 7.19 J (5.30 ft·lb) delivered by the 7.62×39mm in the AKM assault rifle.[3]

Military 5.45×39mm ammunition was produced in the former Soviet Union, GDR and Yugoslavia, and is produced in Bulgaria, Poland and Romania. In the former Soviet Union this ammunition is produced in Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine."

The Tac-Con 3MR Trigger System is the latest trend for gun enthusiasts that want selectable firing from their AR-15. This drop in system is a three-mode model. The first position is “Safe” as it is in all of the ARs. The 2nd mode converts the gun into semi-automatic mode which contains a single stage, 4.5 pound pull, match grade. The 3rd is TAC CON patented single stage, 4.5 pound pull, with almost no take up and contains a positive reset feature that reduces the time between shoots. The 3rd mode is a balance between a higher rate of fire with controllability.

http://tacconautotrigger.com/

Once installed, the 3MR will allow the shooter to reach higher rates of fire without compromising accuracy. Different tests have been performed at different gun ranges with test subjects reporting much higher rates of fire then they could with the original trigger group when engaged in the 3rd mode. It is the method in which the device is designed that allows for such rapid fire in such a smooth manner. Because of the design, however, it is not considered a fully automatic part and is 100 percent BATFE classified as a semi-automatic AR 15 trigger.

Quick Facts About The 3MR System

    Easy to install – simply pop out old one and insert the 3MR, you even use the same OEM pins to hold it in place.
    The only selectable 3 mode semi-automatic available on the market today.
    Semi-automatic and third-mode positions have a non-adjustable 4.5 pound pull.

Intended for use with a suppressor, this one of a kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107. An all-new bolt carrier group design and a four-port muzzle brake engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor is key to making the rifle suppressor ready. The Barrett M107’s lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The Barrett M107 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new recoil buffer system that is also optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference. Delivered with a Pelican case, one 10-round magazine, flip-up iron sights, detachable adjustable lightweight bipod legs, lightweight monopod, sling attach points, and owner’s manual.

It comes with the scope mount and a promag 20 mag. It has two factory 10-rd mags as well.

Vepr Super .308 Win caliber rifle, walnut stock,  two 10-rd magazines.

Built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr Super is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavy duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

Vepr Super in .308 Win caliber features a front sight / gas block combination and a fluted barrel with greater surface area for more effective cooling. The venting at the tip of the RPK style barrel acts as a built-in muzzle break and also created a look unique to the Vepr Super rifle. The furniture for this firearm is a solid piece of precision shaped walnut that runs the entire length of the body, ending at the foregrip. A unique feature to this particular firearm is the ambidextrous magazine catch release for ease of use for any gun enthusiast. Unlike an AK or the standard Vepr rifle, there is no scope rail attached to the side of the receiver. Instead, there is a rail system built into the receiver directly, just above the fire control group and below the top cover. A scope mount (not included) can be attached to this rail system.

Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage. They are shipped with two 10-round magazine, a cleaning rod, and a cleaning kit."

This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

Every piece that goes into the Valor series is hand-fit, polished and blended to provide you with not only the best functioning gun we can provide, but also the best looking.""

There is a hairline crack on the right grip, but you may be able to get another set from the manufacturer at no charge, as I did when this happened to me before. There seems to be some kind of flaw with the grips; I did not over-tighten them. Grips were fine when the gun went in to my purse; cracked when I took it out…

It has the buttons in back and can adjust with different settings times strobe, laser. Had a Trijicon scope on her that performed awesome but decided someone might want to fit it with there liking.

Gun purchased brand new from Stonewall about 5 years ago; less than 500 rounds ran through it. It was mainly used a backup concealed carry gun, and was carried in my purse most of the time (save for the annual trip to the range to function check and clean.) 

There is a hairline crack on the right grip, but you may be able to get another set from the manufacturer at no charge, as I did when this happened to me before. There seems to be some kind of flaw with the grips; I did not over-tighten them. Grips were fine when the gun went in to my purse; cracked when I took it out…

660,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3911660,For Sale/Trade:  Attention MilSurp guys! Cleaning out safe. WWII era rifles!,"NKY, Cincinnati, Ohio",$ 0,"Listed On: Monday, January 12, 2015",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello everybody,

 So here's the deal. I have way too many milsurp guns and the wife has had it. She wants me to sell a whole safes worth, so I chose the smallest one :p

 What's left after my friends have purchased I offer for sale/trade here.

 So let's be clear. I am selling/trading these BUT I am not hurting for money so lowballers keep moving. This is just a wife calming move ;) If you are married you will understand.

 1) 1943 Enfield no 1 mk 3* SMLE in 303 british. This rifle is Australian and comes from the coveted Lithgow plant. It has gone through a refurb in 1947 so non matching numbers. The bore is dark grooves but shiny landings with minor pitting. Crown is still tight and passes the bullet test. During the refurb it was equipped with a highly decorated WWI era stock dated 1915. All parts on this rifle are genuine Australian enfield parts. Brass butt plate and brass fasteners throughout. Feels very high quality compared to other enfields I've held. Metal finish is about 75-80% no rust. Valued at $350 CASH or $400 trade. 


 2)1944 Turkish Mauser in 8mm mauser. K Kale marked receiver. This rifle is cool! It has a great condition stock with original 1944 armory rack number painted on (lucky number 13) the butt. What blows my mind about it is that it still has the original hand drawn penciled paper stencil under the wooden hand guard. This was used to actually carve the stock.... and its still there! Wow... A true collectors piece! The bore is dark grooves with shiny landings and no pitting. The crown is tight and passes the bullet test. The numbers do not match. The metal finish is about 75-80% no rust. I shot 2 liter bottles at 200 yards last week with this rifle. Surprisingly low recoil for the huge round since it has such a robust stock (this is a big rifle). Awesome! I also have 300 rounds on clips in bandoliers that I can add to this, Turkish made ammo of era of course. I value the rifle alone at $275 cash $300 trade. We can discuss the addition of ammo if the time comes.

 3) 1944 Russian M44 carbine in 7.62x54R. The stock on this one is laminated, looks amazing. All numbers matching, the mag and buttplate have been force matched in a refurb. The action is very smooth. The bore is just slightly dark with crisp solid landings. The crown is tight and passes the bullet test. I've shot 30-40 rounds through this rifle and LOVE the fireballs. Very accurate for an m44. I value this rifle at $275 CASH or $300 trade.

 4) 1939 1891/30 Russian Mosin Nagant. This is not a crate picked rifle. The numbers match but mag is force matched in a refurb. The stock is great looking with some cool, very small, woodworking repairs from the factory. The bore is almost new like. Mirror like with no pitting and tight crown that passes bullet test. The metal finish is about 95%, looks great! Comes with sling, leather ammo pouch, non matching # bayonet, and maybe some original tools if I can find them. Do NOT email me with offers for a crate pick mosin. I value this rifle at $225 CASH and $275 trade.


 That's all that's left fella's. I am open to all trades, worst I can do is say NO THANK YOU.
 I will try to respond to all emails, I hate it when people don't respond. I can provide tons of pictures of any of the rifles. Questions? Please ask!

 FTF no shipping unless the price is right. Thanks for looking!


P.S.  If you are a jackass wanting to get the rifles for dirt cheap so you can resell and make money.... why even email me to talk crap?  Get a life....and a job... specifically referring to wishtoremainanthonymouse@yahoo.com   .... loser!"

Gun purchased brand new from Stonewall about 5 years ago; less than 500 rounds ran through it. It was mainly used a backup concealed carry gun, and was carried in my purse most of the time (save for the annual trip to the range to function check and clean.) 

There is a hairline crack on the right grip, but you may be able to get another set from the manufacturer at no charge, as I did when this happened to me before. There seems to be some kind of flaw with the grips; I did not over-tighten them. Grips were fine when the gun went in to my purse; cracked when I took it out…

Basic information on the boat is the following.
14 FOOT BOAT WITH TRAILER AND MOTOR
1974 SEARS 14 FOOT ALUMINUM BOAT WITH TRAILER AND MOTOR.
Clear Oregon title and registered until December 31, 2015.
Boat has swivel folding seats. A pair of new Caviness oars. 2 pole holders.
Trailer has good tires, 1 spare tire and new working tail lights. Trailer tongue takes a 2 inch ball.
Johnson 6 horse motor runs and comes with throttle extension and a complete new 6 gallon fuel tank with line, pump and fittings.
Rear transom inside and out has been replaced with new treated plywood and new stainless steel bolts, washers and nuts.
Boat exterior had 4 different coats of paint on it. I spent some time on it and stripped most of it off. Boat can be used as is now. Or you could repaint it or finish stripping what paint is still there. I'm pretty sure the fish don't care what it looks like. The firm price on this is $860.00. Which isn't much considering the cost of the extras.
Fuel tank assembly. $114.00.
Caviness Oars. $112.00.
Throttle extension. $49.00.
Pair of seats. $98.00.
Rear transom boards, hardware. Plus labor $45.00.
Tail lights, connectors & zip ties. Plus labor $45.00.
Paint stripper plus labor. $48.00.
That totals $511.00 just for the extras you won't have to buy or possibly work on yourself. I still have receipts for some of the items.
The only things I haven't done is had the wheel bearings checked or a recent tune up on the motor. Pictures show water churn in tub from running motor."

The S.D.S. is the answer we provided. It includes the best of several of our models, enhanced with a 4 1/16” version of the hand-fit, heavy flanged cone match grade barrel pioneered on our Tactical Elite, and a frame shortened by ½” with 7 round capacity. The slide length is reduced by a full inch from a standard length 1911, giving you a speed advantage in target acquisition with the shorter sighting plane. The shorter frame S.D.S. with the accompanying short slide gives you the maximum concealability available with outstanding accuracy and successive shot recovery. Many shooters find the S.D.S’s near perfect balance and controllability exceeds many pistols with 5” barrels.
