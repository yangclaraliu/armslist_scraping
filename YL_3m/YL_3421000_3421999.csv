I am including 10 boxes of ammo as well!
Here's how the Model 700 EtronX works: The electronic fire control has no moving parts other than the trigger. No sear to be released. No firing pin to strike the primer. Instead, an internal electrical circuit sends a charge through the system to our electrically responsive primer. Closing the bolt on the cartridge establishes contact between the firing pin and the primer. When the trigger is pulled, the electronic circuit sends an electrical pulse through the firing pin directly to the primer. This all happens in less than the blink of an eye. Ignition is even faster, with near zero lock time (.0000027 seconds, actually), which virtually eliminates the effects of barrel movement after pulling the trigger. In fact, the bullet exits the barrel of the Model 700 EtronX before a mechanical firing pin could even hit the primer in a conventional rifle. The system also creates an exceptionally crisp trigger pull with 36% less travel than standard triggers.

This entire ultra-advanced system is all powered by a single, replaceable nine-volt battery, located in the rifle's butt stock. What's more, a unique light-emitting diode on top of the grip indicates complete system status, including whether the rifle is in ""FIRE"" or ""SAFE"" mode. Or if a cartridge has been chambered. Or if the battery is low. An additional safety feature—a key switch located in the bottom of the pistol grip—must first be turned ""ON"" to enable the electronic system. Without turning the system on, the rifle cannot be fired.

In keeping with at least some tradition, the Model 700 EtronX rifle retains all the other classic aspects of our famous Model 700 bolt-action rifle. It includes the same features as the revered Model 700 VS SF with a stainless-steel action, 26-inch fluted barrel, black synthetic stock, full-length aluminum bedding block, and hinged magazine floor plate."

This sale comes about in a weird kind of way. My wife gave me this as a gift and researched it due to my interest online without consulting me. I have read mixed reviews on the gun and know the ammo requirements (very high) and the price high (worth it if they live up to my other Kimbers). I was on the fence but I am not inclined to use high quality ammo all the time, especially at the range. So today I decided to test it with what ammo I had. I shot it with ""unrecomended 124 grain, Armscor ammo, which is not endorsed. It ran somewhat reliably but I did have a few failure to ejects, beyond that I don't know other than I cannot afford PP ammo all the time. It is a great gun and I am sure worth the money if using the recommended ammo but I am sticking with my Sig 238. I cannot speak to reliability or any aspect of the gun other than to say I like my 238, beyond that no assurances. My ""wife's"" love and my loss is your gain, as I am selling this for a hell of a lot less than paid less than a week ago and will make someone a nice gun.

 I will entertain trades if high quality. Worst I can say is no."

         I am so very close to completing my collection of Russian 20th Century weaponry; the last piece has eluded me for years. But then, I didn't know about Armslist! I am looking for a M1910 Maxim machine gun- either in a parts kit or completed- preferably mounted on the wheeled carriage with the shield as well, but those I can get myself.

       I am also interested in ANY kits or 'rifles' of machine guns chambered in 7.62x54R or 7.62x39mm. RPK's, PKM's, DHsK's, etc, I will look at anything.

     I am looking for the basic infantry model; I don't need the first Maxim ever, or the the first Maxim to be touched by Stalin; so long as it is rust-free and fires well, I will consider it. This will inevitably be a shooter, and as such I'm not looking to spend $2,000 on an Imperial Russian Super-Rare Brass Shell Maxim. I'd much prefer to spend a few hundred on 'the Maxim that was dragged through Germany by Ivan and Boris, neither of whom could be described as 'gentle' in any fashion', and redo the paintwork and scratches myself.


Bonus points(herein meaning money) if you have what is sometimes called the 'Finnish' version, with the large cap for putting snow into the water jacket. More bonus points for better condition in earlier years. I would very much like a WWI weapon in my collection. the second picture is an example of this type of Maxim.


    Now, to the goodies. In addition to the simple cash transaction, I have plenty of firearms and ammo to choose from if you're less of a seller and more of a trader. Primarily, the king of my collection(other than a beautiful OPAP M70), is a Mosin PU sniper in 'Excellent' condition(with all original matching serial numbers and kit), and a No. 1 MK. IV Lee-Enfield, captured in the Middle East(imported through a good friend at Century) during the Gulf War by a friend of mine. Other than shooting it a few times to test the rifle, I have done nothing other than clean it. Haven't even removed the copper wiring grips yet to get under the handguards. I also have TONS of Mosins, Type 53's, 7.62x54R, 7.62x39mm, etc etc.

   Simply put, if you have the kit(or completed 'rifle') that I'm looking for, I will FIND something that you want just as badly. Might even give up my RPK for the right seller...



That's it for my speech; now we wait.

    Your move Armslist, you have yet to disappoint me!

Because of this I'm selling a lot of my hunting items / equipment, etc. I know you don't care about this, I just wanted everyone to know the reason I'm selling these items.

Most of you know someone like me! I had one bow that I used and 2 more for back up that got shot once a year to be sure that sights were still true. 

This bow is a PSE Precision Edge 5050 Compound Bow: This is a Right handed bow in Forest Camouflage Pattern. Overall length of bow is 41inches with a 58"" String Length. It has a 29"" Draw Length with an adjustable draw weight of 55, 60, 65 lbs. with 65% let off. (I took this bow to an Archery shop and he piddled with it until he got it down to a 48 lb. draw, but still a little much for me (according to doctor). 

This bow comes with a tru-glo sight, a tension adjustable arrow rest, pep sight & tubing, loop for release and a 4 arrow quiver (sorry name has been painter over). The quiver does have reversible quiver fingers, I’m assuming one is for carbon and the other for aluminum arrows...   $120.00 

But I could be talked into taking $150.00


I also have 4 Cabals Carbon hunter arrows. These arrows are 30 ½ inches long, these came in a package of 6 and were over $10.00 each. Along with these 4 carbon arrows there are 3 aluminum arrows, the bigger one in the middle is a 2214 and is 26 inches long, the other 2 arrows are 1914s and are 29 inches long. 

One of the carbon arrows has he begins of a receding insert! The 2214 is missing the noc and some damage the fletching’s. The 1914s have feathers. Asking $30.00 for all 7 arrows. 

But I could be talked into taking $40.00


I also have a Contico hard plastic bow case, inside measures 50 ¾ by 19 ¾. Has 4 bow tie downs and will hold 12 arrows. Has a dear scene on outside of case. $20.00. 

You guessed it, I could be talked into taking $30.00

Or I’ll take $175.00 for everything.

This bow and accessories is also listed on Craigslist if you want to see more photos.

Molot is the Russian factory that produces the RPK Machine guns.  The Vepr has a 50% thicker receiver than the standard AK as well as a thicker barrel and side scope mount.  
This is the model with the HK style sights that put the front sight over the gas block and gives you a cleaner look.  This one has the factory threaded 14x1 barrel and has had a Tapco G2 trigger group installed.  It has also been tapped for a bullet guide but does not have one installed.  The wood on this is beautiful and the Vepr thumbhole stocks are the best feeling and quality stock of any AK out there.  This comes with both a factory 5 and 10 round magazine.

 This is a TOP OF THE LINE Ruger, 10-22 mounted in a Hogue Stock and outfitted with a 16.25"" Volquartsen carbon fiber tension barrel. You can read up but these are insanely accurate and I personally have shot quarter groups at 50 yards as equipped. It includes everything in the pictures, extended mag release, optic, bridge mount, Volquartsen barrel scope mount, stock, 3 magazines and an alligator clip for making 2 in 1 mags. This rifle has been deburred, headspaced and botht the extractor and firing pin are Magnum Research products. It also has a trigger rebuild using lighter springs and pins and has been de-burred. It is much better than a stock rig and is an outstanding value.

Winchester continues its innovation and versatility with Razorback XT, the first-ever cartridge designed specifically for wild boar hunting. Deep penetration and maximum expansion are a must when hunting wild boars and Winchester Razorback XT accomplishes both of these.

Razorback XT ammunition was engineered to drive through tough hide and bone and then expand to its maximum potential resulting in extreme knockdown power due to its deep hollow point in a beveled profile. For those hog hunters who use nightvision, Winchester loaded these with a powder that reduces muzzle flash to prevent night blindness from the flash. Trust Winchester Razorback XT to deliver the terminal performance you desire on your next hog hunt and you will not be disappointed. This ammunition is new production in reloadable brass cases.

I have approximately had about 500 rounds through this rifle with the majority of those rounds being slow controlled shots at long range. I broke in the barrel like I do with all my rifles (is it needed probably not but I do it anyways). Its an incredibly accurate rifle easily capable with sub-MOA groups (the .223 Wylde chambering is great) as long as you are doing your part. I was able to hit 16"" ringers out at 200-300yds with ease.

Also being a piston driven platform, the bolt and carrier have always stayed immaculate (although I never let more than 2 range trips go by without a thorough cleaning).

The 100% stainless steel T3 is 320% stronger than our competitor’s aluminum. The all-stainless steel construction of the T3 will deliver amazing penetration never seen before in an expandable or aluminum broadhead. The durability of the T3 will lead to multiple kills with the same broadhead. Other broadheads use pins or screws with their replacement blades which are difficult to replace. T3 blades are simple to replace and can be changed in seconds. The Spider Clip Retention System provides amazing consistency for blade deployment compared to competitors. There are no rubber o-rings, which break down over time and cause unreliable blade deployment. The spider clip on the T3 is not affected by temperature and does not break down over time.

I originally bought this gun for my wife, but she now wants something with a little more oomph. My wife is awesome :)

I am the second owner. It is in EXCELLENT condition. I'd rate it at 97% and that's a conservative grading.

This model 22s beauty comes with several rare options. The factory bull barrel, factory ""Smithcote"" finish and wooden factory target grips w/magwell built-in, all pretty hard to find and on a single pistol especially hard. It is in untouched and in unfired condition. I bought it a few years back and it has sat in my safe ever since. Everything comes as new, all paperwork, 2 mags and accessories just like you bought it brand new from S/W. This is as nice as these pistols come and as such don't miss out on a great deal. It pains me to list it but unfortunately bills are bills.

It's somewhere around 500 rounds down range with no real problems. The first time I took it to the range the rear sight came loose but a little Locktite fixed that right up. It is one of the most problem-free guns I've ever owned. Usually there's a break-in period where you'll work through some failures and then after a couple hundred rounds or so the gun settles down and starts shooting reliably. This sucker has gone bang every single time I pulled the trigger.

Put it this way: I'd trust my life or my wife's life to it without hesitation. For concealed carry this baby is practically invisible in any kind of decent holster.

I'm not terribly interested in trades. My wife has another gun on layaway and I want to surprise her with the money for it. Unless the trade is pretty one-sided in my favor I'm probably going to pass on it."

I am selling a Savage 10FP chambered in .223.  It is in very good condition and has a few aftermarket improvements.  These improvements include an aftermarket Rifle Basix SAV-1 trigger along with a wood thumb hole stock.  The gun is in overall very good condition but does show signs of typical wear and tear from being used.  Those of you who are familiar with the Savage 10FP model line will know that they are pretty accurate guns out of the box

This rifle also has 1 rear and 2 forward sling mounts.  It includes a Harris bipod as well as a Viper Vortex 6.5-20x44 PA rifle scope with Mil-Dot reticle and flip up covers.  The scope is mounted on Burris Zee Signature 30mm scope rings.  The scope is new to the rifle and has only seen about 100 rounds.

I would consider splitting up the rifle and scope, but I would prefer selling it is a complete package.  I would like to sell the rifle alone for $500.

Feel free to contact me through email with any questions.

I am asking $800 obo for the package.
