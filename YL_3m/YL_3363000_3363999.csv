**The LW-15 Complete Polymer Lower Receiver is designed to be used with the New Frontier Armory polymer lower parts also available on this site.  Standard MIL SPEC lower parts may require some modification and fitment of the lower.  All holes should be fitted carefully and will vary due to tolerances in the lower parts kits from one manufacturer to another.  Warranty is null and void once any modifications are made to the lower from factory configuration.

*NOTE:  Some .22LR, 9mm and other blow back style upper receivers use a groove in their BCG that is too narrow for the polymer hammer that comes standard on the New Frontier Armory LW-15 complete polymer lower receiver.  In these cases you will need to switch to a blow back style hammer available by clicking HERE.  The blow back style hammer, once installed, will run all rim fire and pistol uppers, and still work fine with standard mil-spec rifle uppers."

Ive had this confirmed by several professionals who specialize in WWII arms. Built by Franz (for short) and contracted through Parker Hale Manufactured in March of 1943. Judging by the markings on the rifle there is a lot to say. The proofs indicate it was issued to British Army and not to new Zealand or some other place. Its a MKI No.4, a common model, HOWEVER the Parker Hale variants are somewhat rare. It does have the Original JC stock and butplate, numbers matching bolt and reciever chambered in .303 british (faster than 30-06) and even has the original sling. Has one detatchable magazine and 40rds. The rifle shoots great, and has ZERO issues, headspace was checked today by a gunsmith and its perfect. The bore does show wear, this was a war weapon, so its been broken in to say the least. None the less its a tack driver open sights from 200yds. Dont try to offer me $300 for this one. Its not one from the back of The Shotgun News. This one is a rare one. If you know enfields, come and have a look at the markings, come and shoot it. Its a cherry."

I bought this gun used from original owner. Excellent shooting gun used it Antelope hunting in Wyoming once. I have only put ten rounds through it 9 for sighting in one for the kill. My old eyes do not allow me to use open sight any longer at the ranges it takes to hunt Antelope so it needs a new home. Included are a little over 200 once fired cases, tumbled, sized, primed and ready to load as well as a set of RCBS competition dies. There are 2 spots with some pitting but this does not affect accuracy or performance. Anyone who has ever shot a 7mm-08 knows that it is a very flat shooting and accurate round. This T/C Encore was originally registered as a pistol so by BATF regulations it can be converted to a rifle at any time and back again. On the otherhand a T/C Encore or Contender rifle can never be converted to a pistol legally per BATF regulations. I will send more photos upon request. Bill of sale will be required and Washington stated drivers license. I am open to a reasonable trade of equal value or best offer. Out of state sales will require FFL.

This gun was used in the SWA (Iraq/Afghanistan) Theater of Operation by US Military Contractor SOC-USA. These were recently bought back by CAI and resold to the public. They are now sold out. Very few of these were sold to the public. Don't miss your change to own a very rare gun that was actually used in a war zone. This is quite the special opportunity. 

These guns ranged from new condition to good condition. This one is in very good overall condition and has seen by my estimate no more than a couple hundred rounds. It has been test fired. Some, but not all of the rifles, came back with a rack number painted on the wood forgrip - this is one of them. 


This is the description from Century Arms regarding the paratrooper RPK rifles.
These rifles are semi-automatic only version of the Romanian RPK’s issued to elite paratrooper forces during the Communist Ceausescu Regime. This extremely rare variant is built using the small cache of rifles found in a sealed building in the Transilvanian factory town of Cugir. These were apparently to be issued for a planned massive troop build-up on the Hungarian border when Warsaw pact 
*tensions flared between the two member States. Luckily, cooler heads prevailed and a crisis was averted. The rifles were subsequently put in secure storage – and forgotten, until now. The rifles feature a side folding stock, integral carry handle and bipod. As you can imagine, quantities are limited as only few hundred were ever produced – and we bought them all! Each rifle comes with two 40 rd. mags. Barrel: 23"" with a 1:10 twist, Overall: 34.25"" (stock folded), 42"" (stock extended), Weight: 11.8 lbs. Condition: Excellent.""

In-person transfers require you to be legal to purchase the rifle, willing to show ID, and sign a bill of sale or show a valid CCW."

This was mainly a weekend vehicle, trips to mountains etc.  it just sits now.  I drive it once a week or so around town, that's about it.  Time to let it go.


Starts up everytime and runs well.  Transmission shifts very smoothly and 4x4 is perfect.  No issues in high or low.  

Cons:

Dings and dents here and there
Paint fading in some places

Super condition and ready to use. 

1) .243 Win 22"" barrel, walnut stock with skip line checkering and 4 screw hole butt plate. Bluing is near perfect.  Walker trigger, no recall issues.  Wood is very good with few dings, but nothing serious.  The gun is all original with a cheap but decent Tasco 3-9x40 scope.  Mount and rings are Leupold.  This rifle is a shooter.  It's sighted in at 200 yards.  Very light recoil but plenty of power.  No barrel warning, i.e. pre 1984. 

2) .300 Win Mag 24"" barrel, walnut stock with skip line checkering.  Stock butt pad. Leupold mount and rings.  Scope is a variable Barska 10-40x50.  It's cheap but is quite clear up to about 25x and holds zero fine.  Bluing is super clear with honest wear at the muzzle only.  Walker trigger, no recall issues.  Has a nice sling and swivels.  Wood shows a few rubs from being carried.  No scratches or significant damage.  Sighted in at 200 yards. Very accurate and hard hitting cartridge.  I've successfully hunted with this gun out West.  Very few rounds through it.  Post 1984, but pre-hex head trigger guard screws.  
09/07/14 SOLD PENDING FUNDS--THANK YOU

Neither gun has a recalled trigger.  These are the ""old"" three screw rem triggers.  The .243 is about 3 pounds and breaks crispy.  The .300 is heavier, but can easily be adjusted down.  It's light but not as light as it could be.  
09/08/14 SOLD PENDING FUNDS--THANK YOU

Both were made long before Cerberus bought Remington and the build quality on these is by my standards, higher than the newest guns. There is nothing mechanically or really cosmetically wrong with either rifle.  To that end, the scopes are not ""broken, throw aways"" . They're not top shelf, but they hold zero and adjust.  These are hunting rifles and have been carried, but are both very accurate if you do your part.  I've shot very tight groups off of roll bails, recently out past 250 yards. If you like BDL's these are nice...   

Both guns are available for cash, face to face deals with Ohio residents. You'll need to show me your id and sign a receipt.  Shipping is available but must be to an FFL.  Payment would be by USPS money order only.  I'm placing a trade value of $1100.00 total for both guns as shown.  Sale value for both is the same.  Individually, the .300 could be bought for $650.00 and the .243 for $550.00.  So yes there is a $100.00 savings for a package buy.  There's a little room should the buyer not want the scopes, slings or swivels.  My trade offer is both of my guns for the following:

Little info about the firearm:

92A1: Legendary 92 Reliability with Ultra-Modern Tactical Features

The ""A1"" class is a specialized tactical branch of the most tested and trusted military and personal defense weapon in history: the 92FS. We started with the super-reliable 92, keeping the engineering characteristics that make it so accurate, safe and dependable; then, we added some features prized by today’s most demanding tactical shooters as well as by those wanting the absolute best for home defense or personal protection. The result is the 92A1, a pistol that is as reliable for its intended use as it is safe and user-friendly even for the novice.


Easy Accessorization and Maintenance

The most noticeable difference between the classic 92FS and the 92A1 is that this comes with an integral Picatinny rail situated in front of the trigger guard. The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit.


Impressive Firepower, Extra-Durable Magazines

Another feature that will impress you about the 92A1 is the type of magazine it comes with. This pistol comes with three 17-round stainless steel magazines designed to deliver remarkable firepower out of the box while being absolutely durable and corrosion resistant. Furthermore, the magazines on the 92A1 feature a “dirt rail” along their length, which helps collect dust and grit out of the magazine while keeping cartridges clear of the magazine walls. The result: enhanced feeding reliability and super-easy magazine maintenance. In addition, the magazine well is aggressively beveled, making it super-fast to change magazines without taking your eyes off the target.


Absolutely Reliable, Designed to Last

The base design of the 92A1 is the 92FS or M9, the pistol that has served the US military admirably throughout its campaigns in the world’s toughest environments. But even in this respect, Beretta never rests on its laurels. This pistol incorporates an innovative internal frame buffer that greatly reduces component stress under firing (yes, even with hot +P ammo), making it even more durable and smooth-shooting. The best of both worlds, the 92A1 offers discriminating shooters the classic overall look and feel of the 92 (including the more traditional rounded trigger-guard) with today’s most advanced tactical features.

This pistol is also available in .40 S&W as the 96A1 and in 9x21mm as the 98A1.

I'm ONLY looking to trade or sell BOTH TOGETHER ONLY. I will sell both calibers together so 2,000 rounds total for $525. That's a steal. That makes it less around $12 a box for 9mm and $15 a box for 40. That's cheaper than any store and no tax. 

I will take $525 cash for all 2,000 rounds or I will trade all together for a pistol. Must be like new, and a nice gun. I will take a lesser pistol for less ammo as well.

Here’s a little info about Tritac where the firearm is located:

TriTac Shooting Solutions was created to provide multiple shooting experiences.
We are Salem’s only indoor pistol/rifle range. The range is 65 ft. long and has state-of-the-art lighting, ventilation, noise control and target retrieval systems. Bring your own, or rent a gun from us.

TriTac has a high-def video simulator with over 400 ultra-realistic scenarios. Designed for police and military training, it provides civilians with an experience in active shooter situations that cannot be duplicated. You experience it all while using a real weapon (rifle or pistol) that’s been modified with a CO2 recoil and laser targeting. No ammo, but incredible realism.

At TritTac, we offer training and classes that include concealed handgun license with live fire and basic handgun safety and marksmanship.
Not only do we have the range, classroom, and simulator, but we also offer a complete gun retail shop with reasonably priced ammo. Any gun purchase receives a free month of unlimited range time!

We’re owned by a veteran (USMC) and employ very experienced staff who can help everyone in a safe and friendly environment.
