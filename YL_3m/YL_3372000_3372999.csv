I've  finally decided to sell or trade one of the rifles. If you are not familiar with them, just look up ""Fenian invasion of Canada"" and ""Needham conversion"" . 
I'll call the two rifles ""Rusty""  and ""Shiny"". 
Rusty had a lot of surface rust and a very dark bore when I got it last week, but after a few minutes of cleaning with a cotton cloth and gun oil most of the rust came right off. The bore came out looking very nice and should get even better if you get access to a .58 cal bore brush. There is a chip missing from the receiver, not very big. Didn't notice it for a week, but it's there.  Rusty is missing the firing pin, but reproductions are available. 
Shiny is just that. Looks like someone went over all the metal with steel wool are removed all the patina. In addition the stock has been refinished. Looks good, but purists with go ape over this. Bore is shiny.

I would very much like to work a local trade. Just seems to work better for both parties. If I can't work a local deal I'll consider cash offers to ship. Price for either rifle is $1,000.00 local, $1050.00 shipped to lower 48(I use new boxes and ship UPS insured).

328,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3372328,For Sale/Trade:   Have You Ever Dreamed of Shooting a .50BMG* Heres your chance...,"Seattle/Oly/ Lacey/Aberdeen/Raymond, Washington, United States",$ 200,"Listed On: Sunday, August 10, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"I own a wonderful and very accurate .50 BMG rifle with a very accurate sniper 56mm SA scope on it.
 I'm offering you a chance to come down and try out one of the biggest badass rifles made!!!
 with the Muzzle brake on this rifle it has the kick of a .243 hunting rifle, even a 7yr old could shoot this rifle!!!!
 I'm disabled and had to sell my Barrett because it beat me up to much, this rifle cost me double what the Barrett cost. I have over $11,000.00 invested in this rifle set up, and it is still new mint and why I'm not to sure how long I'm willing to offer this chance of a lifetime to those firearm collector/shooters that have never tried a big bore rifle.
 So here is my offer....
 I'm willing to meet down here by my farm to take you out to shoot up to a 1000yrd shot
 will cost $125 per person for 3rds down range,
 will do a full mag of 10rds for $200 per person
 will do up to 5 people in a group, with minimum 2 shooters.
 also will consider kids from ages 10 up who have gone through gun safety....
 or for $50 per person I will do a about hr long safety class with them first before going out. to make sure they understand firearms and how Dangerous or Fun they can be if handled properly.
 it takes me over 2hrs to tear down the rifle and clean it, and hr to put it back together
 this doesn't include ware on rifle from shooting, this is over a $9k rifle set up
 so only will to see how this plays out if I keep doing it.......
 if you want, we can go to one of the only gun ranges that allows these rifles you will cover the range fee's, is located in Rochester. I live Southbend/Raymond Area
 but I live out in the country and we can legally shoot in the woods where we have a mountain as a back stop because of how far this rd will travel..
 we always take safety first!!!!
 not many people will offer you to come shoot a $9,000. rifle for kicks and bragging rights so this might not be up long will see how it plays out....
 *First and for most no one who can NOT own a firearm will be allowed to shot this rifle.
 THIS MEANS...
 NO Felony's OR PENDING....
 NO DV Cases OR PENDING....
 NO Restraining orders Against you! OR PENDING....
 and last if you have been declared with a Mental Illness...

 if you Carry a *CWP/CPL this is a plus and I won't have to have your name ran by the Sheriff's before going out to shoot.
 *Warning* if any of these apply to you understand it is against the law and 1 yr in jail for being around/shooting/owning firearms when you can't.....
 don't want anyone to get in trouble so warning you in advance not to write and try to shoot this rifle. because the Sheriffs will have your info and will deal with it, so best just not write...
 ok now that we got that out there...
 I will also do part trade part cash 1/2 & 1/2 for other firearms/rifles
 just ask most I can do is say no thank you...

 **minimum of 2 shooters to bring this big rifle out.**

 I also have AR/AK or a Siaga 12g 20rd barrel drum -we can talk about if that is one you want to try out...

 **also for anyone who comes to shoot the rifle I will give them a yellow tip .50BMG Russian Armor pricing rd to keep as a keepsake memory of shooting the rifle....***"

One of the first ""high capacity"" pistols, it was marketed as a home defense pistol sporting a 10-round double stack magazine. Produced between 1917 and 1923, this pistol exemplifies the roaring 20's with it's beautiful Art Deco design. Hollywood perfectly cast this as the weapon of choice used by Jude Laws assassin character in the film ""Road To Perdition"". These came in a matte blues finish, this one being in 95% condition with the only thinning on some high spots as to be expected of a gun this age.

The pistol functions flawlessly with quality .32 ammo which is once again abundantly available and affordable. High velocity european ammo will ensure reliable cycling (brands like Fiocchi, Geco, and PPU which are all available). Comes with one 10-round magazine and a Makarov flap holster which fits it perfectly.

If you price this gun in this condition on Gunbroker, Gunsamerica, etc. you will see that I have priced to sell. You won't find one in this condition any cheaper. My price of $325 is firm. No trades, cash only and I will need to see a valid Indiana drivers license and CC license. I will not ship, FTF only.

Fantastic collectible gun for those interested in quality American made firearms of the early 20th century, firearms featured in films, or Art Deco pieces from the 1920's. And yes, it is also a fun range gun and with ""Ten Rounds Fast"" (as the original ads say), it is a viable self-defense weapon."

483,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3372483,For Sale:  1 lb. each - IMR 4007 SSC & Hodgdon H335,"Clear Lake, Houston, Texas",$ 25,"Listed On: Sunday, August 10, 2014",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Unopened canisters of smokeless powder.

I have found IMR 4007 SSC to be the most accurate powder for my .223 Remington loads out to 200 yards.  However, the minimum bullet weight is 75 grains.  I am running an HKMR556 with a 1-7 twist.  Using 77 grain SMK, I have emptied a 30-round magazine with all shots being 1"" at 200 yards (caveat: day was virtually windless).  The muzzle velocity is definitely not the fastest, but the chamber pressure is freakishly low and recoil is such that ACCURATE rapid fire comes effortlessly.  I really like this powder, I have several pounds more in my stash.  

As for the H335, I do not know much about this powder; I have never used it.  All I know is what I've read:  Medium to high muzzle velocities for a broad range of calibers. I bought this pound about a year ago out of desperation (during the 2013 shortage) but was fortunate enough to find my 'go-to' powders shortly thereafter.

$25 each or $45 for both.  Not trying to turn a profit, just want to recoup my money.  Cash and carry."

The new Les Baer CustomThunder Ranch 1911 is a serious, no-nonsense self-defense pistol conceived by Clint Smith, Director of Thunder Ranch, one of the premier training facilities dedicated to teaching people how to survive in a tough, unfriendly world.
Clint Smith cares about good guns and he's concerned that his students are equipped with reliable, accurate guns they might one day have to trust with their lives. That's why Clint Smith approached Les Baer about developing a dependable, combat-proven 1911 with which he and his students could feel completely confident.

So, Clint Smith specified the features he wanted and Les Baer built it. The result is a distinctive yet practical 1911 that's ideal for personal defense and a source of pride for the owner. Features include:

• Baer steel NM frame • Baer steel NM slide with front and rear serrations • Slide fitted to frame • Baer NM barrel with stainless match bushing • LBC deluxe fixed combat rear sight with Tritium inserts • Baer dovetail front sight with tritium insert • Lowered and flared ejection port • Baer checkered slide stop • Baer extended ejector • Combat extended safety (extended ambi for left handed shooters) • Baer aluminum match trigger • Baer deluxe Commander hammer and sear • Crisp 4 lb. pull • Baer tuned extractor • Baer beavertail grip safety with pad • High checkered front strap at 30 lpi • Flat checkered mainspring housing at 20 lpi • Beveled magazine well • Polished feed ramp and throated barrel • Complete pistol rounded for tactical use • Blued finish on complete pistol • Deluxe special slim line grips with thunder Ranch logo (not available with extended ambi safety) • (3) Stainless steel 7-round premium magazines • Special Thunder Ranch logo engraved on slide • Special serial numbers with ""TR"" prefix"

The rifle is in excellent condition and has had only about 1 box of shells fired thru it... The Jeweling on the bolt is perfect. I purchased it to take with me on an antelope hunt that fell thru. 

The rifle has a 24"" barrel, a textured matte blue metal finish, amazing walnut wood stock, Remington Supercell Buttpad, X-Mark Pro trigger, and matching Leupold Rings and Bases ($100 value). The only blemish with this rifle is a small spot on the barrel (about the size of a Penny) that has been touched up. This occurred during shipping when the rifle was mailed to my dealer. The bolt was removed from rifle during shipment and somehow was dislodged in the box and rubbed a small spot of finish off the barrel. Since the finish is textured, it is very hard to touch up perfectly. Please see the barrel picture. This in NO WAY affects the performance of the rifle; just cosmetic.

These are currently selling for $850+ new and this rifle comes with $100 worth of Rings and Bases, making the NEW value approx. $950. I feel that my asking price is very fair for the condition of the rifle. If it was not for the small barrel blemish, I would be asking more. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Please no lowball offers. I'm not interested in any trades at this time. Thanks for your interest."

It is used by various law enforcement and military forces, including the French Navy. The PM-5 is almost unique in that it has a detachable box magazine, while most pump action shotguns are built using underbarrel tube magazines. The detachable box magazine greatly improves reloading time and balance. The only drawback is the increased height of the loaded weapon, but it is not a major issue in most cases.
They are reportedly actually manufactured by Benelli. Import has been banned for several years now but are used in Europe by numerous Security forces.
Renowned for their simplicity, lightweight and reliability, this pump action 12 ga. shotgun has sold on the US market for as much as $1200.00."

It needs to be appreciated. 

This is my ATEi customs m&p .40, and it has had over 1000.00 of work put into it. (That if course, does include shipping and FFL fees.) This m&p went off to ATEi Customs in Michigan for the FULL defensive carry package. This package includes the following-

full serration, top
full serration, sides (press check)
catalyst mag release 
full frame stipple (sweaty, muddy, bloody does this)
Full trigger undercut (also SMB)
flared mag well (SMB)
in-house trigger job. This has to be felt to be believed. 
Night sights
trigger reset modification
refinish with salt nitro carburizing bath... Just like melonite. 

To clarify, this is the best m&p outside of a salient that you will touch. 

Essentially, the work took MONTHS to complete. The pistol has been gone longer than it's been back. It has only seen 200 flawless rounds, and is immaculate. I will value the pistol at a fair 1200.00 in trade, or if you really will offer the cash, 1000 in sale, FIRM.  Of course, I am willing to negotiate for the right offer.

It is made by High Speed Gear Inc, a company committed to serving and supplying our nation’s military with the best gear they can get their hands on. This rig is well constructed and has space for everything you need. The entire main body is capable of being unzipped and folded down to display a covered map case, multiple pen/pencil pouches, various notebook pouches, and additional pouches for items such as knives or chem lights. There is also a large back fold that you can store anything else you might find necessary to carry along with you. The front and back of this rig is covered in MOLLE webbing so you can attach anything you need for your specific mission. You can also unzip the side pouches to the left and right of the main body for additional storage of gear or for additional armor. The entire rig consists of the main body, a back strap that connects the left and right sides around your lower back and the two shoulder straps. In addition, there is a large hook and loop velcro area on the front for any patches you may want to show off. Like mentioned before, this rig is one of the best you can find on the market today and made by one of the best companies out there. I took this out of the box when I got it, put it on and went outside to see how it looked with my mag pouches on it. From there it just sat in my closet so it is literally brand new, out of the box from the factory. Due to recent training missions I needed something that can carry plates as well as a hydration system so a chest rig would not do me justice, this is the only reason I can’t use this high speed rig."

I did take it to the skeet range and put one box of shells through it last week, other than that it was not fired or hunted with. Comes with all factory papers & box serial #400-45819. You will not find a nicer 20ga red anywhere ,wood and metal are 100%..Do not make the mistake of settling for a 26"" tubed bird gun. 28"" tubes will give you a better sighting plane and slow your swing down on a whippy 20 ga. shipping conus is $25 to your favorite FFL dealer. Just ask for a full set of hi def pictures and enjoy. This is the next best gun to have if you are not already the lucky  owner of a 28 gauge red label. PLEASE ,CASH BUYERS. NO TRADES."

Video of what is wrong with the M9: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbBNdUjFIbA&feature=youtube_gdata_player

The M4 has a licensed Daniel Defense Rail and is made out of polymer, and i put in a madbull black python 6.03 mm tightbore barrel not too long ago, It is tan with a bronzish-colored rail, It basically looks like this except with black gas block on the end of the rail, and ive had it for close to 9 months. Airsoft GI has dropped it from 9 ft and the only thing different then the gun that was dropped was the rail, and when it landed not a scratch on it and it shot like new still.

G&G M4 Blowback http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?cPath=139_70_285&products_id=11725

And the KWA M9 comes with an extra mag which is $35 new, and i will include about 1000 rounds of great ammo to use with both of the airsoft guns

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=xHlBkJj2_M4
Seperate id take 150 for the M4 since it has a $20 barrel i put in it.
and about 60 for the M9, 55 without the 2nd mag for the M9 since the trigger is messed up as i said.
Also the M9 Feels just like the real one in your hand, the M9 is made out of all metal except for the barrel which is made out of polymer i think to help speed up the blowback so it has less friction, the M9 is a Professional Training Pistol! These are both Great beginners gun as the M9 only needs to be lubed every so often which is real easy. and i will send you pictures of them, they are both pretty much new!
The M4 doesnt come with a battery or any mags. But i can assure you it works. Bring your own battery and mags if you don't believe me!
If the price is right, i will include a save phace phantom full tactical mask, which is a $50 facemask, it has the visor on it, instead of the stock one, which i do not have.

Blueing and internals are in perfect condition. High quality, all steel construction. There have been 100 rounds through this pistol and it functioned flawlessly. REALLY fun to shoot and cheaper than a 7.62x25 tok. This is a very thin profile, full-size 9mm, well balanced and is very accurate. I just don't have time to shoot everything in my collection, so it is time to lighten it up. 

New, you can order one from J&G sales for $199 (plus shipping and transfer fee, of course). Since this is lightly used, I will let it go for $180 and will throw in an excellent condition CZ-52 holster which fits it like a glove for an additional $20. The whole rig (pistol, 2 steel magazines and holster) for $200.

Price is firm and cash only. I will not ship, FTF only. I'll need to see a valid Indiana drivers license and CC license. I get to Bloomington regularly so I could meet anywhere from the south side of Indy to Bloomington."
