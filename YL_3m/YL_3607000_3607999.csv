Description




The Model 517 holographic weapon sight was designed with functionality and affordability in mind. Buttons on the left side (instead of the back) provide instant access for the easiest possible operation, allowing a magnifier or back-up iron sight to fit closely to the HWS body.  The front base of the 517 is raised to hover over the standard hand guards of many AR-15 weapons.  
The Model 517 operates on easy-to-find AA batteries. 
Don't forget, using lithium AA batteries almost doubles the run-time of traditional alkaline.

474,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3607474,For Sale:  Custom CZ-52 with Novak target sights and 7.62x25mm ammo,"Arlington, Everett, Washington",$ 400,"Listed On: Monday, October 20, 2014",Handguns,CZ USA                                                                                ,no type,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"PRICE DROP for quick sale. Will be put back in the safe after Friday if not sold. This fine single-action handgun was made in 1954 and imported in the early 90's (no import marks). Included are three magazines with aftermarket extended floorplates for fast reloads, the original holster, and the option to include 520 rounds of ammo. The CZ-52 is widely accepted to be a more robust design than the TT-33, utilizing the roller delayed-blowback action like the MG-42, HK G3, and MP5. The original rollers have been replaced with new hardened steel ones. The original firing pin has also been replaced with a hardened steel model that won't break when dry fired. The original tiny fixed sights were milled off and 1911 style Novak adjustable target sights installed- the difference is amazing compared to the factory sights. The original Bakelite grips were sealed and then painted black. The parkerized finish on the frame is in 90%+ original  condition and the slide has been coated in Dark Parkerizing Gray Alumahyde II rustproof gun coating (properly cured) so it can be carried IWB without worrying about rusting from sweat. Function wise, I have never had any malfunction in 500 rounds. The decocker/safety works properly and the hammer does not contact the firing pin when decocking.

It fires the potent 7.62x25mm tokarev round which will defeat both sides of a threat level IIa bullet proof vest or one side of a level II vest with normal target grade FMJ's. The now banned 320 (of 520) hardened steel core AP rounds I am including will defeat all soft body armor up to level III. These rounds are legal to own in all 50 states, they can just no longer be imported into the country or manufactured.

The gun has a very thin profile and can be concealed as easily and sometimes better than a 1911. If you're expecting bad guys with body armor and want better penetration than a .357 SIG, this is the gun for you. Would make a perfect glove box gun to shoot through glass and sheet metal if needed to. Hollow points are available online if you are concerned about over-penetration.

The ammo available is:
100 rounds of banned Norinco mild steel core non-corrosive FMJ
100 rounds of S&B indoor range safe new production non-corrosive reloadable FMJ
320 rounds of mixed Hintenberger and another European manufacture 1955 and 1962 production hardened steel core AP. The finest 7.62 ammo ever available to civilians, last available in 1990. This ammo is mildly corrosive like most surplus stuff. It is very clean brass cased and berdan primed. I have shot through 1/4"" steel plate like it wasn't there, and I have seen it shred Kevlar helmets.

Besides defense, this is one heck of a fun gun to shoot. It sounds like a .44 magnum going off, and it has the recoil of a .45 1911. Minute of bad guy accuracy out to 150 yards from a bench, and very flat shooting. 9mm luger drop-in conversion barrels are available online.

I'm looking for a new toy, so this one has to go. 

$400 cash for the pistol and three mags and holster.
$600 cash OBO for the above plus all the ammo.

Ammo is not for sale without the gun.

The sights, modern steel upgrades, and magazines are worth $400 alone.

I am open to trades and trades plus cash for firearms and military related equipment, silver, cool stuff etc. What do you have? Worst I can say is no thanks. I am NOT interested in your used SCUBA gear, marijuana grow lights, or fish tanks.

If you are reading this, it's still for sale. 

Will meet at the Tulalip Cabelas in Marysville, WA only. Will ship overnight to your FFL at your expense for $50. Ammo ships separately for $20. 

I am a CPL holder and will only sell to US citizens 18 and older with valid ID and bill of sale. If you have a CPL or WAC card, no bill of sale is necessary.

Thank you for looking, and remember to vote no on I-594 this November."

some items on armslist cost MORE USED as they do for a NEW item

why buy a firearm on here when you can purchase the same gun online or at any local retail outlet at WAY better prices and get a BRAND NEW firearm untouched by anyone.

do your research - some items for sale on armslist  are available at local retail outlets or online for competitive prices even if you include the ffl ship cost.

i would expect armslist to be a place to find used items for LESS than the cost of the same item as new... a no brainer! but no, some people just take advantage of others.

and most times it is even a pain in the @ss to even deal with them... avoid the hassle...

do your research... shop locally and support your local dealers who dont rip you off!

and let these snakes choke on thier over-priced goods!

examples include: M&P15 for $1500 friggin bucks? you godda be kidding me... and you have the balls to even say it does not come with the eotech or laser?!?! that gun sells all day for $599 with free shipping!

This package was over 1,400
This build consisted of building a m1a style rifle without breaking the bank on ammo. So I had predator custom shop build the ruger mini 30 for me 
Asking price is very reasonable for what has been done to this fine rifle. The flash hidder alone was almost 100 bucks u can't find them anywhere. And no I'm not talking about the other flash hidder u can get on amazon this is a m14 style flash hidder in which u will never find due to ruger stopped making them in the 1970s early 80s this is a vintage flash hidder that was only produced for the mini 14. But the guys at preditor opened it up so I can shoot the 762x39 thew it. 
The accu strut was put on not only for looks but for accuracy. The accu strut was made to stabilize the barrel while the projectile was shot threw the barrel and makes ur rifle alot more accurate which works, u can also reference to YouTube on it. The scope is a 1-4x32 short dot scope. Which was $200 bucks 
So what ur paying for is a like brand new m14 that's sure to please anyone out there I have only shot 5 rounds threw it and that's it.

I am not interested in any trades except a high end AK47
Not interested in a wasr 10 ak47 or anything els thanks

I have $1400 into this, and the gun itself cost $900 so ur paying for a 1400 rifle for what a normal mini 30 would have cost

""The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy, and greater reliability. The double/single action design is safe and time-proven. The open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged. The high-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning and also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. Visible automatic firing pin block. Reversible magazine release."""

do your research - some items for sale on armslist are available at local retail outlets or online for competitive prices even if you include the ffl ship cost.

i would expect armslist to be a place to find used items for LESS than the cost of the same item as new... a no brainer! but no, some people just take advantage of others.

do your research... shop locally and support your local dealers who dont rip you off!

The previous owner and I have made some modifications to improve this rifle. First up is a Volquartsen trigger kit with a metal trigger housing. Trigger has a 4lb pull with a nice crisp break, it really is a huge improvement over the stock trigger. Since I bought it, I also swapped out the original stock (modified by the previous owner, see below) with a Ruger laminated stock, which I think is a nice visual improvement over the original stock. In addition, the laminated stock, unlike the original, this one has posts installed for attaching sling swivels (not included). Sights are the original stock iron sights with the gold dot on the front sight and a rail is installed on the receiver for optics.

Regarding the original stock (also included with the rifle), the previous owner had a heavy tapered barrel installed prior to selling to me. This required some modification of the original stock. First, the barrel end was cut down a few inches, so the barrel band is no longer there, and then it was re-shaped to make room for the tapered heavy barrel. He removed that barrel and put the stock barrel back on, which leaves space under the stock barrel, essentially free-floating the stock barrel. Personally, I like the look without the barrel band ‚Äì that‚Äôs always bothered me about the 10/22 design. 

Rifle has been well cared for. I‚Äôm the second owner and can say it‚Äôs in very nice condition.

I‚Äôm also putting this up with 250 rounds of .22lr so you‚Äôll be sure to have something to shoot when you buy it.

It‚Äôs a very nice rifle, but I need the cash right now, so this is one item that needs to go.

What you get:
‚Ä¢	(1) Ruger 10/22 with Volquartsen trigger kit, metal trigger housing, original 10/22 barrel and laminated stock (installed)
‚Ä¢	(1) Original 10/22 stock, modified as noted above
‚Ä¢	(1) Ruger BX-10 10-round magazine
‚Ä¢	(250) Rounds of Remington Thunderbolt .22lr ammo

Price is $375, firm. I‚Äôm not looking for any trades or offers.

Sale will be FTF in Milwaukie, Oak Grove, Gladstone or O.C.  Current Oregon DL is required, current Oregon CHL is preferred and will be given preferential status if more than one person wants this. Meeting will be around my work schedule. Note that, due to my schedule, evenings and weekends are currently not an option for me.
