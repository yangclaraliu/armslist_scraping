Kickeez recoil pad.
The wood has awesome figure and color through out the stock. The stock has very minor handling marks and the bluing is mint condition other than a tiny rub on the floor plate. I know for a fact the rifle has been fired less than 50 times since new. The rifling looks like brand new as well as the bore itself. Comes with the original dealer hanging tag as well as instruction manual. Also comes with a Browning model 1915 hand fitted safari case that was purchased fro the same place in the early 70s along with a hand tooled Torel Cape Buffalo sling. The case is in mint condition with both keys as well as the Browning instruction manual and care card. I have seen some of these on the web for sale but never one like this in mint condition as well as both keys and paper work. Last is on box of vintage Winchester Western 458 rounds and one box of empty cases. This rifle is in amazing condition to have been made in 1964.

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1943 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped in February of 1943. It was Issued to an enlisted serviceman at the time. (Trying to find out who it was issued to now through different channels.) There are specific clues on the gun that tell you who it MIGHT have gone to.. There is AA inscribed (Not stamped) on the frame Next to GHD. GHD is significant because Col. Guy H. Drewry inspected ordnance from June 17, 1942 to July 15, 1945 For COLT.

After having multiple collectors and Colt dealers at the gun show look at it. ""AA"" is believed to stand for ""All American"" 82nd Airborne. Which would match the dates the gun was issued, and the eagle carved on the Ivory grips. 82 Airborne was the first Airborne division in US Army history and had three major drops, made their first drop in July of 1943 to invade Sicily. Second was Salerno on 13 September 1943. The third was the invasion of Normandy Jun 1944.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by a gunsmith. At some point it was re-blued, and fixtures were 24k gold plated. It has been determined the gold was added many many years ago as some has worn off in spots. Bluing and finish is still very nice...

I purchased the Match Grade barrel & bushing set from Wilson Combat (and as well as 3 Wilson stainless magazines) and had a local gunsmith fit the barrel.  He also did a high-cut grip, installed a Smith & Alexander magwell and melted it, stippled the front strap of the grip, tuned the extractor, and then bead blasted the pistol.  
I installed Harrison Design micarta grips and a Wilson Combat extended slide stop so that the slide stop and the thumb safety match in checkering and how far they stick out.
The pistol shoots flawlessly in either configuration, and switching between calibers is a 30 second job (just swap barrel and magazine).
Comes now as the .38 Super, but comes with the stock Kimber 9mm barrel/ bushing and the stock Kimber 9mm stainless mag.

Comes with all the following:
Pistol, 3 Wilson magazines with bumper pads, S&A Magwell installed, stock Kimber mainspring housing in S&A bag, Harrison grips on pistol, stock Kimber grips, all paperwork, Kimber barrel wrench, Kimber hard case, Stock 9mm barrel and bushing (In Wilson .38 Super bag).  
Gun still looks brand new, only shot about 40 times as a 9mm & about 120 times as a .38 Super."

Here is an excellent Chinese copy, and in some respects an improvement on, the workhorse Remington 870. Since the 870 was introduced in 1950, its patent probably expired in 2000, hence these excellent tributes to the Wingmaster. Manufacturer is Zonghzou Machine Works, Jin An China, one of the former Norinco operatives. Importer is Interstate Arms in Billerica, Massachusetts. Finish is entirely matte black with classic corncob 870P type forends in black synthetic, and matching buttstock with a nice thick recoil pad. Sight system is conventional bead sight but also with frame mounted Tactical Picatinny Rail that accepts any Weaver Style Optical mounts or device. Weight empty is about 7 1/2 pounds. Note the mar on the finish. It's a safe assumption that none of the 981 Hawks will be cosmetically perfect. Credit finish mars to the rice paper boxes that these come in, even though Chinese boxmanship has improved over the last decade. Nevertheless these are solid, quality shotguns and attractive finishwise. All of them are brand new in their original boxes, and we take great pains with rice-boxed guns when we ship them. Note the high visibility orange follower. Barrel is 18 inch Cylinder Bore, .718-.720 at the muzzle. Magazine capacity is five plus one round of 12 gauge 2 3/4 inch shells, or four plus one round of 3 inch magnum. Note the extended section of the magazine forward of the barrel lug. We have added an FM brand, Brand New Electronic Green or Red Dot Sight, adjustable two colors with brand new mounts, all excellent quality and all manufactured in the same neighborhood as the shotgun itself. All the owner will need to do is put the rings on the sight, screw it down to the rail, and zero it in. We have also added a polymer heat shield, similar to the famed Trench Guns of World War One. A Remington 870 tricked out like this one commands prices in the $700 - $800 vicinity. We're offering these excellent 870 clone shotguns, however, complete with shield, mounts and sight, each for only $ 219.00Shipping. $20 flat fee lower 48 states; $60 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground with full insurance coverage.

Buyers help us connect the dots, please fill in your FFL's info on your GA forms. This listing is for One shotgun, dealers and law enforcement, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. This is our #LG982T. Here is an excellent Chinese copy, and in some respects an improvement on, the workhorse Remington 870. Since the 870 was introduced in 1950, its patent probably expired in 2000, hence these excellent tributes to the Wingmaster. Manufacturer is Zonghzou Machine Works, Jin An China, one of the former Norinco operatives. Importer is Interstate Arms in Billerica, Massachusetts. Finish is entirely matte black with classic corncob 870P type forends in black synthetic, and matching buttstock with a nice thick recoil pad. Sight is the classic and popular military Ghost Ring peep sight setup. Weight empty is about 7 1/2 pounds. Note the mar on the finish. It's a safe assumption that none of the 982 Hawks will be cosmetically perfect. Credit finish mars to the rice paper boxes that these come in, even though Chinese boxmanship has improved over the last decade. Nevertheless these are solid, quality shotguns and attractive finishwise. All of them are brand new in their original boxes, and we take great pains with rice-boxed guns when we ship them. Note the high visibility orange follower. Barrel is 18 inch Cylinder Bore, .718-.720 at the muzzle. Magazine capacity is five plus one round of 12 gauge 2 3/4 inch shells, or four plus one round of 3 inch magnum. Note the extended section of the magazine forward of the barrel lug. We have added a polymer heat shield, similar to the famed Trench Guns of World War One. Own one of these fine shotguns for only $ 219.00.

 I fondled it for a bit and flipped it a few times. Clipped it in my pocket and walked around with it for a bit (not carried out of the house, and nothing else was in my pocket). It has not even cut paper. It is just as it came from Spyderco and is LNIB.

 Blade is well centered. Lock up is about 50% with no blade play that I can detect. Has a bit of lock stick (pretty normal for a Ti lock face, and seems like this is pretty normal for a Southard. I’d assume it’ll wear in eventually, but I haven’t opened/closed it enough for it to smooth out).

 I accept PayPal gift, cash, check, etc… I’ll wait for any payment method you choose to clear before shipping. I do not accept PayPal other than gift because I’ve been scammed before. I’ve got a LOT of history and feedback on ebay, INGO, CAF, and CACO. All 100% positive. Please contact me if you’d like for references. Or, if you’re close enough, we can meet face to face.

Photos show the first P22s we received from the newly established Walther Arms in Fort Smith Arkansas. We have sold dozens of these fine little pistols locally since their introduction in 2001. Their 18 oz light weight and superb design makes them one of the most pleasant handling handguns on the market. Their accuracy is unparalleled for pistols their size, with a very efficient 3 1/2 inch barrel. The P-22 is, as Fjiestad puts it, a 3/4 scale variant of the Walther P-99. Manufacturer is Carl Walther of Germany. Importer and assemblers are Walther Arms, and the pistol is so stamped on the right side of its slide. Magazine capacity is 10 rounds, and this P-22 comes with its factory Stainless magazine. Safety does not decock, but the safety drops the firing pin as part of an unmatched safety system that includes an internal lock with key. Here is what the factory says about the P-22: The Walther P22 is fascinating in its compact size, while still maintaining all of the features of a full size pistol. Constructed using a modular manufacturing concept, the P22 offers several different equipment configurations. Features include interchangeable backstrap that creates an ideal fit to the shooters hand, compact and lightweight design, traditional double action design, ambidextrous controls for right or left handed shooters, integrated trigger lock and loaded chamber indicator, magazine disconnect, hammer safety and firing pin safety for safe and reliable operation, fixed barrel for incredible accuracy and windage adjustable rear sight and elevation adjustment with interchangeable front sights for variations in shooter operations. Other specs are double- and single-action semi-auto; Black Polymer grip frame; steel slide, 3.4 inch barrel, and internal parts; ambidextrous lever safety; weight empty 19.6 ounces.

I absolutely love this pistol but it just doesn't get used. I've owned a number of 45's and this is the softest shooting to date by far. I purchased it from a dealer several years ago. They now retail for $1039 at my local shop. I believe $650 is more than a good deal for a concealable soft shooting and top quality 45. Gun is in excellent condition and comes with a retention holster. Does not have night sights. You can carry de cocked like a sig or cocked and locked like a colt. I have never ever seen a single malfunction or hiccup with the way it shoots and feeds. I'm probably going to regret this but first one with the cash wins. Call it text mike at REDACTED.

This rifle has a BD date code. For those that don't know, the HK MR556 is a short stroke piston operated rifle built as a civilian version of the 416. The 416 is in use by Marines (IAR27) and by select special forces. It is an outstandingly clean operating system. It also has been upgraded with HK licensed Troy Micro flip-up front and rear sights($190). The sights give absolute 1-1 co-witness to the Aimpoint. It has had the barrel re-profiled to the SOCOM profile by Jayson at IGF. He re-profiles and works on HK's for a living. His work is second to none. It also comes with a 14.5"" SS barrel custom made to fit the HK MR556 and 416, it has been Duracoated and includes a BCM flash hider with pin to lengthen it to 16"" overall. I bought the barrel for another upper but decided to let it go. The upper has a zero round count, while the lower has a 30 rounds or less count. I used it with my other upper to test the other uppers accuracy. I have a larger trigger guard on it but includes stock flat trigger guard. It has 7 HK High Reliability Magazines (2 I bought used and 5 never fired). It also has 5 HK polymer magazines. It comes with all the paperwork, HK Tool, and hard case from HK. I will include the Vickers Padded Combat two point sling with quick release. I also put rubber Magpul rail ladders on the sides and bottom of the forearm rail. The Aimpoint PRO is used but in perfect condition with box,spacer (not used as to give co-witness to the HK low profile sights), and paperwork. There is almost $500 worth of magazines at HK's price. The total of the barrel re-profile and nitriding (meloniting) is $340. The extra barrel (new), I put a value of $300 even though it cost more than that to have it made and include an extra barrel nut (not pictured). I also have an HK barrel nut tool that will fit HK's proprietary barrel nut. On a side note the barrel tab was removed by Jayson to allow either the MR556 or 416 BCGs to fit the upper, the 14.5"" barrel was made without the tab, so it will work with either also. I honestly am not looking to trade for anything. Please note that I will drive within a reasonable area to meet, but prefer to deal FTF. Must show ID, CCW or PPP to buy this. Sorry for the inconvenience, but better safe than sorry. Price is firm and not negotiable. Please no low ballers I really do not need to sell this and only thought I might as it is a safe queen, I have no problem keeping it as I have way more in it than my price. More photos are available of any and all parts of the rifle. Just email me and request photos. I can take close-ups of the BCG, barrel, sights, etc."

It has a Bell and Carlson Medalist Tactical stock and a Vortex crossfire 6-24x50 scope with sunshade. It also has a sling and a Blackhawk traversing bipod. I sold the gun once on here, but it was returned claiming the barrel was shot out and the scope was no good. I had it fully inspected and tested by a very reputable gunsmith in my area and he concluded that the gun was almost in brand new condition (he figured less than 100 rounds through it) and the scope shot sub-1/2 inch groups at 100 yards on the lowest scope magnification. So this gun is an excellent gun and he was quite impressed with the scope despite it's low price. This gun also comes with about 150 rds of ammo. I am asking $950 for the whole lot. If interested just send me a text or call REDACTED. I am not interested in trades. Thanks."

It is chambered in 9mm and will accept any compact Glock lower. Simply remove the slide from your Glock, insert the feed ramp and the Glock lower 'clicks in' to the upper and viola, you have yourself a 9mm carbine. It really is a slick setup. This particular piece has the upper rail and telestock installed at the factory. This would cost you almost $600 shipped to your door, plus several months wait on backorder. I'm only asking $500.

It is a full scale AKM training rifle and very similar to the real deal. However the bolt rails, front trunnion, barrel, magazine and bolt are completely different which makes it legal to own in CT, other than it being a rimfire rifle. Other than that they are the same. It accepts standard AKM stocks, grips, gas tubes, and handguards. That being said, I swapped the factory wood out for some very nice Romanian laminate. Very hard to find Romanian laminate this nice. The rifle comes with a single 10rd magazine as seen in the pictures. These rifles are very rare and unique. I am asking $600.00 cash for this. No trades please.

Second I have a very early Plainfield Machine Co. M1 Carbine. For those of you who don't know, Plainfield manufactured high quality commercial grade M1s for civilians, corrections officers, and LE. They were also known to use quite a few USGI parts on their rifles as well. This is one of their earlier models from the early 60s and therefore had pre-ban status. It comes with no magazine as I do not have any CT compliant mags for this available. I am asking $700.00 cash. Again, no trades please.

Third, I have a Type 99 Arisaka. This is from the Nagoya Arsenal and isn't a 7th series rifle. This is relatively rare as far as Arisakas go and is not a ""last ditch"" rifle. It is complete with top handguard and aircraft sights. The stock is uncut, but could use a refinishing. The rifle was recently in poor shape so I had it reblued. The bore is bright and shinny. I am asking $150.00 cash and only would be interested in a trade for a nice shape 91/30."

Same size as the Glock 42 and less than 3.5 oz heavier with a capacity of 7+1 9mm vs 6+1 .380 ACP. Price reflects a 3% cash discount.

I absolutely love this pistol but it just doesn't get used. I've owned a number of 45's and this is the softest shooting to date by far. I purchased it from a dealer several years ago. They now retail for $1039 at my local shop. I believe $650 is more than a good deal for a concealable soft shooting and top quality 45. Gun is in excellent condition and comes with a retention holster. Does not have night sights. You can carry de cocked like a sig or cocked and locked like a colt. I have never ever seen a single malfunction or hiccup with the way it shoots and feeds. I'm probably going to regret this. Call or text mike at REDACTED. Only interested in a trade toward a glock 30 or 29. Thanks for looking.

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1942 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped in May of 1942. It is stamped with WB inside a Box for Colonel Waldemar S. Broberg, Hartford/Springfield Ordnance District, Army Inspector of Ordnance: July 1, 1941 - June 16, 1942. The WB inspected pistols are a little more rare for that time frame.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by the military, as the barrel has been re-stamped. This gun is in its original time frame finish (parkerized). All Proof markings to fit era. Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. It is amazingly tight and special fitted for accuracy. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

I'm just looking at other things at the moment, so I'm parting with this steal of a concealed carry package.

Before I dive in, if you're not familiar with this brand (like I was), you can dig around the web to find that they are a Reputable manufacturer from Spain.
Their .45 caliber pistols are highly praised (The two 1911's carried by Samuel Jackson and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction are actually Star 1911 Clones), and the other bored models are made to the same standard.




This is the M43 Compact pistol, available in 9mm/.40SW/.45.
Mine is the single stack 9mm, 7 rounds +1, included is a spare mag.
It's an ""all steel"" gun, with an inside the frame slide, this combo makes it an accurate little automatic. The heft absorbs recoil, and from what I've read, will stand up to 9mm + P ammo. 
>>Very quick repeated shots with this overall setup, the grip, slide/body, and trigger.
The LOCKUP is tight, and the BORE is in good shape:
The RIFLING edges are pronounced, has a shine to it still, I don't think it has been used extensively.

It's single action only and can be carried in either:
CONDITION 1 (round in the chamber with the hammer cocked and the safety on), 
OR
 with a round cambered and the hammer released to a half cock. When the hammer is down, the safety will lock the slide in place.

The TRIGGER is in a nice middle ground between the very stiff and very light.
On one hand it is just at the point that it takes a deliberate finger pull to fire,
 and on the other hand: the trigger reset is short and it has an almost two-stage feel.
 When pulled back, it comes to a tangible rest just before the break.
>>Very quick repeated shots with this overall setup, the grip, slide/body, and trigger.

AMBIDEXTROUS SAFETY, just like on a 1911. The beaver tail grip and indent under the trigger guard give you a surprisingly solid GRIP on the gun. If you have *big* hands, you'll probably dangle a pinky.



Included is the original Star FireStar CARRYING CASE,
 a SPARE MAGAZINE stainless 7 round,
 a Galco Leather Inside the Waistband IWB Locking HOLSTER,
 and ONE BOX of econo-target range AMMO I have leftover.

I have found a great web page for this gun, and have a PDF copy of the original MANUAL, I'll have that printed out for you.

This gun needs to be kept clean and lubricated to work properly, and it prefers quality ammo due to it's stiff recoil spring. The hotter, the better.




I'm asking $310 for the lot, I can meet anywhere public, I'd prefer to meet at a Police station (they won't be involved in the sale, however they don't mind for our safety).
Bill of sale with documentation of the Serial #, our DL #'s and FOID card if applicable.

This gun is new in its original box, with all original accessories, manual(s), etc.
The Colt 1991 Series is a direct descendant of the original Colt M1911. A long trigger, flat mainspring housing and original style recoil spring system remain from the original M1911 design. Upgrades from the original include white dot sights and a lowered ejection port for extra reliability. It still remains ""the standard"" that everyone tries to imitate, but no one duplicates.

It has a collapsible stock and an 18” barrel.  This gun has only approximately 100 rounds through it, including a careful barrel break-in.  I fired 10 single rounds, cleaning between each, then three rounds between cleanings for another 20 rounds or so.

It is in completely stock condition and has not been modified in any way.  It comes with the original 5 round magazine, owner’s manual, hard case, and cardboard box.  The only flaws are several small chips in the camo coating from being in a safe.  It is like buying a new rifle for a great discount.  The attached photos show the actual rifle for sale and were taken on January 30, 2015.

The only reason I am selling it is I am left handed and prefer a left handed AR platform.

The rifle is available for face-to-face cash purchase and pickup in Kennewick, WA.  I do not want to go through the time and hassle of mailing the rifle.  Sorry.

The background check that is now required in Washington by Initiative 594 and subsequent transfer of the gun to the buyer can be performed at the Hole in the Wall gun shop in Kennewick, WA.  The fee is $25.00, payable by the buyer.  If you do not pass, I will then have to pay $25 and go through a background check to be able to take my own gun home.  The new law sucks!  In reality, though, I checked out the process and it is not a big deal.  It can be done as quickly as a normal check on a new purchase, only you SAVE BIG!!!

Anyway, give me a call at the number listed below if you have any questions or would like to arrange to purchase the rifle.  To avoid having to bargain on the price at the gun store doing the transfer, my price is firm at $799, cash.  The new price on one of these is approximately $1,100, including tax.  So you save $300.00!  I checked and there is no sales tax on the private sale, even though the transfer occurs at a gun store.

Thanks for looking!

The 5.56 Carbine Quad Rail 16"" Upper is a standard M4 style upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

Barrel Material: Voodoo Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel
finished with our proprietary QPQ Melonite process inside and out. Unlike hard chrome and magnesium phosphate, Melonite is a molecular bonding process with the metal. It allows the chemicals to seep down below the surface area of the metal, instead of just adding a top layer. This means that the barrel can be cut to a true rifle bore while maintaining complete corrosion resistance and virtually no wear. It also means that the protection offered is not just a thin layer on top of the material but actually penetrates layers deep ensuring that it does not wear off. Now you have the velocities of a stainless steel true rifle bore with complete protection! You can out last a chrome lined barrel and shoot with the accuracy and efficiency of a stainless steel barrel, all without breaking the bank

I apologize for the upside-down pictures. Armslists appears to always have a problem with my pictures.

One lightly used LaRue SPR/M4 Scope Mount. Skip the postage and wait; buy it here from me! I'm selling it because I sold my 30mm scope, and instead of buying another 30mm, I ended up getting a 35mm. $150 OBO. 


From LaRue Website:

The Industry Standard.
The LT104 is the best mount made for attaching high-power riflescopes onto flattop-style AR15's, period.

The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.

The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.

Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.

Assembly and adjustment only takes a few minutes, then off to the range.

About VFZ Mounts:
VFZ is a new theory in the concept of clamping accessories to MIL-STD-1913 rails. Instead of using a horizontal cross-bolt, the VFZ uses a vertical bolt that draws up a clamping foot against the lower angle of the rail, seating the mount similarly to a fully-closed LaRue lever.

Once installed on the firearm, index marks allow the user to remove the mount, then reattach to the same tension, providing unprecedented return to zero for a non-QD-levered mount. The unique vertical alignment of the clamp allows components that are structurally stronger than traditional cross-bolt designs."

In the Saiga line of rifles, this timeless design utilizes a proven gas piston system, rotary bolt, and very few internal parts that provide the reliability that Izhmash has delivered for over 60 years. A hammer forged, chrome lined barrel and chamber provide the ultimate in long life. The driftable post front sight with protective ears is adjustable for windage and elevation. The notched side catch with bar rear leaf sight is adjustable for elevation. The rear sight has presets for 109, 218, & 328 yards. The comfortable, ergonomic operating handle makes charging the firearm effortless. The spring loaded magazine release provides for quick magazine changes. The elongated selector handle allows for a smooth transition from safe to semi-auto. Includes one detachable magazine.

Absolutely flawless performance from real Russian made firearms.  These were made by Izhmash which is the Kalashnikov Factory.  These are not US made replicas, there are the real deal, 100% Russian made and imported prior to the ban, so once they are gone, they are gone.

I have tried the torture tests with mine and they hold up to tremendous abuse. I have thrown it in the mud, in a pond, in the snow drug it throught the brush and just sprayed it off, picked out the twigs, stuck in a clean mag and she fired as good as the day I got it.

Plus ammo for these is very cheap at this time.  You can buy bulk boxes of a thousand rounds almost between $250.00 and $350.00, depending on brand and your area.
