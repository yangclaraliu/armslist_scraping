The Magnadot is a meaty folder. It has substance and you know it when it is in your hand. A traditional and reliable pattern that will give years of reliable use, the Magnadot is more turtle than hare. Easily opening the formidable 3.63-Inch half serrated blade with one hand gives you a sense of power. The Magnadot includes a lockback feature and is one of the oldest locks in use today. It's a great mechanism that locks up very securely. The lever on the back edge of the handle catches in the tang of the blade and locks it, while with one press on the back of the lever, unlocks the blade in this ambidextrous and safe to operate feature. The glass reinforced nylon handle is high strength, abrasion and impact resistant. The handle also offers a chemical resistance to common chemicals such as motor oil, transmission fluid, and methanol. Magnadot... it is happening big. This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in manufacturing and materials.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Like the Kalashnikov rifle variants, it is a rotating bolt, gas-operated gun that feeds from a box magazine. All Saiga-12 configurations are recognizable as Kalashnikov-pattern guns by the large lever-safety on the right side of the receiver, the optic mounting rail on the left side of the receiver and the large top-mounted dust cover held in place by the rear of the recoil spring assembly.

The Saiga-12 is manufactured by the arms division of Izhmash, in Russia. It was previously imported into the US by European American Armories, although their agreement expired in 2005 and Izhmash then began exporting through the Russian-American Armory Company. The current export import partner is Wolf Performance Arms.[2] Izhmash also manufactures Saiga 20s and Saiga 410s in 20-gauge and .410 bore, as well as the Saiga semi-automatic hunting rifles in a number of centerfire calibers.[3]"

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip.

Made in 1978. Iron sights with original scope mounts. Blued finnish with walnut stock. It's been well cared for, but it's also spent a lot of time in the field in the years I've had it. It's got quite a few kills to her name. It's got some wear spots in the blue, and dings in the stock. But it's one of the smoothest actions Ive ever owned. Trigger breaks crisp. It shoots 1MOA all day with 155gr Remington coreloks. It does just as well with The heavier expensive loads.

the scope in the picture is no longer on the rifle. But I would be willing to sell it. It is a Redfield revenge 3x9x42 accu-range hunter reticle . It is Brand New. Never been fired. I mounted it on the rifle and bore sighted it, and the gun went back in the safe . I took the scope off the rifle recently for a potential sale of the rifle. So the scope is literally brand-new . I would throw it in with the rifle for an extra $150.

all in all this has been a great hunting rifle. Built tough, and always been dependable and accurate. I have no doubt that whomever ends up with it will be pleased.

I hate to see this go but the wife is into hunting now and needs something with a bit less kick.

it has found worldwide acclaim with both private and public security agencies. 
In addition to being used as a conventional service pistol, it is ideal for concealed carry or as a backup weapon.

Used by officers as well as tankers, drivers, artillery crews, mortar crews, and other personnel in lieu of the larger, heavier M1 Garand rifle, the M-1 carbine weighed only 4.5 to 4.75 pounds. The Citadel M-1, made by Chiappa in Italy, weighs in at 4.8 lbs. – nearly the exact weight of the original. Barrel length and OAL are also the same as the ""United States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1"", its official military designation.

Right now, we have a once in a lifetime deal on Yugo N-PAP AK's. These AK's have hammer forged barrels. We bought a batch of AK's that were supposed to be ""gunsmith specials"", but come to find out, it was a simple ammo issue. When the Yugo N-PAP's were brought into the country, they were single stack magazines, the importer then modifys them to take the standard double stack AK mags. We noticed in some of the guns, they didn't remove the ""bullet guide"" (shown in picture #3, which causes the gun to only function with FMJ ammo, not soft-point or hollow-point ammo. We are pricing these are $399.99 + TAX. We got in a handful in that has no bullet guide, we test fired these with ALL types of ammo, and they function perfectly like an AK should, these are $429.99. You can easily remove the bullet guide with a dremel tool in about 45 minutes, and then they will function 100% with all types of ammo. Some of the AK's have synthetic furniture, some have thumb-hole stocks, some have wood. They are FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE. Some have side rails, some don't. Some have rails on the top dust cover, some don't. These are all brand new guns, not used turn-in's. We test fired every gun with 20 rounds of ammo to make sure they all function. We'll be happy to ship these to your FFL.

I believe it has the original stock and when I got it from my dad it hadn't been fired in several years so I took it to a local gunsmith, they checked it over, replaced the firing pin, magazine spring, and the recoil pad. I took it out and fired it after that and it worked nicely. I don't have any use for a rifle as I don't hunt and all it does is sit in the case and do nothing.

596,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3333596,"For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES PREMIUM LEAD-FREE 338 WIN. MAG. SUPERCHARGED - 225 gr. Barnes TSX @ 2950 fps/ME 4,347 ft. lbs - 20 Round Box","azusa, California, United States",$ 57,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 30, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=315

This 338 Win. Mag. load is the most versatile of all 338 Win. Mag. loads. The Barnes 225gr. TSX has no polymer tip to accelerate expansion on impact and therefore opens more slowly than the tipped versions of the TSX bullet. This slower start to expansion causes slightly deeper penetration than the tipped versions allow and this matters when shooting large animals such as moose and bison at bad angles. If I could use only one load for all my 338 hunting, this would be it because of its versatility. This Barnes 225gr. TSX bullet will normally penetrate deeper than 250gr. premium style partition bullets, yet it gives the higher velocity, flatter trajectory and lighter recoil of the 225gr. bullet.

 For smaller big game animals weighing under 600lbs, you will find our item 52D, (210gr. TTSX) which is tipped and gives more instant expansion, to deliver a more dramatic impact than the TSX bullet. Animals weighing under 600lbs do not need the extra penetration the TSX bullet gives over the TTSX bullet and the TTSX bullet will make larger entrance wounds and do more initial damage.

Both my 338’s have custom 22 inch barrels as the below velocities show. For your reference, 24 inch barrels will GENERALLY give almost 75 fps more velocity than 22 inch barrels and 26 inch barrels will GENERALLY give 50 to 60 fps more than 24 inch barrels.

I would prefer another bolt action rifle. Mag or tube fed is a huge plus. My 7 year old has a real hard time pulling the bolt back with that knob to cock it and would like something with a more traditional bolt action style so he can pull the bolt back with the handle for more leverage.
It is not hard to pull back for an adult though. i keep it well lubed and the spring isnt very hard. Fires every time, bore is in good condition and stock looks good for being 80 years old. It's extremely accurate. My 7yo was hitting bullseyes at 20 ft.
Ranger guns were sold by Sears back as early as the '30s but were made by Marlin. This is basically a rebranded Marlin Model 80.
Will consider cash offers.  can include some ammo (.22,.223,9mm) for the right trade."

I bought it for home defense because of the dual pistol grip.  To deal with recoil, I had the Knoxx Recoil Absorbing pistol grip stock added.  For the forend, I have a Lasermax combination flashlight and red dot sight.  The red dot sight is a strobe in order for rapid target acquisition.  The flashlight is more than bright enough for a dark home.  Capacity is 6+1.

I have never fired this gun, oddly enough.  I have a Benelli Supernova that's my primary home defense gun now and recently thought of this in the back of the safe when looking for some money to put into other projects.  It's a bit of an oddball, and I'm curious whether I'll get any serious offers.

My recommendation would be to remove the pistol grip stock and put on a choate stock, 12"" LOP to keep the short profile with the 18.5"" barrel.  And I might do this if nobody else wants it."

I got this planning to build it out with a folding Sig ""Brace"" and Solvent Trap adapter for my only little SBR Krink clone but decided my Sig 556 ""Pistol"" was a better choice for my needs.

America's best shooters keep choosing Kimber. Legendary LAPD™ SWAT tested five major 1911 brands and chose Kimber. United States Marines assigned to Special Operations Command chose Kimber. The U.S.A. Shooting Rapid Fire Pistol Team trains for Olympic competition with a Kimber. Most recently, LAPD™ SIS transitioned to Kimber. They all chose Kimber for the same reason: quality, dependability and accuracy. So should you.


 Kimber builds the world's finest 1911 pistols right here in America—something that makes sense, as few things are as American as a 1911 .45 ACP. Virtually every critical component of every pistol is manufactured inside the Kimber factory. The finest raw materials come through the front gate and Kimber does the rest, the only way to ensure that every part meets unequaled standards
