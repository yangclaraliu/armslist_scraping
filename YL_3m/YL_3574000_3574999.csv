Hogue Pistol grip, single point sling, flash suppressor/muzzle brake and detent kit from  Ak builder.com, plus I spent a weekend custom staining the wood fore end which came raw and was a blonde wood.. 
       It shoots awesome, what a thump this thing has.. immediate smiles.. and unbelievably smooth/low recoil due to the muzzle brake. I shot about 400 rounds through it with no issues.
       All this thing is missing is the SB47 Arm Brace (which acts as an NFA legal stock) to make this semi shootable weapon into a serious medium range, fighting, rifle caliber pistol.. 100 yd hits were still easily managed on a 10"" steel plate with the iron sights... due to the hinged top cover design it has a longer and ""better..IMO"" sight setup that is better than the Draco or other short barrel ak's.. Now there's many options for kits to add a rail and red dot for cheap..It would make a great ""truck gun with the 10"" cold hammer forged barrel.. Or if you wanted to go all the way, these were designed with the SBR in mind..

The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

I bought a Remington 700 AAC-SD .308 which comes with a Hogue OverMolded Pillar Bedded ghillie green stock ... I also immediately ordered a Remington SuperCell pad for it.  When I picked up my rifle, they told me that first of all, the Hogue stock comes with an effective Hogue recoil pad, and second- the Remington SuperCell pad only fits on REMINGTON synthetic stocks, not the other brands of stocks they have on certain models.

So if you have a Remington 700 ADL, SPS (Special Purpose Synthetic), SPS Varmint, etc. you can get this pad which revolutionizes the recoil.  I have one on an 870 and it's AMAZING.  I mean, AMAZING.

Anyway I have no use for this thing, it's brand new and sitting around.  

EDIT- LOOK I had the pricing wrong, when I bought this it was much more expensive, now it's alot cheaper online, I am sorry.  $20 bucks cash takes it or offer me some ammo in trade, I have needs of many different calibers, depending on what you got I'm sure some ammo from a box to a couple of boxes can get this done.  it REALLY is a nice thing and it's just sitting in a box, collecting dust because I have no needs and it's perfectly good!"

The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

Description from Condor:
The Summit Zero answers the call to carrying all that you need without being bogged down by the weight of the jacket itself. Designed to have increased articulation, comfort, and breathability when in the field, Summit Zero's feather weight construction reduces weight by 30% compared to the traditional Summit, while still providing much of the same protection.

When it comes to guns, the original version of the SKS called the Russian SKS shall not fall back in line. The original feel, the power, the overall design of the Russian variant makes it one of the most versatile of the series and one of the most considerable SKS variant. One thing good about the Russian variant is that it chews any ammunition up and even if the gun is old, it still shows power and accuracy in its firing capabilities.
The cheapness of the surplus ammo is very appealing for the eyes of gun fanatics because no matter how cheap or what type of bullet is inserted for example, a cheap steel case ammo will still release an incredible shot. Another thing good about the Russian variant is that it has very good accuracy. Shoot from a hundred yards away and it is still assured that the accuracy is spot-on. If not contented with the accuracy, installation of scopes can also be made. Add-on installation was made easy by the simplicity in design of the gun. Some guns could not be installed with particular add-ons because the design does not allow it. It is a good thing that the Russian variant is made to accept a variety of add-ons. The Russian variant is really something that a gun fanatic must get hold of before considering other models. The originals always have something good to offer the people. The Russian SKS just never gets old. 1952 Tula Arsenal"

I bought these around 2007-2010 from Sportsmans Guide but no longer have a need for them.  They're of eastern European or Russian extraction, but I can't tell them apart.  Maybe you can by the markings.

The previous ones I opened had tied paper wrappings around 10 rounds in two stripper clips.    I don't have an x-ray to look inside these, but I imagine they are the same way.  The ones I opened came with 60 stripper clips (with 5 cartridges each mounted) per can.

The value of these cans then would be not just the cartridges but the stripper clips as well, which are not exactly cheap anymore (about 50-70 cents each) 

Sealed, galvanized steel, with a pull ring along what looks like a soldered seam to open it.   

Each can measures about 6"" by 10.5"" by 3.75""

 The Beretta CX4 Storm is a semi-automatic rifle chambered in 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP. The gun is the civilian version of the Beretta Mx4 Storm and is one of two rifles offered by Beretta. Beretta recommends the gun for sporting and personal defense.

 The CX4 Storm features a blowback operating system, so the expanding gases that push a round through the barrel also push back onto the bolt to cycle the action. 

 Features include an ambidextrous controls. The CX4 Storm utilizes a front sight adjustable for windage and elevation with a rear sight that includes long and short range apertures of 50 and 100 meters. And both sights can fold down. However, the carbine is also equipped with a Picatinny rail, which allows for easy mounting of optics and accessories.

 The Beretta CX4 Storm semiautomatic carbine is a sporting or personal-defense firearm with a blowback-type locking system. The bolt safety ensures reliability, great stability and precision for a follow-up shot. The extractor, the ejector and the cocking handle are easily reversible for right- and left-hand use. The manual safety button and the magazine release button can also be reversed from one side to the other. The chrome-lined cold hammer-forged barrel is made of high resistance steel for maximum resistance to corrosion and increased barrel life. Adjustable stock is constructed of advanced technopolymers shaped with modern ergonomic lines and rounded forms for snag-free handling and rapid shouldering and aiming. Stock spacers (one included) allow you to lengthen the stock."

This MK23 comes with 5 magazines ($89 each) and a $150 plus Safariland holster.

The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more. One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America’s most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole! The Mark 23 is available in .45 ACP

I bought it new.  It has about 300 rounds through it.  It has everything that came with it, including two S&W 12 round magazines as shown and a S&W lifetime warranty.  One thing I love about this S&W and the 9mm is that when you push a loaded magazine into the butt, the slide automatically goes forward.  Better for quick reloads and not trying to shoot with the slide still back.  I'll throw in 2 1/2 boxes of ammo to get you started.  Just have too many guns I don't shoot.  It is a very light recoiling pistol.  It would make a good starter or practice gun, especially if you own a centerfire M&P.  If wife or daughter don't like recoil, this will do it.  For the inexperienced, a full size pistol is easier to manage and shoot well than a compact.  Moving toward shotguns and North American Arms. I am selling this because I want to practice with the same brand as I carry, and I carry an XDS.  If you want to shoot an M&P 9 or .45, you could use this for practice, drills, etc.  Save a few bucks including the $20-25 tax.

I am not hard up for cash. At this point and considering the condition, it seems like just as good a deal as the shotguns I've seen advertised here. I am firm and will let it ride for a while. Looking for someone with too many shotguns and not enough pistols or $300."

Hey guys, got my Savage Model 11 .223 up for sale/trade today. 
4th Savage in the family and absolutely love these guns, after shooting ever shape form for the money i beleive you cannot beat an accu-trigger Nikon glass
setup. The accu-trigger are incredible for a stock rifle.

I bought this gun last year to do some varmint/predator hunting with my 2 brothers. That trip we had twins of these along with 3rd brother with a Savage
axis .223 that we purchased for Christmas.  Absolutely had an amazing trip and  theserifles were spot on.
Unfortunately in this neck of the woods havent been able to get onto much varmint/predator hunting and its time to step up to something with alot more punch.
This gun was properly broke in (10 single shots clean in between, 5-2 round bursts with cleaning between, 5-3 round bursts with cleaning and finally cleaned and zeroed)
was only used for 1 hunting trip and shows a little wear but is in damn near brand new condition. 
Quickly swapped the scope rings to Burris Extreme Tactical due to there stability and 6 top bolt construction. Covered the glass in butler creek scope covers and this baby holds a zero all day! 
Along with the gun i have 120 round of .223 ammo i can throw in for ya (also may have .223 die for any reloaders out there)

Bought this gun brand new a year ago and would like to get $450 or trade for something similar in: .270, .308, 30-06 or let me know what you have!
Worst i can say is no thank you! Also willing to work deals with/without scope & rings

Thanks!

Looking to find a local gun smith to do this so absolutely no out of state ones please. Please also tell me a price estimate and how long it would take to do this.

Here is what I want done to my rifle
-Add a side mount on the receiver so it can accept side mounting scopes like the PSO. Like a Mosin with a PU scope base but for PSO scopes and ect.
-Cut the barrel down to 18in. I want the front sight base put back on also.
-Thread the barrel to accept the item below
-Thread this FAL flash hider I have and make it wider so it can accept the 7.62x54r round. I would also like the bayonet lugs cut off and smoothed to look better as well. Than blue it so it looks nice.
-Bend the bolt down. Bend it down like you see on Mosin Nagant PU sniper rifles.
