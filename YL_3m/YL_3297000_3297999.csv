This is a beautifully engraved and carved Gadsden Flag Shotgun. It is a Mossberg 500 12 ga. home defense length. I hand carved the wood stock and engraved the metal. The entire shotgun is engraved with a snakeskin pattern. The butt-stock has opposing Gadsden Snakes on either side, with a somewhat hidden additional snake graved in the metal by the trigger. The fore grip also has the snake skin pattern with the words ""Don't Tread On Me"" The metal is Duracoated ACR bushmaster cheekpiece. The fore-grip and butt-stock are stained using three different steps and are quadruple polyurethaned. This is a shotgun that will attract attention at any range, impress your Tea Party friends, protect your home and family, and proudly let your second amendment feelings be known! go to www.endtimesarmory.com to see more of my work.!"

It also has the correct style of major part for a 1943 Gustloff (speed milled upper band, cupped buttplate on laminated stock, milled trigger housing, etc) The ""X"" indicating Russian capture is a well struck Serif ""X."" 

It is import marked at the barrel.  Does not have sight hood, cleaning rod or capture screws (as is typical of RC rifles). A VERY nice example, especially compared to the very beat up and peened examples coming in these days.  Even those will be drying up shortly I fear.

Ed Brown no longer makes this particular model, and they are difficult to find.  Ed Brown claims 1-1/2"" accuracy at 50 yards, and although I am not that caliber of shooter I believe it.  The big thing with Ed Brown, is it is not super-tight, just tight where it matters, so they run!  There was no break-in period, I've had Kimbers and the like that are accurate, but if you don't run them really wet you will experience malfunctions, especially for the first 500-1,000 rounds.  I've run this pistol wet, but also after it's been in the holster for weeks and seems dry, and I've yet to have this pistol malfunction.  I think with regular drops of oil in the right places, and quality magazines/ammo, this firearm will run flawlessly for thousands of rounds, until the recoil spring or magazine spring is ready for replacement.  This would likely be a great pistol for IDPA or USPSA, as well as carry.  The trigger on this is really sweet, again Ed Brown says they ship at 3.5 pounds, and it is very crisp and clean.

Comes with tritium Night sites, Gen3 coating (over stainless, so you don't have to worry as much about sweat, etc when carrying), light/laser rail, cocobolo grips, Ed Brown exclusive chain link on front and rear strap, factory 7 round magazine, and carrying case with all paperwork and the oil, etc that came with the pistol.

As I carried this, there are some wear marks from the holster, but nothing too ugly in my opinion, I've made sure they all show in the pictures, however some artifacts in the pictures that look like flaws are lighting or oil (typical for my photography skills)."

I purchased this used pistol from gun world,
it was a compulsive purchase, and I simply cant afford to fire a pistol with the price of ammunition 
I am asking for what I paid for(in all reality im losing more money because I have to pay the interest on my credit card for this purchase) 
I have all paperwork and proof of purchase and registration in my name.
we can meet at a local gun store for the transfer. buyer pays transfer fees
I will include a box(aftermarket) with a lock, one magazine(aftermarket) and 50 rounds of ammunition 
I am not a gun expert, I went off of what the Professionals at Gun World told me about the pistol and they said the condition of the gun is 90% fully functional.
I am yet to fire the pistol since its been in my possession. I couldn't tell you how it shoots because I haven't taken the pistol down to the range.

I prefer pump action to any other type of shotgun for reliablity & while this gun advertises that its setup for 2 3/4"" & 3"" Magnum Rounds, I've actually loaded 3 1/2"" Magnum rounds in it singly by hand & it worked beautifully with no problems at all, you just need to feed the round right into the chamber to do it safely & effectively.  Personally though I don't see the need to ever really use a 3 1/2"" Magnum round when you can get a good 12-Pellet 2 3/4"" round that fires 12 .357 caliber rounds that spread out the farther you are from your target & with this gun you get a nice even circular spread, each travelling around 1,200fps, so even if only one of these rounds hits your intended target you're probably going to drop him on the spot, and that's a poor shot. Imagine what an aimed, decent shot with this same ammo can do.  Goto a 3"" round & you can get a 15 pellet OO Buck Shot that increases your chances of a hit & highly increases the chances of a deadly stop in your target's tracks too.  You can liken it to dumping a full 15rd clip from a Glock 31 .357SIG, except all at the same time with all the bullets spreading out the further they travel in a circular pattern until they strike the target. You need not be a good shot with a shotgun to hit your target, but that being said this shotgun with it's ghost ring & Truglo Front Sight make it really easy to be deadly accurate with each & every shot. I just took it one step further by adding some extras, such as the Holographic sight (the shotgun comes with picatinny rail installed on top in front of the sight so you can opt to use any type of RDS or HWS you like instead of the stock sights.  Add the blinding 630 Lumen Torch & a Red Laser that you can switch to run independently or together & you've got the ultimate tactical shotgun. I'm even throwing in a pressure switch you can mount on the guns pump forearm or wherever you feel most comfortable mounting it so you don't need to fumble around to switch on the torch or laser.  Goodluck & feel free to contact me with any questions. I am open to trades for other weapons, particularly I'd like to get a good .357 or .44 magnum, or even a Ruger Mini-14 GB, but am open to any other ideas, and I also take all major credit cards.  Shipment anywhere in the lower 48 for $39.99."

This would be a great bike to give to the kid or to a nephew as a christmas present. its a really nice ride, very fun to ride. im just not into it without a motor and i dont have the money to install a motor on it. the rear rim alone is 50$, rear tire is another 55$ rear inner tube is 25-35$. frame is 100-150$, fork is another 75$. front tire is 45$, front inner tube is 15-25$, front rim is 30-45$. i have 1 spare rear rim and 1 spare front tire(rim and all). 300 is a good price for this all. Bike is in great condition, kept in a garage for the majority of its life. relatively rust free. All im looking for a rifle, preferablly a .22 with a rail on top. im not into them high power mosins so please dont offer them. i want a little plinker basically. just a nice little .22. if you are interested in this bike, feel free to offer, i have some cash to add for a nice gun."

The rifle is almost new with less than 300 rounds fired. It looks very sharp with the contrast of Black and Flat Dark-Earth and the rifle's competition muzzle brake coupled with a 4 lb. single stage trigger with a light hammer allows the shooter to maintain accuracy while firing multiple rounds in rapid fire or follow-on shots. The rifle's high quality compensator keeps muzzle rise to a minimum while the heavy 5 oz. buffer weight all but eliminates the rifle's recoil. The specific parts are listed below:

The X-Bolt builds on the proven successes of past Browning rifles, and adds numerous improvements that place the X-Bolt at the top of any side by side comparison. Most notable is an adjustable three-lever Feather Trigger™ system that offers the best feel on any Browning rifle ever. A bolt unlock button works with the top-tang safety to offer enhanced safety while unloading. Styling features offer more compact dimensions for a smaller, quicker, sleeker look and feel, and also trims weight. To ensure the stability of optics, scope bases are attached to the receiver using four screws per base. Innovation is the Browning tradition, and the X-Bolt is just the latest example. The X-Bolt Medallion bolt action rifle is presented with a fine gloss-finished, Checkered Walnut stock. The steel receiver is engraved and has a blued finish for beauty and durability. Insuring long-range accuracy is the totally free-floated barrel and Feather Trigger System, two of the most critical components of any high-powered hunting rifle. Action of the bolt is sure, smooth and secure. Rounds fed from the detachable box magazine align the bullet straight with the chamber providing reliable smooth feeding. This way, cartridges push directly in-line with the bore, sure, simple and secure. And it is no oridnary magazine -- it is a compact Rotary magazine design that is as convenient as it is efficient! FEATURES: - A durable gloss finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood. - The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks. - Rosewood caps on the fore-end and grip offer additional elegance. - Durable polished blued steel for a striking appearance. - Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy. - The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy. - Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately. - Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform. - Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass."" - Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact. - 60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion. - Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld. - Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change. - Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged. - Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil.

I have everything that came with the kit when I purchased it new including removal tool and extra rubber grip insert. 
Took it out shooting 3 times and taken great care of it and always kept it inside a padded case. 
Some people have had complaints about the forend not fitting right and having to shave a tiny bit of plastic to get it to install properly. 
I already took care of that issue by dremeling off the plastic issue and it fits perfect. It's not mangled, I did a decent job on it.  :thumbsup2: 

Shown here on gun, but I will be removing it very soon or sooner when there is a interested buyer. 
Located in Marysville. local pick up is $75.00 or same price plus shipping cost if you want it shipped.
I paid $140 when I bought it, so I am not happy going this low, but I need to sell it.

There is a little missing metal peg thing as you can see in the picture, I think it has always been missing since only 1 fell out when I took it apart. Doesn't look like it does anything important, so it doesn't seem to be a problem at all or I would have fixed it before I posted it for sale and not have even listed it.

All of my knives are handmade by me.  I use quality steel, 1095 high carbon steel, and 440C high carbon stainless steel.  My sheaths are also handmade, and I also hand stitch these.

Each knife takes 18-20 hours to make. They are razor sharp and will hold an edge very well.

Serial is BSCXXXX. 

This revolver is in overall excellent condition, low round count, and generally well taken care of. Trigger pull is smooth, timing is good, lock up is tight. Comes with original box and papers.

Asking $590 cash FTF. 

Don't miss this opportunity to pick up arguably one of the best snub revolvers ever made, not available in this chambering since the early 90s. Light enough to carry, but heavy enough to shoot comfortably. Would be great for showing off, both at home and at the range.

I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine.

Thanks for looking!

Happy to answer any questions, share more photos, arrange a face-to-face inspection, etc."
