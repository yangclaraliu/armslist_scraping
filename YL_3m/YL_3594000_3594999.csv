Its in good shape with a little bit of carry wear but nothing major worth mentioning.  Comes with two 8 round magazines.  Has an excellent trigger, light and breaks very cleanly with a short reset.  If you aren't familiar with these they are very similar to a Kahr CW9, basically the single stack 9mm Glock has yet to make.

It carries nicely but I prefer to pocket carry so I'd like something with a shorter grip.  I'd be interested in a Ruger SR9c or LC9 or an M&P Shield in trade.  Might also consider J frame sized .38 special revolvers, or the same guns mentioned in .40.

Web’s Best price I could find was at Bud’s Guns: $678.00

This rifle is used and has been hunted with.  The bluing is in very good shape with no blemishes.  The only signs of wear are at the tip of the barrel where it is slightly lighter in color.  The wood stock shows signs of use but there are no deep dings or scratches, nothing through the finish and into the virgin wood.  Just enough marks that you won’t feel bad about taking it for walk in the woods!   I am not the first owner so I can’t say exactly how many rounds have been fired.  The rifling is very strong and the bore is bright and shiny.  Just like all Sako / Tikkas, the gun’s accuracy is exceptional.  The gun shoots ¾” (4) shot groups with 180gr Sierras’ (well under the factory guaranteed MOA!)  The Tikka trigger breaks crisp at 3lbs (adjustable from 2-4 lbs) and bolt is extremely smooth.  

The rifle comes with the following:
1.	Factory Detachable Magazine
2.	Factory 1” Scope Rings
3.	If you pick up the gun (FTF in Western NY) I’ll include (34) rounds of Reloaded Ammunition

Asking $525.00 OBO TFT in Wellsville, NY (I’ll Ship the rifle only for an additional $25.00)

One of the most accurate, and easily carried pistols I own. Recoil is very managable making it a joy to shoot. Made around 1924 ( I can look up the serial number again if you'd like) I believe its a type 2 that easily dissasembles by twisting the barrel when in lock position. 

Eats any ammo I put thru it.
Comes with original 2 tone magazine 9 round I believe


and 2 after market 10 round mags, barely used.
I have two different holsters Ill include- one is a cheaper suede holster, and the second is a custom tuckable IWB from ryangrizzlleather.com which is fitted/molded and holds great retention & includes a 'p clip' and a brand new belt loob attatchment never been used- carries so well you'll forget its there. I have around 100 maybe more rounds left over- mostly winchester white box and some good magtech hollowpoints.
I also had my smith swap out the original springs for new springs from wolff and I will include that package that includes part numbers. This pistol runs great.
Asking less than I have in to it- $500 cash takes all. 

YOU pay your own background fee and transfer fee. I know of a shop in Littleton that honors $15 transfers. I will meet anywhere within reason of Parker, Colorado. NO, THE NEW CABELAS DOES NOT DO TRANSFERS

L3 EOTech HOLOgraphic Weapon Sights 553.A65/1 - the latest from L3 Communications EOTech division features CR123 Lithium battery, reticle pattern with 65 MOA and 1 MOA aiming dot, Dual ARMS® throw levers with 7mm raised base. Eotech 553 is waterproof and has 66 ft submersion rating. Eotech 553.A65/1 is a top of the line model and it is compatible with Gen I-III+ Night Vison Systems (tandem operation).
After extensive testing of various optical sights, US Special Operations Command has standardized on the EOTech Holographic Weapon Sight its 1X weapon optic for close quarter and urban combat zones. To meet the stringent requirements set and demanded by our elite fighting forces, EOTech has developed the EOTech HOLO Sight M 553, modeled after the ever popular, battle proven EOTech HWS design. The EOTech M553 HOLO Weapon Sight incorporates many additional features required within the SOPMOD Block 2 program. 

The advantage of HOLOgraphic Weapon Sight 553 is holographic reticle patterns that are instantly visible in any light condition, instinctive to center regardless of shooting angle and always remain in view to achieve lightning quick reticle to target acquisition without covering or obscuring the point of aim. 

The magic of EOTech HOLOgraphic Weapon Sights is the edge they provide to you in close quarter or urban combat zones. L3-Communications EOTech HOLOgraphic M553 Weapon Sight will remain fully operational even when laminated window is obstructed by mud, snow, rain, or even damaged/shattered, as long as you can see through any portion of the laminated window, the entire reticle pattern will be visible on target... with point of aim/impact being maintained and EOTech HWS Weapon Sight SU-231/PEQ (M553) Night Vision compatible 553.A65/1 is being fully functional, the operator can still engage with confidence. The Holographic Weapon Sight EOTech M553 employs a true Heads-Up Display that eliminates blind spots, constricted vision, or the tunnel vision associated with tubed sights. All user controls are flush to the HWS's streamline housing with no protruding knobs, battery compartments or mounting rings blocking vision at the target area.


Twenty brightness levels of EOTech HOLO Weapon Sight M553 - 553.A65/1 ensure proper brightness control in either low light or very bright sunlight. An on-board microprocessor provides automatic battery check indicator, up/down brightness scrolling and programmable auto shutdown features. All HWS's state-of-the-art electronics are fully encapsulated in shock absorbing resin compound to withstand shock. The EOTech HOLOgraphic Weapon Sight M553 553 A65 1 has been designed and tested to provide consistent, reliable performance even in the most hostile operational environments. It is waterproof, fogproof, shockproof, and temperature proof. The EOTech HOLOgraphic Weapon Sight 553 is designed to withstand Mil-Spec drop tests and still remain fully operational and hold zero. The HWS has been extensively tested in a punishing recoil simulator generating 3,500 G's of acceleration in less than 0.5 milliseconds (the recoil of a .454 Casull revolver) as well as various environmental chambers). EOTech’s Heads Up Display is constructed with a 3 layer, shatterproof laminate glass that is 3/16"" thick for added durability. Additional protection of the EOTech HOLO Sight 553.A65/1 SU-231/PEQ (M553) Night Vision compatible is provided with a ""roll bar"" ruggedized hood. 

The EOTech Weapon Sight M553 does not emit any muzzle side position revealing light signature...the projected reticle pattern is visible only to the operator of L3 Communications EOTECH 553. Even Gen III night vision equipment cannot detect muzzle side signature of the operator's position. All optical surfaces of EOTech HOLOgraphic Weapon Sight 553 are flat and treated with anti-reflective coatings eliminating additional muzzle side signature due to reflective glare. No need for costly glare elimination filters that reduce the effective light transmission and further dim the target area.

Good rifling bore has minor frosting from firing of blanks but is clean.  Very good muzzle measures ""1.""  Fully functional.  From some research this serial number is in a serial number range of rifles potentially issued to the USS Reina Mercedes which was a Spanish cruiser captured by the US in the Span-Am war and re-commissioned by the US Navy and used at USNA Annapolis.  Whether or not this particular rifle was indeed issued to this ship is speculation but it is in a serial number range of ID'd rifles FWIW.

Why settle for a pistol from a manufacturer that has copied Glock's design and construction (S&W M&P, Springfield XD, etc.), when you can own and rely on the original and best to protect you and your family?

This model is one of the most desirable pistols on the planet.  A great primary or backup carry weapon, gently used, in outstanding condition.  Sometimes called the ""Baby Glock"", chambered in the powerful S&W 40 caliber round.

This weapon has been fully disassembled, cleaned, inspected, lubricated and reassembled per Glock factory specifications and recommendations.

It is in excellent condition and the internal parts would pass for parts from a brand new weapon.

Features:
Standard Glock factory sights, ready for your tritium or fiber optic sights.
Glock Factory upgrade - extended slide release (installed by me during reassembly) - normally found on competition models.
Glock Factory 5 lb. trigger connector - trigger pull approximately 5.5 lbs.
The serial numbers match on the slide, barrel, and frame - as they should.

Purchase includes:
The complete Glock pistol described above.
One 9 round Glock Factory magazine.
Blackhawk! OWB hard plastic range/carry holster.

Notes about aesthetic condition:
Slight holster mark on right side of slide, toward muzzle.  Unnoticeable to most, but I'm meticulous, so I wanted to mention it.
Barrel - bore (lands and grooves of the rifling) and feed ramp are whiney and in perfect condition.
Picture shows no rear sight - a Glock Factory rear sight (U) has been installed (replaced).

Willing to entertain a discussion about trading for anything tactical or another firearm, but prefer $.

Can also install parts to enhance this pistol (Pearce mag extension, New York trigger spring, etc.) for you for additional $.  I can also permanently paint the slide stampings to create a truly unique weapon for you.

Will only sell this weapon to an individual that can legally own this firearm and holds a valid Georgia DL, concealed carry license preferred.  You will have to sign a bill of sale.  This protects you and me from the world's silliness!

Thanks for looking.  Please don't hesitate to email with questions."

Total production was 13,544 rifles. they are kinda hard to find making it a must for collectors. the gun shoot great and the rifling is perfect, the stock is also in great condition real wood. the problem with it is it started to get minor rust on the bolt and a little on the outside of the barrel. this is because it belonged to an old lady who kept it in her closet for a long time. the rust did not affect the rifle and it still shot great. i am sure there is a way of removing the rust. she is asking me to sell it. we are wanting $150 for this one. if it did not have the small amount of rust we would sell it for way more.

This gun is the most desirable chinese SKS. It was fully milled on original Russian machinery, as opposed to later models which feature a number of stamped parts. It also has a chrome lined barrel unlike the yugo's, and quality comparable to the much more expensive Russian SKS's, since it was originally made for the Chinese army, not American consumers. The gun is in great shape, especially for the age, and has never jammed or misfired. Super reliable. It will come with a collectable red jungle stock, as well as an aftermarket side folding pistol grip stock. It will also come with a hard case. May trade but would really rather sell.

Scout Sniper for many years and am offering my services to make your next Ghillie Suit! As the title says, these are made to order, completely custom to meet your needs!
