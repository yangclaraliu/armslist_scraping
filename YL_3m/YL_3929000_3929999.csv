The 5.45x39 Carbine Base 16"" Upper comes complete and ready to go onto any mil-spec AR 15 lower. This upper is built with the Adams Arms proprietary piston system.

Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surp ammo without fear of the parts being unduly worn out. Each upper also comes with a 30 round magazine and a Wolff extra power hammer spring to ignite the older hardened primers.

 Components are of premium quality. Premium Forged M4 receiver w/ feed ramps and laser cut Tmarks. The 4150 CMV steel 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided (SCARmor™ bore & exterior coating ) to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ QD flash suppressor. A 13.5"" Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron ( UCT EXO/ FailZero ) coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The custom 383K psi steel extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used and a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage.

About this item:

The M21 Reflex sight provides constant, all-light aiming capability, without batteries. Designed through close collaboration with Israeli Special Forces, the M21 was the first reflex sight in the world designed for close quarter combat. It is battle proven, reflexive to use, deadly accurate, and totally reliable. The M21 features a large 30mm diameter lens which allows rapid target acquisition with both eyes open. Reticle illumination is achieved by a protected fiber optic light collector system during the day, and by a miniature self-powered tritium light source at night. Transition between the two systems is instantaneous and automatic to assure good contrast between the aiming dot and the target area. The M21 is night vision compatible. This reflex sight offers shooters the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open. It is also designed to work with a magnifier. The M21 is the optic of choice for the Israeli Defense Forces. Bullseye Reticle Triangle Reticle X Reticle 4.3 MOA Reticle 5.5 MOA Reticle Always ready for action ‚ no batteries or switches. Reflexive, parallax-free aiming with both eyes open and focused on the target. Self-illumination adjusts to ambient light. Reticle designed to be visible under all conditions. Operates under all weather and temperature conditions. Large 30mm diameter lens with state-of-the-art coatings assures large FOV. Armored design for hard combat use.

This is a great option to shoot two great calibers, and do it without spending money on two uppers, and two optics.  The barrel can be changed in less than 2 minutes.  LMT is one of the best in the business, on par or better than any AR manufacturer.

- MRP upper new without the brake is $1250-$1400 (never fired)
- .300 blk barrel assemblyis $400 (never fired)
- LMT DI bolt and BCG (never fired)
- AAC muzzle devices is $100x3 (never fired)
- 12.5"" complete piston barrel and assembly w/ POF roller cam upgrades (fired for function) w/ piston LMT BCG are $750-$950 w/ upgrades
- Gas buster charging handle (for suppressed fire) new, $115

The only used item in this listing is the 12.5"" piston barrel assembly, it was upgraded with a POF rollercam upgrade which has significantly smoothed carrier travel. And the plug on the piston is not the standard plug it is the upgraded version, that is offered by LMT's, that is for suppressed and unsuppressed fire. The difference between the standard plug and the upgraded plug is the standard plug only has one side that is open for fire the other is closed. Where as with the suppressed and non-suppressed plug there are holes on both sides of the plug to better regulate gas flow for when you are running either non-suppressed or suppressed fire. (The piston configuration was used with my other MRP, ~120 rounds to function test it.)

Package as is value is easily $3k, I know I'm not going to get $3k so asking $2k cash, open to trades.  Going to put this on GB first, but thought I'd list locally first.

Comes with 3x configurations/barrels:
- 10.5"" .223/5.56 w/ AAC Brake
- 10.5"" .300 BLK w/ AAC Flash hider

I've had allot of inquires why I am selling...we had a son born in Sept with something called a congenitive diaphragramatic hernia. His chances of survival were 10% but happy to say he is still with us and doing great, hopefully 1-2 more months in the hospital then will be home. I am active military and tricare pays for allot, but not nearly all of it, this is why i'm selling. Even if you don't buy, if you read this do me a favor and drop a prayer for him.

These rifles sell at online auction sites for an average of $450, but I am selling it for $400.  This is the cheapest you will ever find a Yugo SKS in this condition, as these are a finite resource and will only go up in value. 


I also have a Sino Soviet SKS I would like to sell.  This rifle also has all matching serial numbers.  It was produced in China in the early 1950s with the help of the Soviets.  Unlike other Chinese SKS rifles, this one is made from all milled parts.  The gun is high quality and indestructible.  I am asking $350 for this rifle and this is the cheapest of any SKS in the entire lowcountry.

I love this rifle and I've had no issues with it, but I'm really wanting to build an SBR.  The Dissipator setup is somewhat rare, and it allows people with longer arms to stretch out on the rifle a bit better, plus it gives you a rifle length distance between the front and rear sights on a carbine length barrel for better accuracy.  

I zeroed the gun back in 2012 and have yet to touch the sights since.  I've shot nothing but 5.56 ammo through ranging from 50gr up to 70gr with not a single failure.  I've cleaned the gun thoroughly three times since 2012, and will clean once more before a sale is made.  Again, the ONLY reason I'm looking to sell is to begin my 11.5"" SBR build in the near future.  

I'm looking to get $1100 for the entire package listed above, or $950 for the rifle with everything minus the Vortex optic and the rear flip up sight.  I will provide a stock military carry handle sight if the optic and flip up stay with me."

Trijicon Bright & Tough Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock-resistant design. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil.

I have a Chinese SKS which is milled not stamped so it is higher quality than an AK. It is currently being converted to use AK mags. There is about an hours worth of work left to complete it. My gunsmith is not able to continue working on it at this time, so I figured I would try and get something worthwhile. It will fire single shot as it is. Additionally it has a spring loaded firing pin installed which fixes the bump fire issue. Comes using a Tapco stock, it will come with the original stock, and 80 rounds of ammo. The SKS is more accurate than the AK and can be even more so with a rear sight aperture that replaces the rear cover pin. I have only shot it about 50 times and performs great.

All that's left to be done is just a bit of grinding and sanding for the mag catch to be right on. Then you need to clear the part between the bolt and the mag release for the arch of the mag as you put it in, just like an AK. The mag as you are aware makes an arch when you put it in. It just needs a little grinding to clear that. And then have the release extended which is super easy. About an hours worth of work to finish it. I am not gunsmith inclined that is the only reason I am not doing it myself and just selling it. It currently shoots single shot. You can not use the original mag or the Tapco mag unless you want to undo some of the work."

I'm putting a feeler out there for this beautiful off-roster 1911. I'm not even 100% sure that I want to see this go but I am considering trades at the moment for other non-1911 type pistols. If I don't come across a captivating trade in a few days then I'll likely keep it.

The pistol is in excellent like-new condition with less than 250 rounds through it. This gun is extremely accurate; without a doubt the most accurate pistol i have ever owned even compared to my previous tack-driver, a 5"" PPQ M2. You will not be disappointed with how well this shoots. Why am I even trading it if I like it so much? I have no idea, I think I'm addicted to the thrill of catch & releasee. Also as much as I love the beauty of 1911's I'm finding myself to be more of a utilitarian when it comes to guns so I'm considering something simpler that holds more ammo.

Actually manufactured by Pinoneer Arms, In Radon, Poland...

Note: Folding Stock is permanently fixed, due to ATF regulations which classifies firearm as short barreled rifle if activated. There are kits to make the folding stock work, however legally one must pay a tax fee to the ATF of $200 dollars as I understand in order to make this a legal action!!! Unless buyer already has said authorization.

The PPS-43C, model of 1943; is an improved version of the Soviet Army’s PPSH-41, more compact and a better SMG for use by tank crews, mobile recon groups and paratroopers. This model, the PPS-43 was made between 1943 and 1946, after WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world and manufactured in those countries. The Polish model that we offer has been redesigned as a semi auto version and shoots from a closed bolt, it is ATF approved and made of all new parts of the famed Radom plant in Poland. The stock is permanently fixed in the folded position, thus the weapon is classified as a pistol, furnished with 2-35rd magazines."

The Marlin is a working firing gun. Wood is good but receiver has had bluing stripped and there's minor rust on barrel. Gun functions fine and is accurate, previous owner just gave it a hard 14 years. I feel my rifle is worth the trade but would like some ammo with yours since you get some with mine.

I should mention, if you don't like the set I have on the gun right now, you're going to get two other sets as well, being that Apex sends three sets when you purchase them as they're all different and have various trench art on them.

 DESCRIPTION

 At middle distance ranges (where field of view is ultimately more important than magnification) the Armasight 4X night vision rifle scope strikes just the right balance between the two.

 The Nemesis 4X has multicoated all-glass lenses and an internally adjustable fine reticle that makes precise shot placement incredibly easy. This night vision riflescope is also water, dust and sand proof for increased reliability. Complete with tactical rails for lasers or illuminators (high power IR illuminator included as standard), the Armasight Nemesis 4X is ideal for the predator hunter, tactical marksmen, or anyone that needs a compact, light medium range night vision rifle scope.

It was made in 1884, and is serial number 6XXX with a blued octagon barrel. All mechanics work well and the rifle still shoots well. The rifling is in decent shape, and the rifle is sound to shoot with the right ammo. I would put the finish on the rifle and internals at 60-70%."
