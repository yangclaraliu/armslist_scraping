This is part of my father's collection that he passed on to me.  I have the box, documentation, and original purchase receipts.  I am not an avid collector, but based on the rating guide in the Blue Book this is 98+%.  Only visible flaws are the ""drag lines"" of the barrel being revolved in handling, and a handful of very very minor scratch / scuffs, mostly on the right side of the barrel and one tiny mark on the left side.  You may barely be able to make them out in the pictures.  Consistent with a gun that has been just lovingly handled a dozen or so times over the last 30 years for inspections and cleanings.  Is this “mint” or “excellent”?  I’m not sure but it’s a damn pretty gun.  One of only 2200 manufactured according to my research.

I am not aware of it ever having been fired, but I believe that it has at least had some test shots fired through it (I took it for an evaluation at a gun shop years ago and they confirmed it has been fired).  I have had it for about 15 years and aside from admiring it once in a while have never fired it.  Stored always in a padded case inside an air conditioned environment.  It's really a beautiful gun.  

It appears that prices are “skyrocketing” (if you believe the posts) but I am offering this at ½ way between 98% ($2350) and 100% ($2650) of the BlueBook value, which appears to be “behind” on value.  I really hope someone will enjoy adding this to their collection.

I'm in Cary, North Carolina and can be reached at REDACTED or REDACTED.  I would strongly prefer a local sale.

Its everything you could want in an SBR and if you want a solid blued steel body with rich wood grips this THE one to have. I have a lot of real guns and let me tell you, this thing is basically a real one that just happens to shoot bb's, it even smells like the real deal and the stock is so solid you could probably use it to bash things/faces. It is wired for deans and includes 2x custom built elite 2/3a 1500mah nimh 10.8v sticks & smart charger and a modified upper handgun to accept the longer battery otherwise when running the short ak's you typically have to run a tiny battery. All the benefits of crisp trigger and fast rof without the lipo issues of bursting on semi, expensive chargers and batteries etc etc. Comes with 7x 150rd mid caps that fit like on the real steel version, snap in and ZERO play whatsoever. Also have a new bag of Goldenball .25 & Goldenball .28

I have well over $500 into this setup onop of the 2 months I had to wait to get it imported from overseas.

What your getting:
-gun box manual etc etc everything is BRAND NEW
-2x batts
-7x 150rd mags
-quality smart charger
-jdm bb's
-pride of ownership for such a rare gun

Some pics and a size comparo to my m4, Ive played airsoft for more than 10years and doing CQB the 74u is THE gun to have. Points, transitions and brings up way faster. Slap a suppressor on it with an extended barrel thru it and you have a great outdoor gun as well!

Beretta ARX 100 223 Rem 556NATO 16"" Black Side Folding 30Rd Flip Up Front and Rear JXR11B00
 Beretta is shipping the ARX 100 in 5.56. This is the civilian version of a battle rifle that’s currently in service in Italy and a handful of other countries. The rifle combines the operational familiarity of both the AR-15 platform and the AK platform into a versatile rifle that’s built for active service. Every detail of the gun is adaptable. Controls can be switched easily, without tools. Even the various calibers of barrels are interchangeable, on the fly. It is an impressive rifle. Beretta is calling the ARX 100 “The Ultimate Tactical Rifle.” 
Beretta ARX100! This model is chambered for 5.56/.223. It is a piston operated rifle, this means less maintenance and incredible reliability. The ARX100 was engineered with one purpose in mind: to be today’s best tactical semiauto rifle. It takes the concept of a modular rifle to futuristic levels, while maintaining an absolutely simple operation that make it ultra-reliable. With ambidextrous controls, easily-replaceable barrel and virtually endless possibilities for customization and accessorization, the ARX100 is adaptable to any firing scenario and is perfect for today’s most demanding tactical shooter. Ultimate Reliability and Ease of Maintenance The ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all. Ultimate Versatility This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction. Ultimate Accessorization The possibilities for accessorization on the ARX100 are limited only by the user’s imagination. It comes out of the box with a full-length Picatinny rail on top, which is perfect for attaching a variety of optics and other sighting systems. It also has Picatinny rails on both sides of and under the fore-end, which offer countless possibilities for easily adding lighting systems and other tactical devices.

 MFI Fake Suppressor for HK USP 9mm Tactical Threaded Barrels 1/2 X 28
The MFI Fake Suppressor for HK pistols are designed for real weapons. They will also fit replica & airsoft weapons with appropriate adapters. These do not suppress sound in any way and are 100% legal for the regular civilian to own in all 50 US States.
MFI Fake Suppressor means:
No $200.00 Tax Stamp
No special licence needed
No FBI background check needed
No wait 3-6 months for BATF transfer or approval
The MFI fake suppressors are made specifically to take the punishment from live fire! Unlike lesser quality mock silencers made for the HK pistols the MFI version allows the weapon to cycle without jamming!
FROM GG&G WEB SITE: There is little doubt that weapon mounted tactical flashlights are an all important accessory for urban combat. GG&G manufactures over 20 different tactical flashlight adapters and mounts for various weapon systems including the GG&G USP adapter. There is also little doubt that the HK USP handgun is one of the ten best handguns manufactured. Unfortunately, HK chose to manufacture the dust cover integral mounting rail to only accept the URL flashlight. Besides being very expensive, large and heavy, the URL lacks the flexibility to be mounted to other weapon systems. GG&G has engineered a HK compact flashlight mounting rail adapter for Streamlight TLR-1/2 , ITI M3/M6, All Viridian and Surefire flashlight or light/laser combos.
Our highly regarded design engineering staff developed an innovative and clever mount to interface the TLR-1 and 2, ITI M3/M6, All Viridian Surefire models and with the USP standard and compact handguns in a small and lightweight package. As can be seen in the photographs, the GG&G Slim Line USP Flashlight Mount fits tightly to the USP trigger guard allowing the TLR, M, Viridian and Surefire series rear rocker switches to be activated by the fire control finger or the thumb of the off hand. The Slim Line USP Flashlight Mount rail adapter is available for the full-size and compact USP handguns. The GG&G Slim Line USP HK Flashlight Mount consists of a three piece lightweight aluminum adapter that easily clamps over the existing USP light rails. The installation only requires a small wrench. The rail fits tight enough to retain zero of the light/laser. The GG&G Slim Line USP Flashlight Mount is machined from solid billet 6061 T6 aircraft-grade aluminum alloy using modern CNC machinery. It is then Type III hard-coat anodized matte black per mil-spec for combat durability.
FROM THE H&K FACTORY WEB SITE: Enhanced versions of the USP, the USP Tactical models are designed for users who need the features found on the HK Mark 23, but in a more compact pistol. Both pistols approach the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel, adjustable trigger, and adjustable target-type sights.
Features & System Characteristics:
Threaded barrel with polygonal bore profile
High profile target sights
Target sights with micrometer adjustment for windage and elevation
One piece machined, nitro-carburized steel slide
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Patented HK recoil reduction system
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever

Shooters Arms Manufacturing (SAM) M1911 Military. Full size 1911 with one 8-round magazine ($550), one 7-round Colt factory magazine ($35 - not pictured), WRB XMH holster with thumb break and magazine pouch ($30 - not pictured), zippered locking soft case ($19), rubber Hogue grips with finger grooves ($20), wood Hogue Sig Sauer grips ($50), 8 brand new 16 lb recoil springs ($75), a used .45 caliber cleaning kit ($12), 20 rounds of Federal Premium low recoil Hydra Shok ammo ($28), and an antique leather shoulder holster with built-in spring retention ($?).

I've put exactly 132 rounds through the pistol. The previous owner bought it and kept it new, but there's a little surface rust in the grip screw heads from replacing the grips. He also apparently dropped it so there's a ding on the front left side of the slide, and the left corner of the hammer and safety. Nothing which affects the mechanics of this gun. This is considered one of the best entry-level 1911's, and shoots excellent. Perfect if you're trying to decide if you want to go a 1911 route without paying for an expensive name, or looking for a project gun to test your gunsmithing skills on (not that it needs anything).

The previous owner told me the leather shoulder holster is from WWII, but there's no markings. It's in pretty rough shape. The holster needs some stitching and the shoulder strap is cracking or split in several places.

Price shown is for cash - trade value will be a little higher. I know funds are pretty tight for a lot of us right now, so while I prefer cash I'm open to trades, especially partial trades with a bit of cash. I would rather add ammo, mags, etc instead of cash if you have something I want that's worth significantly more, but I do have a little cash if needed for the perfect trade.

Do NOT ask what my bottom dollar is or if I still have this - I won't respond. And please don't send me any truly insulting offers. It's not a must-sell situation and I'm perfectly happy keeping this around, just looking for something I would use more, or a little cash for the kitty. Otherwise feel free to ask any questions you may have.

The Smith and Wesson Model 39 was the first U.S. designed double action (DA) semi-automatic pistol marketed in the United States. In 1949, Smith and Wesson began development of the Model 39 DA semi-auto in caliber 9x19mm Luger. Smith and Wesson began selling the Model 39 commercially in 1955. This is considered a first generation pistol. Since the Model 39 came out, S&W has continuously developed the design into its third generation pistols now on the market. First generation models use a 2 digit model number, second generation use 3 digits, and third generation models use 4 digits."

Piston operated, so virtually no clean up besides the adjustable gas block every once and a while. 16"" chrome lined heavy barrel.

But it is very sturdy and accurate and my plan was to use it Coyote hunting but the opportunity never struck. This is one of the better quality ARs you can get so I'm hoping it goes to a loving owner who will take care of it and not shoot crappy bulk ammo through it.

Also includes UTG 6in-9in tactical bipod. 

Has only a few hundred high quality rounds through it, mostly Hornady FMJ (my favorite rounds for the range). Had this gun for about 2 years and only get to shoot it maybe 3-4 times a year. It's in virtually mint condition. The only noticeable wear is on the buffer tube nut and a bit of brass coloration near the ejector port.

This gun has only had about 90 rounds put down the tube, and the only markings on the rifle are from the safety (which is par for any AK). The rifling is still very strong given the very small amount of use this gun has seen, so it is good to go without any modifications. The trigger has also been polished and refined so it is a very smooth pull and lighter than most AK's on the market. The trigger actually gives my Smith and Wesson AR15 a run for it's money. The receiver also has space for a double hook trigger group to be mounted as these slots are already cut into the frame.

Along with the rifle you will also get 2 steel 30 round magazines, 160 rounds of ammo with both FMJ and JHP, and an installed no-slip sling. I fired the 90 rounds one magazine at a time, and the rifle was cleaned after each range trip, even though that is not completely needed with an AK. I can be reached by clicking the contact seller button, or by text (preferred)/call to 770-549-596three. Let me know what you're offer is and we can talk from there."

I have for sale a Century Arms Polish Tantal ak-74 in 5.45x39mm. I bought this rifle about a year ago at a WAC show. Since owning it I have put zero rounds thru it  and it has sat in my closet. The previous owner put one mag thru it and put it away.   It is a TTLC serial numbered and from my research that means there is no key holing and it has the correct barrel.  It also means it is a newer build and built correctly (2008-2011 build).
included with this rifle is:
3 Bulgarian poly mags 
1 circle 21 mag
1 warsaw surplus mag
1 pro mag 40 round mag. Does not lock well probably needs sanding
180 rounds of 7n6 surplus (5.45X39MM)
Ak series owners manual
Small Rossi rifle bag with sling
AK sight adjustment tool ( if I can locate it)

Unfortunately it's too big for me. Skinny people problems. Out of the bag, but still have the tag. Price negotiable (if you travel to Lafayette and make my life easy).

Here's the description from US Palm website:

""The AK Attack Rack is for carrying 4 spare magazines in a quick donning and secure platform.  The magazine pockets are lined along the locking-lug end with a heavy polymer material designed to prolong the life of the pocket.  Shock cord retention provides the perfect blend between security and speedy access. 

The AKAR is constructed of 500d Cordura nylon, and utilizes made in the USA hardware and materials.  The AK Attack Rack was built to accommodate wearing over a plate carrier or other forms of soft armor, but is equally effective as a stand-alone chest rig. 

Built to the same rugged military spec’s as our higher end rigs, this rack system will last you for years of hard service in any of the conditions encountered by modern war fighters.  The 3rd Generation H-Harness provides for a flat mounting yet fully adjustable solution.  A 1” adjustable waist belt completes the rig."""

This is not a CMP build 308. This gun was assembled by myself.

The rifle is all USGI parts, most of the later 65 or 77 series parts, with the exception of the barrel. The barrel is a Criterion M1 Garand contour barrel with a 1:10 twist which should allow you to shoot any ammo from surplus to match with excellent accuracy. It is NOT chrome lined. I have been able to consistently paper 1 ¼ in groups and I am quite sure it is capable of shooting better than I can.

All USGI parts were hand selected and are either new old stock or newer parts well within acceptable tolerance. The stock is in excellent shape, again a USGI item with a nice DAS stamp. The rifle has fired for me without a single problem.

It has National Match front and rear sights and is an excellent shooting rifle. The trigger group has been tuned and polished to National Match standards by Master Gunsmith Jeff Shapiro. It also features an adjustable gas plug which will allow you to adjust gas blow back for any round you may be shooting. The receiver and op rod have been nicely laser engraved with the words “NATO 7.62 mm”

I am in Marysville and would prefer a face to face and I am willing to split driving if in a reasonable distance. If you adopt to do it by mail I will need a money order or bank check plus an FFL to send to. It is C&R eligible. SHIPPING COST WOULD NEED TO BE DETERMINED.

Recently got this bike as a project, first off, bike has a branded title from previous owner from a low-speed wreck. From what I gathered the rear tail fairing and front fender were replaced, but none of the front ones. Wheels were replaced. I just got new (used) forks from the same model, same year to replace the previous ones - could tell they were bent as the bike would pull while riding, rides great now! I have the stock headlight and headlight stay from the previous owner which I will include. Will also include the other forks if desired.

Tail section, new shocks, rear wheel and front fender are plasti-dipped flat black. Has brand new Dominator dual headlight, wired directly with a battery relay (extremely bright). New clutch lever assembly, new front led blinkers wired up and mounted beside the headlights. Bar end mirror. Full Yoshimura Exhaust. All electronics work, however tail light does not light up with brake compressed (but is pretty bright as is while running - could be as simple as a bulb I just haven't looked into it yet) and has F1 light, im assuming due to the Tachometer (revs to 6 and stays - speedo works fine). Just did a full oil change and plugs are next.

Bike is fuel injected, not carb'd. Has right around 32k miles.

Overall I'm not in a rush to sell it, just got it and enjoying riding thus far. Would like to trade for boomsticks mainly, cars, other motorcycles. Shoot me an offer. Not in a rush to get rid of this. Price somewhat flexible.

""There is a moron on here that thinks people will pay him to take their guns. Not only has he posted wondering why people will not give guns away for free but he keeps reposting the ad! After speaking with the man, he does not seem sane enough to even be able to own a firearm. Please help me keep idiots like this off the page by flagging it everytime it's posted (SIC).""

(The message is as follows -) Now you're clearly misinterpreting the individual's postings. I just hope that, for the sake of everyone, it's not being done with intent. Frankly, I agree with the user, who's posts I've come across twice now and who's posts have maintained roughly the same message - 'We don't give guns away for free.' Again, what you're either failing to comprehend or what has upset you; what the individual is trying to express is that, I'm not going to give you my firearm for nothing and you're certainly not going to give me yours.

I've been having to deal with all of the crooked, 'let's trade up' or 'this may be what I have and it may not' or 'how about you pay me more than retail for what I've done mishandled for years' or 'good luck after dealing with me,' backdoor dealers and wannabe salesmen and bamboozlers for some time now; and I have to say - there's a lot more bad to be found out there than good. I've been lied to in some shape or form, swindled and sold lemons on almost every single occasion. I've been ill-informed regarding chamberings. I've been sold 'like new in box' firearms that do not function. I've been on my way to meet people that I've never heard from again. I've had firearms blatantly sold out from under me. I've even been lied to about damages seen in pictures that supposedly didn't exist upon 'mint condition' handguns, where I've made the decision to purchase anyway after making the drive, and have got the proof that says otherwise on my hip - the proof that every abrasion, pitting and loss of finish pictured in the conveniently piss-grade photos is in fact not just a product of someone's new, unwieldy camera phone. Of course everyone wants to meet you in the parking lots of Wal-Mart or McDonald's (which I'm not sure isn't an infraction of the law) after dark, so you're surely not going to be testing anything out.

It would appear that the second market firearms trade is a niche that anyone looking to make a dishonest buck can get into. You really have to watch your back when it comes to laying your cards down against those who have no credentials to speak off and are only bonded by bullshit, i.e. your everyday wheeler dealer.

So with that being said, and in the name of dispelling your wild assertion as well as clearing up any further confusion on the behalf of others, I have to ask: exactly why wouldn't an honest individual stand up for his fellow enthusiasts by posing a question such as this? Furthermore, exactly what legitimate purpose is supposedly served by 'fishing in the dark,' as it is, seemingly looking to draw in and capitalize on the naive and uninformed? Or rather, as the person on trial so put it, ""Why is it when people post items for free, (and) you respond agreeing with their price
and even agree to pick it up, they go all ballistic on you? Don't put free if it's not free.""

Personally, I believe that a mandate requiring the inclusion of either an asking price, the fare allocated or at least an estimated value in each and every listing would better serve us all. Thank you for your time.

737,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3513737,For Sale/Trade:  PSA Amended,"Right outside of Camden, Cincinnati, Ohio",$ 0,"Listed On: Friday, September 19, 2014",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Sent to the anonymous purveyor of the following ad at eleven forty P.M. (EDT) on the eighteenth of September, 2014 -

""There is a moron on here that thinks people will pay him to take their guns. Not only has he posted wondering why people will not give guns away for free but he keeps reposting the ad! After speaking with the man, he does not seem sane enough to even be able to own a firearm. Please help me keep idiots like this off the page by flagging it everytime it's posted (SIC).""

(The message is as follows -) Now you're clearly misinterpreting the individual's postings. I just hope that, for the sake of everyone, it's not being done with intent. Frankly, I agree with the user, who's posts I've come across twice now and who's posts have maintained roughly the same message - 'We don't give guns away for free.' Again, what you're either failing to comprehend or what has upset you; what the individual is trying to express is that, I'm not going to give you my firearm for nothing and you're certainly not going to give me yours.

I've been having to deal with all of the crooked, 'let's trade up' or 'this may be what I have and it may not' or 'how about you pay me more than retail for what I've done mishandled for years' or 'good luck after dealing with me,' backdoor dealers and wannabe salesmen and bamboozlers for some time now; and I have to say - there's a lot more bad to be found out there than good. I've been lied to in some shape or form, swindled and sold lemons on almost every single occasion. I've been ill-informed regarding chamberings. I've been sold 'like new in box' firearms that do not function. I've been on my way to meet people that I've never heard from again. I've had firearms blatantly sold out from under me. I've even been lied to about damages seen in pictures that supposedly didn't exist upon 'mint condition' handguns, where I've made the decision to purchase anyway after making the drive, and have got the proof that says otherwise on my hip - the proof that every abrasion, pitting and loss of finish pictured in the conveniently piss-grade photos is in fact not just a product of someone's new, unwieldy camera phone. Of course everyone wants to meet you in the parking lots of Wal-Mart or McDonald's (which I'm not sure isn't an infraction of the law) after dark, so you're surely not going to be testing anything out.

It would appear that the second market firearms trade is a niche that anyone looking to make a dishonest buck can get into. You really have to watch your back when it comes to laying your cards down against those who have no credentials to speak off and are only bonded by bullshit, i.e. your everyday wheeler dealer.

So with that being said, and in the name of dispelling your wild assertion as well as clearing up any further confusion on the behalf of others, I have to ask: exactly why wouldn't an honest individual stand up for his fellow enthusiasts by posing a question such as this? Furthermore, exactly what legitimate purpose is supposedly served by 'fishing in the dark,' as it is, seemingly looking to draw in and capitalize on the naive and uninformed? Or rather, as the person on trial so put it, ""Why is it when people post items for free, (and) you respond agreeing with their price
and even agree to pick it up, they go all ballistic on you? Don't put free if it's not free.""

Personally, I believe that a mandate requiring the inclusion of either an asking price, the fare allocated or at least an estimated value in each and every listing would better serve us all. Thank you for your time.

It comes with a polished 3.5 lbs Ghost connector.

High vis sights.

Cerakote OD Green.

Extended mag release.

Stippled grip.

I bought this about 3 months ago along with 1000 rounds of 9mm ammo to practice with. My intent was to start shooting competitions. But this grip is just too small for my hands and as a result I keep shooting low and to the left. A friend of mine that shoots IDPA with a G34 can shoot the bullseye out with this gun , so it's not the gun it's me.

So, I want to sell it and get the Glock 41.

I've put about 300 rounds through it. No scratches, dings, blemishes, failure to feed or failure to fire.

I also have 700 rounds of 9mm target ammo that I would like to sell with it.

$650 for the G34 and $150 for the ammo. That's 21 cents a round. Or $750 for both.

The only trade I will consider is for the ammo. I will do a trade for factory 45cal. If we do that it wont be $150 dollars of 45cal ammo at 40 cents a round. Even trade at the going rate for both. But I prefer to sell this as a package and be done with it.

No phone calls please. I don't answer numbers that I don't recognize. I've had enough people pretending to be the IRS calling me and telling me that I owe them money and if I don't put $500 dollars on a green dot card they are going to come to my house and arrest me. Do I sound like I'm 90 years old? Okay, sorry about the rant :).

For sale is an original Whitney Wolverine .22lr pistol. This is NOT a $250 new production Olympic Arms model, this is an original from the late 1950s. They were produced in 1956 and 1957, and only ~13,000 were made. It functions flawlessly, is very comfortable to shoot, and is surprisingly accurate. I have the pistol, it's original factory magazine, and another original factory magazine. Numrich sells original magazines for $65.

I am asking $650 for the pistol, both magazines, and I'll throw in a 50 round box of CCI Standard. The only trades I am interested in for this pistol are certain variants of Finnish Mosin Nagants (M24s, M27s, M28s and M28-30s for the most part; I am not interested in M39s or Soviet Mosins) or British Martini Henry rifles.

It's still new in box, and has never been fired.  Comes with 1 magazine. Was for my wife, but we found the pink version of the same gun. It is common practice for others on ArmsList to sale guns that they have had issues with such as Failures to feed, Failures to Eject, stovepiping, ect. This one is still new in box and covered under warranty. You'll know it's history...

This is the most current generation of the TCP, i.e., the ""E"" series. I own the ""D"" series and carry and shoot it often.

Unlike the Kel Tec P3AT, the Ruger LCP, the DB380, and other .380 ACP pocket pistols in the same price point, the TCP has last round hold open. That is, after you fire the last shot, the slide will stay open making it easier for you to tell when the last shot is fired AND makes it easier and simpler to reload.

The reliability and fit and finish of the Taurus TCP is on pair if not better than it's competitors, but at a slightly lower price. That is why I chose it over all others. It's also made in the U.S.A.

PRICE IS FIRM. Must be 21 of age, VA ID, and sign Bill Of Sale.

WARNING- When you download 8.0 you will not be able to post pictures on Armslist. I have reported this to AppleCare, but I doubt any quick fix will come about.

Update:
Apple was able to duplicate the posting of an ad on Armslist in their own lab, and found the problem lies in the security safe guards they built into the IOS 8.0. These safe guards are probably a result of the nude photos that were uploaded to icloud a short while ago.
Anyway, the problem is not in your device, will they come out with a patch to fix it?? Depends on how many people file a complaint.
