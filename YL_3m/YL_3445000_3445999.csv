The Ruger Lightweight Compact Revolver (LCR) is a light, small-frame handgun with a smooth, easy-to-control trigger and highly manageable recoil. Its patent-pending polymer fire-control housing holds components in their proper dimensional relationships, reduces weight significantly and reduces recoil. An optimized friction-reducing cam results in a smooth, nonstacking trigger pull. The cylinder and barrel are supported by a monolithic, aerospace-grade aluminum frame treated with a black synergistic hard coat to reduce weight and enhance durability. The cylinder is strong 400 Series stainless steel, extensively fluted to reduce weight and is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s durable finish. Five-shot capacity.
Available: • LCR – Chambered in .38 Special+P and outfitted with a Hogue® Tamer™ grip to reduce perceived recoil. Integral U-notch rear sight. Replaceable, pinned, ramp-style front sight. MSRP $529 YOUR COST $405.  New in box. NO TEXTS. Call Ted @ REDACTED"

The same rifle used by Tom Sellack in ""Monte Walsh"" was restored by a company that is no longer in business...was it the same? 
 This rifle is in 98%. If you look down the wood you can see spots where it was sanded on during the restoration, saddleg has left the normal ring wear. 
 I have a letter from the Buffalo Bill Historic Center that states the rifle left the factory in 1895 as a Rifle, caliber 40/65 with an octagon barrel.  No other info was available for this rifle so it is not known when it was modified into its current configuration but is always worth the sum of it's parts.

At first glance you would think that the Colt 901 is just a .308 Win./7.62 NATO version of a standard AR-15, much like any other .308 AR out there, but it is a lot more than that. The Colt LE901-16S is a “Modular Carbine,” which means it can be adapted to any AR-15 platform upper. This isn’t a new concept, because there are of course a whole bunch of different caliber uppers for ARs. The difference is in all the other ones, they have adapted a standard size AR magazine to boutique calibers and cartridge designs. The Colt 901 is different. It can be adapted from .308/7.62, using standard P-Mags, to .223/5.56, using standard AR mags, and back again, in literally seconds. The design uses one proprietary part, and you have to swap out the recoil system. It is that simple, and it works fantastic."

English straight stock.

This gun was manufactured in 1986.  It is an 1100 model and takes ANY part that a Remington 1100 takes.  It is in 95 percent condition.  It has been fired very little and has a small inperfection in the right side of the barrel and a couple small spots on the stock.

It has very deep bluing and no rust or pitting.   It was Remingtons attempt at making a liwer grade 1100, before the express line of guns.  

I originally had it priced at $475.  I told 2 people I would take $400 , but both deals fell through. $400 is my bottom dollar.  The only trades I would consider are Henry lever action or pump action 22's or a browning lever action 22.  Maybe a 28 guage shotgun.  No handguns."

For those of you that offered to buy but live like 5 or more hours away, I'm truly sorry and wish I could do business with you. For those that offered less than $550, you either neglected to read/heed the description OR you're just trying to weasel your way into a better deal for you than what is already a great deal. I'm pretty sure that if you're willing to spend $500 then you should have no problem paying $550, or else you shouldn't be buying anything at all. Either way (to the weasels) it's your loss, even if you live nearby. I am a proud member of the gun community and I wish every gun owner had integrity.**

For sale is a like-new, full flat dark earth, Glock 26. I bought it brand new 2 weeks ago and shot a grand total of 100 rds through it. Just as one expects from a Glock: cycled flawlessly, zero failures, very accurate, just shoots period. Zero problems with the Glock 19 mags as well. 

I really don't want to let this one go but I have to. I would sell this ""as is"", which would be the gun, 3-10 round mags, speed loader, back straps, case, and of course the lock:) for $550, but I will also include one 15 rd mag with a mag case, a Vanguard 2 holster from Raven Concealment, and a Bladetech Ganyana-Lite knife. All for $550!

Please no trades and no offers for less than $550. This gun is basically brand new so please do not contact me if you're going to offer a penny less than the listed price. 

I live in Santa Rosa county but am willing to travel a little bit (no more than 2 hrs) to bring the gun to you, as long as you're legal to own one of course!

I have an almost brand new Glock 19 Gen 4 up for sale/trade.

This firearm includes a couple of  nice upgrades...

TruGlo night sights
Siderlock trigger (safety trigger for the Glock)
Houge rubber grip
Rubber sandpaper grips
LED tactical light (super bright)
(I've also filled the etching in with white...looks great!)
Also includes...
X3 15 Round clips and x1 31 Round  extended clip
Original hard case, lock, cleaning brush,  warranty card & all original paperwork
(Also includes x2 shells from original test rounds enclosed & documented in envelope)

I've only put a clip through this 19 (15 rounds)...I've just decided that I'd like to go with something a bit smaller. 

This piece is flawless...accurate and reliable.

I really hate to part with it...but I think I'd be comfortable with a smaller Glock... (26 or a 42)
Preferably a Gen 4 as well... (And some cash on your end for the upgrades on the 19)
I may consider selling if the offer strikes my interest... (no lowballers)

if interested, let me know...Thanks"

Its lightly used and in pretty good shape. Very accurate with minimal recoil, +P rated. This is the relatively rare six shot M856, not the M85; it is one of the very few 6 shot J frame sized .38 snubs out there. Easily pocket carriable which is a plus in the summer heat.

I'm interested in trading for a compact .40 handgun such as an M&P Shield .40 or Ruger SR40c, or similar. Really only interested in .40, but might also consider a Taurus PT92. Depending on what you have to trade or what comes with it I have a little bit of .38 ammo I could include, or maybe some cash.
