To avoid getting accused of scamming, if shipped, please purchase through my Etsy store:  https://www.etsy.com/listing/217883519/tactical-rifle-sling-quick-adjust-two?  

This is a tactical rifle sling made of mil-spec multicam webbing. I am very proud to be able to offer this quality item at a competitive price point. This sling is built to take a beating and keep performing. I designed and built this sling with durability, versatility, and ease of use in mind.

The features of this sling include:

Easily and quickly convertible from two point to one point sling using the sewn-in D-ring.

The front and rear ends of the sling use fastex buckles to attach the connection hardware. This allows you a quick way out of your sling if the need arises. This also allows you to add different connection hardware.

Your choice of hardware, from left to right: HK Spring Clips, Mash Hooks, or Webbing Connector with metal tri-glide hardware.

Fully adjustable: This sling will fit the slimmest of shooters all the way up to a big burly dude in full kit and body armor. There are two adjustment points. One tri glide on the rear of the sling is meant to size the sling to your body. The front end of the sling features a spring loaded cam buckle for quick adjustments. Simply pull down on the webbing to tighten, and pull up on the plate of the cam buckle to loosen. This quick adjustment will allow you to have the rifle tight to your body and then quickly let out enough slack to bring the weapon to the shooting position.

All webbing is sewn on an industrial sewing machine using size 92 bonded nylon thread. 

If this sling ever breaks, send it back for a free repair or replacement. 

If you have an idea for a custom sling in mind, please contact me for a quote. Options for custom slings include, but are not limited to: other connection hardware such as the Daniel Defense quick release, different webbing colors, adding a padded portion to the sling, and addition or removal of hardware."

I fired approximately 50 rounds through it before getting a guilty conscience.  I would put the condition as 99%, give or take ½ a percentage point.

I am a dealer and as such there is a background check and transfer paperwork. This must be done at my place of business in Appleton. I can't meet you someplace else or deliver as that would be ILLEGAL. Wisconsin has a 48 hour ""waiting period"" for handguns, so you would need to come back after that time to pick up your purchase. The 48 hour wait does not apply to longguns. All AR-15 recievers may only be sold to those over the age of 21 as they are readily made into pistols (question 18 on ATF form 4473). No exceptions

I also offer transfers from any online retailer and or any other FFL dealer. 
Long guns are $20
Handguns are $25

As it ships, the Sentry plate carrier package includes our Level III rifle rated Body Armor, MOLLE Chest Mounted Pistol Holster (Universal), Double M4/AR15 magazine pouch, and a Double Pistol mag pouch.
600D nylon construction nets a lightweight & slim, yet rugged backbone to your body armor system. Mesh internal lining improves airflow and adds comfort with minimal bulk.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*, except the Hunter Variant which comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle."

Ideal for Home Defense, Emergency Situations, Training/Carbine Courses, and Active Shooter/Rifle Threat situations. The AR500 Armor® Sentry Plate Carrier package is an all-inclusive rifle threat protection Body Armor solution. As it ships, the Sentry plate carrier package includes our Level III rifle rated Body Armor, MOLLE Chest Mounted Pistol Holster (Universal), Double M4/AR15 magazine pouch, and a Double Pistol mag pouch.
600D nylon construction nets a lightweight & slim, yet rugged backbone to your body armor system. Mesh internal lining improves airflow and adds comfort with minimal bulk. The Sentry Plate Carrier Package bypasses frills and includes all of the necessary basics such as adjustable padded shoulders, drag handle, hydration tube/radio guides, and quick release side buckles. All with minimal excess material resulting in less wasted space, bulk, and ultimately reducing unnecessary weight, heat signature, and improving comfort.
The Sentry Plate Carrier features ergonomic wide adjustable side straps with quick release buckles. The cummerbund-less design reduces bulk on the side of your carrier and helps improve airflow, at the cost of being incompatible with side plate body armor. Easier to don and doff, the quick release buckles are maneuvered with easy allowing you to gear up quickly in an emergency.
The AR500 Armor® Sentry Plate Carrier Package features everything you need with no frills offered at an affordable price point. Loaded with (2) AR500 Armor® Level III patent pending Advanced Shooters Cut 10” x 12” body armor plates, MOLLE Chest Mounted Pistol Holster (Right Hand Only, Universal wrap design fits Full Size to Sub Compacts), MOLLE Double M4/AR15 magazine pouch (4 mag capacity), and MOLLE Double universal pistol magazine pouch (2 mag capacity).

Ideal for Home Defense, Emergency Situations, Training/Carbine Courses, and Active Shooter/Rifle Threat situations. The AR500 Armor® Sentry Plate Carrier package is an all-inclusive rifle threat protection Body Armor solution. As it ships, the Sentry plate carrier package includes our Level III rifle rated Body Armor, MOLLE Chest Mounted Pistol Holster (Universal), Double M4/AR15 magazine pouch, and a Double Pistol mag pouch.
600D nylon construction nets a lightweight & slim, yet rugged backbone to your body armor system. Mesh internal lining improves airflow and adds comfort with minimal bulk. The Sentry Plate Carrier Package bypasses frills and includes all of the necessary basics such as adjustable padded shoulders, drag handle, hydration tube/radio guides, and quick release side buckles. All with minimal excess material resulting in less wasted space, bulk, and ultimately reducing unnecessary weight, heat signature, and improving comfort.
The Sentry Plate Carrier features ergonomic wide adjustable side straps with quick release buckles. The cummerbund-less design reduces bulk on the side of your carrier and helps improve airflow, at the cost of being incompatible with side plate body armor. Easier to don and doff, the quick release buckles are maneuvered with easy allowing you to gear up quickly in an emergency.
The AR500 Armor® Sentry Plate Carrier Package features everything you need with no frills offered at an affordable price point.

Paid $360 for it a couple months back. Will take $295 for it.  That's as cheap as your ever gonna get one. Also trades are more than welcome. Pictures show it next to a full size m&p.  Got more pics if needed."

926,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3902926,"For Sale:  KAHR CM9 PISTOL!  3"" BEAUTY!  9MM","Madison, Madison, Wisconsin",$ 399,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 3, 2015",Handguns,Kahr                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.
