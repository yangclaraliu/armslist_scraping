--Just because your AR-15 has optics and an after-market grip does not make it a ""custom"" rifle.
--Most of us know one Generation of Glock from another, but as a courtesy go ahead and provide that info.
--Another courtesy is to list the year of manufacture for your firearms.
--Most buyers need and want more than just ""Winchester 30-30"" in the description. Is it an XTR, Ranger, Commemorative? Year of manufacture?  Pre-64?
--Why are you asking more for your gun that what I can buy a new one for?
--A Llama 45ACP is not worth $450 no matter what you think.
--Know your AR-15 chambers. Is it .223 Rem, 5.56 NATO, or .223 Wylde?
--A 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 year old gun is not ""new"" whether it's been fired or not.
--Just because you built it does not make it worth more.
--Know the difference between ""rare"" and ""hard to find.""
--If you are charging more than 8 cents per round for 22LR, you are part of the problem and not part of the solution.  Same for more than 40 CPR for 5.56 and 45ACP, 30 CPR for 9MM...
--Is your FN Five seveN a MK2 or Mk1?  Know your Marks and Mods.
--Using ""pre-ban"" is really not necessary as there is no longer a ban in effect.

...and finally...A Glock costs $500 and comes with two mags (G3) or three mags (G4.)  Just because you pay tax and background fees does not mean you pass it along to buyers on Armslist.  More mags and ammo will get you more money, but remember, its a USED gun nonetheless--whether you fired it or not.  There really are no ""rare"" Glocks out there and ""custom"" work is questionable at best.  Good luck."

It comes with two 13 round magazines.  These magazines have been marked on the bases with glow-in-the-dark nail polish so that, if this is a night-stand gun, you can see your spare mag in total darkness.  It is in good shape and good working order.  If you have experienced a Double Action Only pistol and sworn that you would NEVER own one, this Sig will get you to rethink that position.  It has a smooth, consistent trigger pull and not one that will wear your hand out.  This it truly a great design.  The trigger group is the registered part of the gun.  You can change caliber including to .380, 9mm, .357 Sig, .40S&W and .45.  There are Subcompact, Compact and Full Size grips.  You can make any of these changes without changing serial numbers.  I am willing to ship this gun to an FFL at your expense, and must do so if you are an out of state buyer.  Do not contact me if you are not able to legally own this gun.  I am in Delaware during the day and can meet within a reasonable distance.  (What is reasonable is defined by whether or not you ask me to come off my asking price and if you are so inclined, buy multiple items)  To conclude a sale, I will need to see your driver's licence (to see your name and that you are from Ohio) and you will need to sign a bill of sale.  I will also furnish you with a bill of sale to show that you legally purchased the gun.  Again; Do Not Contact me if you are not able to legally own this gun.  If you wouldn't pass a NICS check, I can't sell to you.  Reply to me via this ad if you are interested and don't intend to low-ball me on the price. Don't offer to trade me Hi-Points or .22's.  I have stepped up from this gun and have no desire to trade down."

It is stamped 5.56 so you can shoot that or .223 from this weapon. Started off stock then I re did the whole body with Magpul furniture to include the MOE hand guard and vertical grip, the ACS friction lock stock, the MIAD pistol grip, the ASAP backplate/swivel sling mount, and the Magpul dynamics ASAP 2/1 point sling with the front anchor mount on the hand guard. It also has folding iron sights and a railed gas block and the ""izzy"" compensator/flash suppressor and the BCM gunfighter charging handle. The sight is an EOTech 516 which takes AA batteries and has the raised battery case so you can mount it as far forward as you wish. On the inside we have the Spike's Tactical Nickel-Boron bolt and bolt carrier group as well as the same brand and finish trigger group for a smooth feel and break. It is a self lubricating metal and I have never had to put a drop of CLP/lubricant inside when firing. It also is unbelievably simple to clean. The carbon does not stick to it the way it does to a normal phosphate coated bolt and is as simple as wiping it off with a cleaning rag. It also operated well in sandy conditions as there is no lubricant to mix with dirt/sand to gunk up the weapon. Dumped sand in the chamber, racked it, and it still blew through a whole mag like the dirt wasn't there. I bought the weapon new in 2012 and have been upgrading it as I went along. I am a prior service Marine and can say I wish that our weapons had the internals this thing does! A dealer put the value of the weapon at $1400, but it can be yours today for $1200!"

The Geissele Super Scar trigger is designed to only fit into the standard polymer trigger housing manufactured by FN. We do not recommend installing the Geissele Super Scar trigger into any aftermarket trigger housing. We have seen dimensional discrepancies and safety interface issues in the aftermarket trigger housing that do not allow our triggers to function properly and can produce an unsafe situation."

It has a 34"" ported barrel.  The butt-stock is very adjustable vertically and in cant.  The cheek-rest is also vertically and horizontally adjustable.  It really is a well made gun and has served my son well through his development as a trap shooter.  It's time for him to move up to something better.  This is not a bad gun, but he can't shoot doubles with it.  It comes with 2 choke tubes.  One is an extended Improved Modified tube and one non-extended Skeet (very open) tube.  I have the original cardboard box, but it's getting to be in rough shape.  It's a great gun for a beginning trap shooter and will do the job admirably for several years (until the kid asks for something REALLY expensive).  Right now, I have a brass bead on it, but was planning to put a fiber-optic sight on it.  If you want me to leave the bead alone, let me know.  I am in Delaware during the day.  I can drive to meet you.  How far I am willing to drive is in direct proportion to things like Asking Price and Number of Items Purchased.  What I am not willing to do, under any circumstances, is sell a gun to somebody who is not eligible to own one.  If you live outside of Ohio, I will have to ship to an FFL in your area at your expense and after I have received payment.  If none of this is done face to face, USPS money orders are a good way to protect both of us.  Money orders don't bounce, protecting me. If I accept money and don't provide merchandise, I'm guilty of mail fraud and the BATF would probably have something to say about it.  

Do not contact me and attempt to purchase this gun if you're not eligible to own it.  For a face to face transaction, I will need to see your driver's license to confirm that you are an Ohio resident and to confirm your name.  You will be asked to sign a receipt  showing that you bought the gun from me and I will sign a bill of sale showing that you legally obtained this gun from me.  I am willing to discuss trades, but no Hi-Points or .22's.  My son is moving up, so I am not interested in trading down."

Wondering what Hydrographics is?  Hydrographics is a method of applying printed designs to three-dimensional objects.  The hydrographic process can be used on metal, plastic, glass, hard woods, and various other materials. In the process, first the substrate piece to be printed is prepared/primed and a base coat material is applied. Second the pre-printed film with the graphic image to be transferred is then floated on the surface of a tank of water. An activator chemical is sprayed on the film to dissolve it into a liquid and activate a bonding agent. The piece is then lowered into the tank, through the floating ink layer, which wraps around and adheres to it.  After removing the piece from the water it is placed in a wash tank where all the excess material and residue is washed off.  Last, once the piece is dry a clear coat is applied to protect the design. With multiple dippings, hydrographics printing can achieve full 360° coverage of the part surface, including small crevices.

It is a Frigon Trap Combo and it fires Bottom Barrel First.  It fires the top barrel in sequence.  There is no barrel selector.  There is no ability to fire the top barrel first.  

There is a second single barrel.  It is a top single and there is the problem!  The gun was made as a top first firing gun, but was modified to fire bottom first.  Therefore, it doesn't really function as a combo.  As such it is being sold as an Over/Under.  Both barrels are ported.

9/8: If this gun doesn't sell this week, the ad will come down and the gun will be sent off to the gunsmith so it will fire top-first.  When it comes back, it will be sold as a combo and the price is going to nearly double.  Buy now and get a bargain or buy later and pay what it's worth.

It isn't perfect.  It has dings in the stock here and there, but it is a great shooting gun.   It points well and hits hard.  It's better than an entry level gun, but it lacks a few things that my son requires as his trap shooting progresses.  I am not interested in Hi-Points or .22's.

I just took this gun out on 10/4 and shot sporting clays.  Despite the O/U barrels being longer than most, it still allowed me to hit both birds.

10/24: Heard back from the gunsmith.  He finally got around to my gun and tells me that it's an easy (inexpensive) fix.  Unfortunately, he's backlogged and probably won't get to it until mid to late November.  If I get a buyer before he fixes it, they'll get a bargain.  Once he has it fixed, I will replace this ad and charge book value.  (if you've looked it up, you can see how much of a bargain this is."

I had bought this firearm a couple months back and I am the single owner,put in total about $660, gun was manufactured after the recall, not sent in. I have shot 220 (200 ball, 20 speer gold dot) rounds through it without a single hiccup and broken-in.   I am currently offering a one day sale for this Sunday, 8/17/14 from 11-4, due to my work schedule, so if you cant make it tomorrow, sorry. I have also added night sights, talon rubber grip, and a pearce grip extension that I had shaved down, to enhance the abilities of the gun and the shooter. I like to call it like it is, I know I would feel the same if I was buying, there is slight holster wear, though hard to see, besides that, the gun looks and shoots great. My package comes with the handgun, box and the original XD gear (holster and mag. holder), and 20 rounds of Corbon Pow'rball to get you all started! This gun is just a real nice shooter, functions flawlessly, sights line up and light up just fine, grippy due to the rubber, and with that extra shaved down pinkie extension, it not only shoots great, but looks the part too.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

The gun saw action in the 1979-1989 Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan and was obtained in Saudi Arabia in 1991 by a US service member stationed there during Desert Storm/Desert Shield and brought home under the radar. As such it is not import marked. The gun is in excellent functional condition mechanically with a bright bore with crisp rifling. Cosmetically, the gun has light battlefield wear to the bluing and very light micro-pitting on the slide from previous exposure to the elements. This is the real deal and not a surplus gun. Included with the gun is a Soviet Military holster, lanyard and cleaning rod that I tracked down from a gentleman in Kherson, Ukraine. He shipped it to me from Kherson with the Russians practically on his doorstep during the annexation of Crimea. I have the shipping box and the customs declaration form with it. Also included with the gun is a Soviet Medal Internationalist and the Afghan campaign medal awarded to Russian soldiers who participated in the Soviet invasion, complete with signed award documentation paperwork. To top it off, I have the gun in a custom Cold War Era presentation briefcase with Soviet insignia. I'll also throw in a Leningrad pin as a bonus. The gun has two spare Russian mags. I also have some aftermarket Makarov accessories such as additional mags, some ammo and grips that are non-collectible that I can throw in as well.

I would value this Soviet collection at around $1,500 - $1,800. I am entertaining trade offers in that approximate value range. It is currently listed on gunbroker as well:

My brother bought it new, and I believe that was in the early 1980's. I inherited it when he passed away. 

Serial number is N200XXX. It has a pinned barrel, and that mirror polished beautiful blue that S&W used to care enough to do. When I got the gun it was unfired. Brother liked to collect more than shoot. I have run 450 rounds of .38 special thru it. So 450 rounds in over 30 years. And it looks it. Condition is easily 99%+. 

This revolver has NEVER been modified or molested in any way. No hack trigger jobs, no lighter springs. Never even taken apart at all, Just shot, cleaned, and stored. I am more of a semi-auto lover, but this thing I have hung on to for years because it is so beautiful, and the action is so sweet. But now I have my sights set on a very badass AR-10, so selling things I don't absolutely have to have. 

It comes with original box, original newspaper clipping of the ad from Rocky Mountain News (Dave Cook I think, but can't swear to. Might have been Gart's), original warranty registration(never completed) and a S&W brochure on holster they were selling at the time. 

I also have a Crimson Trace laser grip for the gun, and a Hogue Monogrip I will throw in. I bought the laser grip thinking my wife might like to use the gun as a home defense weapon. But she found it too heavy. I guess an ""N"" frame is pretty stout, but that is what makes them so nice to shoot. No pleasing women though. 

Price is firm. I have seen lesser versions sell for this or more (Cabela's south this morning in fact), and they did not come with laser grips. As I said, I really love this revolver and don't have to sell. I would LIKE to sell just to spend a bunch more money on another toy. But can live with keeping it. 

Any questions, please just ask. And as far as meeting to show or sell, it will be in a public place where you are safe, and more importantly, I am safe. And all Colorado laws will be followed concerning transferring ownership. I hate it, but not going to jail just because our governor(soon to be ex) is a dumbass, among dumbasses. 

Only exception would be if the transfer happened to take place in a neighboring state that does not require background checks for private sales."

Google Gun Review:
The Charter Arms Undercover is a gun whose owners come hungry for self-defense, and leave satisfied that their attacker ate lead. Whatever else you can—or cannot—say about this mid-priced revolver, it’s one accurate gun of a son.

 But a recent experience with the Charter Arms Target Mag Pug left me wondering if a reasonably competent shooter equipped with any of Charter’s products could hit the broadside of a barn. I’m pleased to report that the Undercover is one of the most accurate .38s I’ve ever fired. The collection of dots in the target’s center (at twenty feet) was so well-gathered that Adam at American Firearms School challenged me to repeat the feat using double action. Only I’d already punched the paper in double action mode.

Thank You for Looking
