This is Surefire's newest tactical weapon light system launched at the NRA Convention in Indy.  It retails at $790 I was given one of the first available to do a soft review. This has been mounted on a pistol but never shot with it on. The Green Laser is incredibly bright and projects farther than most handgun caliber bullets will fly. The light is 500 lumens of blinding light with a very tight beam, and 1.5 hours of tactical runtime. The selector switch on bottom allows you to select the Light only, Laser only, both on, or both off. The thumb screw makes for easy on, easy off deployment, but can be locked down securely. This is THE top of the line Surefire Weapon Light System and feels great. Much lighter than it's predecessor, the X400 ULTRA GN is worth every penny.

Only this one comes with a threaded barrel, front cocking serrations on the slide, and the SRT Trigger System. The SRT (Short Reset Trigger) is designed to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent characteristics of the P239 are the result of “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols. The P239 tactical is available in 9mm."

139,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3063139,For Sale:  Headshot Tactical Customs-Clarification on the hate postings on me,"Hamilton, Cincinnati, Ohio","$ 10,000,000","Listed On: Thursday, May 15, 2014",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"To anyone who knows me, and all the loyal customs that have notified me of the 2 hate postings on armslist, I appreciate you taking the time and effort to give me support and state that you don't agree with those listings, it means a lot to me to know that people who have been to my shop and know me agree that those postings are false. I found out the poster has never been here before, has never spoken to me, and have no idea why he is mad enough to start ranting about me. Here are some facts-
I am a premium armslist vendor-this means I pay $200 a year to post ads here and armslist.com has a copy of my FFL on file and verified my shop so I'm a legitimate dealer. I paid this fee because it lets me post as many ads as I want and lets everyone looking know immediately that they won't get scammed and if they send me money I'm going to send them the correct item they paid for. 
I'm sorry I list a lot of guns on this site. I always pick the Dealer listings so people can easily skip over my ads by clicking the Private Party button. I thought by carrying a ton of guns, ammo, and accessories I was doing a good thing for all of us. I figure most people come here looking for guns, ammo, and accessories and the more I carry the better chance I have to stock something that someone wants. Does anyone think too many guns is a bad thing?

I'm a small dealer that runs my shop out of the garage next to my house. I paid big money to get the zoning changed to commercial, and get my FFL license, and take the risk of having everyone on the internet know where I live and approximately what I stock at my home. Take a look at the 12 or 13 pages of what I have listed up here for sale, and think that I still have a lot more than that here for sale. I mainly list guns, a few mags, and ammo on armslist but until you set foot in my shop you have no clue how much inventory I keep in stock. Everything from  hard to get parts, magazines, targets, lasers, lights, holsters, cleaning kits, night sights, triggers, stocks, grips, cases, range bags, and on and on that I paid for up front to have ready and available for anyone who makes the effort to come here. One guy in his garage that has everything from $250 revolvers to Springfield M1A Super Match rifles. I try to always keep the cool stuff that not many shops have in stock. SRM M1216 16-shot 12 gauge? I have 2 of those. Kel-Tec KSG's-2 of those two. You want an AR pistol but want something different? I'll usually build one for you while you wait. Think about How many other gun dealers can you call or text directly at almost any hour of the day or night? How many people online give a complete stranger their address and say come on over? All my prices are based off of what I paid and I generally am so broke I sell them at $20 over dealer cost for anyone willing to spend their cash here, I'm always willing to work with anybody. If I have a hard to get gun for sale at $1200, it's because I paid $1100 or more for it-but at least I have it here. 
I jump to take care of my customers. I've worked all night to get duty guns running for a LE officer that had to qualify the next day. I've ordered $3500 guns for people using my own money that never showed to pick them up-I'm not happy about it when it happens but it's the way things work and I move on. 
My shop lives and dies by word of mouth and it physically made me sick to see hate postings by someone I've never wronged or had dealings with and has no idea about me or how I am in the shop. If anyone has a problem with me selling too many guns on a website that is made for buying and selling guns please feel free to contact me directly and voice your opinion instead of just posting a rant up here that ruins my night. 
If you made it this far, I thank you for taking the time to hear me out. If you have any questions about me, feel free to call or text me at REDACTED or reply on here. I may take awhile if I'm busy but I'll get back to you. 

If you're that middle aged guy sitting in your mothers basement where you live randomly talking trash online, I hope you stub your toe really hard on momma's coffee table and it hurts for a good 5 minutes and you reflect on why you're such a jerk."

I have put about 400 rounds through it, and it has not had any failures.

It is a nice pistol, but I need to find something a little smaller.  Everything that came with the gun when I bought it will be included (i.e. the case, both 15 round magazines, cleaning rod and brush, and user manual).

I would prefer a FTF meeting at a local range, where the prospective buyer could try out the pistol before purchasing, should they so choose.

My eventual goal is to pick up a Ruger SR9c.  On the off-hand chance that someone has one and might be interested in a trade, let me know and we could work something out.  Thanks for looking."

 Trade wise I'm most interested in longer range builds, trying to get into a more accurate game rifle. If by chance someone has a .308 VEPR, I'm interested.

This gun is very hard to obtain right now and none of the retailers have them in stock.  Other people are asking 3k+ so my price is fair. This gun started as a Polish kit and was built with a US made receiver. Comes with 2 drum mags, a burlap pouch for each, a burlap bag for the gun, a sling, and two 100 round chains for ammo(no ammo though).  Don't waste my time with pawpaws old shotgun or your first 10/22.  Thanks for looking.  I can be reached at REDACTED or text REDACTED.  

""The RPD was the 1st belt-fed machine gun designed to fire in 7.62X39mm. The system was issued by the Soviet Army, China, North Korea and many others throughout the Eastern Bloc as well as Africa and S. America. The RPD was also used by U.S. SOF in Vietnam. These classic reproductions are true to form just as originally issued only in semiautomatic. They feature new U.S. made receivers, barrels and the proper 922R compliance components. One of the most battle tested and affordable belt-fed systems available. Each unit comes with its original field/deployment kit. This is a BATFE evaluated and approved semi-auto rifle. ""

 Springfield Armory SOCOM II rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

In these days of pricey ammo, more shooters are economizing with the vastly under-appreciated .22 LR cartridge. Here is a Sig Arms Mosquito, .22 LR Caliber pistol with 10 shot magazine, made exactly on the lines of its center fire siblings. This pistol is what we call a CPO, Certified Pre-Owned, factory refinished, and in Mint Condition. Manufacturer is SIG Sauer GmbH of Eckernförde, Germany, or its subcontractor. Importer and refinisher is Sig Sauer of Exeter, N.H. traditional double action, and its safety consists of an ambidextrous hammer block. Its action, then, is identical to the center fire Sigs complete with decocker, but it has an additional safety feature. It is furnished with one magazine. Factory Code is UDMOS-22-B. Here is what the factory says about the Mosquito: The Mosquito features a polymer frame, Picatinny Rail, and chambered in 22 LR. The slide features adjustable sights, fixed barrel, one 10 round factory Sig polymer magazine and superior ergonomic grip. Also internal locking device and ambidextrous safety. Factory specs are: Single and Double action semi-auto pistol, caliber .22 LR; 10 + 1 capacity; manual safety with decocker; composite grips; contrast 3-dot sights; 4 inch barrel; weight 24.7 oz empty; black matte Nitron finish. This pistol is a tactical trainer as well. Since .22 LR firearms have always resold better than anything else, this is an exceptional value in a genuine Sig Arms pistol. Retail pricing on these in our area, if a person can even find one, is $400 or more. We're offering the Mosquito in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 339.00. Transferable to eligible civilians in all jurisdictions of these United States. New York civilians are enjoined by state law from loading more than 7 rounds into a magazine.

Product Information, Features, and Specifications:

In addition to the advantages gained by the interchangeable barrel system of the 455 platform, the 455 Varmint features a heavier, stiffer barrel than its predecessors in the 452 and 453 lines. The 20.5” long, .866” diameter cylindrical barrel gives the 455 varmint an accuracy advantage across the wide variety of rimfire loads available today.
Any of the accessory barrels available for the 455 platform, including the American and Lux (open sights), as well as other varmint-weight barrels in .22 LR, .22 WMR or .17 HMR can be easily swapped out due to the larger universal barrel channel of the Varmint model. A 5 round magazine is included.
