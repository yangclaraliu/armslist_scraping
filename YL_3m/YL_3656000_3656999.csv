Unfortunately I own a recant suppressor and I decided I don't want to take off the handguard every time I want to use the QD on my can. I'm looking to get $325 USPS Money Order shipped or trade for a Noveske 10.5"" barrel kit in 300 Blackout.

This Advanced Armament Co (AAC) AR-15 Pistol Barrel Assembly is perfect for the shooter who wishes to build or convert an AR-15 to chamber the new 300 AAC Blackout round in order to take advantage of its unique ballistic characteristics. The barrel is finished inside and out with a highly durable and corrosion resistant Black Nitride, a treatment that produces an extremely hard, slick surface on the steel that resists carbon adhesion for easier cleaning and maintenance. The Nitride process converts the steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered with it due to the uneven application of chrome inside a barrel's bore.

The 9"" and 12.5"" barrel each feature a 1 in 7"" twist and is threaded 5/8""-24 at the muzzle. These barrels include the 51T Flash Hider designed to effectively eliminate muzzle flash and works in conjunction with AAC's improved ratchet mount sound suppressors. It utilizes a pistol length gas system and is compatible with most subsonic and supersonic ammunition, with or without a silencer in place. However, some subsonic ammunition may not always cycle reliably under adverse conditions or in a severely fouled firearm without a sound suppressor attached to provide extra backpressure. Barrel assembly includes a pistol gas tube, low profile steel gas block, barrel extension and locator pin. Requires barrel nut for installation (not included).

Trigger-job, laser, enhanced factory 3-dot sights, professionally broken-in (by me) with 250 self-defense rounds. It has been outfitted with them best possible practical options.  

The unmodified pistol retails for $369.99 at Cabela's (See  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Ruger-LC-NRA-Special-Edition-MM/1589189.uts ).

The factory double action trigger has been dramatically upgraded with a Galloway Precision trigger-job, making the  double-action trigger-pull reduced to about 5+ pounds, much smoother, without any stack, a shorter stroke, and a shorter reset.  The trigger usually sells for $110 WITHOUT labor; it is already installed (the installation is not simple, and Galloway charges $60 plus shipping to do it). Most CCW-holders consider the double action preferable because, especially under the stress of a self-defense engagement; it eliminates the extra memory and manipulation necessary to deactivate the external manual safety. All the new packaging, as well as all the original parts are included (See       http://gallowayprecision.com/ruger/lc9-and-lc380/35-percent-shorter-stroke-trigger-bar-for-ruger-lc9-lc380/ 
    ).

A LaserLyte CK-AMF9 laser has already been installed, and that installation is not completely simple. The laser retails for $116 without installation.  Original packaging and additional batteries are included  (See   http://www.laserlyte.com/products/ck-amf9 ).
$656 Minimum Value for $489.90! FANTASTIC DEAL!

The stock  three-dot sites  have been highlighted with GlowOn white  phospho-luminescent paint,making it a snap to visually pick-up the sight-picture!

Soft carry-case and all original goodies, including original box, are included! This is a real steal!!"

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for .22LR, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!"

Also includes the soft pistol bag, the carry holster pictured and your choice of ammo. I'll include 100 rounds of training ammo and one box of Hornady Critical Duty for you to carry with...

When Al Franken campaigned for office he stated that he is for the 2nd Amendment and would not vote for any gun control - HE LIED !!!

Al Franken has voted yes on all gun control measures including limiting magazines to 10 rounds, giving up our 2nd Amendment rights to the United Nations and supporting the assault rifle ban.

The only two detractors that keep me from listing it as mint are a very slight amount of thinning at the muzzle, and lack of the box and correct period target grips. It has some very nice figured later S&W target grips, but if the buyer prefers, I have a set of period diamond magna grips I can put on it. Included is a very nice vintage Safariland holster that has been with the gun since I acquired it, and a Blackhawk pistol case. Price id pretty firm, and NO TRADES ARE NEEDED!

It's shorter in height than the standard CZ75 for ease of carry and has a fantastic grip feel. It comes in the factory box with two magazines and all the paperwork CZ provides.

I've fired approximately 100 rounds and it worked fine. It's almost LNIB (Like New In Box), except for normal wear for operation.

The double action/single action is a great choice and is done well in this pistol. The first trigger pull is a little harder than my Gen4 Glock, but every other trigger pull is much easier - it feels like cheating. Also, this has a quality barrel and the slide sits inside the receiver rails instead of outside as other pistols have it - it makes for a very accurate pistol and a low barrel centerline. It's a fine pistol, just made for carry. 

I'm retired military, and this is better than what they gave me to carry on active duty.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation.A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. Gun comes new in the box with optional bullet button. And also the R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle."

Blowout price to move it.   I would NOT advise firing this weapon due to probable inability to handle the pressures of contemporary loads.  It DOES need two springs to fully operate which are a leaf spring for the trigger return and another leaf spring for the top break clasp that keeps the cylinder closed.  They are gone and will probably have to be made.  The holster is a vintage Hunter 1100 50 model.  The ammo is a FULL box of 1950's 44-40 and has been sealed for years. Ammo alone is worth 100. Gun will cock, etc., and fire double action after pushing the trigger back.  I will NOT ship under any circumstances.  I have a C&R FFL and will sign sales slip."

This type of pistol was originally created as a defense for cyclists against dog attacks in Europe.

This particular pistol was brought back from Europe by my dad at the conclusion of WWII.  I have not used the gun but it appears that the firing action works properly. The folding trigger allows for ease in getting pistol in and out of one’s pocket. I’m told that it was made in Belgium prior to WWII.  While it would be a challenge to find the original ammo I learned at a local gun show this week that it would be equivalent to Colt .32 short ammunition. 

As I attempted to show in the photos it has rust around the edges of the nicely checkered grip and on the back spine of the grip. It would be a darn handsome pistol if re-chromed. I can send additional  photos for more detail.

There is considerable information on the web regarding the history of this type of pistol and choices of ammo."
