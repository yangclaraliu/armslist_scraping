After the war the Soviets converted many of their snipers back into standard infantry rifles simply because they had too many sniper rifles and there was a high cost to maintaining the optics.

I got this one in part because of the uncommon MO /42 date (42 is the earliest known MO second date). 

While it is a '20s era Mosin with some neat and uncommon stamps, I do call this one the swamp rat. Some of the metal on the barrel shank and receiver had pitting that the soviets blued over during refurb, which gives it a very odd texture. The ""pitting"" is very shallow and does not in any way make the rifle dangerous or unsafe. It might be blood pitting, might not. Looks like there could be a pitted thumb print possibly on the rear sight. 

The rifle has likely seen some really hard times during the wars. The stock similarly looks as thought it's seen some tough times as the shellac is cracking, peeling and flaking. The wood itself is in good condition, just the shellac placed on the rifles during refurbishment is at issue. 

That being said, this one is so ugly it's beautiful but maybe you just have to really appreciate the Mosin to see it that way... This rifle was refurbed at the 5th Grau arsenal in Alatyr Russia.

I'm selling part of my Mosin Nagant M91\30 collection to help fund another interesting gun. Sales only to Washington residents, must show proof of age and sign a bill of sale stating your legally allowed to own a firearm."

I'm looking for some cheap 7.62x54r ammo. Mainly looking for surplus ammo. I can order it online for about $100 for a half case, but figured there may be some guys who bought a bunch of it and wouldn't mind selling some or even trading some for some ammo in other calibers. The amount I can buy will mainly depend on what you're asking on them, but I'm wanting to get a rather good amount for my 91/30.

I have switched over to a 1-4x. This a a great setup.

The setup goes for around 300$ from Primary Arms. I'm asking 200$ for all three. 

The magnifier is in an American Defense mount that flips to the side. The 3x was an external blem that I couldn't find a scratch on. As most of you know, Primary Arms really stands behind their products. The mount is solid, quick detach, and locks in place in either position and the extra eye relief means you aren't shooting nose to the charging handle (if this going on an AR) like you have to with many magnifiers.

The mount is like new, the magnifier is like new, and the red dot is in excellent condition. Feel free to ask any questions. Will ship for 5$."

The Scope mount comes with all the necessary hardware to mount it other than an allen wrench. Now, those are the average prices new, so i'm only asking $2,000.00 for the whole package. Some quick notes: one of the box magazines has rust on the bottom of it... I left the magazine in my car on humid night. The rifle has been sitting in my gun safe for a couple years collecting dust.. I've shot a few hundred rounds out of the barrel and to how much the previous owner used it is unknown. I will clean her up, but do not expect this to be cleaned to the sergeant majors standards. I am just being honest! It is a great deal and would love to get the cash, so I can begin my new project. The rifle is freaking awesome! I just want to be shooting farther more accurately. Feel free to call, text, or email me. I can respond with more pictures if necessary. I am in class from 9:00am-1:30pm please give me a call anytime other than that time.

Originally produced in 1924, completely refurbished by Yugoslavia in 1947 after WWII and put into storage for the “next big war.”  There was none, of course, so these basically new rifles were released to the surplus market.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly."

I had great intentions of building up some great loads and competing with it, but just don't have the time.  Also need some cash for a down payment on some property, so unfortunately, it needs to go to someone who will get some enjoyment out of it.  No trades.

Here's the specs:

Remington 700 Action
Bartlein #13 contour (Varmint/Sendero) barrel (1-8.5, 5R rifled, 26 inches)
Manners T-4a Stock w/ 1 AI magazine (chassis version
Jewell HVR Trigger)
Badger Base and Rings
SWFA SS HD 5-20X50 30mm scope (matte, mil quad, FFP, .1MRAD, side focus)
Badger Mini Tactical Bolt Knob

And here's what LRI did as part of their custom work:

Tier 1 Action Blueprint
Opened mount holes to 8-40
Thread bolt knob
Flute Bolt
Install heavy duty recoil lug
Chamber barrel in .260 Remington
Cerakote action and scope base in Burnt Bronze

I've got right at $4300 it it not counting the bolt knob and recoil lug.  The rifle is in near new condition as it's only been to the range twice.  Once to get the scope sighted in and once to try out a few loads.  Total of 46 rounds down the tube.  

I'm looking to get $3900 shipped to your FFL (must accept shipments from an individual) for the complete package.  Payment by USPS MO only (or check if you're willing to wait til it clears). Willing to drive a reasonable distance for a FTF transaction.  Brass and bullets available to buyer as well.

Edit:  If anyone's interested in parting it out, I'd be willing to do the following:

Barreled action, trigger, base:  1750

Model of 1950.
There is a touch of bluing wear on each side of the muzzle, and a slight scratch near the logo. But overall, the finish is excellent.
Very tight with a very smooth trigger. Slight turn line on the cylinder.
Generally, I would say it looks better in person. Sometimes the flash washes out the detail and luster. It had some plastic target grip on it when I acquired it, and some people who have shot it like those grips, but they feel too big to me. I recently spent $150 to get a nice set of period correct N frame magna grips.
This is a very collectible gun in excellent condition,  but I will say it probably could not be considered a true high end collectors piece, as I do not have the original box, tools or matching numbered grips. Those gun go for up to or over $2000, but mine is still a nice example of a very rare gun with an excellent original finish. The gun dates to 1955 or 56, and shoots great.  Probably the most accurate handgun I own. 6-1/2"" barrel. Target trigger shoe."

Our M4 Competition barrels offer the accuracy of a heavy barrel but the lighter weight approaching that of an M-4 ""pencil"" Profile.

The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with Black Nitride have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more expensive processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, Black Nitride gives better corrosion protection.

The rifle is not for sale.This is an improved Romanian wire side folding stock. If you are familiar with this type of stock you will know that it's downsides are the short length of pull and no cheekpiece for a proper cheek weld. I fabricated a curved cheekpiece that does not interfere with the operation of the rifle at all yet gives a very comfortable cheekweld. The other issue I addressed was the short length of pull. I extended the stock, added a longer buttplate, and installed a 1"" thick recoil pad. The original stock had a rubber bumper intalled in the top of the buttplate to cushion and quiet the stock when it was folded. I relieved the new buttplate to achieve the same result. I also inletted the top of the block that bolts into the rear of the receiver to allow the installation of a Krebs Kustoms AK scope rail. It does not affect the operation or integrity of the stock if you have no desire to install a krebs rail.  the inletting is done underneath of the receiver trunion tang. I then duracoated the stock in magpul's flat dark earth. Very nice stock. I decided to go a different direction with my AK or I would not be selling it.

The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with Black Nitride have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more expensive processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, Black Nitride gives better corrosion protection.
