Looking for 9mm of the same value. 100 round federal are $26 and 50 rd pack a little over $14. Understood other ammo is a little more.. some a shade less.

I used the same store comparative prices to make the comparison. excluded tax from both.

.47 cents  a round for the 556 traded at  .28 1/2 cents a round for 9mm (off setting and averaging) this is simply going to be the exchange rate. Slightly but not much in your favor depending on brand and where you bought them.(remember tax is not included in your end either)

mostly looking for 9mm.. the only other possible interest i would have is 22lr,45acp and 10mm. I will work in any balance of the ammo.. but please keep 9mm the focus

I am driving from big rapids to midland tomorrow (friday)... will meet along somewhere of m20 (feel free to mapquest the route to see where you could meet)

Preban Colt sporter complete lower receiver *mint* includes offset front takedown screw adapter so you can attach any modern upper and the stock big pin incase you want to buy the original sporter upper for it. I will have a Date of Manufacture letter from Colt about a week.

For those confused about preban and why they are valuable. Here in the state of Massachusetts we have an assault weapons ban to contend with. If you have a newly manufactured rifle you can't have things like an flash hider , you have to have a muzzle break or compensator pined and welded on, you can't have a collapsible butt stock or bayonet lug but if the lower receiver was manufactured before 1994 it is grandfathered in and you can have all of those evil features that you can't have on a post ban rifle."

SIG engineers designed the SRT to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting."

1. 91/30 ischevek dated 1942 good bore great shooter comes with ammo sleeve, bayonet, oiler, cleaning kit and tools. Purchased from a shop and was told it was the A grade mosin and compared to most other 91/30s it is in amazing shape price is 200
2. Is a 1926 hex receiver mosin that has been sporterized to a shorter barrel length and re-crowned with a after market front sight. While being modified the bolt handle was bent but i haven't tried but i presume further work would be needed for a scope to be mounted to the receiver. Bore is dark but very accurate and incredibly fun to shoot. Price is 250
3. A Chinese type 53 dated to 1956 i believe and like the rest it is also a great shooter with a good bore price is 200
I am willing to sell all at 600 and also have ammo that can be sold with the purchase of 1 or all of the rifles i have 410 surplus rounds of which 240 are loaded onto ww2 Russian tula stripper clips ( feed much better than the new ones that sell for 5 for 10 bucks) all the ammo is 147 grain aside from 25 rounds that are 180 grain ww2 surplus, the ammo can be sold for an additional 150. I will sell the package as a whole at 700 or best offer. If your interested or want more info please feel free to call or text me at REDACTED and i can text more pictures i wanted. And to get it out of the way the buyer must be legal to own and will need a valid Washington id to fill out two bill of sales (one for me one for you). Also willing to trade for either an ar or ak with cash on my end for the right deal, and i am open to all good sounding trades, just ask worst i can say is no thanks!"

The gun has little wear on the slide release, and it's been carried. I bought the gun in February from cabelas and the gun has a test shot date of December 12, 2013. I have some money into this gun and I'm obviously asking less than what I paid for because even though I put 150 rounds through it, I know it's used. I'm asking maybe $750 for it all. I have $200 invested in holsters and $100 in night sights. If I'm asking too much, shoot me a reasonable offer.
Thanks for looking.

Hogue grips are currently attached, but it also comes with original wood grips. Hammer spring is 24lbs, trigger spring is original spec. Trigger pull is an excellent clean break at about 3.5-4lbs.

Or, if you have something incredibly interesting to trade, I can throw the ammo in as well, or you can add in some cash for the difference in trade.

I have less than 700 rounds through it.  I also added a Wilson Combat magwell which also replaced the plastic back strap for a steel checked one.  It has tan G10 grips on it right now, but it also comes with the original black rubber grips.  It comes with all the original paper work, case, and misc.  It will come with three mags and a blackhawk serpa holster.  I also have an Insight M6 and Blade-Tech holster to accommodate a fulll size 1911 w/ m6 for an extra 200. I am also selling other pistols and rifles.

Hey everyone,
I have up for trade or sale a really old H&R .32 double action revolver. It is named “The American Double Action Revolver” and has a mid range 4 digit serial number (really old). I actually had this at the range yesterday and it shot great in single action and double action. The cylinder itself spins freely when not cocked, when cocked it locks up as it should and I didn’t notice any spray coming out from the rounds I shot. This is a really old firearm so definitely expect it to be as such. Yes it has heavy finish wear, but it still is a awesome little gun to have and plink with. I would also consider trades for derringer pistols (like 38, 9mm, etc) or just cash. For any questions or offers or more specific questions just shoot me a text at REDACTED and I’ll respond ASAP. I based the pricing on roughly what I am seeing elsewhere and then I priced it lower than them. I am not firm, so just make an offer!
Thanks and happy shooting!"

It is in good cosmetic shape inside and out (especially for the year). It runs and drives good; the breaks work. The roof does not leak and has been triple-coated with a quality elastomeric roof sealant within the past year.

*The generator does work and will power the 'hotel', but it needs a new fuel pump. I can get it going with starter fluid, or by forcing fuel in. It's a simple fix, but I don't have a ton of time these days. I can show that it runs when you take a look.

*The water line was hooked straight up to the house (too much pressure) and cracked the incoming water line. This is another simple fix (cutting the cracked part and gluing in another section of pipe).

*The fridge does not work when plugged into the house. It probably works fine with propane still but the tank needs to be filled to find out. I think there is a wire short issue that is causing the problem.

*The AC, heater, stove, shower, toilet, lights, and outlets work.


It's a great roof over your head/place to stay when you're temporarily staying at the in-laws. It needs a few EASY fixes, but it worked fine for what I needed it for (a portable bedroom).

Hey everyone, 
I have up for trade or sale a Phoenix Arms HP22 22lr pistol. It come with both the factory short barrel and a blued finish longer target barrel. It also comes with 3 magazines one of which has the pinky extension on it. This also will come with a small leather holster that seems to fit this gun perfectly. This gun shoot fine and would be a great deep conceal pocket pistol or cheap plinking gun. This is used and does have dings and wear, so please dont expect a new gun for this price. I would also consider trades for derringer type pistols in 38, 9mm, etc or any other firearm really. Would also consider trades for large lots of 45, 38, or 357 ammo. Just shoot me a message, worst I can say is no! Also, the previous owner put some epoxy on the grip (seen in the picture) to use as a thumb rest. It actually works decent, just not the prettiest thing around haha. Even if you hate the look you can get new grips in almost every color for $15 online. Just shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there."

Hey everyone, usually I only run across 22lr ammo but this time I found a good deal on 22mag ammo so I snagged it for on here. Its not as cheap as they run in stores (when and if you can even find it), but its cheaper than I’ve seen most other places and even online with shipping and in a higher quantity than I’ve seen in a while. Just like with the 22lr, prices are what I paid with shipping and as such are firm and are for pickup in Norman only. I would also consider trades rd-rd for 45 auto or 357 mag. Open to others too (357 sig, 6.5x55 swede, 44mag, 38spl, 25, etc) just not in as large of a quantity. Will trade value for value either way. Reloadable casings only. Honestly, I’m open to most, just shoot me a text or a pm and we can figure something out. Not trying to get ahead here, just come out with everyone feeling like they got what they needed and can use. Would also trade towards a larger bore derringer (38, 9mm, 357 mag, etc) like cobra or Davis. Would also trade towards other guns as well. Just shoot me an offer. For the right trade offer I can include cash or other items on my end to even it out, but it would have to be a really good trade. Worst I can say is no! Here is what I have:

-10X 50rd boxes of Fiocchi Performance Shooting Dynamics 22wmr/mag/magnum 40gr JHP- $22 each

They are all new and sealed (aside from maybe a few cracks in the plastic holder from shipment). Again, these are pickup in Norman only and my cell is REDACTED if you would like to grab some. Also, there's no quantity limit, so if you want to buy them all I'm fine with that. I will not hold for extended periods of time, been burned way too many times."

The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm. The Daniel Defense, v5-300 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

The finish looks really good all over, but of course there is some finish missing where you work the action from normal use.  Whether you want to feel like the Terminator or take on Velociraptors, this is the shotgun for any occasion, it's been used in hundreds of movies and video games.  From researching, there are about 1,800 SPAS 12 shotguns that made it into the U.S. before the ban, so I guess you could say it is somewhat rare.  This one has all of the must haves for a SPAS 12, it has the folding stock, the coss-bolt safety and the ""hook"", which is a carry handle that can be rotated for one handed shooting or taken off completely.  I had no intention of selling or trading this ""any occasion tool"", but I really want a SCAR 16 or 17 (FDE preferred,but not a must), so it's up on the block now!

FN SCAR 16 or 17 
Vortex vmx-3t magnifiers in new to excellent condition 
Vepr 7.62x54 or .308 with barrel 20.5""-23"", maybe another PSL
Quality uppers or complete rifles in 5.56 or 7.62x39 or a .50 Beowulf or .450 Bushmaster would be cool. 
Colts 
FAL 308/7.62
AR-10 
Sig 556 or 556r piston models ( only the newer model with the upgrades and bugs worked out)
Will consider several quality stripped AR lowers. 
Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails
AK-47 rifles like Norinco Mak-90, Arsenal or Saiga converted model or not converted, I can convert myself easily.
Saiga 12 unconverted, may consider other calibers too if unconverted or converted if a good deal.
Beretta 92FS INOX, Brigadier, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites 
Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models.
XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred. 
Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be a good one. 
Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifiers in the 3x-7x power, looking to finish off several rifle projects, so if you have multiples let me know.  Maybe 1-4x like the Burris set up with Fast Fire red dot on top, maybe the Burris MTAC 1.5-6x40mm or other 1-6x optics.
Maybe more revolvers, Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39,
.308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everything, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

From Wiki: 
The .223 Wylde is a proprietary rifle cartridge chamber with the external dimensions and lead angle as found in the military 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and the 0.2240 inch freebore diameter as found in the civilian SAAMI .223 Remington cartridge. Rifles with a .223 Wylde chamber will typically accept both .223 Remington and externally slightly larger 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition.[1]

The .223 Wylde hybrid chamber was designed by Bill Wylde of Greenup, IL to exploit the accuracy advantages of the .223 Remington chambering without pressure problems or compromising the functional reliability of (semi) automatic weapons like the AR-15 family when using 5.56×45mm NATO military ammunition.[2] Coincidentally, it shoots the relatively long and heavy 80-grain (5.18 g) bullets commonly used in the sport of Highpower Rifle Competition very well and is one of the preferred chambers for that use. The Wylde chamber is used by a few rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers."

I would prefer either the 1 1/8or 1 5/8 barrel . Just let me know what you have. I'll be buying it after June 2nd so not in too much of a hurry.
I've got a ar-15 lower I'd be willing to trade as well and I'd pay extra for some ammo to go along with it.
I'd love to buy some ammo with the gun too since is hard to come by.
I go back and forth between Fort Collins and Brighton. I'd prefer to do the transfer at Kopp's tactical in Brighton but I'd be willing to meet any where from Fort Collins to Denver.

Tired of being flagged for misunderstood reasons.

Up for grabs is my highly customized Saiga 12
Here are the specs and what it comes with.

The Saiga 12 to start features a dual recoil stock adapter tube and stock itself both from mako. Making recoil even with slugs minimal. Cheek riser is also on the stock. Moving up I have a chaos extended quad rail that goes all the way back over the dust cover. Great brand. On the quad rail we have an eotech 512 that also has customer made lens flip covers. Mbus gen 2 flip up sites. Klarus tactical 880 lumen light. Kryptonite k15 battle ready laser. As well as rail covers and a solid adjustable for end grip. The barrel shroud and muzzle brake combo was custom made and ordered through alumalite and features a brake that is perfect for this weapon. It was professionally converted by sniper co here in fort Wayne. Trigger guard. Mag release extension and safety extension all aftermarket. Comfortable pistol grip. Two sling pins. Now to move onto the internals. Everything was replaced or worked on. Trigger has been upgraded to match specs and polished. The entire bolt carrier and bolt were upgraded and polished. Tromix firing pin. Tom Cole op rod. All aftermarket gas adjusters and pics. Gas holes has been bored out to proper specs. The recoil system has been completely redone by jt engineering. Buffers and polishing galore. Also features the Pauly piston canted charging handle welded on in place of the original charger.

The wait time on the internals to get done took 9 months. The guy who did the work ""glassbolt"" best in the business according to the Saiga forums. Has closed his doors and is no longer offering his services.

On top of all that the entire gun was DURACOATED urban camo. All done by hand and took 3 weeks to completely paint and finish.

All the magazines 11 in total were also painted to match. Very expensive to duracoat everything in this design. I have one 20 round drum and a 12 round mag included. The rest are 10 rounders and one 5 rounder.

On top of all that I have 500 rounds of buck shot 00 and 4 to go with it all.
Two ammo cans. Very nice rifle case. And a blue filter for the light. Bandoliers and belts.

First, starting from one end to the other, we have a Magpul adjustable and locking buttstock, followed by a Magpul MBUS (not pictured), with a Magpul pistol grip, and lastly for Magpul the magazines, comes with 3 windowed, Gen 3 PMAG's.

Then we have the fore end of the rifle which has an 11"" Troy battle rail, with the concealed flip up front sight post, and then lastly for the rifle is the muzzle break. It's a nightforce flash suppressing muzzle break. This rifle has served me well, it's rarely been shot for the fact that I am more of an AK guy than an AR guy. The deal will come with around/about 800 rounds of .223/5.56x45 roughly, I believe its more than that but who's counting. I'm sure I have more accessories such as laser, and more mags for it that I'll throw into the deal. It will come with the grenades that I have for it. I'm not splitting this up.
