One of the conclusions from the war, particularly relevant to the small arms industry, was that the battle had moved from open field conflicts to close-quarters engagements – and there was a need for a seamless transition from daylight to nighttime capability on a single mission. Out of this understanding, and after more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts. The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. Rifle package comes with 1-30 round magazine, lock and cleaning kit. • Bullpup configuration; short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy • Mil-Spec , chrome lined, cold-hammer forged CrMoV barrel, 6 groove 1:7 RH twist • Optional 9mm Parabellum conversion kit with CHF barrel, 1:10 twist, CrMoV steel • Optional 5.45x39mm conversion kit with CHF CrMoV barrel, 1:7½ twist, chrome lined • 100% ambidextrous configuration and operation with optional left hand bolts for 5.56 NATO and 5.45x39mm • Integral folding adjustable backup iron sights with Tritium front post (flat top models only) • Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles • Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies • Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR®SAR parts • Mil-Std bayonet lug on 18"" barreled models • Uses standard AR-15/M16 magazines • Last round hold open on empty magazine • All metal parts are treated for corrosion resistance • Integral rubber recoil pad • Assembled in the US from Israeli and US manufactured parts • Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use • Clean, long stroke piston operation • Body constructed of high-strength impact modified polymer"

This is all either fired or brand new brass - no loaded ammo.  Most of the stock (except for some bulk range brass) has been polished, most with SS pins so it looks like new. All brass is guaranteed and individually inspected before it is shipped.  

And to be very clear, I am not selling the entire batch.  You can buy 10 cases or 1000 cases or whatever you want."

Weighing less than 14 ounces and with a barrel length of just 2.75 inches, Kimber Micro .380 ACP pistols are easy to carry and conceal, great looking and powerful. Chambered in .380 ACP, the Kimber Micro Carry STS gives you 6+1 or 7+1 capacity with the extended magazine. Built with Kimber quality, this miniature 1911 gives you the best of everything, power, conceal-ability and reliable performance. 
Slides on the Stainless Steel model as well as all Micro barrels are machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory.
Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.

Taurus’ new Millennium PT145 is a pocket-size, extremely lightweight double-action-only autoloader in .45 ACP that weighs a mere 22.6 ounces. It joins Taurus’ family of ultra-compact personal-defense Millennium autoloaders.

The Model PT145 features a 10-round magazine capacity for 10+1 firepower, but the most central feature of the gun is its rugged recoil-operated action instead of the simple blowback mechanisms found on many other pocket-size pistols.

1993 production Ruger P89, with nice leather OWB holster, 220 rounds 9mm ( 200fmj, 20 Gold dots) 1 mag, and nice M&P softcase.

After many years of owning this Ruger it is time to let it go. It has wear on it like all old duty/daily use weapons will. It has finish wear etc nothing major though. It fires just like it was brand new and is still very accurate. Decocker works great on it etc. Bore is still nice and shiny with great rifling. In all honesty it probably has only had 500 rounds through it over the years. Mainly for qualifying and practice etc.

Looking for other used duty guns etc in trade. May take other HANDGUNS ONLY in trade. Would prefer to sell though for $325"

Ammo Manufacturer - Military Ballistics Industries
Bullets - 230 grain full metal jacket (FMJ)
Ammo Casings - Boxer primed once-fired brass Note: This ammunition is manufactured at a more cost effective price through the use of Small Pistol Primers

This MBI 45 ACP ammunition is geared towards cost conscious customers who are seeking a great value for high volume range training and target practice.

 MBI ammunition realized a need in the marketplace for more cost effective range ammunition for high volume, serious shooters. They have answered the call through this new line of 45 Auto ammunition which features once-fired brass that has a small pistol primer pocket. For years, many of the lead-free 45 ACP cartridges have been loaded with small pistol primers instead of the customary large pistol primer. In recent times, Blazer Brass (owned and operated by ATK) and some other major manufacturers have started loading their standard 45 ACP ammo with small pistol primers to help keep costs down. This ammunition functions great and through the use of the more cost effective primer, it is available at a lower price point.

 This product is not just remanufactured ammunition. It is “precision” remanufactured ammunition for the serious shooter. The fact that it costs less than most new ammunition is simply an added benefit."

The VZ58 is a piston operated 7.62x39 chambered weapon that served as the Czech's little FU to the Russians when they pushed their ComBloc influence on the superior Czech arms industry in the mid 1950s. The design looks externally like an AK, but the guts and balance are absolutely not. As a NON-AK fan who wanted to shoot Russian ammo, I got one last year. I have put three magazines through it, cleaned it, and put it away. Since I'm moving in a couple of months, I'm letting go of... personal surplus. I've got ARs in 3 calibers now, so I'll probably end up with another one in 7.62x39. You can have my intermediate gun.

Comes with:

    Milled US manufactured Receiver, US made barrel, Czech ""beaver-barf"" handguards and grip.
    A starter pack of 5 x 30 round magazines, this weird Sheep suede freedom fighter pouch to tote 4 of them, a leather sheath for the removable bayonet, and a cleaning kit.
    I hate shooting folding stock steel rods that punch me in the face and don't allow a cheek weld - so I have a super cool-guy ""custom"" paracord cheek protector woven on there - Save your face... use the paracord as a cheek brace.
    This thing is a solid 16 oz lighter than an AK, and folds to fit under the seat of your station wagon. Shoots ""internet sub-MOA"" w/ surplus ammo per forum tards - and real world minute-of-man (or hog) at 200-300 yards per every real person's experience. 

I keep seeing that there are cool prices on this rifle, but no one has them in stock. Maybe the DHS bought them all. Anyway - the local FFL guy who advertised on here just sold his for $625. I'll do $550. And his didn't have a cool para-cord check piece. If you are a medical professional with a license, LEO/MIL with ID, or have a CHL, I'll drop like 10% lower. So... how about that? Comes in a random rifle box or bring your own bag."

It is also listed on Gunbroker but I would sell for $100 than there if I can sell it local. It has been fired about 50 times and is in excellent condition. It has the following upgrades: Mesa Tactical SureShell 8 round Carrier and Rail. Dave's Metal Works Magazine Extension. GG&G Benelli Tactical Charging Handle. Also I have installed a Magpul flashlight mount on the left forward handguard. A Surefire M600 Scout. Aimpoint T-1 micro with 4 MOA dot. ADM low mount with QD cam for T-1. Magpul OD green rail ladder. I machined the square notches and screw holes for the Magpul mount on the forward section of the left hand guard. It is clear of the tube/barrel/gas pistons, and retained with original nuplates. It is very secure, positioned so as to easily access the tailcap of a weaponlight. It is also mounted at a very slight MOA cant upward and inward so as to cast light perfectly in front of the gun at about 35 yards. An additional benefit to the positioning of this light is the shadow cast by the barrel/magazine is in extreme upper right hand quadrant, well out of the field of use for most shooters. The T-1 is practically new, very good condition, is night vision compatible and has lens cover. I have just bought and mounted it on the ADM low mount, it is one of the best QD mounts on the market and fits the T1 perfect. I mounted after degreasing the screws, applied blue Loctite, and did not over torque. Tension on the mount is currently set light so as not to print on the rail in case you decide you don't want it set up this way. The remainder of the rail is covered in a Magpul OD green ladder which matches the barrel/magazine color very well. I still have the original magazine tube and spring, as well as choke wrench, all original paperwork and DVD, and the box, tools, paperwork, etc for the mount and aimpoint. The Benelli M4 is the choice of elite military units, and is the cutting edge of technology with it's self cleaning operation system. The M4 is a tactical shotgun, and unlike later model M1's and such it will ""ghost"" or ""float"" a 9 round. So this gun will hold 7 in the tube, 1 in chamber, and one ""floated"" in beneath the bolt, for a total of 9 rounds of 2.75 inch shells, one less if shooting 3 inch. If you know shotguns, and you want the best; be it for 3 gun, self defense, tactical, or any other purpose where the best cannot be compromised on, this is the gun for you."

The gun is about 4 yrs old, with under 60 rounds thru it, (I'm the original owner.) It has the Knoxx Ultra-Light recoil stock done by the gun shop, not myself. The reason it has so few rounds is that I'm a prepper with kinda bad arthritis so......
That is NOT A SUPPRESSOR on the barrel, but rather a clamp on muzzel brake with a screw on flash hider. It's made by Grizzly Gunworks and it DOES work as advertised. It completely quashes all the blast from the brake itself so the guy shooting next to you will not be bothered. It could be modified into a suppressor BUT YOU MUST DO YOUR PAPERWORK BEFOREHAND. Now that I've protected myself from legal issues, you can see these at grizzlygunworks dot com,
I will sell the gun without the brake for $700 FIRM, as the price for the same gun is about $690, and then $260 for the Knoxx Stock. PLUS install unless you CAN do it yourself. So if you want a new one, prepare to shell out $950 or so. The brake and flash suppressor ALONE are $350.
 I don't mind keeping the muzzle brake and flash suppressor as it will work with 308, 30.06, etc.
Will consider 30.06 trades. Will also trade for a Chiappa 357 5 inch (no 2 inch).
Will also consider the Taurus 357 608 8 RD  model + boot.
I also have quite a bit of 300 win mag ammo, good stuff that I will sell for chep as part of a deal.

689,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3910689,"For Sale:  Unserialized, unmarked, 80% AR-15 receivers $100 - We will buy the tools back after you're done.","Downtown, Albuquerque, New Mexico",$ 375,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 20, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"1. What are you selling?

We are selling you both the tools ($275) and the unfinished lower receiver ($100) needed to make your own, UNSERIALIZED, legal AR-15 lower receiver. This is an easy way to fabricate your own, legal, unmarked and unserialized lower receiver without creating a paper trail. Your lower receiver can be used to build an AR pistol or a rifle. We are also selling stripped upper receivers for $30. In case you don’t know what a stripped upper receiver is, this is the part:
http://aeroprecisionusa.com/aspx/store/productdetail.aspx?pid=46 

2. Why so much? (Because you can sell the tools back – out of pocket cost is just $100).

The receiver is $100 - a fair price for a good product. We planned to lend the tools to customers, but the ATF has decreed that doing so is illegal. Since we can't loan you the tools, we will sell them to you instead. Here's how it works: $100 for the incomplete lower receiver, plus $125 for the steel jig to line everything up for you, plus $150 for the drill bits and end mills that you need to build it. Receiver can be used to build an AR pistol or a rifle. 

Do not trust anyone who offers to let you borrow tools or equipment unless you don’t mind federal police playing a role in your life. The ATF’s lame-brained decision that lending tools makes felons was the very first decision of the new year: http://www.atf.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Firearms/FirearmsIndustry/atf-ruling-2015-1-manufacturing-and-gunsmithing.pdf - If you want to be safe, neither a borrower nor a lender be (when it comes to tools). 

We only accept cash and we only keep track of what we have sold (to pay the tax man). We do not keep customer lists. The tools and the jig are $275 more. 

HOWEVER, as long as you don't damage them, we will buy both the tools and the jig back for...that’s right: $275. Your total out of pocket cost would be $100 for the lower receiver or $130 for the lower receiver and the upper receiver. Please note that if you are buying a complete (built) upper for your firearm, you do not need a stripped upper. 

3. What are these tools you keep talking about?

We have put together a set of all the drill bits and end mills that you will possibly need in order to complete your receiver.  All of the bits and mills were purchased from www.mscindustrial.com  You may not need every tool listed depending on the method you use, but every bit or end mill you should need is included. 

4. I have my own tools, will you sell just the receiver? 

Of course. 

5. Is this legal? 	

Yes--as long as you are not prohibited from owning a firearm and as long as you make a legal firearm (no unlicensed machine guns). The lower receiver is the part of a weapon that is considered “a firearm” by the ATF. The 80% lower receiver is not, according to the ATF, a gun yet. So it is not serialized and there is no registration. Again, don’t take our word for it – check with the ATF: http://www.atf.gov/content/it-legal-assemble-firearm-commercially-available-parts-kits-can-be-purchased-internet-or 

You are allowed to build your own gun with the 80% receiver. When you complete the remaining 20%, it is a gun. There is no requirement that you serialize or register your own gun. The other components that make up the AR-15 platform are not considered firearms by the ATF. 

6. What is the quality of the unfinished lower receiver?

The 80% lower receivers are made from 7075-T6 Aluminum. Right now we only have raw aluminum, but we will have anodized lowers again in the future. All of the portions of the lower receiver that have been completed have been precisely machined to mil-spec. The magazine well is broached and fully flared. The lowers are made in America. 

7. What else do I need to build the lower receiver? 

Buying the jig and bits from me means that all you need is a drill press. A milling machine is better, but drill press has worked for me just fine. No returns on the receiver (can't transfer it once it becomes a firearm and milling mistakes are your responsibility), but we will buy the jig and bits back as long as they are in good shape. 

8. Can you help me finish the lower receiver?

Not only no, but hell no. However, YouTube can: using a drill press to complete the lower receiver (with steel jig), Part One: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpeTkT2K32M – Part Two: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfIkL1ctGk The operations left to be completed on the receiver are as follows: A) fire control group, B) trigger pin, C) hammer pin, D) trigger slot, and E) safety selector hole.

9. What’s the big deal about serialization and home fabrication?

Many people feel that the goal of the Second Amendment is undermined if the government knows where every firearm owned by any citizen is likely to be found. Other people are concerned that states or the federal government will ban certain “models” of AR-15 (like the Bushmaster). Having a custom built receiver means that your AR is not any specific ""model"" and will therefore be harder to ban. Some people just like the challenge of building their own firearm. Some people want to build a pistol and you can’t do that with a lower receiver sold as part of a rifle or carbine—the ATF considers that a “firearm made from a rifle.” 

10. Will this always be legal?

Maybe, but maybe not. Who knows how long it will be until the goons stop the sale of 80% receivers - and where else can you pay cash and avoid leaving a credit card trail? Don't miss out on the opportunity to exercise your right to keep and bear arms WITHOUT giving up your privacy.

Winchester collectors take note---we have acquired a collection of 5 Model 12 Pigeon Grade small bores, 4 20 gauge guns and one very rare 28ga. gun, all factory original, all proper with no flaws or question marks. One 20ga. has B Carved wood, one has A Carved wood, all have ribs. This is a rare find and these guns will not last long, so don't hesitate on these treasures. This particular gun, sn1919813 built in 1961, is a 20ga. gun with factory 26"" barrel wearing a factory 3 pin rectangular post duck bill vent rib, choked IC, retaining 99% factory blue on all parts, near perfect Pigeon Grade wood with the double diamond forearm, 14"" LOP to factory butt plate, and jeweled action. The Winchester Model 12 Pigeon Grade is a very high grade collectible Winchester that continues to be a good solid investment grade firearm. There will be very few chances in one's lifetime to acquire a Pigeon Grade 20ga. with these features and condition.

I personally have no sentimental ties to it, or use for it.  I did have it appraised by 2 separate credible appraisers, which all averaged out to the very broad price value of $250 to $650. They basically informed me that since there were in fact, so many of them made, their value is obviously much less.  That being said, they said they've witnessed several buyers/sellers make extraordinary deals due to the fact the buyer (for example) needed that specific weapon for his collection. So, I'm all ears to anything reasonable. I'm not opposed to, or strictly seeking anything ""specific"" at the moment; (other than that ""one"" gentleman who cannot live without having this rifle!"

I guess people don't realize theres things called craigslist, ebay, garage sales, and the want ads of their local papers...but these nonfirearm related ads are really beginning to pollute armslist with stuff none of us want to see when we come on here. I mean some ad's don't even want a firearm for trade, they're literally just trying to sell their random shit on here.

Antiques, wedding rings, dishes...LEGOS. No, I'm not kidding, there actually IS an old ad up for someones friggin LEGOS right now, as if the former wasn't retarded enough already.

Its not what this site is for, its offensive and clutters up an otherwise semi-useful website where people try to sell their used guns back to people for retail prices, or ask for your kidney in a trade.

With extensive research on the form and function of the tactile-enhanced grip, the operator will find the design enhances control, while providing consistent hand placement. The flared magwell aids in fast and reliable reloads while the extended magazine base pad provides a secure grip during loading, handling and shooting the DB FS Nine. Diamondback has incorporated a trigger safety and firing pin block safety with a short, positive reset, minimizing trigger travel for faster cycle times. A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide. Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user’s hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation. The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75” Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25” sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition.

 I am selling four (4) gun storage crates that I built a few years ago. I based the design on a smaller military crate I had at the time. Here are the highlights of the construction:

-I sealed the interior seams with silicone caulk. I then polyurethaned the interior and exterior (3 coats). I added a foam strip to the top rail for a seal.
-Each crate has two sets of vertical rails for inserts. Each set of inserts holds five (5) long guns; each crate holds fifteen (15) long guns.
-The lids are secured/anchored with several lag bolts with washers.
-Each crate has a small desiccant cartridge (from Cabelas) for moisture control. These cartridges can be removed and ""reset"" by baking them in an oven for a few hours.
-Each crate has a heavy-duty metal handles on both sides

Here are the dimensions of the crates:

Short Crate (3 of them)
Exterior: 51"" L x 24"" W x 22"" H
Interior: 48"" L x 20.5"" W x 20"" H

Large Crate (1 of them)
Exterior: 64"" L x 24"" W x 22"" H
Interior: 59.5"" L x x20.5"" W x 20"" H

The photos are of one of the smaller crates, but are representative of all of the crates due to similar construction and condition.

I would prefer to sell them together, but would consider offers on individual units. I am asking $200 or best offer for all (4) crates. Buyer responsible for picking them up. Serious inquiries only. Please e-mail if interested."
