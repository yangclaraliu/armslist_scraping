This is a Daisy Red Ryder Carbine No. 111 Model 40.  I date this bb gun from 1947 - 1951.  It has a black painted aluminum cocking lever which means it was made after 1946.  The wooden handgrip dates it before 1952. 

 Included in the listing is a Red Ryder lucky coin and Daisy BBs.   

This Red Ryder is in Good - Fair Condition.  There is a decent amount of wear throughout the gun but overall it doesn't appear to have been abused.  The bluing on the barrel is very apparent and pleasing.  I tried my best to capture all the details in the photos below.  There may be a couple nuts missing on the back side but everything is tight and functioning.  At some point, someone added some lock washers to the screws as well.  Another things to mention is the minor crease or dent in the barrel, the hair line crack on the handgrip, and 3 BB dents on the backside of the stock.   

 The gun does shoot very well.  It pretty accurate too.  However, I found that it does seem to shoot a bit to the left.  The cocking lever on this old gun does require some muscle to cock it, unlike the new models.  Overall it's a fun gun to shoot a will make a good addition to your collection."

Updated Post:

I have for sale or trade a Colt Police Positive Special project gun in 38 Special (NOT 38 S&W or 38 Colt New Police) that has been completely disassembled and stripped in preparation for refinishing, unfortunately I never got around to finishing it and I don't think I ever will. This gun was wearing nickel when I bought it and I believe it came in nickel from the factory. The Nickel was pretty worn and that is why I decided to refinish it.

About the Gun:

This revolver was in good firing condition when I bought it, with correct timing, good lockup with very little endplay and sideplay, and the crane is in good condition. This revolver is complete with all original parts included plus a set of new springs and some other spare parts that I picked up, including a set of very nice handmade grips, three complete hammer assemblies and one hammer assembly minus the firing pin. The original hammer assembly had a broken firing pin, at the time Numrich didn't have any firing pins or hammer assemblies available so I went to ebay, I found three of them very cheap so I bid on all three to make sure I would win at least one, and ended up winning all three. Just to reiterate, this lot includes ALL of the original parts, all pins, all screw, all springs, original grips, and also includes the crane bushing tool that you will need for reassembly. 

How to buy or trade with me:

Due to the overwhelming response that I received (more than a dozen responses in the first twelve hours) please send me your best reasonable offer, I will respond to every offer, accepting the best one and graciously declining the rest. I have no problem doing a BOS and I have all of the receipts if so desired. Thank you everyone for your interest and I look forward to hearing from all of you. 

Trades that I am especially interested in:

I'm interested in trading for quality firearms or ammunition. I'd be especially interested in trading towards an M&P22, PPK/s 22, long action Mauser, or Mosin Nagant. I will put up cash on my end for the right trade.

I am looking for ammo in 45 ACP, 380 ACP, 5.56/.223, 8mm Mauser, and 7.62x54r."

CAL 38SP/357MAG four barrel double action derringer in 4000 serial number range. Has been carried, shows slight handling, in very good condition. This is a sturdy well thought out design meant to be a back-up gun for a police officer. There are no protrusions or moving parts that might snag on clothing during drawing and firing so that it can be reliably and repeatedly fired from inside a pocket or purse. Technique is important. The index finger should be laid along the barrel and pointed at the target and the middle finger used to trigger the piece. Fired in that mode the recoil is 'mild' and will seem normal to anyone who shoots a large frame .357 revolver. Most women can handle it. This is a real bear gun !"

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 can pack six or seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame, depending on the magazine (this version includes both).

NBS13 Package Overview

Sig Sauer has included both a 6-round (flush fit) and 7-round (extended) magazine with a finger-grip extension. In addition, this P938 also comes equipped with a SIG laser.

X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser

The SIG X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser for the P938™ Pistol is a compact, lightweight, red pointing laser used for aiming. The X38-TGL combines pinpoint accuracy and rapid target acquisition with intuitive operation, in a form fitting package weighing only 1.0 oz.

(Franchi SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun manufactured from 1979 to 2000. Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the United States. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 was sold to military and police users worldwide, [1] on the civilian market, and has been featured in many movies , TV shows and video games . 

US firearm laws have universally blocked the importation of the SPAS-12 shotgun, because the shotgun fits under the profile of a military shotgun, Additionally, in 2000 Franchi stopped production of the SPAS-12 altogether, and Franchi has since shifted its entire marketing focus towards the new and improved SPAS-15. Together, these drastic events have made the SPAS-12 a true collector's item both in the United States and abroad.)"

Bolt Action single shot. Excellent condition. Wood is very straight (nice looking) and is excellent, no gouges or scratches. Metal is excellent, no rust, pits or worn areas. 

22 inch carbine barrel (not the heavy barrel version, no beavertail forend). Bore is clean with sharp rifling. Obviously has very low round count. No iron sites. Original Remington butt cap. 

I have been to a lot of gunshows in the past 25 years. I have seen very few of these carbine versions with the sporter weight barrel and they sold for around $450 due to the low number produced. 

These guns were introduced in 1939. Year Discontinued: 1962. 
Total Production: Approximately: 558,686 guns produced, so has collector value. If you are familiar with these guns, you know the rarity of this particular model. You can look it up on Remington website, history section.  

I have never fired this gun. 

Stored PROPERLY LAST 20 YEARS. Has a Tasco widefield 3-9 scope mounted. Scope mounts and scope included. Scope is usable.

as much as it pains me to have to put this ad up as I am really not wanting to part ways with this beautiful firearm, I really do need the money. I have taken pristine care of her and never even fired more than 100 rounds through this thing. this is around $700 less than the list price  so I do feel it is fair considering it is in perfect condition. It is immaculate. I am not eager to sell this so my price is firm. If you know anything about the ACR you may know that it was featured on future weapons and is seen by many as a revolutionary advancement in the assault rifle. if you're a scar loyalist you May be hesitant to admit that the ACR actually does perform better in most tests than the scar. There are the of course many who will disagree but I suggest if you want to do your own research and watch reviews from people who are experienced in owning both you will see the ACR your wins time and time again. you can fill this thing with mud shoot it underwater whatever. This rifle was set to replace the m4 in the last military trials but proved to be too expensive to mass produce. If you know your guns then you know the reliability, durability and flexibility of this platform. Designed to work under extreme conditions, and designed to adapt to any situation.  The enhanced model sells new at 2700$ Last but not least please do not send me emails asking if it is ""still available"" if it is still listed here it is for sale. I am not interested in trades, nor taking less value than I am asking for this. If you really would like to own this gun please get a hold of me and thank you.

It's been my safe queen.  It has been stored in a temperature and humidity controlled safe.  Comes with factory case, speed loader, and all factory supplied back-straps.  It comes with the original 2, 15 round factory mags.  As an added bonus, this pistol also comes with 2 extra factory Walther PPQ 15 round mags, as well as 3 factory Walther PPQ 17 round mags.  All magazines come from Walther with their ""Anti-Friction"" coating.   

If your a lefty, I also have an Armordillo Concealment custom kydex holster that I'll throw in.  Armordillo Concealment is probably Raven Concealment's biggest competitor.  

This is by far and wide the nicest factory striker fired pistol on the market.  The PPQ M1 is very sought after as it's 100% ambidextrous, and has the paddle mag release on both sides.  This aids in quicker magazine changes as you don't have to change your grip angle to drop your mag, simply use your trigger finger to release the magazine.  This pistol was inspected in the same German proofing house as H&K (Heckler and Koch).  Out of all of the striker fired pistols that I have fired, the Walther PPQ comes from the factory with the best trigger out of the box.   

I don't need to sell this, I'm simply testing the waters here.  It never get's shot, so it's taking up space in the safe.  I have other projects that I am interested in.  I would like to get my son a Glock 19 (Gen 4) or myself a Kel-Tec Sub-2000 9mm more than I'd like to keep the PPQ.  

We only have until next Thursday to strike a deal, after that it's all paperwork.....  Buyer or person trading must present a valid WA. State CPL.  I priced this pistol and accessories to move.  I don't believe in gouging people at the expense of our trampled liberties due to I-594."

Based on some research I did this was at one time issued to an Royal Air Force Officer, as indicated by the Italian Air Force stamp on the frame near the hammer. This pistol was made in or around 1941 or the 19th Mussolini year.  Taken from Wikipedia; 

Pistols made during the Fascist Era are marked with their year of manufacture in two forms: the conventional Julian date in Arabic numerals and the date in the Fascist Era in Roman numerals. The Fascist calendar commenced on 28 October 1922, so a pistol from 1937 may carry either ""XV"" or ""XVI"" as its Fascist year. Pistols taken by the armed forces usually exhibit acceptance marks stamped into the frame on the left just above the grip: ""RE"" (Regio Esercito) for the army, ""RM"" (Regia Marina) for the navy, or ""RA"" (Regia Aeronautica) for the Air Force, always in the form of an Eagle wearing a Royal Crown for the Royal air force.

In excellent condition this Series 70 Government Model is finished in the rare and desirable electroless nickel. According to Colt, this finish was only used from 1981 to 1983 and was applied by the Nitex company based out of Texas. This finish is NOT the dull ""satin"" finish that was commonly used in the seventies/eighties on many 1911 pistols. That particular finish was much equivocated in appearance to that of a flat house paint. The serial number dates this 1911 to the correct era. This finish was applied to other Colts as well, including the Python. Next on the list of rarties about this 1911 are the sights, which I can not confirm are factory. This one will be left to the experts here. Nonetheless, the Millett front and rear sights are a wonderful addition to the gun. Truly a unique and very collectible series 70 1911 that is worthy of any collectors safe. A long out of production beauty with only surface scratches that do not penetrate the finish and light handling marks throughout. No box or paperwork with this one, just to note. I am a lifelong KY resident with a KY DL and CCDW permit holder and one of the two must be provided when we meet for the transaction. Shipping will be $30 from my FFL holder to yours if you are an out of state/area buyer and I will accept USPS Money Orders or bank verifiable cashiers checks as payment methods. Any other form of payment remitted will result in a 10 business day hold on shipment. Please text 8five9 7four9 6ninefour9 (text preferred initially) or email with any and all questions/concerns/inquiries as I will assist to the best of my ability. Tons more pics available via text.

At only 1"" wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability.

Product Information
Production of IMR powders dates back over 200 years when the company was originally founded by E.I DuPont. Available for use in many reloading applications, the IMR series of powder is trusted by reloaders all across the globe. 

IMR PB is great for Trap, Skeet, and Sporting Clays where heavy 1 ounce and 1-1/8 ounce loads are needed. In pistol it yields top performance in target and plinking loads for such cartridges as the 9mm, 40 S&W, 45 Auto, etc. The small extruded grains deliver metering that is always super uniform.

Serious offers will be considered.  BUYER covers 1/2 cost of shipping and FFL costs at YOUR end."

Throughout the manufacturing process each barrel undergoes multiple quality-control checks, with a detailed final inspection prior to receiving the Wilson name. You can be sure that if your barrel bears the Wilson name, it's the best there is!
