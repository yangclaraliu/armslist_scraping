The INSIGHT M6 Handgun Light w/ Laser (TLI-000-A1) is the most popular tactical illuminator/laser combination available today and is widely used for both law enforcement and personal defense because of its lightweight design and reputation for rugged reliability.
The M6's Xenon bulb delivers a peak output of 90+ lumens and is powered by two (2) 3V 123 lithium batteries (included) that give it a one (1) hour run time. The Class IIIa red laser is adjustable for windage and elevation and has a range of 200 meters.
The M6 Handgun Light/Laser mounts easily, without the aid of tools, utilizing Insight's patented Slide-Lock interface. Simply slide the unit onto the firearm's rail and lock into place with the spring-loaded latch bar. L-3 Insight Technology's Slide-Lock interface is designed to fit most pistols.
The M6 features a 4 position selector switch in conjunction with an ambidextrous rocker switch located on the removable backplate. The selector switch turns to Lock-Out, Laser Only, White Light Only or White Light and Laser combined. Once the desired output is selected the M6 is activated by using the rocker arm, toggling for either Momentary On or locking for Constant On. The rocker backplate on the M6 is interchangeable with any other backplate designed for either M6 or M3 models, and optional long gun and shotgun backplates with integrated remotes are available providing for greater versatility in illuminator application.
Like all L-3 Insight Technology products, the M6 is covered by a Limited Lifetime Warranty.

It features a 3.125"" modified tanto blade made of AUS-8 stainless steel. The blade has a non reflective black titanium nitride coating with Mako Flipper and dual thumb studs for ambidextrous one hand operation. Designer Greg Lightfoot describes the M1 as having ""a refined Tanto shape with a custom-style hollow grind, slight belly and recurve with a hint of a drop point. The hexagonal textured black Zytel handles measure 4.5"" closed. Features stainless steel liners and LAWKS system. A custom four position paddle clip is mounted at the pivot. Overall length of 7.625"". Weight: 5.8 ounces.Teflon bearings at the blade pivot and an adjustable pivot screw allow for perfect blade action. Imported with a US patent Design. 
The LAWKS mechanism consists of a switch on the handle of the knife. When pulled back, the liner lock can easily be pushed back to close the knife. But when the safety switch is pushed forward, it acts as an extra lock ensuring the linerlock can not be used to close the knife, making the folding knife a virtual fixed-blade tool.

Unfortunately my matthews bow broke this past weekend so to get back out there for archery season the back up has to go. Great shooter and it's pretty light however the recoil from the gas system makes the kick significantly less than any pump action. Was thoroughly cleaned before duck season and shot on several weekends by hunters who did not have a shotgun yet and it performed extremely well. It has top groves for mounting a scope for turkey season or even a red dot for home defense.

I bought the SR22 about a year ago and I absolutely love it, however recently got a good deal on a Walther P22 and it is a very similar gun.

After shooting both, the Ruger is a better firearm than the Walther in my opinion. I have put a brick of the exact bullets that I am including with this sale through the Ruger without one FTF or jam, something I cannot say about the Walther.  Also the Ruger has the smoothest racking slide I have ever felt on a handgun before.  However, out of my collection, the Ruger is the only duplicate in sense (with the Walther) and I want to use the money to buy 9mm subcompact (something I do not have).  Why is the Ruger being sold and not the Walther then? I just like the aesthetics of the Walther better, and I am using it to plink, so a few FTFs or jams here and there with bulk ammo with the Walther is not the end of the world.

Condition: The SR22 is in very good condition, as I meticulously cleaned it after every use, and I have taken to the range around 6 to 7 times, shooting about a brick out of it.  The are no cosmetic blems that I can find on the outside of the gun, other than a few small scratches that cannot be seen except very up close, but where the chamber meets the slide, there are some marks from burnt powder (normal from use).

The SR comes with everything that came with it from the factory: 2 mags, owners manual, Ruger lock, two different sized rubber grips, two different sized mag plates and so on (see the pic)

I am asking 275.00 cash for both (SR22 and Brick of 22lr).  I will only do a face to face transaction at a shop within the Pittsburgh Area or surrounding area, preferably Gunspricedright in Davosburg (they charge 25 for the transfer and have regular business hours, and are within 20 mins of the city). Buyer is responsible for the transfer fee.  Just send a message and I will get back to you promptly.  Thanks for your interest."

Willing to include some unopened factory ammo depending on the trade value difference.  Will need to meet in the Noblesville/Fishers/Westfield/Carmel area. Please bring a valid IN DL/LTCH.

Read below for what I consider Good, Fair, Poor Condition and Parts Guns.  It is very hard to purchase parts for most small guns especially those that went out of business.  Most generic pistols there is no way to get parts, a second firearm is necessary,.  Those listed below with names; many of the manufacturers are out of business.

Good Condition - The firearm works, it has all the parts, including magazines were appropriate.  The barrel inside (Bore) is bright and shinny, The firearm mechanics are tight.  The out side of the firearm does not have rust, deep scratching or the finish is 90% or better.

Fair Condition - The firearm works, it has all the parts, including magazines were appropriate.  The barrel inside (Bore) is shinny without rust or pitting, The firearm mechanics are strong to tight.  The out side of the firearm may have a small amount of  rust, some light scratching and / or the finish is 80% or better.

Poor Condition - The firearm has problems but it does work, it has all the parts, including magazines were appropriate.  The Firearm my have problems loading (jams). The barrel inside (Bore) is dull to shinny and may have light pitting, The firearm mechanics are weak but it does cycle.  The out side of the firearm may have some rust, light to deep scratching and / or the finish is below 75%.

Parts Guns - any  gun missing parts: safety, firing pin, springs, grips, sites.  (To replace these parts on a small gun will cost to much to make it worth any gun dealers time.

Description:
The Beretta Model 1934 is a compact, semi-automatic pistol which was issued as a standard service firearm to the Italian armed forces beginning in 1934. It is chambered for the 9 mm Corto, more commonly known as the .380 ACP.

Armi Beretta SpA of Gardone Val Trompia has a history in firearms manufacturing reaching back to 1526, when they were established as a maker of barrels. But it was not until 1915 that, responding to the needs of the military during World War I, they produced their first pistol, the model 1915. Beretta has become one of the world's largest pistol makers and the model 1934 (M1934) was their most numerous product in the pre-World War II era.

It was designed and purpose-built for the Italian armed forces. In the early 1930s, the Italian army was impressed by the Walther PP pistol. Beretta did not want to lose a big military contract to their German competitor and designed the M1934 for the Italian Army which accepted it in 1937. This model was followed by the M1935, which was similar to the M1934 in most respects, except that it fired a .32 ACP (7.65 mm Browning) cartridge.

Pistols made during the Fascist Era are marked with their year of manufacture in two forms: the conventional Julian date in Arabic numerals and the date in the Fascist Era in Roman numerals. The Fascist calendar commenced on 28 October 1922, so a pistol from 1937 may carry either ""XV"" or ""XVI"" as its Fascist year. Pistols taken by the armed forces usually exhibit acceptance marks stamped into the frame on the left just above the grip: ""RE"" (Regio Esercito) for the army, ""RM"" (Regia Marina) for the navy, or ""RA"" (Regia Aeronautica) for the Air Force, always in the form of an Eagle wearing a Royal Crown for the Royal air force. Police pistols may be marked ""PS"" (Pubblica Sicurezza). The Romanian military, at the time an Axis power, also purchased model 1934 (and 1935) pistols. The calibre marking appears as 9 mm Scurt (short in Romanian) rather than 9 mm Corto.[1] Romanian Army M1934's differ from Italian M1934's in that the Romanian pistols use the Russian sight picture, where the Italian pistols use the standard sight picture used by Western armies.

An M1934, serial number 606824, was used by Nathuram Godse in the 1948 assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The pistol, manufactured in 1934, was carried by an officer during Italy's invasion of Abyssinia and subsequently taken by a British officer as a war trophy. It is not known how it came to India, but Godse was given the unlicensed firearm by a co-conspirator.

Design
Fitted with the characteristic Beretta open slide, the M1934 has a very reliable feeding and extraction cycle; the elongated slot in the top of the slide acts as the ejection port. It is made with relatively few parts and very simple to maintain. The M1934 is very robust in construction with a long service life if properly maintained.

9mm Corto (.380 ACP) is less powerful than most other military service pistol cartridges, such as 9mm Parabellum or .45 ACP. The magazine capacity is only 7 rounds. When the empty magazine is removed it no longer holds the slide back. The slide will come forward and close the gun unless it is held open by application of the safety, a separate operation, and this slows down the reloading of the pistol."

The Sniper Complete Kit features the ultimate kill light for rifle hunters.

With The Sniper hunting light, there’s no worry about replacing the bulb, as this rifle scope features a 100,000 hour bulb life. And if your bulb ever goes out, you’ll get a replacement free of charge for the first year!

The Sniper hunting light weighs just nine ounces (with the battery), so it won’t weigh down your rifle. And the rifle light is only seven inches in length, so you’ll enjoy easy, lightweight portability. No more toting heavy battery packs and bulky spotlights that don’t work well.

This hunting light accepts two types of batteries, for ultimate versatility. When you utilize the 18650 rechargeable battery, you’ll enjoy two hours of light at full power, along with an additional two hours at moderate and low power.

The Sniper barrel- or scope-mounted hunting light also runs on two non-rechargeable CR123A batteries. Depending on the precise battery brand, you’ll get approximately one hour of light at full power and an additional hour at low or moderate power. Notably, prolonged exposure to extreme cold – below 10 degrees Fahrenheit – can shorten battery life slightly.

The Sniper hunting light is ideal for all weather conditions, so whether you’re in rain, fog, high humidity, snow or cold, you’ll get the visibility you need to spot and take down your prey with ease.

With the white LED light, you’ll get incredible visibility on your hunt. You can spot your prey’s eye shine from a distance of over 300 yards, with full prey visibility out to 250 yard. Compare The Sniper to the average hunting rifle light scope, which provides just 190 yards of visibility!

And just a 50 yard or so difference with the Red and Green Led

The Sniper hunting rifle lighting kit comes with the following components:

The Sniper Rifle Light with CREE LED light bulb;

Quick-mount equipment to affix to a scope or barrel;

White module;

DC car charger unit;

AC wall charger unit;

Remote tail switch;

End cap switch and lanyard;

Two rechargeable batteries; and

A foam-lined storage case.

Don’t struggle to see your prey! And don’t spend a small fortune on over-hyped hunting rifle lights that barely illuminate the length of a football field! Light your hunt with The Sniper hunting light, which easily mounts on your rifle or scope.

We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. We’ll provide a full refund, provided the light and all of its components are returned in new condition."

The current flash suppressor will be changed out prior to sale. It will only fit an AAC SPR/M4 suppressor. This is of little use unless you have this can. Because of the piston system, this upper runs cooler, and cleaner when used with suppressors. It runs equally as well with or without a silencer, the same goes for full auto.

This upper has seen approximately 500 or so rounds through it so it's broken in and in excellent condition.

You know everyone's looking for a deal, but let's get real this is a brand new gun with 50 rounds thru it.  Kahr makes great compact guns, they're not cheap guns.  If you know how to shop --the price for a new Kahr CW9 is the same as a Ruger SR9.  The difference is small frame vs full frame it depends on what you want.  Same quality same price we’re not talking apples and oranges.   

So if your looking for a good compact gun you can either buy it or trade for a Ruger SR9 or 45, Mauser model 98, M44 Mosin Nagant.  Thanks for looking"

This will allow me to buy the R15 on here for 1500 cash. I know this bushy I have was built at the Ilion NY Remington plant and is virtually the same thing as the Remington R15 450, except this has the 16"" barrel and the factory threaded Izzy Brake and the Remington is Camo, 18"" and button crowned. I just can't see wrecking a factory spec rifle and paying more money only to bring down the value of the rifle because the original finish was painted over. Its a big no-no with coin and guns. Factory finish is always best. So, if anyone has a Remington camo r15 .450 bushmaster in 18"" to swap even for this harder to find factory complete Bushmaster , let's talk. I mean this was bought as a complete rifle, not a upper slapped on a mismatched lower. I'm not looking for other trades, because I have a fortune wrapped up in boxes of Hornady ammo, as well as factory 450 mags, even though you can use the typical .223 mags and change the follower, but the springs are weaker and they are not stamped .450. Thanks and God Bless. I don't mind traveling to trade. Face to Face, will not ship to your FFL, sorry. REDACTED
Round count on this carbine is 10rds and only ever fired factory Hornady loads. This is the good thing about a 450 and 458, is that you know the rd counts will be low and usually top brand ammo, unlike the other ar15 and ar10s out there."

994,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3820994,"For Sale/Trade:  52"" Welding Tank","Conyers, Covington, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 60,"Listed On: Monday, December 22, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Someone decided to abandon this tank where I work, and the building manager said I could take it. I know absolutely nothing about these things, but I did a little research, and here's what I can tell you:

Tank is a size ""H,"" which is apparently the largest Consumer Owned Tank you can get filled. It's certified to be safe at 10% over it's maximum pressure, and is dated 2002, with a 10-year marking. In other words, it'll need to be inspected before it can be refilled, unless there's a re-certification mark that I missed. The tank had a helium balloon valve on it, and still had a little helium inside. I opened the valve and drained it completely. The tank does not have an owner's mark on the band, so I'm pretty confident that it qualifies as a C.O.C. Tank is marked ""US GOVT,"" but had a nice, new-ish fill label on it, from Lande Gas. From what I could determine, the tank was most-likely sold off to the civilian sector, or else it would not have been able to be filled. That, or the government randomly throws massive balloon animal parties, then dumps pricey equipment behind the dumpster at a seedy strip mall, dozens of miles from any base.

Tank shows a little surface rust, but looks to be in very good shape, with no actual pitting. It is still mostly painted. I have no way to tell what kind of internal shape it's in, other than the fact that it still had a little gas in it, so one could *assume* that it holds air. I was also told that it runs $20.00-$25.00 to get the tank re-certified, and once that's done, it's good for another ten years.

Tank is about 112 pounds, and you'll need to pick it up in Conyers. I will need a Bill of Sale, which I'll type up. Basically, I just need you to sign off that you understand that I know nothing about the tank, can't certify that you're good to fill it up, and that you'll have it inspected before you try to use it. In other words, just normal liability stuff, because I really have no clue about anything related to welding, making animal balloons, piloting a Zeppelin, or whatever else these things're used for.

I'm asking $60.00, but I'm open to offers. I'd also trade for a drill press, ammo cans, or various other stuff that catches my eye. Come to think of it, I could use a wheel barrow, sledge hammer, and a splitting axe with wedges, too.

[EDIT: I'll add an image of the whole tank tomorrow...forgot to snap one today, and it's too dark out right now.]"
