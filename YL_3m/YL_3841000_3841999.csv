Needs:
20"" barrel
A2 furniture
Solid stock
Attached (perminent) carry handle. None of the bolt on ones, they bother me. 

If it has a non free float quad rail or an aftermarket pistol grip, that is fine.

Doesn't need to be new, can be used and decently worn in, but my offer will drop the more damaged it is. It does need to work smoothly and reliably, however, so cosmetic and normal wear and tear only. 

Send me a photo and an asking price, and I'll see what I can do. 

Also willing to look at an M4 clone. It doesn't need to be to strict, as I don't want to deal with the BS that is NFA items. So if it is a 16"" barrel that's fine. But as the M16 style, it needs to have a permanent carry handle and appropriate furniture (again, non free float rail or whatever is acceptable). 

Colt or FNH preferred, but not mandatory. Prices will obviously vary from manufacturer to manufacturer."

I'd like to trade this whole lot together.

There is a Model 1914 ""Royal"" patent .32. It is all matching and has an original magazine. Good bore. Shoots great according to previous owner.
I was told this is a rare model made specifically for the Italian military in WW1 and WW2. (as opposed to the French who these were mostly made for).
I believe the manufacturer is M. Zulaica Y Cia.

Also a .25 caliber ""protector"" pistol (protector is mostly worn off but is still visible.) These were made for the US market in Spain.
All matching parts. Magazine is a period, ""Spain"" stamped mag but does not ""snap"" in like it should. It fits snug so it should feed, but I don't think it's original to the gun.
I believe the manufacturer is Arizmendi.

Here are two links showing what each of these are selling for on a collector's site:

Lastly is just a box of random parts revolvers. H&R, Iver Johnson, Thames Arms, and Victor .32 S&W. They all need parts. 

Would like to trade all 6 guns together. Not separating at this time.

Considering the low numbers of these first variants that were produced, and then an even lower number that actually survived in somewhat decent condition having undergone cavalry issue during the Indian Wars, and then the rigors of frontier use. Most of these were later sold off as surplus only to have their barrels cut down, undergo refinishing with many of their numbered parts intermingled with others, and then commercially sold to the frontier market; it is then truly remarkable to find one that is as decent as this one. All numbers match, including the grip panels. The grips have never been messed with and still display the faint outline of the inspector’s cartouche on the left panel. The wood has only very minimal shrink and loss around the toe areas. There are minimal handling marks on the wood and absolutely no evidence of repairs. It retains the original oil finish. All metal stampings and letterings are sharp and very legible. Some of the screws appear untouched, while some show some use, but nonetheless are all in very serviceable condition."

Keltec PMR 30 looks brand new and very good shape looks like it hasn't had but a couple hundred rounds through it, it is a generation 2 so it has the non keyholing barrel. 
The pistol does come with the box two magazine and about 85 rounds of ammunition, for those of you that do not know the Keltec PMR 30 is a .22 magnum that holds 30 rounds in each flush fitting magazine. These guns are very hard to find.

Keltec sub 2000 I have, had the grip cut to take the Glock 19 magazines it will also fit Glock 17 and Glock 33 round magazines it does look to be in fairly good condition however the nut on the back of the tube for the bolt does have a little bit of surface rust. This gun comes with one Glock 17 10 round magazine.


I value each of these guns at 525 dollars apiece however I am going to say that they are best offer and will take reasonable offers you can reach me at 865 - 776 - 8735. Please text me only I do not receive calls as I work 12 or 14 hours and you can also text me anytime.

The famous Winchester Model 1912 pump shotgun was designed by Winchester's Thomas C. Johnson. Introduced in 20 gauge in 1912, 16 and 12 gauge guns followed in 1914. From its debut until the end of the 1950's, the Winchester Model 1912 was the pump shotgun, long known as ""the perfect repeater."" After 1919, the model designation was shortened to ""Model 12,"" but the gun remained the same. Oh, sure, Ithaca, Stevens and Remington guns had their fans, but it was Winchester's Model 12 that dominated both the market and the public consciousness for decades. However, by the beginning of the 1960's, the times were a changin', to paraphrase Bob Dylan.

This is why the pre-64s are so sought after especially when you have a Georgia Peach this sweet my 12 boasts the 28 inch barrel, Full Choke, beutifull wood no scatches or knicks, the finish has been well kept and the blueing is phenomanal.
I have never held a Model 12 in my hand that is over 50 years old almost 60 years old and looks and feels as if it was just made. This with out a doubt a safe queen the bore and action are spotless and tight there are no flaws or no suprises when looking/getting this gun in your hands this is the Winchester of a lifetime and will be a prize in anyones collection. The SN# is 150XXXX Which dates it at 1954/55 production right inbetween there, sorry this is a NO TRADE SALE, I will ship to FFL one must be provided to me before i ship and i will only accept a POSTAL MONEY ORDER if your out of state no exceptions.

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth.

Our exclusive ArmorLokt™process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

The Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem™ Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail.

This is a legit 9mm MP5 not that 22lr look alike. Made by Turner Fabrications who has been making MP5's for a long damn time, its the closest you will get to an Genuine HK MP5 without taking out a second Mortgage! Note, HK does not make MP5's anymore, they havent for awhile, finding one for sale is near impossible, and if you do it is going to cost a but load. This thing is in perfect condition and functions flawlessly.

$3000 cash or trades listed below. You will pay over $4,000 to buy all this new after its all said and done, Get mine and save $1,000. This MP5 is Built by Turner Fabrications and comes with signed letter of authenticity. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here it is:
-There is one NIB on Gunbroker right now being sold by Turner Fabrications for $3000(Gun and 1 Mag!), I'm asking $3000 for everything listed in this ad!!!

-Barrel Threaded 1/2x28 and 3-Lug for multiple suppressor mounting options.

-NAVY SEF trigger group/housing (this MP5 shoots Semi-Auto ONLY tho)

-Has a ""Action 3"" bolt group with F style bolt carrier, this means it will fire F/A with a NFA Registered F/A Trigger pack. These bolt groups are banned from further importation and cost about $1,000, check hkparts.net(SOLD OUT) to confirm for yourself. Couple this with a registered F/A Sear installed in a F/A pack and your ready to blast rounds. Obviously NFA Rules apply if you take this route, and it costs $$$.

-MFI Low Profile claw mount($130)

-3 Mags ($50 ea)

-Bushnell TRS Red Dot($100)

-Brand New Folding stock($140), I was going to make this MP5 an SBR but spent money on a suppressor instead and just haven't done it yet. I probably will if I keep it, so get it while its a Non-NFA Weapon and SBR it yourself!

-Included in this ad is 500rnds of factory 9mm, most are American Eagle, some Remington and Winchester too($150 @ $0.30/rnd). The ammunition container pictured is one of my 9mm containers and contains 2,000 rounds which you will be getting 1/4 of.

I got this for my wife - but she prefers my revolver - so I'm selling the G42 so I can buy her a revolver of her own!

We have put exactly 150 rounds thru this pistol. It is accurate, has fired every time, and the trigger is actually one of the better semi triggers I've ever fired.

They are not in this picture, but I have installed Pearce pinky grip extenders on both mags which I will include in the sale.

The pistol comes with box, original papers, lock, original mag plates, and the 2 Pearce extenders and 2 factory mags.

Price is firm - $400 - not a dollar less. If you are some one who ""has"" to haggle, either come to terms with the $400 price tag, move along, or tell yourself I really wanted $425 so $400 IS a deal."

This is the Competition model with 5.25 inch match grade barrel, adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight.
Frame, slide and barrel have matching serial #. I put 60 rounds thru it. Honestly, this gun looks and runs as new! No disappointment here.
Why I want to sell it....
I have two 5.25's. I bought the 2nd 5.25 while my first one was at Springfield for repair. I bought it because I did not think Springfield would repair the one I broke under warranty, but they did! I don't need 2 identical pistols. My first one is modified so I'm selling the 2nd one which is all original with matching numbers.
FYI: Springfield has a no BS Customer Service/Warranty even if you aren't the original buyer.
I have 100% Positive Feedback on GunBroker.

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system (14.5"" barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness."

AR500 Armor® Level III Body Armor is manufactured from an extremely rugged ballistic grade steel core and coated with our PAXCON (a division of Line-X) spall and fragmentation protective coating. Our ballistic steel plate is unmatched in the industry and is formulated and treated specifically to our specifications for improved consistency, durability, and then tested to NIJ standards. Our ballistic plate core is stress fracture resistant, features an ultra-low profile of only .25”, and is designed to handle extreme abuse in day to day use, training, and less than ideal storage conditions. AR500 Armor® body armor will outlast alternative armor solutions such as Ceramic, Dyneema, UHMWPE, and raw/uncoated steel trauma plates.
Level III Rating: AR500 Armor® body armor is Stand-Alone and Multi-Hit capable. Designed to defeat rifle threats up to 7.62x51 M80 NATO Ball (.308 Winchester) at velocities up to 2,780 feet per second, and all pistol calibers.
An Extra Large body armor solution for those looking for maximum coverage or body armor to fit your Extra Large plate carrier. AR500 Armor® 11” x 14” Advanced Shooters Cut (ASC) plates are compatible with our XL Plate Carrier and other plate carriers able to accept Extra Large SAPI body armor plates. Measuring in at an actual 10.85” x 14” ensures our flat, curved model, and built up model(s) will fit firmly and properly into your plate carrier with no shifting or movement. Our 11” x 14” body armor is the largest production chest plate model we produce and provides adequate protection of your vitals on larger frames.
Featuring and ergonomic form, our curved 11"" x 14"" plate further improves ergonomics over standard flat body armor plates. The curve contours to your body and is recommended if you wear your body armor on a regular basis, or for duty use. A specific radius has been chosen for maximum comfort as a front or back plate for operators of varying height and weight; our curved 11"" x 14"" body armor can be used in either position in your plate carrier. To achieve the best ergonomics possible we recommend a curved front and back plate.

The AR500 Armor® spall & fragmentation mitigation coating is simply the best in the industry. PAXCON (a division of Line-X) is a military grade protective coating designed for spall and fragmentation containment. PAXCON protective coatings have been used to increase protection on the walls of the U.S. Pentagon. This Line-X coating completely seals our armor helping reduce spall and fragmentation; and additionally protects it from chemicals, liquids, and other harsh elements. This fully sealed design combined with our advanced ballistic plate result in the Strongest, most Reliable longer term, Maintenance Free body armor solution in the industry. More details on our PAXCON/Line-X spall and fragmentation mitigation protective coating can be found by Clicking Here.
Our body armor undergoes an extensive 4 stage cleaning, etching, and preparation process prior to application of our Line-X coating. This ensures maximum adhesion and helps mitigate “blow-outs” which are common in lesser quality coatings and improperly prepped and/or primed body armor alternatives.
AR500 Armor® body armor is manufactured and coated in-house 100% in the USA. We are an approved OEM applicator of PAXCON Line-X protective coatings.
AR500 Armor® body armor undergoes rigorous pre and post production certification, independent, and in-house ballistic resistant tests to level III standards. All body armor passes through multiple quality control checkpoints during our manufacturing process.

It includes the following:

BNIB Remington Model 552 BDL Speedmaster - Never Fired 
Vortex 2-7 X 35 Rimfire Rifle Scope 
Burris Steel Mounting Rings in Matte Black 
CCI Mini Mag .22LR - 500rds
Winchester Super X .22LR - 500rds
Remington Golden Bullet .22LR - 1125rds

The Model 552™ BDL™ Speedmaster® is the only American-made 22 autoloader that handles 22 short, 22 long, and 22 long-rifle cartridges interchangeably. Like its pump-action counterpart, it features adjustable big-game sights, positive cross-bolt safety and grooved receiver for scope mounts.

A true beauty with high-gloss walnut stock, Monte Carlo comb, and cut checkering. This American-made .22 autoloader will shoot shorts, longs, and long rifle cartridges interchangeably from its easy-loading tubular magazine. Perfect for plinking and small-game hunting. It includes adjustable big-game sights, positive cross-bolt safety, high-luster bluing, and receiver grooved for scope mounts.

Key Features:
Autoloading action for serious plinking.
Handles 22 Short, 22 Long, and 22 Long-Rifle cartridges. 
High-gloss American walnut stock and fore-end with cut checkering.
Tubular magazine fed.
Richly blued carbon-steel barrel.
Adjustable iron sights for open sight plinking and grooved receiver for scope mounts for precision shooting with optics.
Receiver grooved for scope mounts for precision shooting with optics.

Vortex Diamondback 2-7x35 Rimfire Riflescope

The Diamondback—loaded with features! First, the solid one-piece aircraft-grade aluminum alloy construction makes the Diamondback riflescope virtually indestructible and highly resistant to magnum recoil. Argon purging puts waterproof and fogproof performance on the agenda, and advanced fully multi-coated optics raise an eyebrow when crystal clear, tack-sharp images appear in the crosshairs. Look for all this and more in a riflescope you'd expect to cost quite a bit more-but doesn't. We can live with that.
•2-7x35 Diamondback Rimfire has a 50-yard parallax setting which makes it ideal for use at close range on 22 rimfire, shotguns and muzzleloaders.
•V-Plex reticle is the single best all-purpose hunting reticle intended for a wide variety of hunting applications.
•Parallax is set at 50 yards.

This particular handgun was made in 1957 and is in very nice rust free condition for being so aged. With exception to a new Colt recoil spring, Wilson Combat grip screw bushings and allen head grip screws, as well as Magpul grips, this gun has all it's original parts. The barrel, slide, and frame have matching serial numbers. When I bought this, I originally intended to make it a project gun. When I brought it home it was bare of any finish. I stripped it down, cleaned it, gave it a cold blue finish, oiled it, and then shot it. Believe it or not, it shot great considering it's age. And all shots stayed within the 10 ring of the target at 10 yards. I had a lot of project ideas for this gun, but have run out of funds for other projects and need to let this guy go. It's a great solid gun. If you know anything about these guns, they were built on Colt machinery by workers trained by Colt in Argentina. This gun is basically a South American Colt and for being almost 60 years old, has a fairly tight slide to frame fit. If you have any questions or would like more pictures including a picture of the target, please feel free to ask. $485 gets you the gun as pictured,  as well as 2 used in excellent condition Kimber 8 round stainless magazines. Price is firm.
