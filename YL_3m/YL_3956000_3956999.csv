Update from Remington that has owned the Para USA line since 2012 -
Para’s products have a strong following due to their key technical and performance features, which are different than many 1911s, including Remington’s own R1 line. ROC intends to keep these features and benefits that our customers have come to trust, while transferring Para’s operations to Huntsville and rebranding Para to Remington.
Further, ROC will recognize and continue to support Para’s Lifetime Warranty promise on all Para handguns."

The model 530A was the precursor to the famous model 311s.
I can't find any information about the age of the gun via the serial number, but the model 530 was replaced by the model 311 in 1945, so it's at least that old.
Very good overall condition, especially considering the age. 
Very rare, this is the first model 530 I've seen.

Double triggers, plain receiver, not case-colored.
Double bead front sights (one at end, one about midway of barrels).
Bluing is solid, some pitting, but it's not through the finish.
May or may not have been reblued at some point in the past, I can't tell.
Stock looks like new, may have been replaced. Again, I know nothing about the history of this gun, so I can't say what has or has not been done previously.
Bores look good, minor streaking from plastic wadding, should clean right out, haven't tried yet.

Stainless steel bolt, mag tube, trigger, safety, receiver pins, bolt release, base plate, action guide bar, and housing screw. 
Judging from my research, this rifle appears to be original with nothing altered or changed, or missing.
I've only fired 5 rds through it for function test, shot flawlessly and accurately. Cleaned and very well maintained. Excellent condition, especially for its age, has a couple of small wear spots but nothing major, wood furniture is excellent with no breaks or cracks. I would estimate the rnd count to be fairly low, rifling and internals are in very good condition.
This is a great little rifle but I never use it so I'm looking to sell or possibly trade for another modern 22 that I will actually use.

One of the best kept secrets in the firearm industry has to be Bersa Firearms. Bersa Firearms are very well known with concealed carry aficionados and for good reason. Bersa Firearms are very well built, available in defensive calibers, and an incredible value at any price point. The Bersa Thunder, Thunder Combat, Thunder Concealed Carry, Thunder Pro, and BP Concealed Carry are among the most popular concealed carry firearms available and are feature rich with what shooters want and demand. Spend anytime with a Bersa Firearm and you will become a fan instantly. After all it is about performance not price tag.

 The Thunder Pro UC is a smaller version of the proven Thunder Pro. Compact and powerful, the Thunder Pro UC is an excellent choice for those who need stopping power without bulk. Preserving the best features of the standard Thunder Pro, the Thunder Pro Ultra Compact is a superior value in a compact, service grade handgun.

 Like the standard Pro, the Thunder Pro UC features an improved Browning Petter barrel locking system which provides reliable feeding and ejection. The safety, cocking lever, slide stop levers and magazine catch are completely ambidextrous making this a perfect fit for right or left handers. The Thunder Pro UC maintains the Bersa tradition of accuracy, reliability and durability and is an excellent choice for anyone needing a tough, reliable, compact sidearm.

I am a dealer and as such there is a background check (on pistols) and transfer paperwork. This must be done at my place of business in Appleton. I can't meet you someplace else or deliver as that would be ILLEGAL. Wisconsin has a 48 hour ""waiting period"" for handguns, so you would need to come back after that time to pick up your purchase. The 48 hour wait does not apply to longguns. All AR-15 recievers may only be sold to those over the age of 21 as they are readily made into pistols (question 18 on ATF form 4473). No exceptions

TRADES: Please bring your item(s) in so we can give you a trade value. Unfortunately we cannot give you exact prices over the phone or email. Please keep in mind we will consider non firearm related items. 

I also offer transfers from any online retailer and or any other FFL dealer. 
Long guns are $15
Handguns are $25
NFA Transfer $65

Single/double/double plus action, double plus action is their own proprietary thing they have done and it's pretty interesting, using it makes engaging the hammer from the down position a very light trigger pull. 

If your unfamiliar with these, look them up you'll probably be surprised, I don't think I found one bad review on these. Modeled after long time use Korean military handgun.

461,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3956461,For Sale/Trade:  *** New ** RARE ** Wilkinson Linda *** Tactical 9mm Assault Pistol ** UZI / MAC 10 Style ***,"Tacoma / Gig Harbor, Tacoma, Washington","$ 1,250","Listed On: Sunday, May 3, 2015",Handguns,no type,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is a brand new Wilkinson Linda 9mm pistol. It comes complete with owners manual and all of the factory paperwork. This was one of the very hard to find late edition pistols with the threaded barrel to accept a sound suppressor or any other similar type of attachment.  I have owned several of these over the years and this has the nicest piece of wood I have ever seen on one. It also comes with 6 of the extremely well made and very hard to find 31 round factory magazines to provide a lifetime worth of shooting pleasure.
     The Wilkinson ""Linda"" was designed to be used as a tactical weapon for police SWAT and other special agencies. It was designed as an improved upgrade of the J&R 9mm carbine. Being a small company the founder Ray Wilkinson was obsessed with detail and quality control (he even named the pistol after his daughter), that the fit and finish need to be seen to be believed. Everything on this weapon is solid as a bank vault the bolt operates as smooth as silk! Unfortunately this unsurpassed quality control came at a price and it was hard to complete with the cheaper stamped competition from Ingram (Mac 10) and UZI. Not being able to compete on price forced Wilkinson out of business.
     It is very easy to disassemble and clean, due to the ingenious design of the firearm. Re-assembly is also simple due to the presence of the timed barrel, which ensures that the firearm will continue to perform with the same high degree of accuracy without the burden of re-sighting the gun each time that it is disassembled. In addition to being both attractive and accurate, the ""Linda"" has very little recoil which makes it a great target gun and very useful for home defense. Many of our customers have told us that it has become their favorite firearm. Additionally, because there were very few ""Linda's"" ever manufactured, they are destined to become collector's items.
     A full blow back semi-auto design, firing from a closed breech. The pre-ban “Linda” receiver is manufactured from T-16 aluminum [which is a high-grade aircraft aluminum] and is machined to very tight tolerances. Fully machined rather than die-cast or stamped metal and are not subjected to the flaws that are inherent in some other firearms that are currently being manufactured today. The trigger group is a reliably simple design with an excellent trigger pull, a nice balance for the firearm. The bolt assembly weighs [1 lb. 7 oz]. The front of the bolt extends well ahead of the breech and surrounding the rear of the barrel which prevents the barrel from free floating to provide better accuracy.
    The mags are sweated together and have several spot welds down the backs. The magazines are a double stack design, upon inspection of the disassembled magazine; there is a nice machined aluminum follower with a special rounded allen head bolt used as a bearing guide to help prevent binding during operation. You can see that there was a lot of thought put into the design of this magazine for reliability. The “Linda” is an attractive looking firearm and an accurate shooter, providing very tight target groupings.

Balls on at 300 yards, the rifle weighs 7.9lbs with an empty mag, which comes with (2) 30rd PMAGs and (1) 20rd PMAG. Great set up for many different tasks. 

Condition:
Very well maintained, and not OVERLY-cleaned! Less than 500rds and zero malfunctions. I've shot PMC, Wolf, Black Hills, Federal... it shoots everything very well (both .223 and 5.56, from 55g to 77g). Trigger glass-breaks at an easy 4lbs, virtually no creep."

Might throw in an 80% lower if it sells in the next week. ** Willing to trade for a 50cc MX bike (in new or newish condition) for my son.**
Here's the specs:

The 5.56 Carbine Tactical Elite 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating quad rail was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 10"" rail that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you more rail space for whatever your tactical needs may be. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

Two Type 53 Chinese Mosin carbines. No rust. These have been cleaned up and are nice rifles. They're not beauty queens because they were battle rifles and the stocks do have dings, but no cracks. The bolts have been polished up and the actions are smooth. The bores ere what you'd expect from any of these rifles. 

I don't see these for sale anymore. Seems all the online dealers are out  and not expecting anymore

Price is firm. Please no low-balling. 

If interested, reply to the ad, or you can text 214- seven six two - 8060.

I'll respond to all inquiries. I live in Waxahachie and will need to meet somewhere on the South side."

Like new stainless steel lever action 44 magnum.  Walnut stock, shot very little.  Bought new and have put less than 50rds through it in 5yrs.  It is a true ""Marlin"" as it carries the JM stamp.  Another of these in lower grade condition just went for $1100 on Gunbroker.  Please do not ask about a compromised price.  This is more than fair to those of serious inquiry.

The Colt Automatic dates to 1970-1973.  The Walther is the first variant Model 8 produced between 1920-1926, and the Baby Browning was in Browning's first block of FN imports from 1954-58.

Serious inquires only please.  I will not separate my guns; they’ll only sell as a package with AMMO.  I’m in no rush to sell.

Asking $1,975 for collection with AMMO.  Potential shipping available, my local gun shop charges 3% credit card transaction fee and approximately $75 for insured shipping.  Gun shop will ship to FFL only.
