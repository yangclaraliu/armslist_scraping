Didn't use it due to family things. I found another gun I want. It will come with 1 double stack mag. The trigger is very light, under 3lbs. The only issue I know of is that the hammer falls to half cock when using the slide release with an empty chamber. The sear spring may need adjusted. It does not fall all the way and does not fall at all when just racking the slide, or when cycling rounds. I just fired a few mags and had no other issues. The grip safety has been disabled (like most are, including the one on my grandmaster (which is why I am only selling with me mag)). Please email any questions. I do not have batteries in the c-more. Also, if the gun I am looking at sells, this listing will be pulled. I will listen to trades, but mainly selling together another race gun. Thisis a firm price"

If you know Tikkas you know that the main weakness is the plastic trigger guard that comes with the gun. I have replaced this trigger guard with a machined bottom metal that accepts Accuracy International magazines. I have also replaced the original plastic stock with a custom light weight tactical stock. I also replaced the plastic bolt shroud with a machined aluminum one and replaced the bolt with a custom large aluminum bolt so that it is easy to work in cold weather with gloves on. I have used this as a hunting rifle and it works great because of its light weight and accuracy. This would also work great as a bench rifle. This will include a Cabela's Alpha Scope 3.5-12x40 with a bullet drop compensator reticle on a one piece scope mount made by DNZ. It has been torqued down with a torque wrench and locked with loctite. This also comes with 1 accuracy international 5 round mag. Only selling because I am doing much more bow hunting and need to get rid of some of my gun collection.

What makes this rifle rare is it’s flawless condition considering its age and it’s configuration of stainless barrel and action with a walnut stock.  It is an early model 75 imported by Stoeger during the late 1990’s.  This rifle was only offered for a very short period in limited quantities with a stainless barrel and action combined with a walnut stock.  It was usually and subsequently offered in stainless/ synthetic or blued/ walnut configuration.  Another detail worth mentioning is that under Stoeger, this rifle came with a heavier (thicker) than normal barrel.  I’ve owned several Sako 75’s and this one has a thicker barrel than my stainless/ synthetic (Beretta imported) .300 win mag.

I bought this rifle several years ago from a man that stated it was unfired.  True or not, it was in pristine condition and appeared to be unused.  Since I’ve owned it, it has never been in the field and has been to the range only once.  I put half a box of rounds down range, cleaned it and it has been in my gun safe ever since.  I’ve wiped it down a few times since then. 

The bolt shows almost no wear.  The barrel and action surfaces are perfect.  The wood is in 99.99% condition with one minor superficial ding on the cheek piece.  You may be able to see it in the pictures.  Overall condition is AMAZING.

The only negative was a malfunction in extreme cold (-35F) but frozen aluminum can do the same thing.

Based on our patent pending design that allows for unlimited spring loads for high rate of fire weapons, it will easily operate up to 1100 rounds per minute. The profile is shorter than a standard 30 round magazine and 4-5 inches shorter than a surefire quad stack magazine. User friendly ergonomics and the ability to use your sling makes this the choice magazine for 3 gun competitors. Coated in Cerakote for friction reduction and proven reliability without using lubrication, and given a liftime warranty. Manufactured in the USA, fit’s most M16/AR-15 rifles, Bushmaster ACR, SCAR 16 and Stanang Rifles with improved M4 feed ramps.

Weighing less than 14 ounces and with a barrel length of just 2.75 inches, Kimber Micro .380 ACP pistols are easy to carry and conceal.

Slides on the Stainless and CDP models as well as all Micro barrels are machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory.

Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.
MSRP is $651.00-my Price is $599.00.

New, never used, never loaded with rounds ... $20 ... I paid $45+ for it.

I had a Smith and Wesson Model 99 Compact in 40 Caliber that I used as an ankle backup.  I got rid of it a while back but recently found the original Smith box and paperwork.  Inside, I found one of my backup mags for it.

This is the same gun/mag as the Walter 99 Compact.  The 99C and the 99 are not the same gun, the compact is physically smaller and easier to conceal.

As the title says, this is an 8 round 40 caliber magazine for an SW99C with the tail extender intended as a pinky grip to help the shooter hang on to the weapon.

It is Smith ... and carries the Smith mark.  I don't think it's ever been used.  Prefer face to face and cash.  Yes, I'll mail it for $10 anywhere in the lower 48.  No PayPal.

I have the original SW99 blue Smith box and papers that might be of use to someone.  You can have it too for an additional $20 and no extra shipping , so, that's everything for $50 shipped in the 48.

Comes with the original mags, holster, and cleaning rod. 
De-cocker works fine. When I got it it had no wear on the slide or any internal, or external part. Gun still has no scratches, or rubs on any finish. This is as good an example of a stock factory CZ-52 as you will find. 
I removed the slide, barrel, and took out the firing pin and cleaned off the cosmoline that had never been removed from the gun and checked function and fit. Everything looked new and worked perfect, so I took it out and shot it, It's a shooter and that 7.62X25 round is fun to shoot and fast/powerful. 
These are full size service guns and the felt recoil is about like a 40S&W to me, stouter than my 9mm and less then my 357 mag, but you can tell that bullet is moving fast. I was shooting dirty bird targets with a dirt birm behind it and it was tearing the dirt up. 
I've redesigned my shooting program around 9mm and 45acp because I'm set up now to reload those rounds and between them and 38sp for my revolvers that's about all I'm keeping. I am making room for more reloading components and less diversity in calibers.
I might be interested in a swap, but the gun would have to be either a 9mm, 45acp, 38sp. I might consider a 380acp for my wife. I don't reload for it, but she likes 380 and does not shoot that often.
If you got something you're wanting to swap let me know and I'll consider it.

Read Their Fine Print!! This Listing is for One Factory Brand New in the Hard Case H&K VP LE model with 3 15 round magazines and Factory NIGHT SIGHTS. Factory Part # 700009LE-A5 WE WILL SHIP THIS TO CA FOR SSE OR LEO EXEMPTION!! THIS GUN COMES WITH A FACTORY LIFETIME WARRANTY!! In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis.

If you have firearms in you possession, and a member of the family is on probation or a felon lives in the household, there are legal issues.  Persons on probation and ex felons cannot possess firearms.  They can go to jail for the possession of a hand gun. 

If children live in the house hold there are strict rules (laws) that need to be followed and if not followed they can have serious consequences.  This information comes from ATF Information 5300.2 revised July 2004.  You can get the pamphlet at the ATF website.    The US code is 18 U. S. C. 924 (a) (6)  a juvenile who violates section 922 (x) any part shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than a year, or both.  This goes for ammunition.  

If you bring me any weapon for disposal (to get ride of): 

First I will destroy any firearm with serial numbers removed (removal of serial numbers is a federal crime).  If you are not sure of the guns legality, I can run a check or again, destroy the firearm.  If the gun has a criminal history, was stolen the owner my be liable. If you know the gun is legal, you can consign the gun and I will sell the gun for 20% of the purchase price.  There is not much profit in used guns, in a small business.  I will pay for working guns, (small/compact) 22, 25, 38, 380 or 9mm from $20.00 to $50.00.  I will pay a little more for full size firearms, 380, 9mm, 40 S&W, 45 ACP.  I will need to look at long guns, rifles and shotguns.  Except for the hi end weapons used firearms, long guns will be between $35 and $60.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.

A polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete this package.

The Colt Wiley Clapp CCO is a special combination of Officers size fame and Commander slide for easy concealed carry. The value of the pistol lies in the details specified by Wiley from his life long firearm experience. The goal is to produce the most accurate and reliable carry gun out to the box. “Everything you need and nothing you don’t.” 

Carbon Blue Steel Commander sized Series 70 fire controls, Blue Aluminum Officers Lightweight Frame, rear slide serrations
Special metal work by Pete Single. Front strap is checkered @ 25 lpi with a generous relief cut where the front strap meets the trigger guard (hi-cut to the max) so the pistol sits low in the hand. Average size hands should be able to get whole hand on the grip without the little finger hanging off the bottom. The relief cut blends gracefully from the checkering to the trigger guard. The heal of the frame and mainspring is generously rounded for comfort of concealed carry and shooting. The fit is very good. The magazine well is also fully beveled 360 degrees around with a long gentle taper.
