Have you ever been in the zone when every thing slows down and your subconscious takes over?  You need that zone to shoot well.  Once you have mastered the Grip, trigger control and sight picture it is time to clear you mind and let your right and left brain work together to land perfect shots.  

Anyone can learn to shoot accurately.  If you are trying to shoot well, it is the trying that is holding you back.  Do not try- do.

The 2-hour class includes personal instruction and range time.  It is limited to 2 people.    A larger group can be scheduled if it is a family.  The time also increases.

This gun was purchased last month here in Bend and taken to the range once!  Fired (2) mags and now I offer for sale. 
Had recent back surgery so wish to sell now.  Retail is $1199.00 and now offered at substantial discount!

The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.  Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life.

Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.  

Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

Both the HK45 Compact and full-size HK45 use an improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever. The control lever is frame mounted and is quickly accessible; it has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

Franchi Affinity 12g semi auto, 3"" or 2.75 no adjusting or tuning needed. Cycles all shells flawlessly. Crazy light for full length auto loader. With inertia driven system recoil is less than any shotgun I've ever fired. Bought less than a year ago for 3 Gun Competition and never had time to go, so that being said I have run less than 40 rounds thru it, to which it passed flawlessly trying different shell combos. I easily have over $1000 invested in this shotgun. 

Extras Include: Briley Magazine Extension - Holds a total of 10 rounds($120), Briley LM Extended Choke ($60), Nordic Components extended bolt Handle ($25) , Oversized safety ($30), High Visibility shell follower ($25), and professionally polished trigger job.

I have orig. everything from, 3 chokes,choke key, manual.
 This gun is built by the same manufacturer and comes from the same facility as the Benelli M2 and Super Black Eagle II (SBE). This also uses a Benelli inertia driven system is so similar side by side but you will pay around $1000 for Benelli, and this is more practical.

Feel Free to call or text me at REDACTED. 

Again, this is like new and you will not find a single scratch, or dent anywhere on this gun."

This 2003 Land Rover Discovery doesn't have the third row so it seats five. Just under 128,000 miles. It needs tires but with proper tires you can drive through whatever New England winters can dish out. I replaced the crank position sensor about 8 thousand miles ago. Check engine light is on but it doesn't have the three amigos problem. The vin for the truck is not in the series of oil pump recalls but the oil pressure is weak. There is an oil pressure gauge installed so you don't rely on lights alone. There is the ticking of a noisy lifter as well. It needs some work but if you are looking for a Disco or a unique 4x4 this will be a rewarding project. Leather is in pretty good shape except for crack on drivers seat. Has power windows, mirrors, seats, locks, radio controls on steering wheel and they all work perfectly. Doesn't have the CD changer.

 The military’s need for a magnified, self-luminous tactical sight that enhances target identification and increases hit probability on extended-range shots has given rise to the new Trijicon ACOG® 6x48. Powered by Trijicon’s patented fiber optics and tritium-based technology, the new TA648-308 ACOG® reticle features a red chevron aiming point. It also incorporates a bullet drop compensator (BDC) with additional aiming points estimated for trajectory of the 7.62mm M80 out to 1200 meters. To further improve target acquisition and hit potential, the new ACOG® 6x48 incorporates Trijicon’s Bindon Aiming Concept™ (BAC) – a revolutionary both-eyes-open method of aiming. Like other members of the Trijicon ACOG® line, the new ACOG® 6x48 is battery free and waterproof to 328 feet.

Before you say anything remember there were over 3 million men fighting for the Free French with the Allies. This rifle was also used by the French during the Korean War and during their time in Vietnam. In the mid 50s in order to conform to NATO regulations the French rechambered their weapons to 7.62x51mm (308). The Model 1936 were selected as their Sniper Rifle when they switched to a semi-auto MBR. Because this rifle has been drilled for the standard French military side scope mount this was one of the rifles selected as a sniper rifle. I have found the side mount and have put a Bushnell 3x-9x40 scope on it. The original were Leapers. Also it has a lace on cheek plate.

It has signs of wear and is a bit of a collector's item. It can be picky on the ammo you feed it like a lot of older guns. Just trial and error. It likes hollow points better than fmj which I think is unusual though. It comes with 2 magazines; an 8 round and a 9 round. They function flawlessly. Everything about the gun functions as it should. It is quite accurate as we. I shot a deer in the heart at over 30 yards with it once. Comes with the holster as well.

About the LaserLyte CK-AMF9

The LaserLyte CK-AMF9 Side Mount Laser fits Ruger LC9 and Kel-Tec PF9 pistol. It is easy to mount on the gun by simply pushing out and replacing the stock frame pins with the new threaded pins (included). Mount the CK-AMF9 to these pins with the included screw. Then push the ergonomic activation button with the index finger and the laser is on target.

The programmable laser features a pulse or constant on mode and also has an auto-off function to prevent an unwanted battery drain. An added benefit to the CK-AMF9 is that the laser actually helps to provide safer trigger control by acting as a finger guide without blocking the laser beam. The smooth, no-snag design of the laser allows the pistol to easily holster in any available nylon or leather pocket holster on the market.

FOR SALE; $1450 or BEST OFFER
From its career with the Israeli civilian Police, the Mishteret Y'lsrael,comes this FN Belgian Made Hi-Power, also known as the P-35.
This is a stock military variant with lanyard and stud on the left rear side of its grip frame. Caliber is THE 9mm, 9mm Luger, 9x19, 9mm Parabellum, call it what you will.
Construction is entirely steel, 118 mm or 4 5/8 inch barrel, right-handtwist 6 groove; magazine safety and firing pin safety; weight empty 32 oz /900 g; fixed sights; single action only with lever safety; .265 smooth face combat trigger and classic Commander style round serrated hammer; Israeli armorer refinish coating; traditional black composite checkered grip panels. I installed VZ Grips, G-10 PRO SLIM GRIPS.
Barrel number and proofs match the frame and slide.Slide is marked Fabrique Nationale Herstal Belgique I Browning's
Patent Depose, with PW Arms import marking beneath on the left side of the frame as required by US Law.
This Belgian-Israeli Hi-Power is rated as Good, perhaps even Very Good, finish wise, sixty to seventy percent vicinity
estimate; but photos ought to suffice.
It is excellent mechanically; mechanism, bore, and chamber are all bright, clean, and excellent. Magazine is military issue.
This 9mm is able to use the original Browning manufactured magazines or the Mec-Gar made 10,13 or now
15 round magazines respectively.I am including 2 10 round magazines. I've ordered the 13 and 15 round mags but am waiting for delivery. I can send them to you if this is sold before delivery.
This is a tough one to price considering what went in to secure it myself. Since I have two of these models,
I'm letting this go for Best Offer. I'm throwing out a price of $850. This was
an Israeli Military Police issue. Look for the stamps on the upper left trigger
assembly. You'll see a Star of David and a Y, which is the abbreviation for God in Hebrew.
Can't get any more authentic than that.
This exact model is listing prices of APPROX $1200 but none are currently Israeli Issued/certified. This is why I'm listing it as Best Offer.

Trigger is ultra smooth and has a crisp finish.  The sites are dead on, and could shoot it better than some other 1911 higher priced pistols I own.  I purchased a PT1911 in 9mm last fall and I am finding myself taking it out to the range rather than this one due to a wrist injury.  Again, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this pistol, I just decided that it is time for it to go.

(Weapon Armament Surface Protection)

Is a Salt Bath Nitride Finish surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as Nitriding. The Nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, Nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG has been utilizing this nitriding process for many years with our LE series rifles.

This gun has 100 rounds through it, has never been carried/holstered and the 100 rounds were shot during one trip to the range to compare it to a Shield M&P 40SW.
