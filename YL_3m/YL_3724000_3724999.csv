I bought the gun in the spring of 2013.  I shot between 200 and 300 rounds through it.  I have not had a single malfunction.  Some reviews say these guns don't like 115 gr ammunition like Winchester white box.  Well this Nano works flawlessly with them as I have shot nothing but the WWB through it.

I purchased a Glock 19 and really don't carry the Nano anymore so I have no need for it.

I will travel up to 30 miles from Fond du Lac to meet for the purchase.  Beyond that I will ask for more money (a reasonable amount) to offset my gas and time.

Has a 360, 3spd, with 373 rearend. There have been many parts put into the truck to make it reliable. New battery and cables, ignition system, carburetor, complete fluids in motor transmission and rear, valve cover gaskets, transmission linkage, belts and hoses, and air conditioning that needs to be charged. The air will kick on and blow but its not cold. (All the work was professionally done. Truck has good tires, and a new spare. It has a dented hood, but i have another flat black hood that was originally on the truck. Has rust in both floor pans, that could easily be fixed with a patch panel. There is also a power steering leak. The pump works and i can put fluid in it, but it will leak out. The brakes have had the front rotors turned, but has not had brake pads put on. The dash is also cracked, as with all these fords. The door/glass seals are pretty wore out on the truck and for the right offer I will throw in a complete kit for it. Comes with the original hubcaps. Has a good tag and title in my name. This would be a good first truck that is easy and inexpensive to make improvements on, or as a project. I already have another truck that I'm invested in and I dont want a good running vehicle to sit.Text REDACTED"

Arsenal SGL 31-68 AK-74 chambered in 5.45x39 with some pretty sweet stuff attached. Shoots great, but I am getting moved to California and this bad boy is a no go. You can steal it from me. From the back. B5 systems stock and buffer tube, Magpul asap plate, Rifle dynamics adaptor, Magpul pistol grip, Krebs custom safety and retaining plate, Tapco G2 trigger with polished surfaces, Extended mag release, Tromix bolt on charging handle extension, Damage industries MK III rail, Magpul RVG, SRVV Jet brake. Shoots sweet, 1400 Rounds down the pipe. This is a Russian ak, so a bit tricky and pricey to find. Brand new you will pay 1500. The T1 micro can be had for an extra 350. I will even toss in 500 Rounds and 5 magazines.Ammo is not hard to find either. It can be bought online for cheaper than 5.56 per thousand. http://www.jgsales.com/5.45x39-russian-surplus-53gr-fmj-ste…

If you have a good trade I will be willing to accept cash on top to make up the difference. A Tavor, Sam7 ak, or scar 16 I am willing to work with outright. Reasonable offers will not be refused. If you offer me a lesser quality ak from century for trade I will refuse and send you a number to a good psychologist."
349,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3724349,For Sale:  ATN 12-36x80 Illuminated Scope,"Grants Pass, Medford, Oregon",$ 675,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 19, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"ATN 12-36x80 Illuminated Scope.  This is purpose built scope for .50 but would work great on any long range rifle (.338 etc.) ATN is known for their high quality night vision equipment.

EYEPOPPING CLARITY. HIGH QUALITY GLASS. VALUE PRICE. LONG RANGE SCOPE.

It has a 1000-yard BDC and a 3000-yard range finder built-in. The custom designed mounting ring of ATN riflescopes, which incorporates the BDC, insures easy and precise adjustments. 

A 10 position illuminated reticle prevents you from losing sight of your reticle even in the darkest of conditions. The 80mm lens is one of the largest objective lenses available giving you the brightest image possible. ATN Rifle scope Professional 12-36x80 has an electronic reticle. There is 10 degrees of illumination. The rheostat is the knob located at the back of the scope. It is labeled with numbers 0 through 10. When the rheostat is set at 0 you will see a black etched reticle. The reticle will light up red electronically as you rotate the rheostat through the numbers, 10 being the brightest. The rangefinder reticle in ATN Riflescope Professional was designed to assist you in determining the range of your target. These distances are based on a 6' target, if a 6' target fits between the numbered baseline (the seven short horizontal lines) and the post of the reticle above the baseline determines your distance. If a 6' target fits between the horizontal post of the reticle and 2 the target is 200 yards away. If the same target fits between the 4 and the horizontal post of the reticle the target is 400 yards away. The same is with the 6, 8, 10, 20 and 30. The target would be either 600, 800, 1000, 2000 or 3000 yards away.

* Comparable to the outstanding IOR Valdada scopes. Vastly superior to Chinese glass scopes.

** Excellent condition.  Mounted but never fired. 

ORIGINALLY 899 FOR SCOPE AND 200 FOR RINGS AND BASE (INCLUDED HERE BUT SOLD SEPARATELY ORIGINALLY)

675.00 FOR SCOPE PLUS RINGS AND BASE.

Trade value is $600 with scope or $450 without scope.  I'd rather trade than sell, but sale price is $550 with scope or $400 without scope.  It has a sling and a Leupold M8 4x scope.  (The scope & rings in the pics do not come with the rifle.  This scope is zeroed so I'm not removing it until the rifle finds a home.)  Text me for a pic of the Leupold 4x if you'd like to see it.  I'll mount it with another set of rings but it won't be zeroed.  Lifetime Leupold warranty applies.  One final purchase option is $450 for the rifle with a Redfield 4x scope (vintage, but made in Denver, CO during the good years).  The rifle shoots great and has a very smooth action.  20"" barrel / approx. 7 lbs / 38 1/2"" overall.  Plastic Marlin butt plate with white spacer.  Marlin bullseye in stock.  JM stamp on barrel.  This is not the cheap 336W version commonly sold.  It is also a pre-safety model.  Scope mount added but rifle retains front and rear iron sights.  Please email or text me with any questions or if you need additional pictures.  I'm looking for a Remington 700 .30-06, .308 or .300 Win Mag, Remington 760 .30-06 or .308, Rem Model Seven in .243, Ruger M77 MKII, Ruger Scout, etc. in calibers .243 and up. I will consider calibers smaller than .243 and rimfire if it's the right rifle.  I'm also looking for a Marlin .45-70 lever.  I know that this rifle alone won't cover a trade for a lot of the rifles that I'm looking for, so check out my other listings.  Maybe we can work out a trade for this and/or one of my others.  I have the following guns available:

I have a Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 380 with laser up for sale or for trade.
This gun was bought new and I have not fired it at all yet. The only reason I am selling is because my wife utterly hates the trigger on this thing, and I don't want to have a gun in the house that she is not comfortable with.

This handgun is in factory mint condition, and comes with the box, paperwork, shell casing from the factory -still sealed-, the gun itself, two magazines (one with the finger extension on it), and a black carrying case from Smith & Wesson.

I am open to either sell or trade, just shoot me what you have or what your offer is. I would like something small, for pocket carry or ankle carry, but just shoot me what you have. If need be, I may be able to add some cash for the right offer. The only limitation I have for sure is that the firearm I trade for must have a manual safety. Feel free to text or call me at REDACTED just make me an offer, I'm very flexible.
Thank you and God bless."

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

For 2010, our new Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem™ Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail.

These are all brand new, and we got them in bulk factory packaging. Construction is serrated body matte blue steel with black polymer floorplate and followers. Each magazine holds 17 rounds of 9mm ammunition.

Replacement pricing on these in our area is in the $60 range, and they’re not easy to find at that. Our Single Magazine price is $39.00. We’re offering them, in lots of 3 at only $33 each. Own 3 for only $99.00.

I have a Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 380 with laser up for sale or for trade.
This gun was bought new and I have not fired it at all yet. The only reason I am selling is because my wife utterly hates the trigger on this thing, and I don't want to have a gun in the house that she is not comfortable with.

This handgun is in factory mint condition, and comes with the box, paperwork, shell casing from the factory -still sealed-, the gun itself, two magazines (one with the finger extension on it), and a black carrying case from Smith & Wesson.

I am open to either sell or trade, just shoot me what you have or what your offer is. I would like something small, for pocket carry or ankle carry, but just shoot me what you have. If need be, I may be able to add some cash for the right offer. The only limitation I have for sure is that the firearm I trade for must have a manual safety. Feel free to text or call me at (843) 384-1516 just make me an offer, I'm very flexible.
Thank you and God bless."

There are three very small, light, marks on the compensator visible in the picture. They are very light and he has no idea where they came from. I could have touched them up with bluing and you'd be none the wiser. However I thought it best to let the end user decide if they care about it, and if so how they want to deal with it, if at all. 

I'm not a collector, and every gun I own I run the snot out of. After purchasing a new unfired sig p210 and unfired 8"" blue python, both of which I promptly traded for guns I would shoot (I think I traded the p210 for an LWRC REPR, and the python for a SCAR) I decided no more guns in my collection I'd be afraid to shoot.

And this is quoted directly from the description:
Compact, concealable, secure and versatile, the open-muzzle design of the Silhouette™ makes it a favorite of gun carriers who own multiple barrel lengths of the same firearm model.

Hand-molded to fit specific handgun frames, the Silhouette features a reinforced thumb break for security, combat grip accessibility for speed, double-stitched seams for durability, and covered trigger guard for safety. The retention strap configuration is specific to individual firearms types, and varies depending on firearm model. The high riding Silhouette holster is constructed of premium saddle leather and is made to fit belts up to 1 3/4"".

Its unique two-piece construction is contoured on the body side to the natural curve of the hip, keeping all the molding on the front of the holster, allowing for significantly more comfortable carry and a narrower profile than an ordinary pancake type holster."

Description: The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory®’s forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect.

And this is quoted directly from the description:
The Galco CCP™ (Concealed Carry Paddle™) is widely considered to be the finest professional-carry paddle holster in existence.

The CCP offers all the features expected in a modern defensive holster: open top, secure retention, combat grip accessibility, and covered trigger guard. It adds the convenience of Galco's unsurpassed adjustable paddle design, with unlimited range of holster angle options. Whether your choice is FBI-forward cant, barrel-forward cant, or neutral (vertical) cant, a single turn of a screw allows precise adjustment to your preferred angle of carry. The option of crossdraw carry while you are in an automobile, or for everyday use, is also just a screw turn away. Our patented paddle grips the inside of the waistband and underside of the belt, and is adjustable for belts of different widths.

If you need an open-top paddle holster with variable cant, this is it. Constructed of premium saddle leather, the CCP fits belts up to 1 3/4"".

Made for semiautomatic pistols, the C.C.P. is available in right or left hand designs, in a havana brown or black finish."

CSR stands for concealable sniper rifle. The rifle build is as follows:
-Surgeon Scalpel 591 short action
-Surgeon tactical bolt knob
-Jewell trigger
-Accuracy International AX chassis - black
-AI adjustable butt plate
-16"" Krieger stainless #14 barrel
-folding stock

This rifle is a .5 MOA rifle, GUARANTEED. But .25 MOA is attainable (depending on ammo and shooter proficiency). The company boasts it's ability to hit almost to 1000 yds easily with such a short barrel. The overall length rivals that of the M4. While folded it is around 27"" or so, I forget what the exact length is, but clearly it would be shorter than fully extended.

There are no scratches, blemishes, no rounds fired, no break in process required due to such outstanding barrel quality. Throwing in 4 magazines. 2 are 5 round mags and 2 are 10 round mags. I am selling it because some things came up and I needed the money. I am asking $5600 plus shipping, serious inquiries only please. However, since you are doing me a favor by providing liquid cash, I would be willing to negotiate, but not much. I am looking to get what I paid for it (basically as close to it as possible). If I didn't need the money I would be keeping it. I got a military discount on it which would then apply to you because, like i said, I'm only looking to get what I got it for. Indiana residents preferred. However, if out of state must ship to FFL. Also all payments must clear before shipment of rifle because of so much fraud going on these days.

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. The modular design of the USP’s internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type oaf trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes."
