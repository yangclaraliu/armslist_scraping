The pistol shoots great and has very little wear. These pistols were actually manufactured by Kimber and shipped to South Korea for assembly. These were later imported back into the states. This pistol says Daewoo one side and Kimber on the other.

About the Handgun:
Daewoo pistols use delayed blowback action instead of the relatively more common recoil action of most automatic pistols. Other pistols which use the delayed blowback include the H&K P-7 Series and the Vector CP-1. The pistols have a special Tri-Action trigger pull which provides the same trigger pull with the hammer down as most single action automatics. The general appearance is that of a SIG 226. The DP51 is designed primarily for military and police use. It is the standard sidearm of the South Korean armed forces. The DH40 is popular with South Korean Police."

SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year.


This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose.


The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select
one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change
everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance.

This was my Fathers..remember it being in the closet since I was 7 years old so it's 60's vintage at the newest.

I never saw him shoot it once but he said he bought it to go bird hunting with a buddy.
I fired it once and it functions.
It's been sitting either in a closet or safe since the 60's and except for some very small marks on the stock it looks almost like it came out of the box new.

Color case hardening is really nice too.

It does have a couple issues and I've dropped the price $100 from what I would list the shotgun in this nice condition (and the harder to find 20 gauge version of this gun) if it didn't have the issues.

If you look at the safety button-a little piece is missing.
It slides back and forth like it should but if you want the gun to look perfect a new button would be in order.

2nd issue..and I almost didn't notice this because I don't use safeties on shotguns-ever.
I don't load them till I shoot them.

The safety slides back and forth but doesn't appear to be preventing the gun from firing when on ""S"".

Obviously if like me you don't use the safety-not an issue-but otherwise you'll want to take a look at it.

I don't really want to sell it but could pay some bills and I'm primarily a handgun shooter so....

Comes with snap-caps and I've never dry fired it of course.

If you don't know about these guns do a little net research they are known as workhorses and this was savages nicer version.

Manufactured in 2000, Robinson Arms imported these for only 3 years, from 1999 through 2001.  Extremely difficult to find and rare in this condition.  Current MOLOT VEPR's just do not compare to the early Robinson Arms imports; it is said that these early Robinson Arms MOLOT VEPR II's are the finest AK's ever brought into the States.  This rifle is in absolute pristine condition.  The pics tell the story, and I have more available if need be.  I have fired less than 150 rounds through it via 4 trips to the range. Other than that, this rifle has remained cased and in the safe.  With the 20.5"" bbl., she is set up to shoot long distance:

> Custom cheek rest; 
> Aluminum handguard from Carolina Shooters Supply;  
> Muzzle break; 
> MagPul forend grip; 
> Low-profile tactical bipod; 
> Hogue grip sleeve; 
> 4x16x44 illuminated Mil-Dot scope mounted on original removable left-sided receiver scope base;
> Four (4) 30-rd. polymer TAPCO magazines, new;
> One (1) 20-rd. polymer TAPCO magazine, new;
> One (1) 30-rd. steel Russian magazine that came with firearm, new.

You will also get the original matching foregrip, same material as the composite buttstock.  This is a gorgeous and accurate rig.  Good luck even finding an early Robinson Arms MOLOT VEPR II, let alone one as nice as this one.  

Price is now at $1,475.00.  I am using this to fund another project.  I'm not interested in trades.  I will ship it FROM my FFL (Private Sector Arms, Olympia, WA) if you are out of state, AFTER a USPS money order is cashed and I have green backs in my hand, or after pay is coordinated through the retail storefront FFL dealer here on my end, your choice.  I will be happy to drive and meet you within reason.

The bluing is worn off on the safety, nad there is a little bit of wear on the grip panels. This model 84 is DA/SA and can be carried cocked and locked, and yes this means it does not have a decocker. It comes with two magazines (One well worn factory and one newer Mec-Gar), three sets of grips (Walnut Factory checkered, Rubber Pachmayr, and 1980s era smooth medallion wood), replacement slide and barrel (I replaced slide and barrel with immaculate condition ones that have been cerakoted matte black and kept the old ones, as the previous owner attempted to Duracoat them gloss black and did a poor job of it. They still function, but would shatter a mirror from lack of good aesthetics), a box of 25(+2 loose rounds) Hornady Critical Defense rounds, two IWB holsters (one custom leather and one factory Bianchi Leather), and a single Desantis Leather Magazine carrier, and factory blue Beretta Hard case (No manual) I am looking to part with. Also comes with spare guide rod and recoil spring and spare extractor. I carried this piece for a month or two, shot about 150 rounds down the pipe reliably with no failures, cleaned it, and stuck it in the safe after replacing the afore mentioned parts. Gun is reliable, accurate, fast, and fun to shoot. Magazines run flawlessly as well, even despite the beat up condition the factory mag is in. The gun has fed every ammo I fed it, including 50 or so of the Hornady Critical Defense. I just want to replace it with something I have more use for. Will do bill of sale. Text me REDACTED as it is faster, but Email is fine as well. I can take calls, but I don't answer numbers I do not recognize (I work in Public Safety so nobody likes me), so if you have to call leave a message and I will get back to you.

It is a recent Molot import. It's a typical refurb. It's a good shooter, I've only fired 20 rounds (Bulgarian surplus) through it since I bought it. I am the first owner of it since it came into the States. The bore is good, with dark rifling, but with deep, defined rifling. It has a little debris, but I will give it another good bore cleaning to see if that clears it up. The stock has some dings and scrapes, but its purely cosmetic, and could be cleaned up with a little touchup. The metal finish is 95%+. It has clear stampings, with all numbers matching, no mismatching or electropenciling here. It's rust and corrosion free, well kept and cleaned thoroughly and properly. The stock is refurb marked with the slashed box, but no refurb markings on any metal. It has the cleaning rod, and early style bayonet collar. This is a very good rifle, a good shooter, and a good addition to your collection! I will include the original tool kit, ammo pouch, and 20 rounds of surplus ammo. I will be at the Cahaba Shrine Gun Show this Saturday at around 1 or 2, I can meet there on Saturday if interested. Feel free to email me or text me (256)431-four2five7 for additional questions or pictures, I'll be happy to oblige. I have a C&R, and I will need to put this purchase in my bound book. I can ship on your dime to another C&R or FFL. Thank you, Michael"

469,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3803469,"For Sale:  Browning Citori Over Under 12 gauge 26"" barrels, chokes, and forend - Under Deposit","Georgia, Vermont, Vermont, United States",$ 825,"Listed On: Monday, December 22, 2014",Shotguns,Browning                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Over and Under                                                                                ,Shotgun,"This item is currently under deposit.  If the sale falls through, I will revise the ad.

This is a Browning Citori Over Under 12 gauge shotgun with 26"" barrels chambered for 2 3/4"" shells.  It comes with 11 Invector screw-in chokes as follows (2) skeet, (2) IC, (2) MOD, (2) IM, (2) F, (1)XF.

Condition:  The barrels are clean and shiny, all metal work is excellent.  The buttstock has light handling marks, but the wood is very attractive in what appears to be a satin polyuerethane or oil (as opposed to shiny clearcoat) finish.  The forend has a small crack which was repaired many years ago, but the repair was not a professional job.  However, the shotgun comes with a brand new, unfinished, identical forend in the original box (where it's been since 1990).  So if you're bothered by the condition of the original forend, you can make it brand new!  Obviously, neither I nor the previous owner were bothered enough by it to replace the forend.

I've owned this shotgun since about 2000, and have shot quite a lot of skeet with it.  I've never taken it hunting.  I loathe shooting in the rain.  However, on occasion, I'll get snowed on or rained on during a round of skeet.  ANY TIME moisture touches any of my firearms, they get complete disassembly, complete cleaning, complete drying, and treatment with a light coating of RemOil before return to the gun safe.  So there's no corrosion whatsoever on this firearm.

I've owned this firearm for approximately 15 years, and haven't shot it in the past 5 years or so.  So it's time for it to find a new home.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT ME TO TELL ME THAT YOU CAN FIND THIS ITEM CHEAPER ELSEWHERE. IF YOU PREFER TO BUY ELSEWHERE, THAT'S A-OK WITH ME. IF YOU ARE THE SORT OF PERSON WHO SENDS SNARKY EMAILS TO STRANGERS, DON'T WASTE MY TIME, OR YOURS BY SENDING ONE TO ME. IT JUST MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A DICK."

Based on the serial number and grips, the gun seems to be built in 1954. The grip has full checkered grips and silver medallion (correct for such model). The gold medallions were reserved for Colt Pythons. The revolver has a very nice two tone blue finish. The end of the muzzle is un-blued bare steel with a bright polish (indicative of first year productions of 3-5-7, later years changed it). There is a cylinder ring. he barrel It has slight wear marks on the sides of the barrel at the muzzle. But overall, this is a nice specimen thats harder to come by.

This is NOT a trooper. This model is the premium version that came before the Colt Python. The internals are identical to the Python.

I still have half of the box of personal defense ammo I bought when I purchased the gun(shot some of it out of curiosity and put 1 box of 410 shells through it).

This is my Marlin 336cs. 
I bought it new 3-4 years ago. 
It's got a beautiful walnut stock tiger striped pattern. 
It's the deluxe model, so it also has the front site hood. It's got the rubber butt pad.
I topped it off with what I consider the perfect optic for this caliber and style rifle. 
Leupold VX-II 2-7x33mm. It gives the gun a great balanced look. There's no reason to run out a 40 or 50mm scope on a 30/30.  This Leupold is a quality $300 scope. It's zero'd in and ready to hunt. 
I also put a thick $50 Browning Safari Leather sling on it. 

I own 3 different 30/30's. I'm gonna keep the oldest one. So this one's a gem. And it's gotta go!!!
I'm NOT interested in trades. I'm thinning the herd. So everyone wants a deal... Here it is, $550 cash only.  It's a nice $500 gun with a $300 scope. Not trying to get a new price for a used gun.  
I'm not going to separate the gun and scope, either.

Trijicon TA648MGO-M2 ACOG 6x48 Machine Gun Optic, Dual Illuminated Green Horseshoe/Dot .500 Ballistic Reticle, GDI Mount, ARD & M1913 Rail

The TA648MGO-M2 6x48 ACOG is a Machine Gun Optic (MGO) designed specifically for the .50 BMG M2 weapon system. The MGO provides the shooter enhanced target identification and increased hit probability out to 2000 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. With a built-in 1913 Picatinny rail on top, the MGO allows the end user to incorporate the Trijicon 1x42 Reflex (RX30/RX34) sight for convoy operations and/or close combat situations or any other target designators.

The TA648MGO-M2 incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the close in reflexive fire aiming point to be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

http://www.ebay.com/itm/GALCO-M7X212-MATRIX-SNAP-ON-PISTOL-GUN-HOLSTER-1911-3-4-5-RIGHT-HAND-BLACK-/REDACTED90

The M7X Matrix™ is a durable thermoplastic holster that is lightweight, comfortable, and nearly maintenance free! The M7X is also fast, very concealable, and easy on the budget.

Setting it apart from other thermoplastic belt holsters, the patent-pending snap-on belt loops of the M7X – similar to those found on our deluxe Side Snap Scabbard – make it fast and easy to attach and remove from the belt.

The M7X is a strong side belt holster that uses a butt-forward cant to enhance concealability. The open top makes the draw quick and easy, while the lateral tension when worn does an amazing job of retaining the pistol securely. Unlike so many other harsh, mechanical-looking plastic holsters, the Matrix resembles a hand-molded Galco leather holster.

The M7X features easy on/off belt loops that fit belts up to 1 1/2""."

This is my Remington Speedmaster 552. It's 22lr. But who can find the bullets, anymore!?!

It's prone to jam. Tho my gunsmith said it won't jam for him... Go figure. 
Well, it jams more than I'd like it to. (Again, whose got ammo enough to duplicate the problem?)
Anyways, he cleaned it up, internally. And told me to stay with Remington Golden bullets (which I can't find) for ammo and problem solved.  I did locate a couple boxes of Remington Lightning Bolts that I'll send you away with.  But hey, I make NO promises.  (I will gladly give you the gunsmith phone number, tho). It's gonna jam, eventually. 

If fit and finish are high on your list, well this gun's not gonna be the gun for you. It's pretty utilitarian.  Nothing fancy combined with moderate use multiplied by not being babied... It's got scratches. And dull marks. Wood is structurely sound. Just not pretty and no rust that I can see. 

BUT.... if Speedmaster 552's are your thing, then boy have I got a deal for you!!!

This is a high quality factory upper built by Seekins Precision. The 16"" barrel is Black Nitride / melonite treated which is more accurate and lasts longer than chrome lining. The extremely lightweight 15"" MCSR V2 Keymod rail is over $200 alone and has a 1.8"" inside diameter to accommodate suppressors. The Seekins adjustable gas block is another $60 and offers you complete tuning capabilities (see below). 

This upper should shoot a 1 inch group if you can. Throw this on any lower with a decent trigger and have a competition level rifle built by one of the top quality manufacturers in the industry. $500 takes it. Might trade for a decent 1911, quality other handgun, AK, or ?

For another $100 I will include a brand new $150 Seekins Precision Black Nitride full milspec M16 bolt carrier group and charging handle.  

From the manufacturer:

The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block lets you to fine tune your rifle's gas system for smoother cycling and operation. Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.
Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes.

The MCSR V2 rail is a comfortable, extremely light weight modular rail system that will work in any situation as well as comfortably fit a suppressor inside the rail. The MCSR V2 was designed to make using a quick mounted suppressor easy to install or remove while inside the rail.
The MCSR V2 rail is designed so that the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions will now accept all keymod accessories and have two anti-rotation QD positions per side (6total). the internal dimension of the MCSR V2 has increased to 1.8"" to accommodate most suppressors on the market."

First, the circumference of the frame has been reduced to augment the shooter's grip. The grip has been re-contoured to better fit the hand. Grasp performance is enhanced because the hand has to stretch less in order to maintain control of the pistol. This new, optimally shaped and sized radius is small enough to maximize your ability to hold the gun with minimal effort. At the same time, it's large enough and shaped such that your hand will feel naturally positioned, allowing you to maintain a Point and Shoot experience."
