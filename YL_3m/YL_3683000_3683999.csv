With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Research & Development teams, developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF. The TAVOR® was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the “father of the TAVOR,” spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities – seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, the TAVOR underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies in the world. IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication to craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR SAR rifle. TAVOR® SAR Features Include: -Bullpup configuration allows for short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy -Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease-of-use -Clean, long stroke piston operation -Detachable, cold hammer-forged barrel (CHF), chrome-lined with 1:7 twist, CrMoV steel -Optional 9mm Parabellum conversion kit with CHF barrel, 1:10 twist, CrMoV steel -100% ambidextrous configuration and operation with optional left-hand bolts for 5.56 NATO. No additional parts required to convert 9mm Parabellum to LH configuration -Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles with push button swivels -Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies -Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR SAR parts -Last round - bolt holds open on an empty magazine -All metal parts treated for corrosion resistance -Integral rubber recoil pad Keywords: Bull pup , Bullpup , SAR , Flat Top , Flattop , 5.56 , 556 , 2.23 , 223 , AR , TSB ,"

Bought new in 1990s---Fired very little.  No dings, scuffs, gouges, scratches, dents, missing, broken , repaired parts and MOST IMPORTANT not a worn out range toy like so many used ARs.  This setup is fresh and mint with little use and it shows.  Considering offers on my late 1990s production Model 1 heavy barrel upper woth American Spirit Arms forged lower, AR-15, 16"" CAR, carry handle style upper, and 4 position collapsible stock.  I am the original owner, purchased the ASA forged complete receiver, upper, etc. All new and was assembled by Wyoming gunsmith in 1990s.  It is an American Spirit Arms forged receiver (better than cast or billet) , collapsible stock, chrome lined heavy contour barrel and is mint.  The case is a proper fitting heavy cordura, smooth velour-like padded interior in excellent/newish condition, ACE brand case (yes the ones made in USA, St. Clair, MO back then) purchased new with the gun in 90s, has 4 magazine pockets on case side and includes 3 steel magazines, carry handle straps and shoulder sling carry strap.  Magazines are:  1 Sanchez 30 round, 1 Colt 20 round, and 1 generic 10 round.  After purchasing the rifle brand new I went halves with a friend on 1000 rounds of ammo (500 for me and 500 for him) and I still have about 3 boxes left of that first 500 rounds.  So that means the rifle has fired less than that.   Will include 1 box of Remington soft point brass case ammo, 6 boxes of military steel cased FMJ ammo.  I also have the original heavy steel bar type armorers takedown wrench (not cast mystery metal/pot metal or light aluminum like some cheap ones)  that I bought with the rifle.  It is a sleek rifle, no add-on doo dads except the range finder scope--nothing unnecessary to dangle, break, fall off, or fiddle with.  It does have excellent factory original sights (combination large or small aperture flip-up-down-peeps and a mint Barska 4x Bullet Drop Compensating Electroscope on a see-thru mount (Not electric as the name implys but is a Bullet Drop Compensating ""BDC"" Turret type scope) that has a bolt and clip attachment to mount through the factory hole in the carry handle quickly and easily, with a BDC turret adjustable from 100--400 yds. in 100 yd. increments. Again, the sights are all original see-thru with the scope attached, which I think defines a combat rifle.  This is an awesome and sweet lil rifle, quality built during the 90s (before the Wall Street formula ""contiually cheapening products = increased profits"" changed the firearms industry) and pampered by me since.

I started this off with a saimese Mauser for 500$ Bought a stainless shilen heavy barrel for almost 200$ Had a gunsmith remove the old barrel, install the new, check headspace, etc as well as test fire for 300$+ also had him drill , tap and install base mounts for 40$ I then had it duracoated snakeskin camo for 200$ with brush colors to match our landscape. This is an all weather finish and is ready for heavy duty use. I also have an upgraded and adjustable trigger for this gun for you to drop in and set it how you like it . A 2 stage trigger is currently installed. 

A ramline stock comes included and came with the gun. Someone tried removing material to fit the gun and got really close. I tried to fit it and it only needs a little material removed for the gun to be complete. This is 5-10 minutes of work. Fit it in this stock, or an aftermarket Mauser stock of your choice. I will also include rings and a scope.

The weapon was submitted to the Israeli Army for evaluation and won out over more conventional designs due to its simplicity and economy of manufacture. The Uzi was officially adopted in 1951. First introduced to IDF Special Forces in 1954, the weapon was placed into general issue two years later. The first Uzis were equipped with a short, fixed wooden buttstock, and this is the version that initially saw combat during the 1956 Suez Campaign. Later models would be equipped with a folding metal stock. The Uzi was used as a personal defense weapon by rear-echelon troops, officers, artillery troops and tankers, as well as a frontline weapon by elite light infantry assault forces. The Uzi's compact size and firepower proved instrumental in clearing Syrian bunkers and Jordanian defensive positions during the 1967 Six-Day War. Though the weapon was phased out of frontline IDF service in the 1980s, some Uzis and Uzi variants were still used by a few IDF units until December 2003, when the IDF announced that it was retiring the Uzi from all IDF forces. It was subsequently replaced by the fully automatic Micro Tavor. This fine example of a machine gun was built Pearl MfG in Grants, NM with a registered receiver and collapsible stock and Suppressor built by Aurora Tactical. This is a fully transferable machine-gun and is on a form-4 in Arkansas. All NFA rules apply. Make sure you understand the NFA rules and your ability to own this weapon where you live. If you are not a class3/SOT then this weapon will have to transfer to a class3/SOT in your state and they will help you with transfer from them to you.

April 2014 Issue No. 185

Nevada residents order firearms from
out-of-state retailers and the retailers
ship the firearms to an authorized
Nevada firearms dealer for delivery to
the customer. The Nevada firearms
dealer charges a fee to register each
firearm in Nevada. When the Nevada
firearms dealer completes the
registration paperwork and delivers a
firearm to a Nevada purchaser for an
out-of-state retailer not registered with
the State of Nevada, Department of
Taxation (Department) as a retailer
engaged in business in this state, it is
presumed that the firearms dealer is the
retailer of the firearms pursuant to NRS
372.055 and NRS 372.050. In such a
case, the firearm dealer would owe
sales tax on the total amount of the
retail sales price of the gun to the
customer, including the Department of
Justice fee if passed on to the customer,
and including any service charge made
by the firearm dealer. If the firearm
dealer establishes to the satisfaction of
the Department that the out-of-state
retailer was engaged in business in this
state, its deliveries for that retailer will
not be considered taxable retail sales by
the firearm dealer, even if the out-ofstate
retailer has not registered with the
Department as a retailer engaged in
business in this state. In such cases, as
well as in situations in which the
retailer is in fact registered as a retailer
engaged in business in this state, the
out-of-state retailer has a duty to collect
the use tax pursuant to NRS 372.185
and NRS 372.225, even if paid directly
to the firearm dealer by the customer.
Also, the Department of Justice fee
passed onto the customer should be
included in the measure of tax.

The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols.

739,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3683739,For Sale:  Saiga rifle and shotgun,"Everywhere, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 600,"Listed On: Friday, November 7, 2014",Rifles,Saiga                                                                                ,no type,Semi-automatic,no type,"The skinny on Saigas:

Yes, they're banned from import by Obamas executive order a couple months ago (along with many other Russian firearms and ammo).  This means we won't see any new ones entering the country, even with Republicans in Congress, for at least two years when Obama leaves office (unless a law is passed in the meantime permanently banning them, or whoever's the next president issues an order continuing the ban, which will extend the ban.  It's happened several times in recent history).
Yes, they're pretty much sold out online and in stores.  Whenever a retailer manages to find a couple more, they tack on an extra $100+ than the last price they sold them at.

No, they don't accept standard AK or com-block mags without modification to the magazine release, installation of a feed ramp under the barrel inside the mag well, and sometimes some work to the mag well opening.
No, installing a Tapco stock and maybe an eBay quad rail doesn't make them ""converted"".  A true ""converted"" Saiga has the trigger guard right up against the mag release and will accept standard AK-style pistol grips and stocks.  In the case of the rifles, they also need to have the gas block removed and replaced with the proper block, tube, and sights so it'll accept standard AK-style hand guards (upper and lower).  A total conversion will also have a  threaded barrel with muzzle break.  In other words, it's now a 922r compliant AK-47.
No, these aren't $300 plastic rifles.  The people who like to say that are A) living in the past or B) ignorant or C) assholes.  Saigas do usually sell for a couple hundred less than Arsenal AK's, but usually have to be converted so the prices generally roughly align once the conversion is done.

Watch out for:
Anyone who claims to have a Saiga for $500-600.  It's a scam.
Anyone who claims they did the conversion themselves.  It's not terribly hard to follow YouTube directions if you have the right tools, but many people skimp or cut corners on the more difficult parts of the builds.  Check any such ""converted"" rifles carefully.  If possible, use some snap caps to test the cycling and check the strikes on the cases.  Also bring some of your own magazines to test if possible.  Some people find it easier to Dremel their magazines to fit the rifle rather than taking the time to fix the rifle/shotgun.
People claiming their rifle is ""like new"".  This is usually a way for people to try to get rid of their old, used toys to someone who doesn't know better.  Sometimes people say it has ""only 100 rounds through"" when they picked it up used and have no way of knowing.  One objective way to get an idea on this is to look at the serial number on the box or gun.  The first 2 digits of the serial number is the year it was made.  I know this doesn't tell you the full history, but if it's made 20 years ago, it's likely passed through many hands.

Finally, I don't have a dog in this fight.  I'm not selling a Saiga and I'm not looking to buy one; as much as I love them I'm certainly not going to pay 2 or 3 times what a new one is going for now for a used range toy with a dubious history.  I'm just a Saiga fan and want to educate some of the people on here who know little or nothing about them.  So don't bother emailing me to flame me, harass me for outing your POS, or any other reason.

If you're really looking for a cheap Saiga in this crazy post-ban world, Cabelas in Richfield has 3 used converted Saiga's in .223 for $599 each.  Yes, they're imported, assembled, and converted by Century, but if you can look past their piss-poor reputation, it's likely to be the last time you'll see one at that price in the foreseeable future, if ever again.

Good luck, be smart, and don't support the gougers!"

The invention of the G2R's projectile R.I.P.™ is related to the ability to control the way the projectile reacts as it passes through different mediums by control of the mfg process, geometry and the rate of failure at different zones along its axial length. More particularly but not limited to the ability to take the projectile and predictably have it stay solid in one medium but yet have the exact same projectile predictably react as a fragmenting bullet through a different medium without alteration of the projectile. The geometry at the tip of the projectile has much to do with the way the projectile travels through tissue. It has been long known in the medical industry that a trocar point penetrates the dermis layer more efficiently. Patents for trocars appeared early in the 19th century, although their use dated back possibly thousands of years. It is the use of this geometry at the front end of the projectile that does specific work at the point of entry from one system to the next. Dependent on the medium the projectiles geometry is designed to react differently.

Imagine a Hole saw. The hole saw action that occurs at points of entry into different mediums reduce initial drag which allow the hollow cavity in the center of the projectile to rapidly pack. In the case of plywood the hole saw action cleanly cuts and packs the projectile with a slug that makes it solid thus allowing it to conserve more of its energy. This performance could prove to be very effective for law enforcement that may be in a situation where the target is behind such an obstacle whereas more energy will be carried into the intended target and not lost in the obstacle.

In a fluid the projectile fragments. Due to the trocar geometry of each petal the resulting diameter of the fragmentation pattern is maximized. The trocar tips allow the fragments to swim through tissue / gel with less resistance thus conserving energy. The cross sectional thicknesses and geometries also create a full 180 degree flip halfway along each of the 8 petals path. The resulting shock wave and wound path is maximized. The result is devastating.

G2R's relentless study and applied physics have derived a radically invasive projectile that outperforms the rest.

I got this shotgun last year when I was stationed in Washington state, and used several times for skeet shooting (having purchased from a gentleman who was using it for the same). Unfortunately, I just don't have the time for skeet shooting now and I'd like to find this a good new home. The shotgun is in amazing shape, the only flaw is in the area around the feed ramp where the bluing has been rubbed off from shells being inserted.  I personally fired around 250-500 shells through it since I have had it. The gentleman whom I purchased it off of did have the gas o-rings replaced within the last year that he owned it prior to selling it to me.  I love this shotgun, have had alot of fun with it but would like to find it a new home. I am asking $600 OBO, does come with a case. I can best be reached by phone (text is fastest response) at REDACTED. Please be willing to show ID and sign a bill of sale.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. The modular design of the USP’s internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type oaf trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes. Features: Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories Ambidextrous magazine release lever Extended slide release Patented Lock-Out Safety device Key Features Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves Ambidextrous magazine release lever Specifications Caliber: .40 S&W Overall length: 7.68 in.

Perfect as a rare collectible, great as a semi-auto for Three Gun, home defense, or any other uses you might have.  I've seen others in this shape and configuration sell for (not asking price but actually sell for) between $1,500 and $1,800 both on Armslist and Gunbroker in the last 2 years.  This is not your $750 beater, this has been superbly cared for and hardly used.

I am willing to ship on your dime (directly to you if you live in WI, otherwise to an FFL as required by law).

955,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3683955,For Sale:  Mossberg 12 gauge Model 835 Ulti-Mag 10 Shot Custom Tactical 3 1/2 inch chamber 24 inch Fiber Optic Adjustable Rifle Sights Ported,"Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 359,"Listed On: Monday, January 4, 2016",Shotguns,Mossberg                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"Our # LG62338X Why get all hot and bothered wanting an AR-15 when this shotgun outperforms that venerable rifle at close range? Firing a 1 9/16 ounce load of 3 1/2 inch #T steel shot delivers payload roughly equivalent to 100 rounds of .22 LR ammunition, all in one shot, and recoil is more manageable with steel, especially with this Mossberg’s padded synthetic stock configuration. With, for instance, Winchester’s 54 Pellet #4 Buck in 3 1/2 inch, a similar payload with 54 pellets develops, like firing 54 rounds of .22 LR ammunition, all with one single pull of the trigger. With its extended steel Choate Machine Tool magazine, this model 835 goes from its original 5 + 1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells up to 9 + 1. Capacity, of course, on 3 inch shells is one less, and two less with 3 1/2 inch shells. Payload capability, then, with steel is the close range equivalent of 800 rounds of .22 LR. This fine shotgun’s 24 inch barrel comes outfitted with a .690 diameter Turkey Extra Full Accu-Mag Tube that is NOT for use with steel shot. The barrel is also clearly marked, Not For Use with Slugs. The reason for that is, a slug could turn inside the oversized bore and cause damage to the barrel. We are also including a Hi-Viz knurled collar tube that measures .705 and works fine for Steel Shot and Buckshot; and that matches the ordinary Modified to Improved Cylinder range. Barrel has 16 recoil-reducing ports arrayed on either side of the second rib post. The Ventilated Rib houses high visibility green fiber optic front sight, and windage and elevation adjustable red double fiber optic rear sight. Finish, with the exception of the choke tubes and Choate magazine tube extension, are Mossy Oak Break-Up Infinity Camo. Construction is the same as any model 835, steel barrel and parts housed in a lightweight alloy receiver that renders a light, well balanced unloaded weight of 7 pounds 6 ounces, with a center of gravity at the back of the forend. Forend, trigger guard, and buttstock are matching finish polymer. Buttstock measures 14 1/8 inches length of pull from the trigger face to the end of the inch thick black recoil pad. Note that the buttstock accepts standard Quick-detach swivels, and the magazine clamp has its own permanent swivel that can easily modified to accept a QD swivel. Replacement pricing on similarly equipped custom shotguns will range upwards of $800 apiece.
