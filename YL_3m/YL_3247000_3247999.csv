Also, stamped on the buttstock comb just ahead of the buttplate is the number ""50"" which I assume is a rack number.  The rifle bore is bright with good sharp rifling. Bore is lightly pitted, but nothing deep or large.  You have to strain to see the pits.  There is some external dents on the barrel under the front sight.  It could be marks from a sleeve-mounted bayonet.  The stock is not cracked anywhere, but shows hard use.  There are several dents and gouges in the stock, and a wood splinter missing from the end of the stock just behind the nose cap.  For a 100+ year old rifle, this rifle is in good condition.

Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts. Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control.

Other than 70+ year of finish wear, the only thing I could find wrong was that the ejector rod has an almost un-noticeable wobble when spun but otherwise works perfectly.   Based on my internet research I believe this pistol, serial number 753XXX,  is  a pre-victory model manufactured in 1941.  The D^D marking  on the left side apparently stands for Australian Department of Defense.  VEGA Imports, Sacramento, CA apparently imported the gun some time later.  

The gun was passed down to me but I am not a collector.  Send me an e-mail if you’d like to own a piece of WWII history and add this one to your collection.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the complete set of Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates would be $300.00"

I bought on locally while mine was on backorder, now I have one too many.
I am not a dealer. These list for $495, I am selling for $400,used for one outing and cleaned.
This is for the Trigger, Selector switch, ATF letter, box, the whole package ready to go.

See below:

3MR   trigger functions in a standard semi-auto mode with a 4.5lb trigger when the safety switch is in the standard Fire position. When you switch the selector switch back to where full auto would be on an M4/M16 you get the same 4.5lb semi-auto trigger, and the action of the bolt resets the trigger for you. All you have to worry about is pulling the trigger for the next shot.

The build quality is superb. USA manufactured utilizing CNC and EDM processes to produce the parts. The quality control process is top notch.

TAC-CON says the trigger is capable of a 600 rounds per minute (RPM) rate of fire. Most shooters will   be in the 400-500 RPM range,   Short travel distance and assisted reset means you have to do very little movement with your trigger hand.

I also have one Hi-Point 995 9mm carbine. These are nice, reliable carbines that are easy for anyone to shoot -- almost recoil free. Has less than a box through it. It has been upgraded with the factory magazine mount that allows carrying two extra mags on the butt stock, so each carbine comes with three magazines. Include vertical grips as well. $275

My kids have gotten the AR bug, and need the money to finance their next purchases so there isn't much room on price. However, the more you buy the more you save.

I had this rifle built by Doug Paschall(Craftsmith) in 2005 just before I moved to Florida from NC. I did load development and took a few ground hogs, two deer, and one coyote with it. During load development I played with H870 and Retumbo with 140 grain projectiles and found that I preferred the much cleaner burning Retumbo. I could get more speed with the H870, but had to clean after 10 rounds. The gun has approx 350 rounds down the barrel, it has only had 12 round shot in the last three years and now just sits in my safe.

It's in great shape and has had the stock shortened to youth length with a rubber pad installed. Great kid's or smaller statured shooter's gun, although I have no trouble shooting it and I'm ""full sized"". It has a home made ""digital"" camo (tan/brown/olive) job that is not exactly military spec, however my kid loved it. Can easily be covered with Krylon if you don't care for it. It hasn't been shot much, so I can't tell you the favorite ammo yet. Probably CCI in my experience. Includes an extra mag and I'll throw in a hundred rounds of ammo. $120 

Will include the pictured red dot on for another $80. It is a quality Ultradot that retails for $200 itself. 

The pictured Hi-Point carbine has been sold. I do have a Norinco ATD-22 .22 LR take down rifle available as well. Just search ""norinco"" in Armslist.

For any sale, all Colorado laws will have to be followed and the firearms transferred through an FFL. The one closest to me charged $20 per gun the last time I was in, and that is the buyer's responsibility. I'll go to yours if it isn't too far."

Now it comes complete with all the modern tactical accessories you would find on a modern military assault rifle. With its interchangeable 6 position stock, this Lever Action will help you find ideal adjustment and cheek weld. The tri-rail forend allows the operator to attach accessories of his choice such as a grip or tactical weapon light. Precision machined receiver provides the 464 SPX Tactical Lever Action .30-30 Winchester with positive lockup for consistent accuracy and long-lived reliability. The tubular magazine gives this rifle an impressive 6+1 capacity for ultimate firepower. This rifle is adorned with the Mossberg qualities we have all come to love.

Light (3lb), maneuverable, perfect for Deer, Big Cats, or Bear, effective on Big Horns (which, by the way, are actually a variety of deer, not sheep) or anything up to Elk if you're good enough to get a shot at 200 yards or less.  Over 200 yards if you really know how to shoot.  Retailers like Henry, Cabellas, and Impact Arms sell these rifles for $769 to $799, plus $46 to $48 tax.  They were unavailable until about March since Hurricane Sandy shut the factory down, and many, especially smaller retailers and online retailers,  still don't have them in stock.  Unfortunately, right now I need cash more than I need a rifle that I won't use until the Fall.  Included are a new Fielding Tactical soft case and a box of Winchester 150 grain Power Point ammo.  If you've wanted one of these beautiful, dependable, and accurate Henrys, you'll never find a better deal."

I appreciate your inquiry, and am only looking for serious cash offers. Very tough to find these days! Also have to throw in a box and a half of ammo and an Uncle Mike's shoulder holster. I will require ID and a bill of sale."

Prefer just a good plain stock 10/22, because I'll be rebuilding it anyways, but if you have aftermarket stock or something that's fine too. 
But have atleast 1 magazine.

Paying $2175 cash for regular 18"" version, will discuss a price if you have a 16 or 18 bull barrel on it already.  Let's be realistic guys, I can buy a new one for $199 plus tax...just looking for a good deal
