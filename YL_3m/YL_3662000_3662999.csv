Adapted from the battlefields, US Forces have begun improving this proven Trijicon ACOG scope by adding a small red dot sight on top for close encounter missions. Trijicon has now created a similar model for the public, the TA31F-RMR. The main Trijicon scope provides a dual-illuminated reticle using fiber optics and tritium for bright aiming point in any light condition. The ranging reticle allows for bullet drop compensation out to 800 meters without any manual adjustments. A Trijicon RMR® sits on top with a 3.25 MOA aiming dot.



The TA31F-RMR also includes:

1 3.25 MOA Trijicon RMR® ( RM01 )
1 Flattop Mount ( TA51 )
1 LENSPEN® ( TA56 )

Model # BN-4208-86, 7.62 x 38 Cal.  Made in Romania.

WASR is Wassenaar Arrangement Semiautomatic Rifles.  These are export-oriented, semi-automatic versions of the Pistol Mitraliera model, itself the Romanian variant of the Avtomat Kalashnikova Modemizirovannly series of Kalashnikov rifles originally manufactured in Russia.  The WASR series rifles take their name from the 1996 Wassenaar Arrangement, a multilateral export control regime, the purpose of which is to monitor and limit the proliferation of certain conventional weapons and dual use technologies.  
The WASR series rifles use a Romanian made receiver, but lack the dimple above the magazine well seen in the SAR series of Romanian AKM rifles.  

WASR series rifles are manufactured with stamped sheet metal receivers that were originally intended for single-stack magazines.  Featuring hard chrome-lined barrels, side-mount scope rail and wooden stocks, WASR series rifles are commonly imported to the US by Century International Arms.  At the Century International Arms factory, the rifles are modified to conform with certain US firearms regulations.  For example, the magazine wells are typically widened to accept double-stack column box magazines.  Other common modifications include installation of upgraded gas pistons, fire control groups, pistol grips, and plastic folding or collapsible stocks manufactured by Tapco of Georgia.

WASR series rifles are easily customized with hundreds of aftermarket stocks, muzzle brakes, flash suppressors, telescopic sights, and other accessories.

After the sunset of the 1994 assault weapons ban, importers were able to legally equip WASR-10's with compensators, bayonet lugs, and folding stocks, thus making the GP WASR-10 (with GP standing for general purpose).  The machining burrs on the magazine will cause some magazines to fit tightly if the burrs are not removed.  This can easily be accomplished with any standard rotary tool, such as a Dremel.  Some advantages of this rifle are the reliability and availability of aftermarket parts."

Also have some side plates 6""x8"" Text or call @ REDACTED
(Please serious buyer's only)

I have one new Condor Multicam Front/Back/Side Vest available. Without the accessories the total price for the plates including the vest is $300.00 so get this while I still have it. I only have 1 Multicam vest 

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each. The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. AR500 is more civilian level armor. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 14 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

IMPORTANT NOTE: I have only 1 Front/Back/Side Carrier Vest Left! This one is a Tactical Gunner Vest as displayed in the photographs. It does not have the side pocket inserts on the sides for the vest. Instead, it has the cumberbund that wraps around the vest in which you could attach Molle accessories/gear to the sides of the vest. It still does accept the Front/Rear Plates however. I have plenty of Front/Back Carrier Vests however and hundreds of side plates available.

If you want the complete set of Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates would be $300.00"

I was a gunsmith many years ago; this was one of my personal rifles. I used it for a display at shows and then I hunted a couple deer seasons with it. The rifle only has about 2 boxes of ammo thru it. 

This gun started out as a Savage sporter. I removed the factory med weight barrel and replaced it with a heavy barrel that was properly head spaced to the action. The barrel was re-crowned, threaded 5/8-24 and a LR-308 flash hider was added. Everything is trued up and smoothed out. The entire barreled action was cleaned, stripped down, aulm oxide blasted and coated with KG Teflon Gun Kote OD green. The bolt is coated in KG Teflon black along with the DNZ scope mount. The trigger has been lightened and is crisp, but not so light to be unsafe for hunting or field use. The rifle is mounted in an OD green and black spider web style B&C stock. The bipod and case is included with it, but the scope in the picture IS NOT included in the deal. 

This is a really nice and unique rifle; it would cost a lot more than what I’m asking to build it today. I’m asking $1100 OBO for the gun, case and bipod. Also included with the gun are the following: sling, lock, protective silicone gun sock, bore cleaner and a package of Mil-Spec rifle grease. I’m sure I’ll find a few more items to throw in the deal too.

I live near the Athens/ Elkmont, AL area and this is for sale/trade FTF for AL or TN locals.

I'd say it was never issued. Just has minor storage wear. Bore is perfect. This rifle is also 100% cleaned of cosmoline grease. Most of these rifles will come packed with grease that was kept on the rifles while in storage. This one is cleaned and is fully functional. Rifle is extremely accurate. The rifle comes with all accessories from the factory. Comes with the original ammo pouch, sling, and cleaning kit. I do have some stripper clips that come with the gun, but I have no ammo. I listed everything I can think of. I know that all that information is important to collectors. If you have any questions, just shoot me a text. Price is $350 OBO. Looking for cash only.

We purchased it for her about two years ago for her as a first pistol to get her into shooting, and she has since upgraded to something else.  We've decided to sell it now, since it's a great gun and deserves to be shot more than we have time to now.

The gun itself is a Walther P99 AS, the Anti-Stress model.  This model is very similar to a double-action/Single-Action pistol with a decocker.  If the pistol is decocked, the first pull is a bit longer as if functioning as a double-action trigger pull.  Subsequent trigger pulls will be more similar to a single-action pistol, with the trigger pre-loaded with a much shorter and lighter trigger pull.

Included with the gun will be everything that we purchased it with.  Included will be two magazines, one 15 round mag, and one 10-round mag.  Both mags function very well and have been cleaned and lightly oiled recently.  Also included will be two exchangable handgrips to change the size of the handgrip for different hands, three additional different front sights to change aiming style, the standard Walther cleaning tool, the owner's manual, the gun lock and key included with the gun, the target from the pistol's first shooting, and the case for the first round fired from the pistol.  The pistol will also be sold in the original Walther case that the pistol shipped in.

This handgun is very nice.  It's reliable, accurate, and very tame with its 9mm cartridge.  It's a full-sized pistol, but is very light and easy to handle.  We've never experienced any issues with the pistol, either with jamming, or anything mechanical.  The pistol has also been cleaned and oiled after every shooting, and has been cleaned and oiled shortly before this posting as well.

I'm asking for $550 for the pistol, or best offer, and can be reached via telephone or text at REDACTED, and can also be reached via email at REDACTED as well if you have any questions, or would like to see the pistol.

He's tough, which is why he's beat cancer for over 30 years.  He is a great man, wise and loving. I want to find him one of these because he's admired the Colt his whole life but would never get one for himself.

She purchased this pistol for her concealed carry about two years ago, and has recently upgraded to something a bit smaller.  

The gun will be sold with the 7 round magazine that it came with, and will be sold in its box as well.  

This gun is very reliable and compact, and functioned well as my wife's concealed carry handgun.  The gun is very slim and carries very well either OWB or IWB, and is even very nicely built for appendix carry as well.  The recoil is a little snappy, but that's mostly a result of the size of the gun, as well as the straight blowback action, and is very manageable.  The gun itself is very accurate and reliable, and will shoot where you point it every trigger pull.

The pistol is Double-Action/Single-Action with a decocker and a manual safety as well as a magazine safety.  I'm selling the pistol for $250 OBO.  If you have any questions, or would like to see the pistol, I can be reached by telephone or text at REDACTED, and can also be reached by email at REDACTED as well."

Changes I made to the rifle:

1. Stock: These come from the factory with a side folding wire stock which I replaced with the original fixed stock which matches the rest of the furniture. The stock was ordered directly from the Czech Republic where they store a lot of their old military surplus equipment.
2. Trigger: This came with a trigger somewhere in the 12 pound range, I don't know for sure because it was over what my scale could read. I followed a guide to lighten the trigger by removing one of the two leaf springs that are not necessary for operation. This is shown in one of the photos. The trigger is now a consistent 5.5 pound pull on my scale.

I fired in total around 90-100 rounds through this rifle (with the improved trigger) and function is flawless.

$500 price is firm
