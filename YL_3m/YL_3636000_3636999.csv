OK, so I am the guy who likes to customize things...make them a little different from stock, so I changed the stock furniture this came with; stock, grip, angled foregrip to MagPul stock and foregrip and a Hogue grip.

It doesn't come with sights, so I mounted the Millett DMS-1 1-4X scope in a rock solid Burris AR-PEPR mount. Buy this all yourself and you're out about $1200."

Multicoat 4
Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold® engineers developed Multicoat 4®, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You’ll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold’s Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.

2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing
While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.

Out and ready for the Christmas holidays is the Ruger's new and improved version of their LC-9 comes the LC-9S (Striker Fired) with improved trigger action. 
The brand new redo on the original LC9, the LC9S now has a striker fired mechanism with a “safe action” (generic term) style trigger to match. Not only does the trigger feel better, but its pull is roughly 30% shorter and 20% lighter. With an improved trigger obviously comes better accuracy and ease of shooting both at a slow and faster cadences with more accurate follow-up shots to boot.

Thanks to the striker fired system, the trigger boasts its own safety as an additional safeguard, and piece of mind if the carrier chooses to do so with the manual safety disengaged. And is deadly accurate straight out of the box.

RUGER LC9S Features: 
•	Striker-fired version of the award winning LC9®; has a short, light, crisp trigger for faster, more accurate shooting.
•	Fits all existing LC9® accessories including lasers, holsters and extended 9-round magazines.
•	Slim, lightweight and compact personal protection, just slightly larger (less than 1” taller and 1” longer) than the popular and incredibly compact LCP®.
•	Rugged construction with blued, through-hardened alloy steel slide and black, one-piece, high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame.
•	Includes finger grip extension floorplate that can be added to the magazine for comfort and grip.
•	Dovetailed, high-visibility 3-dot sight system with windage adjustable rear sight and fixed front sight. Blued, alloy steel barrel.
•	Safety features include integrated trigger safety, manual safety, magazine safety, inert magazine for safe disassembly and visual inspection port that provides confirmation of a loaded or empty chamber.
•	Also Includes: one 7-round magazine; soft case.

This Gen 4 26 has that ""teflon"" finish that alot of the gen 3's had. Very few of the 4's were lucky enough to get it. Do a search on google. Almost all gen 4's have a smooth, matte black finish. Problem is, that finish shows handling and holster marks the second you use it. Gen 4's come with a third magazine, stippling, larger ambidexterous mag ejector and interchangeable backstraps. The 26 Gen 4's have 3 total backstraps.

This finish looks shinier and even feels extremely indestructable. Just like the tefflon coating on really expensive pans. This gun is perfect. Not so much as a little mark on the barrel ramp (pic 2). I wish I could do a better job of explaining the look/feel of the finish other than it is much more attractive and after watching the youtube videos and reading everything people had to say about it on the Glock forums, compared to the flat matte finish which shows holster wear after each use, this one will take a beating and still look new. 

Some will say, ""a Glock is tool and I like it to look used..."" Well, my truck is too and I don't want it scratched up/faded after using it when it could look perfect for a long time. Just my opinion.

Has grip extenions for all 3 mags, slide release extension and glock tool along with all the stuff/papers/lock/backstraps, etc. that it came with.

Also has a very nice ankle holster for concealed carry. Can email pics of it.

Steel slide and steel frame, it has some minor wear from being carried. The grips have most of the wear but they can be replaced for $25. Also has night sights but they're dead, they can be relamped by sending the slide in to trijicon. Has a new recoil spring that only has about 250 rounds on it. The slide flats and raised portion of the frame are polished.  This fine handgun is DA/SA with an ambidextrous safety/decocker, the single action trigger pull is short with a short reset. Is is very accurate and pretty mild on the recoil for a 40 since the frame is steel and keeps the recoil to a minimum. It would make for a great range gun or a truck gun. It's built like a tank and will outlast you and me both.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years1.

The pistol will come with everything it had from the factory, including two 8-round mags, factory E-Series wood grips, and hard case.

Comes with Trijicon night sights, ambi safety, and extended grip safety from the factory. This was my carry gun so there is a little holster wear on the front of the triggerguard and slide. This wear is just a few shiny spots, no scratches or gouges, and certainly no ""Idiot Scratch"". 

The grips in the pic are not included in the package, but may be available for purchase to the gun's new owner. Additional Wilson 47D mags can also be had from me, but not until the gun sells."

When I got it, I had the barrel, action and trigger guard stripped and reparkerized by Coastal Gun Works here in Virginia Beach. I also ordered a period front sight from Fulton Armory. The rear sight is very loose in the dovetail but I have the scope mount that fits in the dovetail. I did strip the stock and had the intention to stain it with the correct boiled linseed oil but I never got around to staining it. 

Put 45 rounds through it shortly after acquiring it in a trade for my 1911 and it shot well. It did shoot steel casings with 2 hangups but they were Tulammo crap.

Its all put together minus the rear sight and will shoot as it. All you have to do is stain the stock with the linseed oil I will supply and presto, you have a piece of history minus the history. 

Comes with 2 15 round mags and the mag pouch that fits around the buttstock. It is reproduction of the Korean War actual pouch and fits nicely around the buttstock. Also comes with a 30 round mag that feeds the rifle well.

The PLR-22 operates by blowback action and has a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16 and SU-16."

Inventory #G-11468-2

The Winchester Model 1200 is a 20-inch, 12-gauge, manually operated, slide action shotgun. The slide action, also known as a pump-action, means that the shotgun has a moving bolt system which is operated by a ""wooden or composite slide called the fore-end"".[5] The fore-end is located on the underside of the barrel and moves front to back. The weapon can hold a maximum of five rounds total with four in the tubular magazine and one in the chamber. It has a hammerless action which means that there is no external hammer spur. There is only a firing pin which strikes the primer on the shell to ignite the powder in the round. The Model 1200 is a takedown type of shotgun; meaning that it can be taken apart for easy storage and transportation."

Have you heard of the impossible shot? Not if you have an ER-25 mounted to your shooting stick. With the right caliber and rifle, shots beyond 2,000 yards become a reality with the ER-25 series scopes. A 58mm objective lens sits in front of a Turret Parallax Adjustment Locater (TPAL) system guaranteeing the sharpest image resolution possible throughout the 5-25X power magnification range and at distances past 2,000 yards. Target acquisition for accurate shots beyond 2,000 yards is possible when dialing the power ring of an ER-25 to maximum power. When weather and light conditions are less than optimal the 12-position illuminated reticle system provides yet another advantage for taking your best possible shot. All ER‑25 optics feature an Erector Repositioning Elevation Knob (EREK) system that maximizes gross elevation travel adjustment for maximum elevation adjustment where traditional turrets leave off beyond 2,000 yards. MIL, MOA and Horus reticle options are available in the ER-25 product line.

Optional elevation and windage knobs, reticles, lit reticle modules and finish colors available at an additional charge. Scope body, eye piece, objective housing and any and all other body parts are made with 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum and are then coated with a matte black type III hard anodizing. Duel elevation and windage rebound springs will insure decades of reliable and accurate adjustments.

Sometimes there is more to making a shot at extended ranges than you expect, and especially when target identification becomes a deciding factor. With this in mind, the LR-17 series scopes provide the shooter a decisive advantage when engaging targets beyond 1,500 yards. A 44mm objective lens sits in front of a Turret Parallax Adjustment Locator (TPAL) system guaranteeing the sharpest image resolution possible throughout it’s 3.2-17X power magnification range. Target acquisition for accurate shots beyond 1,500 yards with proper target identification can be made with confidence when the power ring on the LR-17 is cranked all the way up. When weather and light conditions are less than optimal the 12-position illuminated reticle system provides yet another advantage for taking your best possible shot. All LR-17 scopes feature an Erector Repositioning Elevation Knob (EREK) system that maximizes gross elevation travel adjustment for maximum elevation adjustment where traditional turrets leave off. MIL, MOA and Horus reticle options are available in the LR-17 product line.

Optional elevation and windage knobs, reticles, lit reticle modules, and finish colors available at an additional charge. Scope body, eye piece, objective housing and any and all other body parts are made with 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum and are then coated with a matte black type III hard anodizing. Duel elevation and windage rebound springs will insure decades of reliable and accurate adjustments.

The Spike, designed by Barry Dawson, is a weapon pared down to its bare essentials. Its thick, narrow blade is distal tapered and flat ground to a zero edge. This creates a unique cross section that facilitates both penetration of the tip and cutting power previously unknown in such a thick, narrow blade. The integral handle of the spike compliments its minimalist theme. It has been carefully shaped out of solid steel, wrapped with cord and had all of its sharp edges ""melted"" so they don't irritate the hand."

This is not your typical consumer grade M4/AR15 platform or accessories. It is Military specifications all the way around, using only high end parts and components as you are about to see.

I present to you the Daniel Defense DDM4 V5 M4 Carbine Mil-Spec Rifle. Below is a link giving the specifics of this same rifle for sale (except mine has a different stock). I'll just say it is one sexy and effective piece of art...

https://danieldefense.com/firearms/mid-length/daniel-defense-m4-carbine-v5.html

I purchased and added on to this rifle after doing many months of research on creating the ""perfect weapon system"" for virtually any scenario that would come up. ONLY reason I am selling is because I am saving up for a full auto, so my baby has to go...

I chose the:

-Daniel Defense M4 Carbine because it kept popping up in list after list of the ""best of the best"" because of its durability, attention to detail/quality, and adherence to Military Specifications/tolerances. Watch this video on YouTube and you'll see why the DDM4 is the best M4/AR15 on the market from a durability standpoint http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kX0nCEh5E

-Burris MTAC Ballistic CQ/LR (Close Quarter/Long Range) tactical optic because it offers both Close Quarters and Medium/Long Range capabilities in the same platform and the same time. Using ""true 1x"" it allows for both eyes open use (just like a red dot...AimPoint for example), and up to 4x magnification with built in 5.56 BDC reticles for effective engagements up to 600 yards. Just zero for 100 yards (which it already is) and your ready to go out to 600 yards using the built in BDC dots. It is extremely clear, has illuminated reticle (which work even if the battery dies), weather and shock proof, with a lifetime warranty.

-5.11 LED Tactical Lightweight High Output Weapons light because of it's superior performance inside of an extremely light frame. It is weather/shock proof with high, low, and strobe capabilities. Mounts perfect along side the foregrip for easy of use in any conditions.

-45 degree backup sight for obvious reasons; just in case something were to happen the MTAC optic this rifle can still be effective at close and medium/long ranges.

-Viking VTAC battle sling after much research in the best sling for all situations. Check out how awesome this sling is here: 
http://www.vikingtactics.com/product-p/vtac-mk2.htm

-Quick detach Harris bipod. Small and compact, but adjustable and sturdy. Can be added/removed to the M4 very quickly if the situation requires it. Quickly turns this M4 from a close quarters machine into a medium/long tactical precision weapon. 

Comes with everything listed above, plus:

Hard Carrying case, (4) 30 round mags, 90 rounds of ammo, scope lenses covers, and original boxes for most accessories.

I have well over $2500 invested in this barely used and meticulously cleaned package. Cash only price is $2100 OBO. This is extremely fair for everything included...you will NOT regret taking this beauty home. Plus, there is nothing left to do to make it perfect...

No trades please. FTF only, no shipping. Must be 18 with an OHIO ID. CCW preferred (I'll show you mine as well). 

I have extra mags and ammo for purchase to buyer ONLY."

775,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3636775,"For Sale:  Complete Sweet Shooter Gun Cleaner Kit with Tray, Strainer, Polish, Lube","Joshua, Dallas, Texas",$ 95,"Listed On: Saturday, March 21, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"New Sweet Shooter Kit
It is very easy to clean my pistols with SweetShooter. I simply dump the quart of fluid into the pan and let all the parts of my pistol soak overnight. The next day I see all the black residue from shooting the pistol in the bottom of the pan. I use the grid to lay the parts on and let them drip back into the pan while I brush and swob the barrel. I usually take air and blow off the pistol after cleaning my barrel to get any residue out that didn't come off into the bottom of the pan. All of my guns are pretreated according to the instruction using a blow dryer and swabbing the barrel while at the range shooting to impregnate the SweetShooter into the metal. This makes it very easy to clean after every time I shoot. After cleaning I use the small funnel and pour the SweetShooter back into the can to store it for the next use. 
A $145 value including a 32oz can of SweetShooter gun cleaner, stainless steel pan, stainless steel lid, stainless steel grid, jar of slide lube, jar of metal polish, stainless steel tooth brush, rust removing pad, spot applicator, and a range bottle with funnel.

This is not your typical consumer grade M4/AR15 platform or accessories. It is Military specifications all the way around, using only high end parts and components as you are about to see.

I present to you the Daniel Defense DDM4 V5 M4 Carbine Mil-Spec Rifle. Below is a link giving the specifics of this same rifle for sale (except mine has a different stock). I'll just say it is one sexy and effective piece of art...

https://danieldefense.com/firearms/mid-length/daniel-defense-m4-carbine-v5.html

I purchased and added on to this rifle after doing many months of research on creating the ""perfect weapon system"" for virtually any scenario that would come up. ONLY reason I am selling is because I am saving up for a full auto, so my baby has to go...

I chose the:

-Daniel Defense M4 Carbine because it kept popping up in list after list of the ""best of the best"" because of its durability, attention to detail/quality, and adherence to Military Specifications/tolerances. Watch this video on YouTube and you'll see why the DDM4 is the best M4/AR15 on the market from a durability standpoint http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kX0nCEh5E

-Burris MTAC Ballistic CQ/LR (Close Quarter/Long Range) tactical optic because it offers both Close Quarters and Medium/Long Range capabilities in the same platform and the same time. Using ""true 1x"" it allows for both eyes open use (just like a red dot...AimPoint for example), and up to 4x magnification with built in 5.56 BDC reticles for effective engagements up to 600 yards. Just zero for 100 yards (which it already is) and your ready to go out to 600 yards using the built in BDC dots. It is extremely clear, has illuminated reticle (which work even if the battery dies), weather and shock proof, with a lifetime warranty.

-5.11 LED Tactical Lightweight High Output Weapons light because of it's superior performance inside of an extremely light frame. It is weather/shock proof with high, low, and strobe capabilities. Mounts perfect along side the foregrip for easy of use in any conditions.

-45 degree backup sight for obvious reasons; just in case something were to happen the MTAC optic this rifle can still be effective at close and medium/long ranges.

-Viking VTAC battle sling after much research in the best sling for all situations. Check out how awesome this sling is here: 
http://www.vikingtactics.com/product-p/vtac-mk2.htm

-Quick detach Harris bipod. Small and compact, but adjustable and sturdy. Can be added/removed to the M4 very quickly if the situation requires it. Quickly turns this M4 from a close quarters machine into a medium/long tactical precision weapon. 

Comes with everything listed above, plus:

Hard Carrying case, (4) 30 round mags, 90 rounds of ammo, scope lenses covers, and original boxes for most accessories.

I have well over $2500 invested in this barely used and meticulously cleaned package. Cash only price is $2100 OBO. This is extremely fair for everything included...you will NOT regret taking this beauty home. Plus, there is nothing left to do to make it perfect...

No trades please. FTF only, no shipping. Must be 18 with an OHIO ID. CCW preferred (I'll show you mine as well). 

I have extra mags and ammo for purchase to buyer ONLY."

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability
and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct
lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic
ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.
