Thanks for looking and have a good day.

ALSO, 1) I am not interested in any trades, 2) I am set on the price. If you can find it somewhere else for less, I encourage you to do so. A negotiating tool of, I can find it at blah blah blah for blah will have no impact on my price as I will simply suggest you get it where you found it. I AM LISTING IT FOR THE LOWER PRICE ONLY AS A FESTIVE GESTURE, I will not lower the price, no there is no rush to sell.

It is sad that I have to address this, but due to 3 people who agreed to a deal and then pulled some nonsense, those interested in purchase will need to meet somewhere close to me.  If you cannot afford the asking price, move on.  It is inconsiderate and a waste of my time to schedule a meeting, then after I'm there send a text message trying to get it at a lower price."

Hello, I have a S&W Shield 9mm with no manual safety for sale. Comes just as you would get buying new. Has 7 round flush mag and 8 round extended. This is less than a month old. About 150 rounds fired, functions perfectly as most S&W guns do. It is very accurate and easy to handle. Very concealable. Set on price. Was holding it for someone as a favor to a friend and then they flaked, so it is available again.

If interested, please contact me by phone/text at REDACTED. You should have an Indiana ID and valid handgun permit and we will do a bill of sale. If not, we can do transfer at FFL. OH, please be 21 or older (I know 18 is legal, but my own rule). Thanks for looking and have a good day."

I will not post a detailed description of this item as you probably already know what your looking for and you can google the details yourself.  This is the 5.56/.223 version with 1/2-28 threading (typical AR-15).  I also have the version for 308/AR-10 for sale on ARMSList as well.

I had this on an AR-15 and shot about 100 rounds through it before replacing it with a muzzle device that would accept a screw on accessory I purchased.  It is in like new condition with original packaging.  It looks good on any rifle and is effective for a good price.  Most likely you will want to attach it with a crush or peel washer so the openings can be timed such that the closed space is facing down.

Be warned that this bad boy is so dangerous that within 5 minutes of posting on eBay, not only was it de-listed, but an eBay employee personally called me to explain their firearm and ""assault weapons"" policy--the short story is these flash hiders are such dangerous parts they are not allowed even if intended for ""non-assualt"" type weapons (I assume because obviously putting this on any firearm makes it an assault weapon, I guess!).  Get yours today! :)

Since I occasionally sell things on eBay as 'rahender1' you can check that I have a 100% positive feedback rating over 10+ years, so you can trust that I will get the item to you.  I can ship for around $5 with priority mail or less with regular mail--contact me with your zip code for exact quote.  PayPal payment is preferred for shipping or cash if you pick it up.

I will not post a detailed description of this item as you probably already know what your looking for and you can google the details yourself.  This is the 308 version with 5/8-24 threading (typical AR-10).  I have a listing for the AR-15 version also.

I had this on an AR-10 and never shot it before replacing it with a muzzle device that would accept a screw on accessory I purchased.  It is in like new condition with original packaging.  It looks good on any rifle and is effective for a good price.  Most likely you will want to attach it with a crush or peel washer so the openings can be timed such that the closed space is facing down.

Be warned that this bad boy is so dangerous that within 5 minutes of posting on eBay, not only was it de-listed, but an eBay employee personally called me to explain their firearm and ""assault weapons"" policy--the short story is these flash hiders are such dangerous parts they are not allowed even if intended for ""non-assualt"" type weapons (I assume because obviously putting this on any firearm makes it an assault weapon, I guess!).  Get yours today! :)

Since I occasionally sell things on eBay as 'rahender1' you can check that I have a 100% positive feedback rating over 10+ years, so you can trust that I will get the item to you.  I can ship for around $5 with priority mail or less with regular mail--contact me with your zip code for exact quote.  PayPal payment is preferred for shipping or cash if you pick it up.

Please contact me if you have questions.  Thanks for looking."

With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Research & Development teams, developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF. The TAVOR® was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the “father of the TAVOR,” spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities – seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, the TAVOR underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies in the world. IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication to craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR SAR rifle. TAVOR® SAR Features Include: -Bullpup configuration allows for short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy -Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease-of-use -Clean, long stroke piston operation -Detachable, cold hammer-forged barrel (CHF), chrome-lined with 1:7 twist, CrMoV steel -Optional 9mm Parabellum conversion kit with CHF barrel, 1:10 twist, CrMoV steel -100% ambidextrous configuration and operation with optional left-hand bolts for 5.56 NATO. No additional parts required to convert 9mm Parabellum to LH configuration -Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles with push button swivels -Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies -Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR SAR parts -Last round - bolt holds open on an empty magazine -All metal parts treated for corrosion resistance -Integral rubber recoil pad"

This compensator does a great job of reducing muzzle rise without creating flash or too much concussion. It effectively reduces a good amount of recoil as well (not the same thing as muzzle rise). I need to put a different muzzle device on my AR so that it will work with my suppressor, so this one needs to go.

This is not a beat up police trade in, its in .40 caliber, in very nice shape with night sights. Has the nice DAK trigger, which if you aren't familiar with gives it a consistent trigger pull for each shot instead of a da/sa transition, eliminating that ""problem"", while also being much better than a normal DAO trigger. Will come in its original case and 4 twelve round magazines, a paddle holster, and around 125 rounds of .40.

History:
The 10-year Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) was passed by the U.S. Congress on September 13, 1994, and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton the same day. The ban only applied to weapons manufactured after the date of the ban's enactment. The Act expired on September 13, 2004. Ruger still made the Mini-14 magazines in 20 rounds, but during those years, they had to have the stamp, ""RESTRICTED LAW ENFORCEMENT / GOVERNMENT USE ONLY"" to indicated they were restricted to civilians. This is a pair of those historic magazines. The markings on the box: Strum, Ruger & Co. Inc.

It is a German Occupational Army pistol with matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel. Both also have the Nazi Eagle over Swastika proof marks and designation of AaW140. A great piece of history with matching serial numbers. I have shot this pistol and it shoots like a dream. What a conversation piece!



BROWNING HISTORIAN: After contacting Glen, the Browning historian it was determined this exact pistol was produced for the German Occupational Army between 1940-1944. By the serial number the best info we can determine this was made approximately in 1941. With limited records, it is difficult to determine the exact date. If this pistol could talk I bet it would have some great stories to tell!



PROOF MARKINGS: The frame is marked with the German Eagle over swastika, the WaA140 acceptance mark, the front left side of the trigger guard is marked “H” and the right side has the serial number “168294”. The barrel is marked with an “Eagle” and “168294”. The bottom of the frame next to the magazine well is marked “L” and what appears to be a C inside of a circle. These are difficult to see, however if they are important, please request more details and we can try to view it with a jewelers loops.



SERIAL AND DATING: Belgium Browning manufactured approximately in 1941, a very low serial number. The “168294” serial number is the lowest serial number I have viewed on Gunbroker or anywhere else!



GRIPS: These appear to the be correct walnut grips in good condition for their age. Checkering still present and in good condition.



BARREL: Approximately 4 3/4"" barrel with good bore and rifling.



ACTION: Very smooth and crisp action. This was test fired and worked well for me.



MAGAZINE: These appears to be a very old magazine. Not certain if this is the original magazine but I can take more pic if this is important to know.



HISTORY: FN commissioned John Browning to design a new military sidearm conforming to this specification. Browning had previously sold the rights to his successful M1911 U.S. Army automatic pistol to Colt's Patent Firearms, and was therefore forced to design an entirely new pistol while working around the M1911 patents. Browning built two different prototypes for the project in Utah and filed the patent for this pistol in the United States on June 28, 1923 and granted on February 22, 1927.[5][6] One was a simple blowback design, while the other was operated with a locked-breech recoil system. Both prototypes utilized the new staggered magazine design (by designer Dieudonné Saive) to increase capacity without unduly increasing the pistol's grip size or magazine length. By 1931, the Hi-Power design incorporated a shortened 13-round magazine, a curved rear grip strap, and a barrel bushing that was integral to the slide assembly. By 1934, the Hi-Power design was complete and ready to be produced. It was first adopted by Belgium for military.



I may consider trades. I am currently looking for a Inglis Hi Power with the original shoulder stock that is NFA exempt.

727,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3821727,For Sale:  For Sale: NFA Trust (Complete package including free assistance with ATF Forms),"Texas, Texas, United States",$ 199,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 28, 2015",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"100% Success rate. Guaranteed to be accepted by the ATF or your money back. Period. No questions asked.

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.

As a Texas lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!

This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me. I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.


What the Trust includes:

- The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms)
- Appointment of Trustee (1 Page)
- Trustee resignation (1 Page)

I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.

Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***"

buttplate, with a gleaming Brasslite receiver and barrel band. The classic
styling will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America's
Old West, when company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original
Henry lever action rifle. Adding to the historic authenticity is the
adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. Small game hunters and plinkers will
appreciate its substantial 6.75 lb. heft. It balances well and makes for
highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry
rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness, and left-handed
shooters can safely use any of Henry's lever action rifles.

I acquired this gun through a trade deal about two weeks ago.  I had every intention of keeping it until I ran across a great deal on a SA MC Operator.  The original owner (I'm the second) informed me that he had never fired the pistol, and I never fired it either.  I did breakdown the pistol, cleaned it, and from what I can tell the only rounds that were put through it were the test rounds from the factory.  The pistol comes with two (8) round magazines, night sights, and hard case. 

Buds sells this pistol for 962.00 cash price.  I figure with the buyer saving tax and TICS 825.00 is a fair price.  

Buyer must be able to legally own a handgun in the state of TN, and be willing to travel to Murfreesboro (or relatively close) and meet in a public venue.  I am not interested in trades at this time.
