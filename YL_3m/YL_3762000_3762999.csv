(Serial numbers do not match!) Hk  contacted us in regards to this incorrectly labeled handgun and instead of us having to return it, they allowed for us to keep it in inventory for sale. An email from the distribution center will be provided for clarification. In most cases, the handgun is returned to the Manufacturer so that makes this one a little more rare.

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

With the introduction of the P938, Sig Sauer now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SigLite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380 ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

The strion flashlight is a rechargeable tactical flashlight. To avoid unnecessarily having to remove the light from the rifle to charge it, I acquired a second one so all I had to do was swap the batteries around. Two charging bases, one AC adapter, and one car charger will be included with the lights. One of the lights is brand new, and currently mounted on the rifle. The other is used, but functions and charges like new. 

This is a package deal. I will not sell or trade any of it separately. I'm also not interested in selling for cash. Cash can be included on top of a trade to even things up, but I'm not going to sell it outright for cash. 

The streamlight tlr1 shown in the photo is not included. Photo is of the rifle before I decided to go with the different lighting option.

(.380) Very minimal wear and tear if any, price is pretty firm, let me know what you are thinking for trades, trades welcome but I would prefer cash to buy a bigger handgun. Thanks for looking!"

1: A full box
2: The entire box was what was on the label

I think the Ranger ammo is lead free.  There is no lead warning on the box and the projectiles don't appear to have a lead core.  

The other 20 rounds from the box are not readily identifiable.  I won't trust them to be a specific type of ammunition, therefore I have relegated them to the can of mixed 9mm to be fired when I get around to building an AR-9.

Ordinarily, when a person buys a box of defensive ammo, he or she gets a box of 20 or 25 and spends about $1/round.  Given the nature and rarity of what I am selling, I am placing the price at $20.  I prefer to do business in a public place.  If you have a can of Trail Boss powder and want these rounds, I want to talk and I'm willing to add a reasonable amount of cash."

Website Description:
Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. Even with a machined receiver, the VZ2008 is lighter than most similarly styled firearms with a sheet metal receiver. Our semi-auto version features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a quality U.S. made barrel. All metal parts are bead blasted and coated with a non reflective finish.

Bought this new a few weeks ago for my wife as a HD or carry gun. The recoil on such a small frame is too much for her and I don't see us taking this to the range and practicing very often. Got her a snub nose 38 instead.

Gun is almost new in box, just purchased from dealer. Still has warranty card etc. Comes with everything you see in the photos. Has about 100 round through it with no problems. Comes with 25 rounds that she did not use. This is the new striker fired one with the nice clean trigger break, like a glock, it is not DA/SA like the old models.

I've shot about 75 rounds through this rifle, and it has performed flawlessly. I simply don't have enough time to go to the range and use it like I had intended. I've got roughly 250 rounds of ammunition for it. Mixture of steel cased and brass. I also have a hefty aluminum case with it, 4 latches and nice foam inside. Foam is 100%, nothing wrong.

I'm throwing in a 3x12x44mm rifle scope with it, along with a Barska 1x30 M-16 scope as well. Comes with 3 30rd Magpul magazines(Two black, one green), 1 10rd magainze, magpul foregrip, and all of the magpul furniture on the rifle already. 

I'm in no real rush to sell, and I understand you can buy this rifle brand new for less than my asking price. You can't find a better bargain for a ""like-new"" QUALITY AR-15 for sale with everything included. This will make a great starter package, and has everything ready to go. If you find something that someone else has for sale, that is similar, I'll beat their price. But I feel confident you won't, this is a great deal and I am 100% confident about that.

My phone number is REDACTED if you have questions, if you want more pictures I can send more. $775 or best offer. I'm open to offers, but low offers will be ignored. Give me an offer that isn't insulting. I would only trade for handguns of equal or greater value. I do not want revolvers or old firearms. Very clean rifle, and thank you for your time."

Really nice shooting gun, I get baseball sized groupings at 100 yards with cheap russian surplus ammo. 

The one thing wrong with the gun is that i drilled the scope mount holes slightly off center, i fixed this by putting shims in the scope rings, the gun shot perfectly fine. A few weeks ago i tried fixing this by re-drilling the scope rail and messed it up. It is a very easy fix, you can mess around with the rail i still have for it, or get a new one for 30$ from amazon.

Rifle features a Tapco G-2 trigger set and a U.S. grip and is fully 922r compliant with all AK-74 mags regardless of country of origin. Rifles also incorporate a side rail for easy installation of scope rails or accessories.

New $619.

AK-74 Accessory package, 4 30rnd parts kits, mag pouch, bayonet and oil bottle. $169

2 Tapco 30rnd parts kits $24

900rnds 7n6 ""banned"" ammo. Full case $240 Since its a partial case I'll value it at $200

AK ergo grip, so you can actually hold the rifle. $20

Kvar O.D. green ""NATO"" length stock, A inch longer to fit us decadent capitalist pigs in the West. I have both the original stock and grip that will go with it. $47

""Venezuelan"" PK-A red dot. A excellent red dot that was built for the Venuzualian Army by the Russians. The great thing about this particular sight it that it uses a regular AA battery and it sits low enough to co-witness the stock AK sights. It also allows a proper cheek weld on the rifle a huge plus. $400

Total price if bought separate $1479

My price $1200. Non negotiable! 

No Trades unless your looking to trade a M1A Loaded with a stainless barrel.

I will not break up the package it's all or nothing, sorry I just don't want to deal with all the hassle. I'm in no hurry to sell, I really have no need to sell just trying to diversify my collection so the price is the price. Don't bother contacting me saying ""I found all this stuff at the gun store for $30."" If you did, great, buy it. Don't bother telling me.

You want to do the Dealer thing you line it up, and cover the fees.

I wont travel out of the Denver Metro area so I hope your local or willing to travel.

Sorry to come off like a dick, but I think we all know how this site can be sometimes."

It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters. The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety. Lifetime Warranty From Davidson's (Owner responsible for return shipping costs)
