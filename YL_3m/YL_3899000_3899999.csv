I've been living on my own for a couple years now in the Commerce City area. I was emancipated at 16, and have run into a few problems. There have been 2 break ins where I live (I was only present for one, but was severely beaten). I was wondering if anybody on here can sell me a shotgun or a rifle to protect myself if need be within my home. I don't intend to even use it, so I'm not looking to spend much on it, however I don't want to have to take another beating from somebody who breaks into my sanctuary... Or worse. It would be so appreciated if somebody could help me out, as well as teach me how to handle the firearm and give me some safety tips. Maybe even take me out to shoot it sometime. I'm not looking to buy from just anybody, but somebody who can teach me how to be safe as well. I know it's a lot to ask. But I would like to try anyways. Thanks so much."

 It is in great shape, and is a really nice sword and it looks great. I currently have it on display on our mantle with some other artifacts and it is quite a conversation piece.

 This belonged to my departed grandfather and is from the early 1900's. It is a real sword and is absolutely not a toy. The scabbard may be silver or silver-plated. I am firm on price.

Yes, it is still available. Emails asking if it is available, or that do not specifically reference this item will be deleted and not responded to since spammers waste a lot of our time.

The gun is 90% clean, lots of steel and wood. It's just made the old fashioned way. Lots of durable steel parts that feel solid and reliable.

Incredible design. John Moses Browning really outdid himself when he designed the Model 94. The mechanism is smooth and precise. The ergonomics are practically perfect. The action is strong and simply not prone to wearing out.

Solid lockup. The John Browning design was created to handle the newest type of ammunition in the world at the time: smokeless powder loads. And it is still handling them. The Model 94 has been chambered in some of the meanest calibers ever developed for fast action in brushy conditions.

It's a lifetime gun. Some rifles come and go, but a Model 94 just builds a lifetime of memories. It is one gun that your family will appreciate long after you are gone. It's a gun your great grandson will learn to shoot with. Timeless. That is why I have two of them!

Today's great barrels mean the 94 is more accurate than ever. And there are more bullet choices too. And factory ammo is a lot more affordable than some other calibers, making it something you can afford to shoot.

110 years ago my ancestors bought 94s because they were cool, fast handling and had high magazine capacity.

Our most recent assignment is door-to-door petition work in Reno and Sparks in order to get an effect on the 2016 ballot that, if passed, would require background checks for unlicensed gun sales. My agency has brought in ~200 people on buses from Seattle, Portland, and Tacoma to try to push this through before the deadline on Wednesday.
Although I am unfamiliar with the Reno area, I came here expecting a high amount of opposition in the form of slammed doors and rude refusals. Nevada is a red state and even in uber-liberal Washington this is really just part of the job. What I found strange was the fact that they couldn't just pay people in Reno to do this work. Why was our agency paying to bring people in from Washington and Oregon, 15-12 hours away?
Last night, during a 3-9pm shift, some things happened to my co-workers that have made me think that we were brought in because locals KNOW BETTER than to do liberal canvassing here. One woman was assaulted and mugged right after the sun went down in Sparks. This was only a couple of blocks from where my friend and roommate was working. The cops picked my friend up and told him to leave because they believed a group of people were riding around in a truck looking for canvassers to beat up. At least five of my co-workers were verbally assaulted or followed at night. One woman had a shotgun pulled on her at a door and was then followed by the gun-owner, who had the gun with him in his car. A black co-worker had a pistol pulled on him and put to his head at a door. I have been kicked out of neighborhoods by homeowners, mostly gated communities, screamed at, told to fuck off, and have been greeted by men behind doors holding knives defensively. I understand that no one likes to hear their doorbell ring in the middle of dinner, but we are only doing our jobs. We are not soliciting as we are not selling anything. Everything we are doing is perfectly legal within our constitutional right to free speech.
I opted out of the pm shift tonight because I legitimately fear for my safety and many others have done the same. Most of our problems came up when we started working in Sparks and, although the agency has claimed they are not sending people there anymore, I know of four people who had turf in that area this morning. Locals - what neighborhoods are considered unsafe here in Reno and Sparks? Where would you not want to find yourself alone with a gun control petition after dark? We need your help to protect ourselves while we continue to just do our jobs here. I would hate to see another person threatened or assaulted before I leave.

http://www.hkparts.net/shop/pc/HK91-PTR-91-Sniper-Trigger-Group-308-106p17031.htm

Upgraded bolt group: http://www.hkparts.net/shop/pc/HK-91-G3-PTR-91-Semi-Bolt-Group-Complete-US-113p1473.htm

Price does not include the scope, but we could possible make something happen. The bipod pictured comes with it and is a cheap UTG, but does it's job.

This model runs around $2,400 and then add the upgrades to that. This is a very good deal. The new MSG's run $1,700 and they are not the same quality, precision or accuracy."

It has (installed by a previous owner) those rubberized grip panels and a 3.5lb trigger connector. The gun is in very good condition with, ballpark, a few hundred rounds through it. Am too lazy to dig it out of the safe to take a pic. It looks like a Gen 3 Glock 26 with rubber grip panels. Will take pics for a serious offer. Anyway I recently acquired a Kahr 9mm for CCW and am looking to trade this newly redundant handgun for a larger pistol. 

I am specifically looking to make a strait trade for a gen 3 Glock 19 or 17 9mm. Can swap mag for mag up to 3 or 4 (will have to see how many 26 mags I've got).

 This is a very nice pistol and is very accurate, but it is very picky about what ammo you use.
 Of course it likes the high quality CCI, Winchester ect. But it will shoot anything but some times will not feed correctly, it could be that the feed ramp needs a polish or the magazine 
 This is a great little pistol and fits great in the hand.

I am selling these together as a pair so please don't ask if I would just sell one of them, because I will not respond to that question.

Only selling these because I want something different.

Welcome, welcome. Happy 2015 and all that. So, you are looking for a nice subcompact, hmm? Perhaps from a trusted company, with all the features akin to a 1911 but with a double-stack magazine? Maybe you don't like polymer pistols- don't worry, I won't judge. Possibly, you could be here because you like rare or interesting things.

Well, I do have something interesting for you, if you are in fact still interested.

 This is a CZ RAMI, also known as the 2075. In the Czech Republic (where it was born), it is the most common CCW pistol (the Czech Republic is a 'shall issue' country, rare for Europe), from the fine gun craftsmen at CZ, who despite being little-known in the US, have been *the* go to pistol makers for most of Europe and the rest of the world. The Distributor is CZ USA, in Kansas. Fear not, it is stamped ""MADE IN CZECH REPUBLIC"" on the opposite side.

 This model in particular is the ""alloy"" model, made of lighter (but equally strong) metal than its heavier predecessor and (discontinued) polymer cousins.

 The Pistol is an ""A"" series, one of the 1st 1000 made. It was made in 2003 during the dark era known as the Assault Weapons Ban, therefore coming with two 10 round magazines, which can be supplemented with floorplates or just by sticking CZ75 magazines in it. It has glow sights which sit quite high for a very clear sight picture.

  The pistol is interesting in the way the action is a DA/SA, but has a SAO style (CZ or 1911) safety system. It can be carried hammer down, safety off (the DA trigger is stout enough to act as a safety in itself, like a revolver), half cocked or fully cocked with safety on. The controls are generously-sized and ergonomically-superb.

  Accuracy? I love the accuracy of this pistol. It is amazingly smooth to shoot with little to no felt recoil. I would go so far as to recommend this SubCompact to the arthritic, elderly, novice or female (no sexism, just going from patterns of things countless female shooters have told me they prefer in a semi-auto). The reliability is superb, with zero-failures in its loyal service rendered unto me. This is the Mercedes Benz of subcompacts- reliable, dutiful and still resplendent with class and head-turning distinction. 

Prices for these guns range from 575-600+, according to research done to compare prices. However, I am a believer that a used gun is a used gun. Too many unsavory individuals are selling used guns at MSRP and I shall not partake of such thievery. My price is fair appeasement value, quite literally ""by the book""

You will receive two (2) magazines. The pistol is superb and I am more than willing to even sweeten the deal by offering the original box, a TSA-approved hardened steel safe-type case with key or a nice CZ case of a later model CZ pistol I own (simulated leather texture, black with gold closure snaps).

I do not want your Hi-points, your Lorcins, Rugers, or anything of the like. My ""trade"" list is below. I will most likely not deviate from that.

This is a newer production model and was NOT included in the ACR Safety Recall Program of 2010.

The collapsible stock also has a built-in cheek riser, folds to the left, and will still fire while folded. Also has a PWS FSC556 muzzle brake. This is a piston-driven rifle that runs very clean and has ambidextrous controls. The barrel can also be easily swapped out for it to fire 6.8 SPC rounds. 

It comes with (1) black Magpul PMAG. I really enjoy having this rifle and the only reason I am getting rid of it is because I am more familiar with a tradition AR platform. However, I would not mind keeping this one.

This gun has done a lot of sitting in the last couple decades. I recently took it in on trade, but I have my heart set on a couple other guns. I took the rifle completely apart last night and gave it a cleaning like it's never seen before. Upon teardown, I found that the action is not very worn at all. I cleaned and oiled the entire thing down to the trigger springs. This gun has no trouble cycling ammo. The only downfall to this rifle is the pitting on the receiver.
