Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers — only in a smaller, more concealable design.
The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 - 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 - 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.

The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter's hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.
A set of abbreviated ""industry standard"" mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines."

      I have long been a Civil War artillery re-enactor, and it's about time I have my own cannon. I have also decided to get back into the black powder game at large, and what better way to start than to scrounge the surrounding countryside for the biggest, loudest ""firearm"" there is? I'll start with the basics:


Let me state firstly that I will not consider any display pieces that cannot be converted back to a live-fire state(unless you are literally giving it away, in which case, I'd happily take it. I'll even pay for it's shipping). All of my collection is taken out and used regularly, I have no fake or faux guns, and I certainly don't want a fake cannon. Just a clarifying point, in case you have some Hollywood guns lying around. I should also say that the price will differ based on what kind of cannon you are offering. I tried to do a slide-list for pricing($100-$10,000) but Armslist didn't like that. So, I won't be paying you $10,000.00USD for a golf ball cannon, for example.


Conversely, I am also uninterested in true historical cannons(unless it is both awesome and less expensive than a small private island). I would feel terrible firing off a real Revolutionary War cannon, so reproductions(or your own designs) are the name of the game. Now, on to the search:



-Primarily, I am looking for a full-scale, fully-functional black powder cannon. Ideally, I am looking for what is sometimes called a 'Parrott Rifle' or 'Parrott Gun'; a 3-in ordnance gun is it's true name. Known for ""being able to hit a flour barrel dead center at anything under a mile"", this cannon was one of the first to be rifled, and the first to use shaped shells. For reference, it is the third gun back in the picture. Failing a true Ordnance Gun, I would consider quite literally anything cannon shaped that is capable of launching iron balls over long distances, accurately. That last word is important; I will look at 16th century style cannons, but I probably won't buy it, considering that it's essentially a very big musket; it's as much luck as it is skill to hit something with them. Please note, while I am primarily looking for historical weaponry, though I will take a look at anyone's pool ball cannons, bowling ball mortars, etc. 


-I would mostly like a field carriage, so I can tow it behind my truck, but naval carriages and siege carriages are acceptable as well, especially for small cannons, such as golf ball cannons. Those I can just throw in the truck bed. Field carriages are a must for any cannon over an 18-pounder, unless it is really, really cool. This requirement obviously precludes siege guns, which are by nature(and physics) not mounted on a field carriage.


-Bonus points if your cannon has a flint/percussion firing system. Fuses are fine but I feel they take away from your control of the gun. Plus, half the fun is giving the lanyard a sharp yank and feeling the shockwave bowl you over. I have them installed on all my guns; the flintlocks are my favorite, but percussion wins out because of it's ability to fire in the rain. Northwest Oregon is an unforgiving place for flintlock fans. Don't be put-off from contacting me if you just have a touch-hole cannon; I have several machinists on-call who take care of installing the firelock system, even on older cannons, as the vast majority of cannons do not have these wonderful devices.


-A HUGE bonus to the 'cool factor' if you have a siege gun, of any caliber. Mobile or immobile, I love 'em all, but for black powder, the bigger the better. 'Siege gun' herein refers to large-bore cannons; mortars are sometimes referred to as 'siege guns', but I have a mortar, and one is plenty. I prefer the more direct action/result of a cannon shot. It's hardly satisfying to watch your mortar ball(ie, your money) sail away over a hill side, and since I don't have any convenient enemy fortresses in Oregon to besiege, cannons it is.


-Carriages are important but I would really like to have just the physical cannon. I have a company lined up, ready to make my own carriage to my specs. That being said, I won't say no to a nice field carriage. Cannon-makers and carriage-makers may consider this ad an open invitation to contact me. I am always on the lookout for better deals from companies; if you think you can offer a better service, please contact me.


-Any accessories for cannons; ammunition crates, powder charge carriers, rammers, sponges, etc.


-I'm looking also for any basic ironworks equipment; I will likely end up casting my own cannonballs, so no advanced equipment needed. Just the mold and melter is all I need. Any sabot molds I will look at, regardless of caliber.


-In addition to cannons, I love all things artillery. If it's artillery and it functions, I'd love to look at it. The price scale may not be accurate for something more modern than a muzzle-loader(I was offered a WWII QF 25-pounder for $20,000, for example), however, but I assure you we will find a fair price that both of us are happy with.


-My final point is items of trade. I have a slew of firearms and ammunition, not to mention accessories, for trade or sale. These include(but can change weekly):

-Lee Enfield No.1 Mk. IV
-Mosin Nagants(91/30's, Type 53's, PU Snipers)
-Zastava M-70's.
-All the 7.62 you could ever want, some 9mm and odd rounds as well.


And if the firearms(or money) doesn't interest you, I also have a few random things, including:

-Ping-Pong Table(Full-size)
-Pool Table (Full-size, Saloon style)
-Snowboards(Adult)
-Guitars(One Electric, one acoustic)
-Civil War Saber(Replica, but is 'chromed' and so looks very pretty.)



Feel free to contact me anytime with questions, comments, concerns, etc. If you do have a cannon for offer, I would truly appreciate pictures in the first email(as my first reply would be 'can you send pictures?' anyways), but we'll hash out the details in a personal communique. 

Please note, depending on price and size of cannon, we may have to work out a payment plan and delivery system. If that is the case, I will have my lawyer draft a simple legal document(worded in plain English, not legalise) that should put both parties at ease. I understand that distrust is natural when dealing with someone you've never met, especially online, so I try to be as accommodating as I can in terms of making you feel comfortable. As always, don't hesitate to contact me for any reason.



Kind Regards Armslist, the ball's in your court.

133,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3487133,Want To Buy:  ANY & ALL Black Powder Muzzleloaders & Accessories,"NE Portland, Portland, Oregon","$ 1,000","Listed On: Tuesday, February 3, 2015",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello Armslist,



    I've been out of the black powder game for a while, and I think it's about time to get back in. I'm looking for any black powder firearms, but I am specifically keeping my eyes open for a few ones.


Firstly, I'd like to say that I am primarily looking for traditional (herein meaning 'made of steel and wood') pieces. I will look at anything but traditional pieces will get priority if there are multiple offers. I had intended for the price to be a scale ($100-$1,000), to allow for used firearms, but Armslist didn't like that. I prefer used(even broken in some cases) to brand new almost every time.

Secondly, I cannot take anything with major rust damage or major pitting. I'm not a gunsmith, and so my ability to repair metal is limited. Missing pieces is not good, but not a deal-breaker. Barrel damage, however, is. There is no (economical) way to repair a shot-out or powder-fouled barrel, so if you've got a damaged barrel, that is an automatic 'pass'.

Finally, let me say I am not interested in fake, faux or 'display' firearms(unless it's free. I'll always take free guns, working or not); if it doesn't fire live ammunition, I simply don't have the money to spare on non-firing firearms. They look cool, but that's about it. Conversely, neither am I interested in actual historical firearms. I would feel awful shooting an original Brown Bess, so reproductions are the name of the game. 

     Quite literally everything in my collection is taken out and shot a bare minimum of once a year, and most get range use at least every few weeks, so I avoid fancy guns like the plague. Now, on to what I am seeking:


-Rifled muzzle-loaders: Muskets are cool and I will definitely consider any that you care to offer, but accurate black powder is what I love. Ideally, an 1861 Springfield Rifled Musket, .58 cal, would be perfect. However, they are around $1,000 new. Yikes. I don't really care for the modern synthetic muzzleloaders, but I have a few plans rattling around for conversion ideas, so I will definitely take a look at what you have.

-Military rifles: I definitely prefer military models to civilian versions. I have a soft spot for bayonets, and so I can't help but get disappointed at things like the Traditions Co. Kentucky Rifle or the Hawken; no bayonet lugs or rings, no sling mounts, not even a cleaning kit included. That being said, I will always look at everything. The worst thing I can say is no, and even regarding firearms I haven't ended up buying, I try to help the seller generate some interest in the piece.

-Blunderbuss: Nothing much to say about these guys. Short, but fun.

-Pistols: I don't know much about them, but they are still cool. Rifles are my forte, and in the pistol world I am limited to Civil War-era(or 1911's), but I will look at any of them.



In case you're less of a seller and more of a trader, I have quite a few firearms(and random things) up for sale or trade, if you prefer that to straight cash:

-Lee Enfield No.1 Mk. IV
-Mosin Nagants of all shapes and sizes
-Lots of ammo, mostly 7.62's
-Pool Table(full size)
-Ping-Pong Table
-Snowboards


As always feel free to email me anytime.

Kind Regards,



Thomas"

I have a used 16""M4 profile barrel, with an A2 flash hider, Huldra piston gas block, bolt, and three magazines. Barrel is in great shape. The old gas block was pinned and there is minor surface wear, but the bore is immaculate. Old had about 700-800 Rd through it and cleaned and oiled religiously. 

The mags are all 30rds, and never gave me an issue. 

It's out of a Huldra, which is made by Adams arms so I'm assuming the barrel and bolt are both made by voodoo innovations. 

I also have 2 cans (2160rds) of 7n6 (5.45x39) that I'll throw in for the right price

I love the feel of this gun in my hand more than any other gun I own (including my other HK, my Sigs, etc.). I have accumulated too many handguns and for a carry piece, I think I am going in another direction. (I have a CZ SDP compact, Beretta Px4 compact, Ruger LC9 subcompact, Ruger LCP micro, etc.).  There are zero issues with this gun and I'd like to find a good home for it. Comes with two 10-round mags and an extra size backstrap.  

The many upgrades include tritium night sights, V1 factory enhanced ""light"" LEM trigger system (trigger pull is closer to striker weight), two additional 12 round mags from the P2000 compact, with two X-Grips (only one pictured) for added purchase with the extended mags, so four mags total.  I have put through I dunno, about 400 rounds, but it still looks almost new and is just broken in.  Kept it well-maintained as this has been my EDC/primary home defense piece for the past several months.

Since I require cash, I am not interested in trades.  I have over $1200 into this item, so I gotta get a decent price.  I have dropped the price some, but I'd rather keep it than give it away! 

I am a good guy to deal with on gun transfers and always do my best to price things fairly.  If you shoot .40, I know you will be VERY happy with this gun.  Thanks! :-)"

Custom walnut stock has 8 coats of hand rubbed Marine polyurethane. One of the best looking finished stocks on Armslist. 
No crack or crazing in stock behind back-strap. Great looking rifle with a beautiful bore.
Has the button safety. We all know about the safety/no safety debate.
Smart hunters look for cross bolt safety models, no safety models are for ""safe queens"".
My neighbor will be glad to tell how he almost lost his foot after a hog hunt.
One of his hunting party buds, was de-cocking the hammer in the rain with no safety.
You can figure out the rest. Always have weapon pointed in a safe direction.
He wears a size 10. Thinks if he was a size 12 or larger, he may have been in trouble.
No haggle, no hassle, priced to sell at reduced price of $325.

Long-range rifle shooters (and even short-range ones) know that consistency on target means taking yourself out of the stabilization equation and supporting that rifle with some sort of bipod, tripod, rest, or front & rear bags. We’ve long suffered with having to take multiple bags on trips to the range or into the field because you never know how much elevation you need your bags to provide. Crusader Gear has engineered a solution by making one bag that can be configured in a number of different ways in order to provide the maximum functionality.
Use it flat when you just need a little, or fold it in half, use it like a mini A-frame, or stand it up on end when you need the most support under the buttstock or forend of your rifle. The one-inch webbing strap serves as a carry strap, a handle, or cinches the bag in half to help it maintain its position without slipping or flattening out.

Crusader Gear’s Multi-Position Rifle Bag is constructed of 1000D Cordura nylon and filled with poly pellets that will not absorb moisture, so this bag will not get heavier in the rain or humid air. No more weighing down your rucksack, range bag or drag bag with multiple shooting bags. This one can do it all.

It comes with everything you see in the pictures. On the rifle is a Magpul ACS (slanted cheekrest with storage) STYLED buttstock (picked it up at a gunshow for a lot cheaper than actual Magpul) and it is solid. On the buttstock is a removable single mag pouch for grab n go (I keep one in the mag n one in the pouch). It has a Blackhawk pistol grip, and a Tuff Zone spring loaded polymer rear flip up sight. I just got the Quick Detach red-dot with riser sight from amazon and haven't had a chance to really sight it in (used to have a rifle scope on it), but it got rave reviews and seems solid and is metal. I have a Magpul brand forend on it, and a detachable adjustable (condor?) sling. It also comes with a M10 bayonet. Rifle comes with 5 30 round magazines. The original Windham aluminum, and 4 CAA polymer window mags, which is what the Israeli army uses (they seem to know a little bit about war). I also just picked up a condor chest rig that has 3 double-stack (6 mags) open top M4 bungee-kangaroo mag pouches with 4 pistol mags on the front. And to top it all off, I'm throwing in the Skull camo rifle bag with 4 double stack pouches and other storage. This rifle has been nothing but reliable, and like all Windham rifles comes with a transferable lifetime warranty. I'm wanting to get a couple pistols, so that's why I'm selling, and its for the package-no ""parting out"". I'm asking $1,250 which is more than fair for all you get, but it could be negotiable as I'd like to unload it asap. Text me to get the quickest response. Face to face in Dallas please. 2one4-2seven4-five9seven5. Thanks for lookin."

I originally bought it for my Cavalry display at home but no longer need it. It's the case hardened steel frame version. The conversion cylinder also never been used and it's the 5 round model. I want $325 or B/O for both items. But if u prefer just the pistol, the price is $200. The R&D conversion cylinder by it self is $175, no trades. If you are only interested in the conversion kit, I'd suggest you to bring your pistol to make sure that it's a good fit. The cylinder had a minor gunsmithing done to fit my pistol. It was way too snug at first. 

Remember, even with the conversion kit you should only use low velocity cowboy loads with this pistol. 45LC loads are available in most gun shops.

OK, so I just broke down this AMERICAN LEGEND down to the frame and polished every stainless steel part to give this classic firearm a facelift. This gun looks and fires GREAT! Along with giving it a revamp, I purchased 2 extra magazines, new Hogue grips to replace the hard factory plastic ones, and a nice hard carry case since most 5096's don't come with one. This thing is AWESOME and I don't mind keeping it to be honest, I am just testing the waters to see whats out there. 

So in total, the gun comes with 3 mags. 1 is the factory 15 rounder and the 2 new ones are factory 10 round mags. New Hogue grips and a new hard gun case. If needed I can provide invoices for the new purchases. 

Notice, this is for trade only. And with the work I put into it plus the extras I bought to make it a complete package, the value is around 500-550. You can email or text 843-406-365one"
