This is a great carry gun. It has served me well. It is lightweight, slim, accurate and just overall, a fun gun to shoot. Unfortunately i must part with it and a few of my other carry pistols due to my relocation to Los Angeles, California. (NO CONCEALED CARRY IN CA) I had the pistol professionally stippled to provide an improved grip and more consistent hold when firing. The pistol comes with 3 magazines (2 seven round & 1 eight round), and it also comes with a custom kydex IWB (Inside the Waistband) holster.

I am asking $400

This gun has been seen roughly 250 rounds. There is not a scratch on this gun, it can be considered like new. I am the original owner.

I will sell the rifle and 1 mag for $1300:
Daniel Defense DDm4v7
DD fixed sights

~500 rounds of 5.56 in an ammo can

Also included are the stock keymod rail sections.

By my calculations, this would cost close to $2000 if purchased new. The rifle cost $1500 new, the sights were $125, and the sling was around $50.
I am only asking $1300 for the gun with 1 mag, or $1500 for everything.
Do not offer me lower than my asking prices.
I am not looking for trades unless it is heavily in my favor. So in this case, it must be worth about a grand more than my asking price.

A number of AR15 rifles. Anderson and Bushmaster. Plus 80% lower.
Some are new; some virtually new. Some have been shot, and boy do they shoot well.

And (1) Nikon M223 AR15 Scope with Burrows cantilever mount. Perfect for long shots. Maybe I am missing one or two. I am willing to swap whatever is mounted on the rifle for one of the above.

The Ultratech, will forever set the standard for all out-the-front knives. Ultratech is Microtech’s original dual action out-the-front knife, and has been the foundation of our entire OTF line. Over the years, it has gone through several modifications, each time becoming more efficient and reliable. The ULTRATECH’s spring remains in an “at rest” position at all times except when deployed. This ensures that the compressed spring will not become fatigued, assuring users that when the knife is fired, it will operate effectively. Ultratech can take many different forms; it can be topped with a standard machined aluminum top or a piece of carbon fiber. The ULTRATECHS’ light weight, one handed open and close action, slim shape, and scalpel sharp blade make it a one of a kind knife, only available through Microtech. This knife has proven time and again that it can withstand any obstacle. Only time will tell what the next step will be for the ultratech series.

IL residents responsible for 7% sales tax. I will ship to your FFL. I do except credit cards with 3% added to total. Email or call REDACTED with any questions SPECS. CZC ACCU Shadow (CZC Custom Version with Match Fit Barrel) CZC MATCH BARREL & FIXED SIGHT CZC 75 SP01 ACCU Shadow #91735 USPSA Production Approved! Features *CZC Fitted Match Barrel *CZC Stainless steel barrel bushing. *CZC Stainless steel reverse plug. *CZC SHORT reset trigger system “CZC SRTS” *CZC Competition Fixed rear sight. These modifications have been added to the already customized CZ Custom SP01 Shadow Pistol. #91029 We have been very busy at the CZ Custom Shop over the last few months. We have been working and perfecting some new products and parts for the SP01 Shadow and the CZ 75 Shadow. This details the changes brought about to create the CZ 75 SP01 ACCU SHADOW. Let’s talk about the difference We have hand fitted the ""Made in the USA"" CZC Match Grade Barrel, tighter fit and tolerance then standard factory barrel. The new barrel bushing is threaded into the slide; the bushing is fitted to the barrel creating far less play than the current bushing system. The bushing also retains the new stainless steel guide plug. The bushing keeps the front sight in the slide so no pin is necessary or needed (fitting the pin will damage the bushing threads.) The bushing will need to be removed before the barrel can be taken from the gun. Ransom Rest testing at 50 yards with Fiocchi 125 JHP (A ZERO bullet) has proved group of less than 3” compared with a factory new gun at about 5.0”. At 25 yards the groups were around 1.2” a one-hole group. What’s new and very exciting is the CZC SHRT reset trigger system. People have been asking for a shorter faster reset without the trigger swinging all the way forward in SA mode, now we have it. We have taken almost all of the forward movement out of the single action position with the trigger moving on average less than a 1/16 (0.0625”) before stopping. We have basically created a 1911 single action on a double action gun."

Let me know if you have any questions.

Product Information from Midwayusa.com:

Price:
Chrony - $199.99
Case - $36.99

Description:
Advanced technology enabled CED to double the operating speed of the CED M2 chronograph incorporating a micro-controller that runs at 48 MHz. Memory storage has been expanded 500%. Stored string size can range from a single velocity up to 500 velocities and up to 500 different strings. Expanded digital chip design now gives the CED M2 the ability of reading velocities at much lower light levels. On clear days, this means the ability to chronograph from early morning till almost sunset.

The keypad has been designed in calculator-style layout. Further, the CED M2 now includes a ""Hi-Average"" function which provides ""one touch"" calculation of the average of the three highest velocities in a string. This function is ideal for calculating Power Factor at IPSC & IDPA matches. In addition, the CED M2 Chronograph adds even more features like Single function string removal, 2 ft. folding mounting bracket for all uses, the ability to recall specific strings from memory or to remove specific strings from memory, and a USB interface. Now it is easier than ever to connect your chronograph to your PC and download your saved data into the newly designed and updated CED Data Collector software program.

The Sig Sauer P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG's entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the Federal agents, and numerous law-enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. 

The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs, the fleet's special warfare operators. This railed P226, chambered in 9mm, is engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide. 10-round magazine. SigLite Night sights."

The Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish, and overall visually elegant design. 

The Golden Boy's awesome 20"" barrel, American walnut stock, brass buttplate, and gleaming Brasslite receiver will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America's Old West, when our company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original Henry lever action rifle. 

Small game hunters and plinkers will appreciate its substantial 6.75 pound heft. It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness lever-lovers long for. Get one in your hands and take aim. See what a natural pointer it really is. 

Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. The .22 LR version holds 16 rounds. The .22 Magnum and .17HMR hold 12 rounds. Both will provide a whole lot of shooting pleasure before it's time to reload their tubular magazines. 

The Henry Golden Boy is one beautiful classic that's affordably priced so you won't have to rob a stagecoach to own one. All we ask is that you mosey on down to your local gun shop and ask to see the Henry Golden Boy. You'll definitely agree it's the rifle that brings out the West in you.

 The barrel is a 1/9 twist 10.5in barrel. I am pretty sure it is chrome lined but since I did not build the gun I am not positive. 
The lower parts kit is also of unknown manufacture. But the trigger is a pretty nice GI style trigger. 

 I haven't had the gun to long (a month or so). I bought it pretty much as it sits now. When I first got it I went through the whole gun top to bottom to make sure it was properly assembled and head spaced. The thing runs and shoots great! This gun is functionally sound but it does have some cosmetic defects. on the upper and some minor scratching around the barrel nut. I am guessing it was a first time build for whoever built the gun. But I have been through the gun and ran about 150 rounds of steel cased Tula and Wolf ammo through it. Never a hickup.

     Do I have a treat for you. I recently came upon a set of modern body armor. No Vietnam-era flak jackets here, this is top-of-the-line ceramic plate, capable of stopping up to 7.62x54R rounds with ease. It is a rare event when one of these vests are made available to the public; most surplus vests are stockpiled for future combats or for use with VIP's. This is your chance to own your very own Improved Outer Tactical Vest(IOTV). Front and back plates included. This is Marine-issue; it kept our boys safe in Iraq and Afghanistan throughout the wars; now it is back home to make someone very happy. A perfect piece for any and all preppers/military enthusiasts out there.

   The listed size is medium, but with the rather ingenious 'stretching' bands on either side, it can easily fit a Large/XLarge man(I myself am XLarge, and can get it on, though it is quite snug, as body armor should be, IMO).

   This is the only set of modern body armor for sale on this side of the USA; the next-nearest advertised set is currently in Texas. This is your chance to have the one and only set of military-grade body armor; others might offer 'body armor' for a quarter of my price, but I can assure you it is 'soft-insert' Kevlar, proofed against no more than 9mm. These plates shrug off pistol and most rifle rounds at point blank range, and cover all of your vitals(all but the most important, ironically;sorry gentlemen, no groin protector on this one!). This vest can also accept side plates, throat plates, groin plates, shoulder plates, and leg plates. Get all the pieces(and best of luck on that venture, considering how rare even the vests are) and you'll be essentially bullet-proof!


    Contact me anytime via email if you have questions or would like to buy, or if you have items for trade. See below for trade information. Price is very, very firm. These vests normally sell for upwards of $3,000, pricing mine at half cost for a quick sale. The extra plates are somewhat cheaper if you're wanting to add on to this vest; side plates are about $200 each, throat and groin are about $150 each. Those are very small plates however, the expensive ones are the chest and back plates; very big, very thick, very heavy."

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. We accept cash, certified check and USPS money orders.

Trade Value $400 NOT ACCEPTING CASH AT THIS TIME
I have a S&W Shield 9mm with No Thumb safety for trade at this time. My Shield will come with everything it did new and has had 75 rounds through it. I am entertaining the idea of trading this Shield due to me wanting a 26 or 19 to replace it as a vehicle gun. This Shield is in great shape and has very few rounds through it due to it not being my primary Shield that I carry. It has set in a kydex holster after being shot at one range outing to ensure function check. Obviously if trade is worth more cash/trade will be negotiated but am not looking for a $600 Glock with tons of work being done to it.

Description
SF3P-556-1/2-28
The advanced SureFire SF3P-556-1/2-28 three-prong flash hider, which fits M4/M16 weapons and variants with 1/2x28 muzzle threads, features a patent-pending design that greatly reduces muzzle flash—typically greater than 99%—when compared with a plain muzzle. Boasting robust tines built to withstand the rigors of combat, the SF3P-556-1/2-28 also serves as a rock-solid mounting adapter for SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56 mm Fast-Attach® suppressors, the SOCOM556-RC model having placed first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted by US Special Operations Command.

Precision machined from US mill-certified heat-treated stainless steel bar stock—and including high-precision single-point cut threads for optimum thread interface—the SF3P-556-1/2-28 flash hider is given a black Ionbond DLC coating to provide maximum protection under harsh environmental conditions and to facilitate cleaning, even after extreme use.

When used in conjunction with a SureFire SOCOM Series suppressor, the patent-pending design of the SF3P-556-1/2-28 provides multiple bearing surfaces to ensure superior suppressor alignment and to prevent the audible ringing of tines inside the suppressor.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

Colt 1911 Government .22 w/Threaded Barrel

The Colt Government Model 22 is built by Carl Walther in Germany, and imported into the US.

The Government Model 22 is blowback operated, having the barrel rigidly attached to the frame. Like the centerfire 1911, the Colt Government Model 22 has a thumb safety, grip safety, magazine release, and slide lock that operate just like the centerfire 1911. This makes this Colt 22 particularly a great trainer or understudy to the centerfire 1911, as it has the same solid feel of its big brother, with a crisp trigger pull, identical trigger reach, and the same manual-of-arms as the centerfire 1911.

This Colt is finished in an overall matte black, and has a long 1911 style trigger, but with some 1911-A1 features as well. The front and rear sights are dovetailed into the frame, to allow for windage adjustment, and many aftermarket sights are available, should a different style than the plain black sights be desired. Like the centerfire 1911, the slide locks open on an empty magazine. The Colt 1911 22 magazine holds twelve rounds of 22 LR ammunition. The thumb safety is on the left side for right-handed use, and the grip safety works just like on a standard 1911. The slide lock is also identical in operation to the centerfire 1911, as is the magazine release, so operating this 22 LR Colt will be familiar to anyone who knows how to run a centerfire 1911. Only the disassembly procedure is different, due to the fixed-position barrel of the blowback design.
