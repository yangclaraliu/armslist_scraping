Technically not a complete upper, but essentially complete. The barrel is an 18"" Daniel Defense Strength to Weight barrel mid length gas(https://danieldefense.com/cold-hammer-forged-barrels/18-5-56mm-s2w-mid-length-chf-barrel-stripped.html)  with a Larue Tactical 12"" rail. Young Manufacturing chrome National Match complete Bolt carrier group. I have had great success with Young MFG bolts. The upper is a Red X arms upper receiver with forward assist. Rear takedown pin hole has very slight shaving on the inside of the hole due to a fitting issue I had with one of my lowers. It sits atop my other lowers with no fitment issues. The gas block is a VLTOR stainless steel low profile gas block. The rail will come with 3 ladder style rail covers. They are on the rail in the picture but are a bit hard to see.

I have had great accuracy with this upper. My best group was 1/2in. and the average is 1-1.5in at 100 yards. Never shot it past 200 yards but I would expect it to hold 1MOA at 300 yards. The barrel has had aproximately 700 rounds through it, so its just now getting well broken in. I cleaned it very well after each use with an inital 50 round break in consisting of firing one shot, cleaning after each consecutive shot for 5 rounds. Then Firing 5 rounds and cleaning. Then 10 rounds and cleaning and so on. This obsessive break in method may be superstition, but the barrel does shoot well.

ALL OF MY GROUPS WERE SHOT WITH HONADY 60gr VMAX rounds on top of 22gr of Hodgdon 335 powder with lake city brass. This barrel faired very well with the 60gr bullets. As to be expected, do not expect .5-1in moa accuracy when using surplus or mass production ammunition. Match grade ammunition or hand loads would be a nice choice for obtaining such accuracy.


ITEMS NOT INCLUDED IN SALE : muzzle break, rail mounted bipod adapter.

ASKING 650$

The barrel and rail alone are worth $600

If you have any more questions or want to see more pictures, please let me know. I realize the full picture of the rail is a bit on the grainy side. I will try and get a new picture for it. But please dont hesitate to ask to see more, i have many up close pictures.

I am located around beltway 8 and westpark tollway on the west side of houston. I am willing to drive a reasonable distance if necessary so let me know where you are located and we can work something out.

I never could bring myself to carry it for self defense even though it fits my hand as well as any pistol I've ever owned.  Not only do the age and the manufacturer's letter add value but it is also a 3 inch barrel which is fairly uncommon.  It is surprising how much different that one inch difference in barrel length makes in pointing and aiming the pistol, if you have ever shot a 3 in barrel in a subcompact pistol you already know what I mean.  Buy a new gun and what the value drop.  Buy a gun like this and what as your investment continues to grow as it has for the last 50 years and will undoubtedly continue to do. All original, all matching numbers.  Priced to sell at $650 or best REASONABLE offer.

Product Description
Recognizing the popularity of AR rifles, Nikon has developed a new line of riflescopes built to deliver extreme speed, accuracy and shooting confidence. The M-223 line offers five new riflescopes, all engineered for the 223 Rem./5.56mm NATO round with 55-grain polymer tipped bullet with a muzzle velocity of 3240fps. With Nikon's latest reticle and adjustment technologies, the M-223 integrates the same level of quality as the flagship Monarch riflescopes. ""The recent surge in AR-type rifle purchases means there is a new group of customers out there learning just how much fun owning an AR is,"" said Jon LaCorte, senior product marketing manager Nikon Sport Optics. ""We've built the M-223 family to help them enjoy and use their rifles no matter if it's for competition, varmint or predator hunting or just plinking fun."" All of the new M-223 riflescopes feature Nikon's famous fully multicoated optics, up to 95% light transmission, waterproof/fogproof/shockproof performance and lifetime warranty. Designed for AR carbines and popular 3 gun competitions, the 1-4x20 with Point Blank reticle features an extremely large exit pupil for low light performance and a super wide field of view. The all-new Point Blank reticle technology means incredibly accurate and fast shooting from zero to 200 yards thanks to thick reticle posts and purpose-designed 3-MOA center dot for instant targeting on paper or steel plates. The 2-8x32 is available with Nikon's all new BDC 600 reticle or the Nikoplex reticle with Nikon's new Rapid Action Turret system; both are ballistically matched to the 223 Rem. round and offer unprecedented speed in dialing in your shots for virtually any known distance-from 0 to 600 yards."

There are a few issues though and I want to point them out. The blueing is not bad at all, but there are some slight rust marks on the left side of the receiver. I've tried to show that in the third picture. All numbers match except for the top cover, it came this way with the after market railed top cover shown in the pictures. The original is lost and the previous owner could not locate it. I do however have an original un-issued Norinco top cover ordered. Showing that it will arrive this week. There are no scratches or anything of that nature. All in all it is in very good shape, wood is excellent, for what thumb hole stocks are. For the rifle and the top cover that is ordered the price is $1100. Price for the rifle as is in the pictures without the ordered top cover is $1050.00. Prices are as stated, if it doesn't sell by the time the top cover comes in I am going to have the rifle Cerakoted and order an Ironwood design stock and then have a very nice AK, instead of just a nice AK.

259,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3328259,"For Sale:  Model 1916 Spanish Mauser, w/ ammo, bayonet, and accessories","Conyers, Covington, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 200,"Listed On: Monday, July 28, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"1926 Spanish Mauser (Model 1916).  21"" barrel, chambered in the original 7x57mm (7mm Mauser).  Serial numbers are on the receiver and the barrel, and they match.  Comes with nice leather sling, 95 rounds of new-production re-loadable ammo, bayonet, and cleaning accessories.

  Rifle has all-original parts from what I can tell.  1926 was the only year the Lange Vizier rear sight was used on this rifle, which makes it something of a rarity.  The stock has been re-finished in Tung oil, and is a perfect match to the original.  Most of the original bluing is gone, and there is some pitting on some of the metal parts, but nothing that will affect safety or functionality.

  I have not shot this rifle, so I cannot tell you how it groups.  The Crown looks good to me, and the strong rifling and good trigger makes me think that it'll be a pretty good shooter.

  The Bayonet appears to be a Model 1917, and has quite a bit of erosion on the blade, but is still functional and fits the very nicely.  One of the wood handles has a repaired crack.

  60 rounds of ammo are new-in-box, and 35 are reloads from a professional manufacturer, loaded to factory specs.  The cleaning supplies are some brand-new nylon and brass brushes, some used brushes, and an aluminum jag.

  Price is $200.00 even, and I am located in Conyers, GA.  I'm willing to travel about an hour to meet up, and do not want to ship.  Breakdown of price is $150.00 for the rifle, $40.00 for the ammo, $10.00 for the bayonet.  This model in similar shape seems to go for around $250-$350 by itself, and that's with the typical leaf sight from other production years."

The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty
features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with an Omega trigger
system. The Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses
fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to
choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a
manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design
of the Duty and a sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock)
reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.

This rifle also has a polished Stainless steel barrel. Its stock is a gloss-finished, finely Checkered with a rosewood forend and grip cap. 
• Monte Carlo stock places the recoil pad directly in line with the shoulder, resulting in less perceived recoil for more comfortable shooting.
• The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
• A durable gloss finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.
• Rosewood caps on the fore-end and grip offer additional elegance.
• Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil. 
• Barrel, action, trigger guard and other metal surfaces feature polished Stainless steel for a striking appearance.
• Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
• The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
• Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
• Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
• Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
• Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
• 60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
• Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
• Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
• Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged."

AW93, original model, with 2 magazines

These guns are ""From Russian with Love"", a Soviet design, perfected and made since 1993 in Germany.  They are the preferred pistol of most of the US Military marksmanship teams.

The trigger is two stage, but the first stage can be nearly completely removed.  Trigger positon, weight, and preload all are adjustable.  Accuracy is nearly as good as the Hammerli 208.l

$1580 for gun, 2 magazines, original manual and test target.

Factory case (not original to the gun) $100 additional

As an older model, this gun has no magazine activated hold open (unless the magazine is modified). Any AW93 magazine (one designed for hold open, or not) will work with the gun.

Additional magazines available with the gun (up to 4) at $120 each.

A similar gun, but with magazine activated hold open alsi is available, at higher price. The older AW93 tend to be more accurate than the current production. They have a hammer block safety that serves as a dry fire device, and use the same recoil buffers (See first image, for the hammer block and dry fire function). The grip for these original AW93 are slightly different due to the side activated hold open. The more recent AW93 grips require some modification to fit this gun.

The AW93 is not well suited for small hands. Rink however does make grips that are downsized as much as possible for smaller hands or shorter fingers.

Shipping is extra, usually around $30.

FFL transfer only.

The case is large enough for 3 handguns or 1-2 free pistols. It has 2 plastic latches, holes for paddle locks, and a combination lock that is setable.

Other guns also available .... please check my other listings or ask if you want something not seen.

This rifle is accurate, always kept clean and never allowed to rust. Never used a vice to test it but wouldn't be surprised if it was 1"" moa @ 100yds or less. 

MSRP on ammo was easily over $160 but can't remember exactly it was a while ago. Been stored in a sealed ammo can. Ammo is German NATO grade military ball ammunition. It cycles excellent in the rifle and is accurate.
