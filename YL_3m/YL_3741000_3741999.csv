Marlin camp 9, 9mm rifle in dismantled condition, all the parts in a bag.
It's a project I've had no time for.  Bought from a local sale....buffer disintegrated on the first shot jamming up the works.  Cleaned it up and got a new buffer then had problems with the magazine safety.  Dismantled again to re-assemble without mag safety and bought some more new parts but never got done....that was over a year ago.  If. I haven't gotten to it yet, I'm not going to....have no need for it anyway.  I can't offer ANY guarantees since getting it working is up to YOU and your skill.  All the parts are there plus one original mag, new buffers, new recoil spring, and for an extra $20 you can have the new trigger guard/mag well.

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

Bought it new earlier this week, and its only had 50 rounds through it, will come with its case, mag loader, and two 11 round magazines. These are solid steel CZ75 clones if you aren't familiar with them, uses CZ pattern mags and can be carried cocked and locked or hammer down. The .40 caliber C-100 is hard to find here in the states and was only released here recently. Functions well but I didn't like it like I thought I would.

I'd be interested in trading it for a different mid sized .40 or one of the police trade in Glock 22's that have flooded the market lately. I just bought an engagement ring for my girlfriend so I have no cash to add to a trade, so looking for an even trade only. Really only interested in .40's but would still consider 9mm's, but not interested in rifles or shotguns at this time.

Would prefer to trade, but I'll sell for $350 if not interested in trading.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

The ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all.


This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction.

All in all a very nice adult air rifle.
It has the factory scope base and stop along with fine adjustable sights. Also, it is one of what is called ""Steel safety"" gun a pre plastic gun with a steel part as opposed to plastic.
This is a pretty high performance piece of gear that will likely be passed down to your heirs, they are that nice and well built.
I have posted pictures of the faults but feel free to contact me for more pictures of this rifle.
I have several different air rifles now and enjoy them more and more as I don't have to make a trip to the range and I shoot out back without disturbing neighbors. Great for those marauding woodpeckers too and cheaper than residing your home.

I'd estimate that less than 1000 rounds have been put through this gun. It has never given me any trouble. Only getting rid of it because I'd rather have a shotgun for purely home defense.

Model is a Precore EFX5.21si. It came out a local gym. It's always worked but I moved it recently and is now giving an error code (code 42). I'm assuming it has to be some sort of reboot or loose connection or something relatively simple to fix. I don't know anything about these things, and frankly, I'm tired of hearing my wife complain about it taking up so much room. I've tinkered with it, but to no prevail concerning the code. We hardly ever use it and it's just taking up space. I'm interested in a trade for a firearm. (Pistols, revolvers, shotguns, ak47, rifles, leverguns, etc) Looking it up, a refurbished machine in this model goes for around $1,500. (new around $3,500). I realize that what i'm offering may need some research and work put into it, so i'm not looking for nor expecting top notch, expensive firearms. However, there is nothing wrong with this machine beyond the error code it is now giving. Fix that code, you have a perfectly good machine. It is usable the way it is, but the electronics won't calculate or elevate until this code is cleared. 

Here is a link for info and prices on a refurbished model:

Please do not call asking what is wrong with it or how much to fix it. As stated above, i do not know the answer to neither but would assume that it is something simple. Thanks in advance"

These popular carbines have a laminated hardwood stock, 6-shot capacity, adjustable rear and bead front sights, and the receiver is tapped for a scope mount. A barrel with micro-groove rifling makes it exceptionally handy in the brush and deadly accurate.

The .223 Wylde hybrid chamber was designed by Bill Wylde of Greenup, IL to exploit the 
accuracy advantages of the .223 Remington commercial chambering without pressure problems 
or compromising the functional reliability when using the high velocity 5.56x45mm NATO military
ammunition. It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15
rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber 
throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition 
as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when 
using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 
Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers.

It would be difficult to label Laci Szabo. Call him a knifemaker, martial artist, adventurer, film star, businessman and more. Let's just credit him as the creator of the SzaboFly.The SzaboFly is a stylized butterfly knife with obvious Spyderco influence in the handle's round holes. These unique holes enable retention and control over the knife while rotating and swinging. Szabo's personal style is reflected in the curved handle and blade which curl into eachother when the knife is closed. The Szabo trademark sickle/scythe shape applies cutting performance in both forward and backward cuts.

Very fun to piss people off at the range due to how loud it is, and the amount of unburnt powder. Only cosmetic issue is a by the extractor from ejecting brass.

Story:
Bought Jan 2013, shot 20 rounds through it.  Cleaned, Oiled, sat under bed for 2 years.  Need $ for wood burning stove.  Basically new.  
(Check out White Hat Holsters to see how amazing they are.)

Here is the description of features from Beretta on the firearm:
""Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing.
The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.
The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA.""

Redfield mount and Leopold rings.

This is in excellent used condition and is one of the most solid mount types available for Contender scope mounting.  Probably made in 80s or 90s MADE IN USA and a fine set.  These are much more durable and solid than the aluminum or stamped steel stuff out there.  The set is in the $60+ range and again is not the cheaper slab sided mount version.

The Nate Squared Tactical Professional holster is the ultimate IWB (inside-the-waistband) holster. It has all the comfort of our Original design, but comes with the following additional features: adjustable cant, tuckable, excellent positive retention. The holster is made of polycarbonate, which is an extremely durable thermoplastic. Common uses range from cd's & dvd's to bullet resistant glass. We chose to use polycarbonate because it has 30% more tensile strength and almost double the impact strength of acrylic-polyvinyl chloride, which is the material used by many of the most popular IWB holsters on the market today. All of this simply means that the Professional holster is made of the highest quality materials available. Using polycarbonate also allowed us to develop a positive retention IWB holster with our Twist Release System™.  When the holster is worn, your body puts pressure against the backing, which presses the firearm against the polycarbonate.  The polycarbonate holds the firearm in place and provides additional security for the retention of your firearm.  Simply drive your thumb between the holster and the grip, then slightly twist the grip toward your body to release the trigger guard from the retention bump for a smooth draw!

I just rec'd this this afternoon, but it looks like the fit is going to be a little tight for my intended purpose. I was planning on laying it out to hold a semi-auto, over/under, and subgauge tube set, it looks like i might be able to make it work, but the fit would be very tight with no room for accessories, and would require a complicated layout. Probably easiest to just stick with my Americase for my o/u, and come up with another solution for my auto.

Needs new bottom foam (available from ebay, or most craft stores), top foam is perfect. A couple VERY tiny marks on the exterior. Other than the foam and the couple marks, it is basically brand new.
