someone gave it to me and it has an air leak. You can possibly re-thread it or tighten something. When you place a CO2 cartridge in it will have a slow leak. You can get off 10-15 shots before it completely empties. I'm throwing this in as an extra because it's technically broken so I'm selling the TIPPMANN this is just for fun! This is a bonus maybe you can make it work. Comes with a holster and a few extra CO2 cartridges.

The Sauer Match-Grade barrels give these pistols greater performance and accuracy. Ported compensators subdue muzzle jump. Each pistol is built on a durable, trouble-free stainless steel frame. Each SIG SAUER sport pistol is hand assembled in Germany by one of their master gunsmiths. Each pistol is then hand fitted and hand tuned to ensure smooth operation and the kind of superior accuracy you would expect from a SIG SAUER target pistol. All SIG SAUER Sport pistols are manufactured with a Sauer Match-Grade barrel and a precision machined stainless steel frame. This adds significant weight and rigidity and their increased mass reduces felt recoil and improves control. Both the P229 Sport and P220 Sport feature a ported compensator. These units employ a muzzle brake with an expansion chamber to soften recoil and help prevent muzzle rise, thus improving on-target accuracy for second and subsequent shots. The compensator is removable on the P220 Sport. For added comfort each SIG SAUER Sport pistol comes equipped with soft rubberized grip. Both frames and slides are precision machined from solid blocks of stainless steel. FFL CASH OR TRADE!"

The wooden furniture has a metal butt plate with a storage compartment for cleaning gear, and what appears to be a stock or rack number on a small brass plate on the stock.  According to what I could find on the web, this is one of the best semi-auto FAL receivers on the market.

It's all matt stainless steel with the factory lug-style SS rings and a short 16"" barrel.  I have owned this rifle for a long time, and it's always, ALways, ALWAYS functioned flawlessly.  When I first purchased it, I had the action smoothed and accurized, had the trigger polished and lightened, and had the action bedded to the walnut deluxe wood stock.  I also had about a pound or so of lead laid in to the rear of the stock, resulting in a very well-balanced carbine with almost no recoil! The trigger retains it's factory 2-stage military style, just really smooth now.

The rifle comes with a nice Bushnell 3X9 Scope with see-through caps mounted with original Ruger Lugged Stainless rings.  It also has factory sights, with a steel peep sight in the rear.

Mostly the Mini14 has sat in my safe clean and oiled, but I have shot 5 Coyotes and butchered quite a few animals with it.  It is an awesome tool, and the ultimate in dependability.    

It ALSO comes with 6  high capacity mags ranging from 20 to 40 round.  Two or 3 or them are Ruger Factory mags, and the others are pro-mag or the like.  Also comes with the military-style leather sling seen in the pictures.

Please e-mail me with your phone number to weed out the scammers.  

There will be no required paperwork for the sale, but I would like to see a CWP and ID for my records.  The price on the Mini is firm.  I might be interest in trades for old single shots or lever action rifles.  I'd love to find a Spencer.  Can can add money for the right deal.

It got a few scrapes on the trigger guard and stock hunting this yr, and has some superficial rust on the scope mounts and right by the chamber (it was there when i got it second hand).

I built this Pistol myself from quality parts. The Barrel manufacturer is known for sub MOA barrels and this one is no exception. Not a cheap barrel with pie plate type accuracy. I had the gas port opened on the barrel because of its short length by Duffy's Gun Room in sparks and they checked the firearm over. The Pistol has seen about 200 rounds. Its great but I really just prefer handguns more and my range will only allow this to be fired on the rifle range from a rested position. I don't need to get rid of this but want to see if there are any decent offers. 

I have 1 20 round mag and 4 30 round mags. All mags are pinned to 10 rounds. Simply remove the rivets if you move to a less communist state or on an out of town jaunt. Mags are well worn but still functional.

-Tapco Intrafuse AK Cage Muzzle brake 
-Romanian Wire side folding stock (has been wrapped in black 550 paracord)

Also included in the sale is around 800 rounds of 7.62x39 (mixture of Tula, Herters, and Red Army) in 20 rnd boxes and then around 100-120 rounds loose, 4 steel Romanian magazines, and a BullDog rifle case (capable of holding 4 magazines on the side). Plus the original handguards, pistol grip, and muzzle brake are included.

I've had this rifle for a little over a year now, having bought it upon returning from Afghanistan when I was stationed in Washington.I was told I am the 3rd owner, having bought it from a gentleman who needed money for new tires for his truck. He bought it from the original owner, his friend who got tired of it and needed money himself. I don't know how many rounds exactly have been fired through it, bore is still nice and shiny.  I have personally fired around 300-400 rounds through it.  Got out the Army, and haven't shot it once since and would rather have the cash than the rifle for an upcoming move.  

I'm asking $750 OBO for the whole package. Please no trades at this time and no shipping.  Buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale and show ID to verify they are of least 18 years of age and legal to own firearms within NC.  I can best be reached by phone (text preferred) at REDACTED.

 the bridge was $60 and the Tele itself was $400 before all the upgrades. All that being said I really believe you will not be disappointed at all with this guitar. The only thing I didn't finish was I sanded off the Squire logo and put a Fender water sticker on it(not my best work lol check the pics) I wish I would have just left it alone.

Will ship/deliver to FFL with a 10rd fixed (pinned) magazine installed to comply with regulations.

The optic I had I'm keeping, so I've replaced them with a set of cheap flip up irons. Don't expect reliability or anything less than minute-of-man accuracy at 100 yards. They're only provided since this gun has no built in sights.

Bolt modification was done so the user could release the magazine with the bolt closed. The sear was replaced with a US made one for 922r compliance. 

Rifle serial is a 3 million series, produced at Jianshe Arsenal 26. All SN's match, except the stock. The stock was refurbished/replaced at some point in its life with a newer Chinese stock. The stock is in very nice and clean condition. Barrel bluing was worn to about 60%, and since has been cold blued and oiled, and scuffed to match the factory blue finish. Barrel rifling is good, no rust or corrosion anywhere on the gun. All cosmoline has been removed by steam cleaning, and everything re-oiled for corrosion protection. I have put about 1000 rounds through this rifle. I can hit the 200 yard gong very consistently at ASR range. 

This rifle is certainly an attention grabber, every range I've been to. I've spent about $1200 total to get the gun where it is. I've got another SKS amongst other guns and I am just looking for a new toy to mess with, so buy it!! save yourself some headache of putting it all together. Or trade some stuff to me!! Open to almost anything black rifle or ak, or precision bolt guns. Heck even ammo presses and dies and stuff, powders, primers, whatever. LMK.

It operates buttery smooth and locks up tight as a drum. Absolutely no play in any direction while in the open position and perfectly centered when closed. The lock bar has the insert that locks the blade up solid yet does not stick for easy one handed release. Google it and you'll see why knife enthusiasts rave about this folder.

 See the pictures below. I'll try and put a link to a video of me operating it as well. You will not be disappointed with this knife!! The one I'm keeping is my EDC now.

 I need to get $175 for this and I might consider shipping. Hell, if I like ya, I might throw in one of my custom made paracord lanyards too. PM me if you're interested, Im located in Everett, Washington and this will be listed on several forums.

The optic I had I'm keeping, so I've replaced them with a set of cheap flip up irons. Don't expect reliability or anything less than minute-of-man accuracy at 100 yards. They're only provided since this gun has no built in sights.

Bolt modification was done so the user could release the magazine with the bolt closed. The sear was replaced with a US made one for 922r compliance. 

Rifle serial is a 3 million series, produced at Jianshe Arsenal 26. All SN's match, except the stock. The stock was refurbished/replaced at some point in its life with a newer Chinese stock. The stock is in very nice and clean condition. Barrel bluing was worn to about 60%, and since has been cold blued and oiled, and scuffed to match the factory blue finish. Barrel rifling is good, no rust or corrosion anywhere on the gun. All cosmoline has been removed by steam cleaning, and everything re-oiled for corrosion protection. I have put about 1000 rounds through this rifle. I can hit the 200 yard gong very consistently at ASR range. 

This rifle is certainly an attention grabber, every range I've been to. I've spent about $1200 total to get the gun where it is. I've got another SKS amongst other guns and I am just looking for a new toy to mess with, so buy it!! save yourself some headache of putting it all together. Or trade some stuff to me!! Open to almost anything black rifle or ak, or precision bolt guns. Heck even ammo presses and dies and stuff, powders, primers, whatever. LMK.

Also included is a muzzle protector, original sling, bayonette with scabbard, and 110 rounds of the match grade Swiss GP11 7.5x55 ammunition in their original cardboard boxes (not pictured).  I have fired about 150 rounds from this rifle and it lives up to it's reputation of being exceptionally accurate with a crisp trigger pull on par with a modern heavier trigger pull match rifle.

I originally bought this KRISS a few years back when the huge AR craze was going on. Got it for the wife to shoot because she couldn't shoot my M1A and she doesn't shoot it enough to keep it. The weapon did have some issues that seem to be common with VECTORs, I sent to back to the manufacture in VA to get work done under warrantee and have proof of the work done. It is a fun weapon to shoot but I have my ARs and I shoot those more. If you have questions please send me a message and I will get back to you as soon as I can. I would prefer to make the sale/transaction at one of the shops in my local area.

I took to the range once to sight it in and absolutely loved it. This rifle is fantastic, and the trigger pull is the best I've ever experienced. Unfortunately life got in the way and I never went hunting, and now I need the money. Having only fired 20-30 rounds through this rifle, it is in perfect condition. It also comes with a couple accessories. All together I am selling the following items. This is a package deal, I won't sell various items individually.

R700 XCR rifle, valued at $750
Tasco 6-24x50 AOE scope valued at $90
Caldwell XLA extending bipod valued at $40
Padded rifle sling valued at $20
Field and Stream stock cartridge holder (holds 9 rounds of .308) I'll throw in for free!

So all together the value of this package is worth well over $900, however I am only asking $600, so great savings here on an amazing rifle in perfect condition.

Ready to step up to a belt that might well last you the rest of your adult life? 

This belt is made like your grandfather's was. 

2"" wide x 3/16"" thick heavy top grain leather.  With a tape, and all snapped up with a buckle in place it measures just over 40"" from the tip to the crease in the folded leather.   I unsnapped it and discovered that the overall length including the folded over part is 44"" -- so the 44 mark is a bit confusing.  If you were to attach a large cowboy style buckle it would buy you a few more inches, and perhaps that is what the marking is referring to.

Anchor marked marked real brass hardware, with snaps to allow custom buckle. Leather stamped Idaho Leather USA, Boise Idaho. 

Vintage but basically new -- I only own a couple pairs of pants with loops big enough for it, so I barely wear it -- I think I wore it less than 5 times.  If it was any more heavy duty and it wouldn't bend around your waist :)

The most comprehensive CCW Course in all of North Carolina,   While many firearms owners have become skilled shooters, the truth is that a high degree of confusion remains as to when the use of deadly force is legally justifiable. With so many myths surrounding the subject and the complexity of the laws as they pertain to concealed carry, there is little wonder why both police officers and otherwise law-abiding citizens find themselves being prosecuted for actions they believed were both prudent and justified.   Laws by their very nature are ambiguous, confusing, and often left to the interpretation of those who do not practice law and who may not even understand the law. To ensure you possess a comprehensive understanding of the law you could hire an attorney and pay hundreds of dollars for the consultation. If you are ever in a situation where you have no alternative but to use deadly force, a good criminal defense attorney's retainer fee can start at $30,000.   Fortunately, the professional instructors at Patriot Training and Consulting can provide you with this information in an easy to understand format. In comparison, the cost of attending either your initial Concealed Carry Handgun training or Legal Issues Refresher training through PatriotTAC is a small investment to help ensure you don’t find yourself on the wrong side of the courtroom.  If you don't think you can learn a lot from a concealed carry course, than this IS the course for you!

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

***NOT A CETME***

Built with an HK kit sometime around 1986, the internals, barrel, and furniture are all HK
The in-spec stamped steel receiver is the only Special Weapons Inc part on the rifle

The bolt head is stamped FMP 1968, 
HK licensed FMP Portugal to manufacture G3's and supplied them with blueprints and tooling,

PTR Industries much later purchased the tooling they use to make PTR-91's from FMP

This rifle is a tough rugged solid shooter, everyone has heard the horror stories of these types of rifles being finicky and troublesome, NOT THIS ONE! It just works, I've ran mag after mag through it with not one hiccup, it just works!

A previous owner used polishing compound and meticulously polished the inner surface of the receiver, mag well and internals, they are all as smooth as glass, he even polished the magazines,

The bolt has been rebuilt to HK Armorers spec, with all new HK parts including, new firing pin, spring, new extractor, spring, new locking piece, and STANDARD size rollers, 
NOT OVERSIZE, the bolt gap is a healthy .008""

Is it like new? NO, it has a few scratches, dings on the stock etc. (It's 28 yrs old) If your looking for a pristine HK 91/G3 rifle, this is not it,

Is it reliable and functional? YES, I have not witnessed a single jam since I've owned it, 

Several Magazines and Pouches included, at least 15, maybe more , I'll have to count them

I will be glad to take more detailed pics of any area of the rifle for serious, interested buyers

Price is $795, there are only two other SW3's up on Armslist in the USA, Mine priced less than either
If you're interested, don't wait, I may come to my senses and keep it!

Local FTF sales in Tri-Cities TN area, may go as far as Morristown, Must show a valid TN drivers license and be able to legally purchase a firearm

No, I wont ship it to your FFL 

If you are going to low ball offer me, don't waste your time, I've priced it too low already
