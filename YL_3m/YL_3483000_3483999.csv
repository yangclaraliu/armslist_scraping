The Zastava M48 is a post World War II Yugoslavian version of the German Karabiner 98k designed Mauser and the Belgian/Czech designed m24 series. After World War II, the Yugoslavs took this design and incorporated minor modifications. Although very similar in general appearance to that of the German rifle, many of the parts of these two rifles are not interchangeable, especially the bolt and related action parts. The main difference between the M48 and the K98k is that the M48 uses an intermediate-length receiver. They are usually easily identified by the top handguard, which extends behind the rear sight and ends just in front of the receiver ring, although this feature exists on other models as well. M48's are regarded as a military surplus firearm and can be collected in the USA, Canada and Australia



*M48BO:1956-1965*- The ""bo"" stands for ""bez oznake"" and translates roughly as ""unmarked"" or ""without markings."" These were identical to and manufactured concurrent with the crested M48B but were not stamped with any national or manufacturer's markings

*Most M48's were put into government storage shortly after they were manufactured. Most M48's that are encountered in the United States and Australia today show only slight wear—usually from storage. Many rifles are sold with accessories, including bayonet, bayonet scabbard, leather bayonet frog, ammo pouches, cleaning rod, and field cleaning kit. The rifles are normally sold coated in the protective grease 'cosmoline' which needs to be cleaned out before the rifle is fired. The condition is frequently excellent due to a Yugoslavian maintenance program that cleaned and inspected the stored rifles in rotation every 5 years until that nation's breaking up.

The Mark II was made from 1982 to 2005.  The Ruger MK II is a rimfire single-action semi-automatic pistol chambered in .22 Long Rifle and manufactured by Sturm, Ruger & Company. Ruger rimfire pistols are some of the most popular handguns made, with over three million sold.  The original Ruger pistol, now called the Standard, had no model number, as it was the first, and for a time, only gun made by Sturm, Ruger. Prior to Bill Ruger's partnership with Sturm, he had successfully duplicated two Baby Nambu pistols while working in his garage, from a U.S. Marine's captured Nambu, shortly after World War II. Although deciding against marketing the Baby Nambu Pistols, Ruger did incorporate the Nambu style rear cocking device and modified the Nambu's silhouette, plus he added a 4.75 in (12.1 cm) lightweight barrel with fixed sights.  All guns with bull or heavy tapered barrels are Target models, and are equipped with target sights consisting of an adjustable rear sight and a taller, wider front sight, with an aggressive undercut to reduce glare.

This model is the full frame model.  S&W make 3 models, the shield (compact) and the M&P 9C are virtually the same size. This one is the normal sized M&P-9.

Many magazine articles say that it is the ""Glock Killer"" due to its ergonomics, simplicity and reliability... Just putting that out there due to many inquiry of how big or what model it is..."

1976 “C” Series
On the left side it says, “Browning Arms Company Morgan, Utah & Montreal PQ.
Made in Belgium
Serial Number is under the Pachmayr grip. It starts with 76CXXXXX
It has a Bo-mar sight with rail.  It may look a little funky, but check out the picture of the target from the first time I shot it.  I could have eaten the rest of the red in the bulls-eye, but I chose to put bullets through the hole.  You can always take off the sight and rail, but once you shoot it, you’ll probably keep it on.
It’s had trigger job (pretty light, I don’t know the poundage).  It's a real smooth shooter, much like an aged whiskey. The sights are adjustable and the magazine safety has been adjusted so that it will fire without the magazine.
It has very slight wear around the tip of the muzzle and around the trigger. Not enough that I could pick it up in a picture.
Comes with two 13 round magazines, but I’ve put 14 rounds in them without any problems. Plus a Browning carry pouch.

 Yugoslavian M24/47 8mm Mauser
 Good Condition

 Shipped in box as received from our importer.

The M24 series is a line of Mauser pattern bolt-action battle rifles produced for use by the Yugoslavian military. They are similar to the Czech vz. 24 rifle, featuring open sights, 8x57mm IS chambering, carbine-length barrels, hardwood stocks, and straight bolt handles. All M24 series weapons are designed to accept the M-24/48 pattern bayonet.

The first Mauser-pattern rifle produced in Yugoslavia was the M24. Its predecessor, the FN Model 1924 had been produced for the Yugoslav army by FN Herstal until the Ministry and FN signed a contract on the purchase of the licence for production of rifles 7.9 mm M 24. Nearly all M24's were produced either before or during World War II, at the Kragujevac Arsenal plant. The M24 and Model 1924 are nearly identical.[2]

The final additions to the M24 family were the M24/47 and M24/52 rifles. Both were produced by reworking existing prewar Model 1924 rifles after World War II at the Zastava Arms (formally Kragujevac Arsenal) plant, which was at that time under the control of the postwar communist government. ""47"" and ""52"" indicate the beginning of the rebuild program for each respective model: 1947 for the M24/47 and 1952 for the M24/52. One common misconception is that the M24/47 rifles were produced only in 1947; actually, the rebuild program lasted into the early 1950s alongside new production of M48 rifles. Minor cosmetic differences exist between the M24/47 and M24/52, but the rifles are nearly identical to one another and to their predecessors, the Model 1924 and M24.

M24 series rifles were used by the Royal Yugoslav Army and the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II.

246,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3483246,For Sale:  Buffalo Bore Ammo - 460 ROWLAND Ammo - 185 gr. JHP (1500fps / M.E.924 ft.lbs.) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 32,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 10, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=236

Again, as a result of popular demand, Buffalo Bore has added a new cartridge to its line—the 460 Rowland.

The 460 Rowland, as we load it, is squarely at mid 44 magnum power levels.  This means that a person can now carry a 1911 style combat pistol that has the power of a 44 mag. revolver, but is slimmer, faster to reload, faster to shoot and holds nine rounds instead of a revolver’s six.  The 460 Rowland casing is simply a 45 ACP case that has been slightly lengthened so it won’t chamber in a 45 ACP chamber.  It also has a stronger web area in the casing, so as to avoid ""blow outs"".

To acquire 460 Rowland test guns, I sent two of my 1911 45 acp pistols to Clark Custom Guns and had them install their 460 Rowland conversion kits. To date the converted 1911’s work great. I can fire a 255gr. hard cast bullet @ 1300 fps or a 230gr. FMJ-FN bullet @ 1350 fps. What a great ""woods"" pistol that still maintains combat pistol qualities.

We are using flash suppressed powders in each 460 Rowland load, so that if you have to shoot a bear or “bad guy” in the dark, the muzzle flash will not blind the shooter and we feel this feature is a big tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in America, occur in low light and we are willing to bet that most emergency wildlife shootings in the wilderness will be in low light too.

Note my real world velocities (below) from real world pistols, not laboratory test barrels.

It's had a trigger job and was ""tuned"".  The trigger pull is light and very smooth.  I will include a cross-draw holster.

It shows a little bluing wear on the barrel (holster wear).  It was carried as a back-up during elk and deer hunting which resulted in wear.

I know there's a lot of competition, but you really should see and feel this gun to appreciate it's condition and smooth action.  This gun likes ""hot loads"" and always grouped tighter using these.

Asking $435.00 net to seller. Price is negotiable; however, no LOW ball offers.

I'm the only owner of this gun and I can assure you that I have NEVER had a malfunction with it.
 To that, it's my current bedside gun. I've never ran it dirty, and it's always lubed (properly) before I shoot it and cleaned well after. Round count is probably an honest 600 rounds. 

It has Hogue grips with it, but I think I have the original ones somewhere let me know  if u want them.

I'm selling it because I need the money, otherwise it'd stay on my nightstand for years. I'll be buying another as soon as I can.

I am the original owner, bought new locally about 6 months ago.  I am a vet who knows 1911's very well and takes very good care of his firearms.  It is in excellent condition with a total of 50 rounds fired to verify function & accuracy.  This 1911 is very accurate and smooth shooting.  The trigger is also very nice with a crisp, consistent #4.5 break.  An excellent, no frills GI that can easily hang with my Springfields, Colts, etc.  These are made with ordnance grade 4140 steel, both the frame and slide.  With proper maintenance, this will last longer than you.
I am only selling this because I own several other 1911's, this was my most recent purchased and I need the money.  If I could afford to keep it, I would. 
When I brought it home, I stripped it down, cleaned off all of the factory lube, smoothed some of the internals with flitz, gave it a detailed cleaning, then lubed and reassembled it.  The bore was also thoroughly cleaned and has a mirror shine.  I took it to the range once and fired 50 rounds through it with zero malfunctions of any kind.  Since then it has sat in it's case cleaned, oiled and ready to go.
Pistol comes with everything it would new:  Case, paperwork, hang tag, blank warranty card and 1 factory 7 round magazine.  
Not interested in trades, (unless ridiculously in my favor) or low ball offers.  This is more than a fair price for an excellent, reliable, no frills 1911.

The Mossberg 715T is the perfect semi auto rifle on a budget. It will allow you to get serious marksmanship practice, or just plinking around, without having to spent tons of money on more expensive ammunition. Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 16.25"" barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13"" length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4"" - 14.5"" LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults.

About this shotgun: I have never shot this weapon myself. The person who owned it before me used it on a dove hunt in Southern Georgia in 2009 shortly before his passing. The weapon came to me as you see it today. I like to shoot my weapons, not hang them over a mantle and I am rough on my guns. I drop them in swamps, forget to clean them and love to shoot them. This weapon deserves better than that. I want to trade for something ""interesting"". Uzi, IWI Tavor (or other bullpup) or something along those lines. I would consider a lesser weapon with $$$ in trade or whatever.

The CZ comes with a hard carry case, two 14 round magazines, lock, and all factory literature. 

Light alloy frame de-cocker model featuring an extended magazine release, low profile snag-free sights, and a loaded chamber indicator.

The PCR name stands for ‘Police Czech Republic,’ the group for whom the model was originally designed. Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry.

Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

This is rifle was manufactured in 1946 at Royal Ordinance Factory Fazakerly, in Liverpool. Chambered in .303 British, these were the last major design change in the British production of the Lee-Enfield. They were produced from mid-1944 to 1947 and with only approximately 250,000 being made it is one of the rarest, and most collectible, of the Lee-Enfield models available. 
This particular rifle will come with a sling and the option of 90 rounds of commercial ammo. Only ""blemish"" on this rifle is where some young British soldier carved his initials into the stock, which I think is an interesting piece of history.
