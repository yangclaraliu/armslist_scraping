It's your choice whether or not you want the scope on it (Cabela's pine ridge 17hmr 3-9x40). I hunted with this rifle for many years and have taken lots of deer with it.

Maybe we could consider a trade for your used Sig 516? I have an Alexander Arms 6.5 Grendel M4 carbine that has been test fired with 20 rounds of Hornady 123grn AMAX. The carbine has a 14.5 barrel (believed to be made by Sabre Defense) with a welded and pinned 1.5inch flash hider to bring this to the legal minimum limit of 16 inches.  The value of the carbine is $1499.00 approximately as they no longer offer this barrel length. The carbine comes with a silicon cleaning cloth, instruction manual, (1) ten round magazine, brand new rear Troy Back Up Iron Sight, and KNS anti-rotation pins. If you are concerned about ammo, I have two boxes of 123 grain Hornady AMAX. If you live in Colorado then I can only supply the ten round magazine. The ammo is still in the case it was shipped in and is valued at $24.00 per box of twenty. If you decide that this offer is something you would like to move forward with then we go to a local FFL. I do have multiple photos to be emailed to you if you are interested. If one carbine is not enough for you, I have three Alexander Arms consecutive serial number carbines waiting for that father sons hunting trip. If you do not have a used Sig 516 I would be happy to sell it to you for $1100.00. If you are interested in all three then I will let them go for $1000.00 each.

It is a Model 92 Winchester for $600... there is clue #1... but copy some of the ad text and search it and you'll find the original ad on Gun Broker.

The SCAM armslist ad: http://www.armslist.com/posts/3014994/michigan-rifles-for-sale--winchester-1892-rifle-44-40-wcf

The ""seller"" scam artist scumbag has a few other listings as well: http://www.armslist.com/classifieds/search?relatedto=3014994

This is a great entry level rifle with pretty wood and great accuracy out of the new barrel."

Looking for firearms, basically anything that I do not already own. Just let me know what you have, pics are great and a ballpark figure of how many rounds you are looking for.
As you know we are still experiencing a large and lengthy .22 ammo shortage that will last for a long time to come. Even when found bricks are now in the $30 neighborhood. The good ole days of walking in anywhere and picking up 1000rds for $35 are unfortunately way over.  Please keep in mind that this ammo is very easy to sell but I am mostly looking for a trade.  If you are looking to feed your .22 caliber guns and maybe have another gun that doesn't get much attention lying around then maybe we can make a trade. 
Modern  mass produced firearms are not worth more used than they were new.

There is some scumbag with 4 listings currently out of Indiana, Indiana (anytime there is no city listed, be suspect of the ad), one of them is for the same firearm listed in the title to this particular listing.

The SCAM Armslist ad: http://www.armslist.com/posts/2959541/indiana-rifles-for-sale--marlin-1893--30-30

The dirty thief has other listings active right now: http://www.armslist.com/classifieds/search?relatedto=2959580

Any listing you are interested in, grab some of the ad text and search for it in Bing or another search engine, see if there are any GunBroker or Guns America ads for the same rifle. Often the scammers steal a couple pics and some of the original text, so search for something unique in the suspected listing (adjectives like beautiful, outstanding, etc. describing the condition in the suspect ad make great search terms) and see if it has been listed anywhere else online."

This is an excellent condition gun that has a 22"" stainless barrel vs. the standard 18.5"" that is on most all others. It is also a bedded barrel and not the factory banded that most models are. It has a beautiful checkered birch stock that looks similar to a walnut stain and has an actual thick rubber butt pad vs the cheap plastic ones on most. This is not a carbine, it is a full length rifle, and it also has a Volquartsen tool steel ejector, Christie auto bolt release plate, recoil pin, and extended mag release. Also has direct mount Weaver wide body see thru scope mounts so you can use the pin sights and has a nice BSA Sweet 22 calibrated scope 3-9x40. The scope has 3 different turrets for externally adjustable zeroes and yardage markers for the 3 most popular grains of 22 shells. It also comes with an Allen camo neoprene sling. The best part about this gun besides being very accurate and dependable is it is not the new cast light weight receiver and internals. One stroke of the action and you can tell a huge difference from how smooth this one is versus any newer ones you might feel. This has been sitting in the safe for about 10 years and is better than any you will buy now. I have my wife's newer one if you want to feel how much better the quality is on this than a new one. I would rather sell hers but she likes her purple...I will sell it with the factory 10rd mag and 2 of the 25 round clear butler creek mags, one steel lip and one red plastic hot lip for $325 for all. Or in place of the 2 butler creeks I will sell for $350 with a double BX25 which is a 50 round Ruger mag. Also have a brick of shells I will sell with the gun only for $50 if you want them with either package.  Call, email, or text is fine. I work late so no early mornings please.

This is the model of the Remington 700 they no longer produce for civilian purchase. This is due to the PSS having such a high production cost being as how Remington spared no expense with this rifle. On top of that, it has been gone through completely and upgraded fully to be the most consistent and accurate long range and competition effective weapon possible. It's chambered in .300 WIN MAG so that it can reach out and touch something when necessary. This round obviously has substantial stopping force as well. The barrel is match grade and target crowned with a custom muzzle break to increase muzzle velocity and reduce recoil, while maintaining every ounce of accuracy. Also has Competition Match Grade Trigger with 1.5# pull. No expense spared on this rifle.

This is the model of the Remington 700 they no longer produce for civilian purchase. This is due to the PSS having such a high production cost being as how Remington spared no expense with this rifle. On top of that, it has been gone through completely and upgraded fully to be the most consistent and accurate long range and competition effective weapon possible. It's chambered in .300 WIN MAG so that it can reach out and touch something when necessary. This round obviously has substantial stopping force as well. The barrel is match grade and target crowned with a custom muzzle break to increase muzzle velocity and reduce recoil, while maintaining every ounce of accuracy. Also has Competition Match Grade Trigger with 1.5# pull. No expense spared on this rifle.

This is the model of the Remington 700 they no longer produce for civilian purchase. This is due to the PSS having such a high production cost being as how Remington spared no expense with this rifle. On top of that, it has been gone through completely and upgraded fully to be the most consistent and accurate long range and competition effective weapon possible. It's chambered in .300 WIN MAG so that it can reach out and touch something when necessary. This round obviously has substantial stopping force as well. The barrel is match grade and target crowned with a custom muzzle break to increase muzzle velocity and reduce recoil, while maintaining every ounce of accuracy. Also has Competition Match Grade Trigger with 1.5# pull. No expense spared on this rifle.

I purchased this on Dec 17, 2013 (still have receipt) from CTD.  Item #3-0136388 (listed as: ""Manufacturer: Colt LE6920MP-B""), which is presently $1075.68 on their site, plus FFL fee and tax (total: $1200).  

It's just been in my rifle storage since then, unfired.  This is the gold standard AR-15 (by which I mean it's a Colt, with 1:7 twist barrel, properly staked gas key, properly cut M4 feed ramps, etc., and with magpul furniture to boot).  There are certainly 'nicer' ARs, but if you don't want to build your own, and you only have a grand to spend, this is the one to buy.  I will include a new 30 round PMAG as well as the original box, manual, etc."

This gun was designed for military contract, and was used by police, border patrol, other gov. agencies at one point in time. This gun was owned by a police/agent at one point and has some cosmetic wear, but the internals have all been either replaced or well maintained, the gun was maintained by a dept. armorer. It is a fairly heavy gun, but very solid, reliable and surprisingly accurate. Has a brand new Hogue wraparound grip like the original(different from standard p89's) Has been appraised at 350$, but due to the light cosmetic wear (this gun was carried in a holster every day for a while, but very well cared for) Im asking $325 trade/sale value with accessories (2 mags, (15 and 10 cap respectively)case, soft holster, and a box of 9mm perfecta, or 300$ for the gun and 2 mags (10rd and 15rd mags).
