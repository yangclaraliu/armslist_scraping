This thing was carried by me for awhile and realized pretty quick my frame wanted/needed a smaller gun so I went with the shield. It has sat by my bed ever since as my night stand gun.

Has worked flawlessly, ran every kind of JHPs through without a problem. I carry gold dots mostly which it eats without a hitch. While I carried the gun briefly, that Alessi leather didn't leave a mark, gun is flawless. Gun has factory installed tritium night sights which are amazingly bright. 

Gun comes with 3 mags two with pinky finger extensions. Of course the 3 different sized palm swells and all the factory paperwork including the test fire. 

Also including an Alessi M&P9C leather IWB holster and a Remora pocket mag holder. I bought a M&P compact weapon light which fits great on the gun. and I'm including a X-Grip mag extension which fits over the 17 round mags and gives you an excellent full grip feel on the gun. I especially liked to carry a 17 rounder in the remora as a backup mag. 

I'm asking $600obo for the package. I'm losing out quite a bit after adding all the accessories.

As far as trigger work I can polish the internals where metal rides on metal, replace your connector and springs for a lighter, smoother trigger. On the m&p models I do a custom trigger job without changing any internal parts and can create a reliable 2.25lb pull but can also make it anywhere from 6lbs to 2.25lbs to suit your needs.

The Argentine Navy received many of these. The navy rifles are marked “ARA”(Armada Republica Argentina) next to the Argentine crest on the receiver. In the early 1960s the Argentine Navy converted their FN-49s to 7.62mm Nato. This was done by installing a new barrel. At the same time they were modified to use a detachable magazine. This was a 20-round magazine that resembles a FN-FAL magazine but it is not interchangeable. This was the only official conversion of the SAFN to use a detachable magazine.

Some (Very Few) Argentine Navy FN-49s were imported to the U.S. in the 1990s.

The 20-round magazines were shortened to hold 10 rounds to make them compliant with the Clinton-era high-capacity magazine ban. These guns also had the muzzle cap welded in place so an evil flash hider could not be installed. A few years after the magazines were shortened, the government changed the interpretation of the import rules to allow standard-capacity magazines to come in if they were made before 1994. There are now some 20-round magazines available."" (GunDigest)

The gun has had its share of rounds through it, but does not show it, I'd like to sell or trade it towards +cash a glock 19 or 17 in flat dark earth ONLY.  I am not looking for anything else, I am very picky for some reason and I'm only looking for the glock as I've had everything from 1911's to cz's.  

A little background on these guns, when the beretta setup didn't take off in Brazil after they already had everything set up to go they sold off everything down there to taurus and moved north.  Taurus used the beretta dies to make the first guns with only minor differences that they had to do for beretta to sell them the machinery.  

This gun is a 1982 so it has the European style magazine release on the bottom of the magwell.  This gun has two magazines,  a flush fitting 15rd and a 19rd extended.  Also included is a uncle Mikes holster.  This gun shoots great and has a nice smooth trigger. 

I've looked around and the price on the early pt92s are between $350 and $425, I'm asking $280 firm.

I DO NOT LIKE HI_POINT, I DO NOT LIKE SKS, I DO NOT LIKE MOSIN NAGANTS. Please keep this in mind if you have a trade offer, that I only want to trade for firearms of similar value, or a little less value, with you adding cash to make up the difference. 

Feel free to email or text me any time of day. If you call, leave a message as I don't answer numbers I don't know. Thanks and have a great day. 336264901six"

The previous owner installed a rail on the underside of the barrel shroud so you can attach a laser or light. This former submachine gun has the folding stock welded to the receiver to qualify it as a handgun in the ATF's eyes. If you want to, you can file your tax stamp, cut the two small welds and convert it into an SBR. I will throw in an extra folding stock that works (attached to a torch-cut receiver). It also comes with the magazine pouch (in surplus condition) and cleaning rod. The VA CHP only allows loaded handguns in cars, so I bought this to stow in my car. Trouble is, I drive a Civic and this is a big ""handgun""! It would make a good truck gun or home defense weapon, especially with a light or laser.

I am selling it due to moving to .45 ACP, not because of anything wrong with this gun.  Honestly, this is one of the nicest Sigs you'll see for sale.

You can look up the factory specifics on the gun here:  http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/p229-elite-dark.aspx

I didn't think I'd like the beavertail, but I loved it.  It actually isn't a problem for concealed carry.  What's really special about this P229 is the work done by Grayguns out of Oregon.  Simple google searching about Grayguns will lead you to forums where you will learn it is the most highly respected Sig gunsmith shop in the country.

I had three actions performed on the P229 by Grayguns late last year.  The action enhancement package was done, which basically means spring swaps were done (but not too extreme to make light primer strikes) and all trigger parts were polished and improved as much as possible.  There is a short trigger installed on it (short length, not SRT).  Finally, since the Elite Dark Sigs come with horrible adjustable rear sights, a fixed rear sight was installed.  The rear sight is completely black (I'm never going back to three-dot) and has a smaller than average notch, and the front sight is fresh tritium.

The result is the best-pointing, most comfortable Sig with the fastest shots on target.  Other awesome shit about the gun include the great Short Reset Trigger, great feeling Sig thin aluminum grips, beefy extractor, and front cocking serrations.

With the gun I will include:

- Small case
- FIVE .40/.357sig magazines, all great condition
- Old short trigger that used to be on it
- Optional:  Galco IWB Royal Guard II holster for P229R in great condition

Full discretion.  I used this full time on duty and off as a police officer.  Best estimate is around 1500-180 rounds.  It therefore has some holster wear and some light wear on the top of the barrel, but everything has been cared for.  I'm attaching a picture showing the sights and the top of the barrel.  I use the best grease money can buy for slide rails and keep the other moving parts lubed appropriately.  I've never had a malfunction with it.

If you prefer 9mm, the Bar-Sto or EFK conversion barrels have great reviews and I've read you can use the 9mm in the Sig .40 mags with no issues, but I haven't tried that.

From Magpul: ""The third-generation PMAG further expands the strength, reliability, and versatility of the original PMAG. Along with all variants of the AR-15/M16/M4, the GEN M3 is fully compatible with the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, and even the FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S. It’s molded from a polymer formula that delivers distinctly greater resistance to crushing and all forms of impact, with extra reinforcement in the mag catch and feed lip areas. A new-design four-way anti-tilt follower ensures even smoother feeding, even when contaminated by dust or grit. Pop-off dust cover, included, helps minimize debris intrusion and prevent damage during storage."""

This SKS is is great shape and has an ATI Synthetic Stock in Flat Dark Earth (FDE) with rubber recoil reducer pad. The stock has an adjustable buttrest for comfortable shooting. It comes with one Tapco FDE magazine. I have installed a Wartak SD Rail on the gun which guarantees no movement during shooting. This is not a cheap accessory rail that you get online that will put your scope out of zero with each shot. This is a well made, custom rail that will hold any optics that will hold zero after thousands of rounds making this a great hunting/scoping rifle. I also sent this trigger off to be fixed and updated by Kivaari and it now has a 3.5 lb pull and the sear and spring have been replaced. This is a very nice rifle and will eat some inexpensive 7.62 ammo! It also has a multi-position folding FDE foregrip that has storage in the base. Lastly, it has an adjustable trip attached to the bayonet lug for precise shooting. This gun has been given a modern makeover. The scopes on the gun are not included! Located in the Lenoir City/Kingston area."

Item G-37262-1

Kimber says the Solo® puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers.  Kimber also says what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size.  With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal, and many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target"

Our introduction of +P 9X18 Makarov ammunition is the result of numerous customer requests. With no high quality +P ammunition available for the millions of Makarov pistols that are now in America, the American 9X18 pistol owner has no viable/effective self defense ammo for use in these high quality pistols, until now.
I am not a fan of using expanding bullets for self defense in smaller less powerful cartridges like the 9X18 or the 380 auto, as the expansion of these light weight smaller bullets often limits the penetration required to incapacitate the threat, but there are circumstances where the use of expanding ammo is an advantage. For more information on this subject, please read our ""technical article"" on ""The Use of Expanding Bullets in Small Defensive Cartridges"" posted under the ""Technical Articles"" category on our home page.
This new 95gr. JHP+P, 9X18 Mak loading, (Item # 34A) is roughly 200 fps faster than normal ball 95gr. Makarov ammo. This new +P load also features flash suppressed powder as roughly 95% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light, when the criminal element is active. This ammunition will not blind the shooter in low light situations, which is an important tactical advantage.
This ammo was reliable and quite accurate in our test guns. We noted no accelerated wear from the use of +P loads in our test pistols, although common sense suggests that any +P ammo will wear any pistol at a faster rate than weaker ammo. Please note the below real world velocities from our stock over-the-counter test guns
