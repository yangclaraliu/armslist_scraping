The below groups were shot with Federal American Eagle 150 gr. Below is a parts list with prices, along with a asking price for this awesome setup.

M1A Scout Rifle: $1600
GI Fiber Glass Stock: $125
Viper PST 2.5-10x FFP Scope: $800
Griffin Armament Rings: $130
M14 CASM Mount: $140
Sadlak National Match Piston: $50
Sadlak National Match Guide Rod: $40
Gas Shim Kit: $20
TNVC Raised Stock Pack: $75
Multicam Grip wrap (will come with the whole roll): $20
3 extra CMI 20 rd mags with magpul ends: $90

Grand Total: over $3000 invested

The rifle will come with 1 Springfield Armory 20 and 3 CMI mags all with magpul ends. It will also come with all the items in the last picture for taking it apart and lubing it. I'm willing to take off certain parts and to alter the price (scope, rings, stock pack, etc). 

Since it takes a lot to make these rifles shoot like this, and this is one of the few that is capable of shooting this well, I'm looking for $3k obo for the whole package. If you are not interested in the scope & rings, I will knock off $900, bringing the total to $2100. You can invest a lot of time and money and still not get an M1A that shoots like this one does. Prices, do not include shipping. 

I also have multiple checkmate 20 round mags and 1 5 round checkmate mag that can be purchased. As well as an assortment of 308 ammo from Federal FMJ brass to match grade. Thank you for your interest."

The bluing is good with only a few very small scratches and very little wear on the wood forearm. The rifling in the barrel (JM Stamped) has been inspected by a gun smith and is in very good shape. The bolt, lever, and extractor are in very good shape as well and are fitted nice and tight. This gun is a pre-safety model and made back when the original Marlin company was in business. No fakes here.

This is a CAI Canik 55 TP-9 9mm semi automatic handgun with a 4 inch black barrel. This gun features double and single action, adjustable sights, a black polymer frame with an ambidextrous decocker/magazine release, loaded chamber indicator, and interchangeable backstraps. Comes in case with two 18 round magazines, a polymer holster, cleaning rod, and brush.TP-9 employs a double-action striker-fired mechanism with a de-cocking button located on the top rear of the slide. When a round is chambered, the striker is cocked (you can see it at the rear of the slide). Depressing the de-cock button with either the right or left thumb returns the trigger to a short double-action trigger stroke.

Once the action and bolt have been blueprinted they will be matted to your choice of barrel.  Shilen, Krieger, Bartlein, Rock Creek, ect...  the barrel will be threaded, breeched, head spaced, crowned and can be threaded for a break.

We can build a barreled action that can be sold with or without a stock.  Your choice of stock: Bell and Carlson, HS precision, McMillan, ect.  We offer pillar bedding and free floated barrels.

Each build is different and is built to your specs.  Cost of your build will vary depending on parts and features for your build.

I put a box of ammo thru it (50 rds)

Never carried it so no holster wear. 

I'm 100% FIRM on my price.  Anyone who knows what this is knows its a good deal. 
Comes with what it came with and that's it. Box, 1clip, lock and papers. 

If you want to buy it and have the cash email me and I will call you promptly to meet. 
No phone number I assume you aren't serious and I ignore and delete your email. 
If the posting is still here I still have the gun.  Sick of wasting my time with goofballs who don't even have the money or can't meet for a week so if you don't have the cash right now please have the common courtesy to not waste my time.

I bought it in lightly used/like new condition, and put a few hundred more rounds through it, generally babying it.  It's in very good condition cosmetically, and is quite a shooter.  If you're not familiar with these guns, they're known for being accurate, and this example is no exception.  Its an all steel 16+1 capacity pistol that was largely inspired by the Browning Hi-Power and 1911. It was designed for cocked and locked carry, so the safety only clicks on when the hammer is back. 1911 fans will probably find this design to be very comfortable.  SA trigger is very nice.  I've customized it with CZ Custom Shop thin black aluminum competition grips with griptape, and with those grips it is incredibly slim and carries well, even for a full size pistol, in the Old Faithful holster.

lifetime warranty and custom load customer service
basically the scope gets sighted in at 100 yrds, you enter the ammo information for what you are using, there are thousands of options to choose from and if its not there burris will make you a spec for your load.
you choose your target by putting the laser sight on it press the remote button (the thing on the side of the stock) and it locks the range finder on the target
the scope then calculates distance, range, drop, windage, etc. it may even wipe your ass. It then adjusts your reticle pov for the target, you reallign the dot and makes you look like a better shot than you really are.
