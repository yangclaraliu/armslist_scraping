The stock has a 3 AA marking on the left side, a P under the hand grip, and the cross cannons under the mag pouch all markings are crisp and visable.  It has a correct UQ stamped mag and a WWII mag pouch on the stock.  The sling is marked F-S CO 1943 and is in great shape almost looks too good so I will say that is possibly not original.  I do have two later made mag pouches one dated 1952 and a new manufacture look alike both hold two mags as well.  4 more 15 round newer mags marked with a U.  I got this off of a friend of mine who collects older rifles like this a while back and unfortunately need to let it go to a new home.  It is in amazing shape for such a old rifle.

I bought this thing back in the 1990's from a department store that happened to sell rifles. Think I shot one round through it since I purchased it. I refinished the stock, only ""modification"" to the rifle. The bolt/barrel/receiver all share the same serial number. 

Barrel markings are ""VKT"" with a ""D"" underneath, then serial #, then 1941. Making it a Finnish rifle. Two piece Finnish stock. Hex receiver.

Cons: Small bit of rust on the magazine exterior. Can see that in picture. Small bit of rust on forward sling swivel and trigger. Barrel bands are loose but looks like screws just need tightened. The extractor is broken/gone. I don't know why it broke, but it did the first time I used it. I had too many rifles at the time (as if there is such a thing) but having many, it was never a priority to fix. This is not some sort of collector rifle, if anyone even collects them lol. It's got scratches and discolored finish, plus the refinished wood, so it's a shooter IMO.

The barrel appears to be in good shape. 

I have lee reloading dies for this, and probably a few (~20) casings, perhaps some loaded rounds. All would go with. 

I'm not really sure what these go for, I checked gunbroker but the variations are so many I don't think I can accurately compare. I'm willing to negotiate on price, obviously that is based on demand!

Will not ship, sorry. Local only.

If you have any questions, please ask.

It is a chinese model with all numbers matching. I have it set up in this sweet ArchAngel Stock. This thing is 100 times better and more comfortable than an original wood stock. With the ArchAngel stock this now allows for a bi-pod setup which is installed and included and also a 5 round magazine instead of the old top-loader. If you would like 10 round magazines I can get those for you at an additional $30 as I have to drive far to get them and they are hard to get your hands on. The Bayonet is still installed but hides very well, this is perfect for a last ditch effort to save your life. I wasnt origionally going to leave it on but it actually looks cool and doesnt take away from the rifle at all. The 7.62x54r is a very impressive round, i wouldnt hesitate to hunt with it and plinking is very cheap at .20ish per round. Im asking $500 for this setup. Im flexible and also a nice guy so please let me know what you have in mind including trades. You can reach me by call or text @ 719-306-3nyne6two"

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK®416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN®SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.

In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

I have for sale a Sig Sauer P250. I have a 9mm subcompact version and a  9mm compact caliber X-change kit. Basically the P250 has a feature where you can remove the trigger housing from one frame and put it into another, while not having to buy another gun. The trigger housing is serial numbered so it is the only registered part. Check it out here: 

http://www.sigsauer.com/catalogproductlist/pistols-p250.aspx

I have the subcompact and a compact kit, effectively giving you a small carry gun and a home defense/range gun. The subcompact comes with two magazines, a case, gun lock, manual etc. The compact also has a case, one magazine and comes with factory tritium night sights. 

Both of these guns have very nice double action triggers and are very accurate and soft-shooting. I have no problem doing fast double-taps with each of these models. The subcompact has a very slim grip, takes 12 round magazines and is very easy to conceal. The compact has 15 round magazines and has an accessory rail, it's generally a great nightstand gun. I also have a Crossbreed holster for the subcompact. It's a really comfortable and well-fitting holster.

I bought this gun about 1 and a half months ago. I'm moving to California at the end of the summer and unfortunately I'm selling most of my guns. Collectively this P250 and the kit have about 90 rounds through them. I bought the subcompact for $425 and the X-change kit goes for $250-$300 online. I'm asking for $500 for both of them."

It also had a trigger job ($100) that delivers a very sweet double-action trigger, best I've felt, and improved single-action trigger, very impressive piece all around. These have increased in value over the last couple years, especially the 3"" model for CCW folks.  I checked Gunbroker completed auctions before listing and the nicer ones were going for $650-$755 (some reserve met, some not) depending on condition and if it included box/ppwk.  That did not include the shipping and FFL fees or a trigger job, so that is what I am going on for market value, what people are paying for them.

$800 cash. Any trades will need to be a good deal at this time for me to consider.

Semi-auto pistols or maybe revolvers in .357 mag & .44 mag.

 Varnished rosewood grips.

Cylinder has nice markings with the correct 3 patents dated:

Top of the barrel reads; ""SMITH & WESSON SPRINGFIELD. MASS.""

**The Model One was S&W's first successful revolver design and one of the world's very first cartridge revolvers.
It was also the world's first gun to be chambered in .22 rimfire.
However, .22 rimfire back in 1860 was not the potent stuff you can buy down at your local gun shop today, therefore, though it is in perfect firing condition, this firearm is not meant for firing anymore, best as a showpiece or an antique display.
There is expected wear due to time, but very little considering the age.
The rosewood grips are in great condition Action works nicely.
Tip-up barrel latch is still tight and locks up to the frame tightly.

807,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3300807,For Sale/Trade:  1922 d 'no mint mark' wheat penny,"Westminster, Colorado, United States",$ 500,"Listed On: Saturday, July 26, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The 1922 ""plain"" or ""no d"" can be produced from four different die pairs. Die Pairs #1, #3 and #4 produce either 
a ""weak D"" or a ""No D"". Die Pair #2, which is the most desirable of the four die pairs, always produces a ""No D"". 

In 1922 only the Denver Mint was responsible for producing Lincoln Cents. Both Mints were busy producing 
millions of Silver Dollars. No nickels, dimes, quarters, or half dollars were produced in 1922. The creation of all 
four die pairs was the result of the Denver Mint running out of usable dies with thousands of cents needed to be 
struck to fill their quota. 

Die Pairs #1, #3 and #4 were the result of ""mint grease"", which is a combination of dirt, metal, and oil, filling the 
area of the mintmark. Mint grease would fill the mintmark gradually, resulting in different levels of ""weakness"". It 
is believed that the mint grease would fall out, then refill creating a cycle of normal D's, broken D's, weak D's, and 
no D's. When looking at circulated examples of 1922 D's, keep in mind that the mintmark could have simply be 
worn from use. Die Pairs #1, #3 and #4 have ""weak reverses"" because they were struck with worn reverse dies. 

Die Pair #2 is not believed to be the result of ""mint grease"". A pair of dies that were creating 1922 D's clashed 
together. The clash resulted in damage to both the obverse and reverse die. The reverse die was badly 
damaged, and replaced with a newer less worn die. The obverse die was reworked by a mint employee who 
erased all traces of the D mintmark while repairing and polishing the die. The result is a worn obverse die with no 
trace of a mintmark and a strong reverse die. 

All 1922 weak D or No D coins fall into one of 7 categories:
1. Die Pair #1 Weak D (Weak Reverse)
2. Die Pair #1 No D (Weak Reverse)

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR15/M16 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock.

882,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3300882,For Sale:  Winchester Model 21 Skeet 20 Gauge,"Phoenix, Phoenix, Arizona","$ 3,500","Listed On: Monday, July 21, 2014",Shotguns,Winchester                                                                                ,20 Gauge                                                                                ,Side by Side                                                                                ,Shotgun,"I am the fourth owner of this 21. I found it here in Tucson in August of 2006. The previous owner was selling this 20 gauge Skeet model and an original Model 21 Skeet model in 410 bore, both of which were left to him by his father. The father bought both guns from the original owner here in Tucson on December 16th, 1976. The original owner had ordered both 21's through Mathews & Boucher in Rochester, New York on February 7th, 1952. The guns were built to his specifications and finally arrived at Mathews & Boucher where they transferred to the original owner on September 24th, 1952.

Once I took possession of the gun, I decided to send it to Connecticut Shotgun in New Britain, Connecticut to have the barrels and receiver reblued. There were a few spots of missing blue on the trigger plate, possibly from a few drops of blood, and some fine scratches on the barrels from what I assumed was from use in the field. The buttstock and forend wood were and still are just about perfect and needed no attention at all.

After about six weeks, Lou in the gun room at Connecticut Shotgun sent the gun back to me. His work on it was exceptional. It hasn't been fired since.

The length of the raised matted rib barrels is 28 inches. The left barrel is choked WS-2 and the right WS-1. The front sight is a Bradley red bead and the middle is the 94B Winchester white metal sight. The safety is non-automatic. The trigger is gold plated. The ejection is selective. Bore diameters by my CPS bore gauge are .616 for both barrels. The choke constriction on the left barrel measures just shy of .602 and the right comes in at .603 so in fact, the chokes run closer to modified. Quoting from Schwing's book on the 21 regarding chokes, it states on page 95 ""Where constriction was slight, in the case of Winchester Skeet #1 and Winchester Skeet #2, choke diameter would vary with the bore.""

The stock is the straight English style with the later Diamond pattern checkering on the slim beavertail forend. DAC is 1 5/8ths of an inch and DAH is 2 inches. LOP is 14 inches to the center of the checkered butt. The cast is neutral and the overall length is 44 and 5/8ths. It has ""select nice wood"" and a ""medium comb - leaning to the thin side"". Although the gold oval name plate is supposed to be engraved with the owner's initials according to the build sheet, there are no initials present. The oval is still slightly proud of the stock, so I think that he must have changed his mind about that. Weight is approximately 6 and 1/2 pounds. 

I'm not a dealer but I can go through a local dealer if needed at an additional cost to cover his transfer fee. The gun will be carefully packaged and shipped in a hard case. 

One like this doesn't come along often. I have been very careful to represent this desirable 21 as accurately as possible. As stated previously, this gun was reblued and serviced by Connecticut Shotgun and has not been fired since. It is in perfect working order if you choose to actually shoot it."

It is in excellent condition. It is a mid size K-frame, all stainless, six shot, fixed sight revolver chambered in 38 special and will also shoot 38+P. It is a pre-lock and pre-mim model. Action is tight and typical S&W smooth. This gun came from the California Department of Corrections and has a CDC serial number professionally stamped on the left side of the frame. These guns were used by wardens and staff officers so they were carried lightly and fired infrequently for qualifications. Comes with new Pachmayr Compac Pro grips with exposed backstrap. This compact gun will make a good concealed carry or home defense weapon and is very accurate for a snubbie. Sorry, no box or papers. Price shown is for a face to face cash sale in the Aiken area."

They are all in great working order and have served me well, I'm just trying to raise money for some other gear. 

The first is an off-brand Chinese long-eye-relief scope. It is 2-7x32. The brand name is printed anywhere on it, it's just a cheap scope. Runs for about $50 on Amazon.com. This scope has seen almost no use.

Second is a TruGlo 4MOA red-dot/green-dot sight. Works great and is in clean condition. I paid $50 for it when it was on sale at Dicks sporting goods. Regular price at Dick's was $80 as I remember. This optic has been used only gently and still works great and is in great cosmetic shape.

Last but certainly not least is a UTG 4MOA red-dot/green-dot with a quick-detach mount. I think I paid $45 for this sight. The fit and finish on it is certainly superior to the TruGlo, although the dot itself is not quite as crisp. I've mounted this optic on my rifle but never used it at all, and never fired a round through the gun with the optic mounted, so it's essentially brand new. 

All in all I've got about $150 wrapped up in all of these optics. I'll sell all three for $100, or just the scope and the TruGlo for $60. I'm not interested in trades. Except for the TruGlo, all of them come with original boxes."
