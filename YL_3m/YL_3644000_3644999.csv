I just had it completely restored and it runs, looks, rides and drives like new! I restored it with plans to keep it, but due to unforeseen circumstances, now I'm looking to sell. Over $2500 invested in restoration alone in the last 2 months, of which I have receipts for. You name it, its new on this one. New Honda factory seat, engine controller, speedometer, bearings, ball joints, tie rods, seals, battery and seals. The clutch and transmission were also completely redone with new parts front to back. It has had a fresh tune up and carburetor rebuild. It also has brand new aluminum brush guard and boot guards up front, which also includes a mounting plate for a winch. To finish it off I have installed a nice like new set of Honda Factory wheels and tires. The ATV has extremely low hours and miles. It can be ran as automatic or electric shift and also has push button 2 or 4 wheel drive. Trade interest have been listed on the main pic, but cash is king! I'm asking $3800 or best reasonable offer on this one. I also run an FFL licensed shop and could accept credit card payments through the shop, but it would add 3.5%.

From Remington's website:
“Why yes, that’s really five shots.” Tell your friends it’s genetics. Fact is, when it comes to precision, there’s no finer pedigree in the industry than Remington® varmint rifles. And with the introduction of our new Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint, staking claim to our legendary accuracy is a more attainable feat than ever.

The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700™ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.

Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the hot new 17 Remington Fireball. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes won’t spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

Newly designed SPS Varmint stock with vented beavertail fore-end
Sling swivel studs included

Leatherwood 6-24x50 M-1200 Camputer Auto Ranging Trajectory Riflescope Product Info
Leatherwood 6-24 x 50mm M-1200 Camputer Auto-Ranging Rifle Scope LART624X50TAK is an Auto Ranging & Trajectory Rifle Scope that uses advanced rifle scope technology toimage eliminate the need for range estimation - the same technology the US Military uses to train long-range snipers. The Leatherwood 6-24x 50mm Auto-Rang Riflescope allows you to adjust the scope for long range and still have all the internal adjustments for initial zero and fine adjustment. The Leatherwood Rifle Scope extends the range to the limit of the stopping power of cartridges like the 338 using long range bullets for ""dead-on"" accuracy.
Each Leatherwood Hi-Lux Riflescope features fully multi-coated optics system that gives you a crisp, clear, brilliant and high resolution picture. This riflescope is designed to give you the advantage in the field. The Leather Wood M-1200 ART Rifle-Scope by Leatherwood is ideal for long ranges; the magnification and maximum range are perfect for 338 cartridges. Leatherwood Hi-Lux Camputer Riflescopes are distinguished from other riflescopes because they auto-range your target for you. Let the Leatherwood Hi-Lux M-1200 ART Riflescope do all the work so you can spend more time hunting or shooting.

I've never shot corrosive ammo through this, Wolf ammo is plentiful and very inexpensive.  Accepting trades, shoot me an offer and I'll let you know!  Thanks for looking!
Please note:  manufacturer listed is Saiga, but this is NOT a Saiga.  Armslist just doesn't have Arsenal, Inc.  on their list."

Just toss some plates in and you're ready to defend your life and home in the event of home invasion or other unsavory scenario.

Barrel Length 	18.5
Capacity 	5

I have a new, unfired CZ 527.  The Carbine is an intermediate range ‘brush gun.’ This handy rifle features open sights, a straight comb walnut stock and weighs less than 6 pounds! It’s the only model in the CZ family of bolt action rifles that is chambered for the popular 7.62×39. This cartridge is a top pick for younger shooters for its low recoil and effectiveness on medium sized game such as deer or wild boar out to 200 yards.  The barrel is hammer-forged.  I have the receipt I can show you, I paid $804.XX with tax, shipping & transfer fee.  I will add another magazine for an extra $40.00.  It comes with CZ mounting rings if you want to put on a scope.  I never got the chance to take this out and fire it, but Im tight on money now and need the cash.  I will throw in a Caldwell Deadshot Front Bag and a 7.62x39 cartridge necklace for free.  I will also include the black case that its in since I got rid of the box.  The factory oil is still in the barrel and needs to be cleaned out first before firing."

For sale/trade is a 2 year old Lincoln Square Wave TIG 175. It comes with a ton of accessories. Everything works perfect. It has been an awesome machine. Has seen VERY little use. I haven't even used one tank of gas yet.

Unit can run both a TIG torch and a Stick torch and includes both. Comes with food petal. Comes with about 3-4 lbs of 6013 stick electrodes. Stainless/Aluminum/Steel Filler in various sizes. Parts Kits provide collets, collet bodies, a back cap, alumina nozzles and tungstens in a variety of sizes. Includes the extremely heavy duty Lincoln cart and 50 ft cord. I have around $2600 invested into machine/parts and accessories. Will also come with the regulator.

You can't beat an American Company. Miller or Lincoln make excellent products and you can't go wrong with either.

I would consider selling only the bare machine with cart.

The only thing I cannot include is the Argon cylinder as it is leased.

This is a turn key system and all you will need is Argon.

We are moving and will be in rentals for the next few years and won't have access to 220v so I need to sell or possible trade for a 110v unit.  I might even add guns on my end if you have a nice smaller TIG.

This gun is in absolutely wonderful condition, slick and smooth action.

Barrel, full length magazine tube and receiver have bright hi-gloss and perhaps polished blue. Exceptional color on the lever and hammer. Wood fits quite nicely, is solid with no splits or cracks. There is a nice knot on the stock, right side. The condition of the rifling is very good. It is in great working order with no major dents, scratches, or dings. I have used this gun gently over the years, probably less than 200 rounds have been fired. I have taken good care of the gun. This gun has original parts and refinished from what I have been told. It was bought at Wolfs Sporting Goods in the 70′s and has not been changed. It does have some scratches and dings, which are minor overall. The dings are from transporting and bumping the butt, not dropping it in the dirt.

This will be an excellent addition to any collection.

The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semi-automatic pistol manufactured in Italy and intended for personal defense and law enforcement deployment. The Beretta Px4 Storm is hybrid design borrowing the short-recoil, rotating barrel as the Beretta 8000 models and the trigger and safety system from the Beretta 92, 96, and M9 series. What makes the Beretta Px4 Storm unique is the light-weight polymer construction with steel inserts, a modular trigger group, fully enclosing slide, Picatinny rail, and changeable backstrap options."

Its in good shape and has been lightly used, and is exceptionally accurate. These are similar to the Glock 35 and long slide M&P, I recently traded for it but its length makes it hard for me to carry since I don't carry IWB, so I'd like to see if someone would be interested in trading for something a bit shorter in .40.

Would primarily be interested in a Glock 23 or 22, XD40 service, M&P40, Beretta 96, or similar .40 caliber handgun. Might conaider similar weapons in 9mm, but for the most part only interested in something in .40 at this time, and not interested in rifles or shotguns.
