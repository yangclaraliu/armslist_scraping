It is a standard model ruger sr556,  which is a gas-piston operated rifle. Chrome lined barrel, chrome lined piston chamber, chrome plated bolt carrier group, stainless piston, drive rod and tube. This rifle before upgrades is the AR-15 that can match the AK in durability, reliability and longevity. It is heavier than a direct impingement rifle, but i liked that extra heft. Helped with the recoil which helped with follow up shots and steadier target acquisition.  Now for the list of upgrades. I put in a TAC CON 3MR trigger which is a bump fire trigger. Once you get the feel for it you can dump magazines as if it were a legit automatic. Took me less than 200 rounds to get the hang of it. In semi-auto mode it is one of the nicest triggers you can put in an AR. Very clean,  crisp and light.

This rifle is in excellent condition for it’s age. The rifle sports many charcoal and straw colored part as well as deep rich bluing (nearly 95%). This bore looks like it is new mirror like finish. Comes with the cleaning rod. 

Now the bad news, Bubba decided to take a matching near mint 1895 Chilean and tried make a target shooter out of it. He installed a 12x Unterl target scope. This consisted of drilling and tapping two (2) screws in the front ring (professional done and did not penetrate to the barrel shank. He then removed the rear sight and handguard and D&T two (2) holes into to the rear sight base. 

He next had the matching bolt bent over and ground down (very thin to clear the scope). All in all, kiss an all matching 1895 Chilean long rifle good bye. 

Fortunately, Bubba saved the parts and I found a matching bolt (numbers match the bolt parts not the rifle). He still had the handguard, rear sight ladder, spring and screw. 

I bought this to use as a shooter, but have come across others over so time for this one to go. 

This is not a mint all matching rifle that could cost $600-900. But a really nice Chilean 1895 shooter. Better than the usual grey metal, oily black stock mismatched beater. Not many left to choose from. 

Asking $295. Might trade for a nice Yugo 24/52c 8mm rifle (Yugo captured VZ-24).

Description



Designed with tactical shooters in mind, the XPS2-300 offers a 2-dot ballistic drop reticle that allows the shooter to zero either subsonic or supersonic rounds in the same reticle pattern.  Offered in the XPS2 platform, it is the shortest and lightest HWS sight available.  Its size and weight make it convenient for hunters, military and law enforcement officers to carry.  The single compact lithium 123 battery configuration opens up more space on the rail for rear iron sights or magnifiers.  This sight has the same body style as the XPS3™ model, but the XPS2 does not have night vision-compatibility.

The engine came out of a bike that was wrecked and parted out with only 4,000 miles. It still needs final wiring, the exhaust finished, and a fuel system to run. The wiring harness and computer are present, they just need to be hooked up to power and a starter switch of some kind. Someone could buy a gauge cluster for an 09 gsxr 750 and have working gauges and a key start, all plug and play. The harness also has provisions for turn signals, headlights,  and taillights if you want to make it street legal. It has +2 control arms and a +4 swing arm, a new sprocket for the motor and chain still in the box. The seat has a new execute gripper seat cover that will help keep you glued to it when riding. The header is present and runs past the O2 sensor bung and I have a pair of Yamaha R1 factory mufflers that came off a new bike on the showroom floor at a local Yamaha dealership that go with it. It just needs a Y pipe made to connect the header to the mufflers. The fuel rail with injectors is still installed,  it just needs a tank with a pump and lines hooked up to it. I have decent plastics that go with it but they will need to be painted or vinyl wrapped to look new again. Also have a new battery that go with it as well.

It would be a blast to finish but work, a new baby, and other projects have sidelined this one and I don't think I would finish it anytime soon.

There where only a limited production of this compact beretta in the Inox finish and are kinda hard to come by.

The 92 series semiautomatic pistol operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and time-proven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. INOX version:

Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block.
External Hammer Design.
Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever.
Sure, Firm Grip: The front and back of the grip are grooved on the 92FS and M9, while the M9A1 and 90-Two feature checkering. 
High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 30 rounds in 9mm.

With this package you will have a shot gun for both bird and deer season.   Have gotten many pheasant, grouse and deer with it.  Can not hunt anymore due to physical restriction so some one else might as well get some use out of it.  The shot gun handles very well.   It is also a good skeet shooting shotgun. 

Some consider these shotguns collectors items.   They are a part of history, named for the hall of famer Sox slugger of the mid last century.

The shotgun is in real good shape.

Must have a New Hampshire conceal carry pistol permit and New Hampshire ID.  If you do bot have a pistol permit or are not a NH resident then you must go through a dealer and a back ground check at your cost.  Most dealers charge $25."

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

It is the stainless colored slide model.  Comes with factory items (gun, 1 magazine, box) as well as three holsters.  Two holsters are IWB carry and one is a pocket holster.  Gun also has the hogue grip which makes it much easier to handle being small.  Not looking to trade, selling to fund my ATV project.  Includes pictured items, ammo included. $275 for everything, $250 pistol only.  Those prices are firm and will not change. Thank you

I am aware that you can buy the gun new for $300-$330 depending on who your local gun store is. However by the time you pay the taxes, your another $20-30 on top of that, plus then you have to buy ammo to feed the gun.  My price includes an assortment of ammo  (about 150 rounds) ($60-$75), and three holsters ($90-100) which would cost you another $150-$175 if purchased separately."

This is a legit 9mm MP5 not that 22lr look alike. Made by Turner Fabrications who has been making MP5's for a long damn time, its the closest you will get to an Genuine HK MP5 without taking out a second Mortgage! Note, HK does not make MP5's anymore, they havent for awhile, finding one for sale is near impossible, and if you do it is going to cost a but load. This thing is in perfect condition and functions flawlessly.

$3000 cash FIRM or trades listed below. You will pay over $4,000 to buy all this new after its all said and done, Get mine and save $1,000.

Serious offers ONLY. Cash Price is FIRM at $3k, will not take lower. If you want it shipped, you pay shipping. If offering trade, your trade item will be valued at what it goes for used NOT retail, I don't care if you say its ""New In Box"", its used. If you want to value your stuff at retail, then mine will be valued at retail($4000). All NC laws apply, meaning you will need a Pistol Purchasing Permit OR Concealed Carry Permit, violation is a State AND Federal Crime........Sorry for being blunt, but there are a lot of people on here that I have had problems with all of the above, so that is why I'm saying this.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here it is:
-MP5, All parts German HK, minus the US made Receiver(LSC Manf.)!!!!! There is one NIB on Gunbroker right now being sold by Turner Fabrications for $3100(Gun and 1 Mag!), I'm asking $3000 for everything listed in this ad!!!

-Fluted Salt Nitrate barrel, Threaded 1/2x28 and 3-Lug for both types of suppressors.

-NAVY SEF trigger group/housing (this MP5 shoots Semi-Auto ONLY tho)

-Has a ""Action 3"" bolt group with F style bolt carrier, this means it will fire F/A with a NFA Registered F/A Trigger pack. These bolt groups are banned from further importation and cost about $1,000, check hkparts.net(SOLD OUT) to confirm for yourself. Couple this with a registered F/A Sear installed in a F/A pack and your ready to blast rounds. Obviously NFA Rules apply if you take this route, and it costs $$$.

-MFI Low Profile claw mount($130)

-3 Mags ($50 ea)

-Bushnell TRS Red Dot($100)

-Brand New Folding stock($140) in separate box, I was going to make this MP5 an SBR but spent money on a suppressor instead and just haven't done it yet. I probably will if I keep it, so get it while its a Non-NFA Weapon and SBR it yourself!

-Included in this ad is 1,000rnds of factory 9mm, most are American Eagle, some Remington and Winchester too($300 @ $0.30/rnd). The ammunition container pictured is one of my 9mm containers and contains 2,000 rounds which you will be getting half of. I will sell an additional 500rnds($150) or 1000rnds($300) if you want more. 

----Note, installing the Stock on this ""Pistol"" makes it a SBR(Short Barreled Rifle), which needs to be Registered with the NFA branch of the ATF. Do not install it without registering it first, you will be getting pounded by a big fat guy in prison if you do and get caught.

783,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3764783,For Sale:  Arsenal SGL-107CR AK47 Pattern Rifle,"New Castle, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","$ 1,300","Listed On: Monday, December 1, 2014",Rifles,no type,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for sale is ""like new"" Arsenal SGL-107CR AK pattern rifle chambered in 7.62x39.  This is considered by many as the best AK you can buy with going the expensive custom route. Speaking of custom rifles Kreb's Customs and Rifle Dynamics, the two best AK shops in the country, start with Arsenal made rifles due to their top notch quality.

This rifle features a 16.25"" Bulgarian made chrome lined, cold hammer forged barrel which is considered the best AK barrel in the world, not an American made barrel like many of the other AKs being made one US. The muzzle thread are 24mm.  The Rifle also features the desirable side folding polymer stock. The stock has an indention so when folded it fits over the left hand scope rail mounted on the reciever. The lockup of the folding stock is unlike any of the others I have felt as it is rock solid. The rifle has an Arsenal 2 stage trigger that is probably the nicest AK trigger I have felt. It also has the high quality polymer handguards that have a stainless steel best shield that does not allow the handguard to heat up like traditional wood ones.  The action is very smooth with no hang up or resistance like other cheaper AKs. The rifle also has the rare 90 degree gas block with special gas port tuning and integrated front sight. The rifle will come with 2 Magpul 30 round PMags.

This model of rifle is very hard to get ahold of since it is made to become a Short Barreled Rifle with the correct paperwork, or you can shoot it as is with great accuracy.  I am asking $1200 which is fair number considering you can't find these anywhere and they are not being imported anymore by Arsenal, but I am to offers. I would consider trading for an arsenal sgl107fr or sgl21. You can reach me by email or texting me at 724seven146020. Thanks for viewing."

Cabela's offered $960 for it and they told me they only pay 60% of their value. That gives this a value of $1600 - which they would probably put for sale at $1700+. A quick search online shows nice condition ones sell for$1600-$2200. I don't have a license to ship so I wanted to sell to someone locally private party.

This was manufactured in 1942 so it's right in the heart of WWII - very rare in this condition. Barrel has perfect rifling, and shows almost zero wear around the muzzle. Careful when comparing to others as in 80% or less they are only worth about $400-$500

All metal has nearly perfect bluing, all wood is in beautiful condition. Original Winchester bakelite buttplate.

This is collector quality - check out this one at Cabelas for $1399 and its not nearly as nice as the one I have listed!

Its Remington 11, 20 gauge (fixed full choke), semi-auto, basically a Remington version of the Browning A5. Everything is original and in good condition, with most of the original blueing. The only thing that isn't original is the buttstock; I still have the original, but it was cut down to a very short length by the previous owner, likely for a child with a short length of pull. I replaced it with a new wood stock that I hand inletted and then oil finished. It looks great but does have a little play in it. I might get up the gumption to glass bed it, which would solve the problem, but I'm ready to move onto other projects The gun functions perfectly and I took a number of doves with it earlier this season.
