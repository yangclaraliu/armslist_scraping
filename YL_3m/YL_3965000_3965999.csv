Despite its small size, the P224 maintains a double-stack magazine for a
capacity of 11 rounds of 9mm and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the
P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact competitors. The model P229
magazines can also be used for an even greater round count. Featuring a
lightweight alloy frame, the P224 will be available in a number of
configurations. Initial models will be available with the Double-Action
Kellerman(DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and .357SIG Traditional
DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future. Full-size
SIGLITE night sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can
be a challenge in most subcompacts. P224 Subcompact a Classic Sig Sauer,
with one small change an ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is
an especially good choice for those familiar with the Sig Sauer manual of
arms. From the full-sized P226 to the P229 to the P224, the controls and
operation all remain the same. The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines,
allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the
flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not
having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns. As part of
the Extreme family of handguns, the P224 will feature the distinctive black
and grey Hogue Piranha grips, SIGLITE night sights.

Below I have listed the factory specifications and description for you to look over. If you have any questions feel free to give us a call, shoot us a email, or stop in and check out our large selection of NEW & USED firearms!

Description: The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1″ overall length and an 18.5″ cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3″ shells each, for a total capacity of 6 6 1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4″ shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

Would be great for home defense if you live in the city and don't want an AR-15. Comes with 2 factory Glock 17 mags.

I've added the Tandemkross upgraded hex screw kit, the metal front sight upgraded blade with neon light tube and finally if you're going to be making any kind of sight adjustments you need to have the upgraded aircraft grade aluminum adjustment screws.

I can tell you from experience that you can hit targets accurately and consistently from 100+ yards with this gun.

$2800 CASH. That's what it takes to buy it. No less. Period. Folks, I'm not living in my car nor do I desire to give this away. You can't put this kit together for anywhere close to that price. Pick up in Georgetown, KY. Bill of sale issued at time of purchase."

If there is a mold I do not have, I'm offering a trade.  If you buy the mold ($60), I'll make you an IWB and OWB holster or holster and mag pouch in exchange for the mold.  I'm trying to build up the models I can offer.  Also willing to exchange for ammo in 556/308/300BLK/9mm/40 S&W/45 ACP.  My turn around time is currently 1 week.  Basically if you can think of it, we can figure out a way to make it happen for you.  I enjoy making these holsters and being creative.  Some images I have up are of some holsters with dog tags embossed in them. I can emboss medals, badges or anything else that offers a relief. This adds a personal touch. So, let me make a set-up for you.

It is brand new in the box with, 2-15RD mags, extra back straps along with extra side straps, lock, paperwork, and HK hard case. Below I have listed the factory description, specifications for you to look over. If you have any questions feel free to call us, shoot us an email, or stop in and check out our large selection of new & used firearms!!

Description: In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

VP9 pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

This is a nearly complete original weapon, offered here almost as it was originally manufactured over 70 years ago. There are matching serial numbers on the barrel, receiver, floor plate and trigger guard. The serial number on the bolt does not match the others. The stock is cartouched and apparently original, though the excellent condition of the varnish likely indicates that it was refinished. Exterior metal retains much of the original finish, say 75% or so. The action feels smooth and tight. The bore and chamber are clean and shiny, with strong rifling and little or no muzzle erosion. The sale includes the internally-mounted cleaning rod, a modern high-quality Uncle Mike's leather sling, and a bayonet with scabbard of the correct type, though with a mismatched serial number.

Also included in the sale is a bunch of ammo, and supplies to load a bunch more. This is all as I received it when I bought somebody else's collection a few years ago, so the reloads are not my work – so of course proceed with caution, same for the military surplus ammo, though in both cases, the stuff I've fired has been fine.

The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. The Mark 23 began in development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America’s most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the  Army Special Forces. On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!

This allows for a higher, more comfortable, and more secure grip that reduces muzzle flip and improves ergonomics.

The new CompM4s retains all the great features as the CompM4, but with the battery rotated to the lower right. This allows easier access the brightness control, and gives the optic a slimmer profile. Just like the CompM4, the enhanced energy-usage provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery. The crisp 2 MOA dot brightness has 16 positions, 9 daylight and 7 optimized for use with all night vision, especially Gen-3 night-vision technology in current government use. Aimpoint's band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness. The front lens opening is threaded for addition of a KillFlash® anti-reflective device. A removable one-piece bikini cover keeps dust and scratches off the glass."

The CZ 75 is known for its reliability, shootability, and excellent accuracy due to a smooth trigger, low profile slide, and high quality barrel. The double-action trigger mechanism allows the shooter to carry the loaded pistol either “cocked and locked” with the hammer cocked and the thumb safety engaged, or with the hammer down for a double-action first shot.

This gun was originally manufactured in 1997 in the U.S.A. I have been carrying it for just over a year now and decided to get something a bit smaller. It has some holster wear in all the typical places. The action is still very tight. The slide pulls very smoothly. The barrel is in fantastic condition. It does come with two magazines and a box. Paperwork is nowhere to be found. When I took it in on trade I put about 500 rounds through it, flawlessly I might add. I then practiced periodically just to keep sharp. Let's talk value now. I've seen the value on these fluctuate drastically. I've seen them from $400 to $600 (used) based on condition and extras. I'm valuing mine based on it's functionality more than cosmetics. Although mine has holster wear, it's got a very low round count. With that being said, I am asking $500 firm. It comes with 60 rounds of FMJ and 20 rounds of JHP. I'm located in West Lafayette, IN. I am willing to travel 20 miles. I've been stood up too many times to go much further than that. The only reason I'm wanting to switch is the expense of shooting .40 ammo. I will try to keep people posted on their offers in a very timely manner. You can message me or text me. REDACTED"
