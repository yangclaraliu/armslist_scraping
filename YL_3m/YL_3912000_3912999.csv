I've fallen on hard times and I owe the bank some money, so it looks like the AR must go. I've put a lot of time, effort and money into this build and I love it more than life itself. Never had a problem with it at all. Has some wear and tear, but that gives it character, and it's all cosmetic, moving parts are all in good working condition. This has been my camping gun for a while and it's been my go-to rifle for anything. I can take more detailed pics of the scuffs if you would like. The fit between the lower is EXTREMELY tight, and I'm not exaggerating one bit. It takes a rubber mallet and a punch to get out the rear pin, the front pin isn't such a pain in the ass. The trigger pull is extremely light, crisp and never fails to go boom. Comes with 6 mags. 3 milsurp and 3 magpul. May throw in more if I can find more laying around.

TAKING THE PERFORMANCE OF COMPACT REFLEX SIGHTS TO AN ENTIRELY NEW LEVEL

The all new Micro T-2 redefines everything you thought you knew about compact red dot sights.

Inside the completely new sight housing are advanced optical lenses that takes optical performance to a new level. Cutting edge lens coatings radically improve the shape and clarity of the 2 MOA red dot – especially when used with an accessory magnifier.

Lightweight sight for extreme conditions

Built to offer the same battle-proven ruggedness as other Aimpoint products, the Micro T-2 performs reliably under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon. Suitable for use on

    Rifles
    Carbines
    Shotguns
    Submachine guns
    Handguns

The Aimpoint Micro T-2 is ideal as a standalone sight, and thanks to its small size, it can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics.


Excellent night vision compatibility

The Micro T-2 can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility. The performance of the Micro T-2 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation Night Vision Technology.

Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD) but alos when used with Aimpoint 3XMag magnifyer. 

With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-2 is ready for round the clock use.

This one has an unpinned barrel and a recessed cylinder - a very unusual configuration. This 6-shot, N-frame revolver is configured with a 6"" barrel and adjustable sites (white outline rear, and red ramp front). As it was made in 1981, it has desirable features no longer found on current Smiths: It has the square butt grip frame with wood grips, the firing pin is on the hammer, there is no lock, and it has a recessed cylinder (new Smiths have round-butt frames with rubber grips, internal firing pins, and keyed locks that disable the firearm when turned to the lock position). This one is in excellent to near mint barely used condition with almost no handling marks no issues. It has the factory mirror-quality bright Nickel finish and perfect action and timing.

If you aren't familiar with the Cougar design it is the precursor to the Beretta PX4 and uses a rotating barrel action to improve accuracy and lower recoil. Identical to the Beretta Cougar aside from the name on the slide; Beretta transferred the tooling and manufacturing equipment to Stoeger, Stoeger being a subdivision of Benelli, which is in turn owned by Beretta. Has the same manual of arms as a Beretta 92/M9, so its a great choice if you're looking for a more compact version for carry.

Has some light holster wear from being carried but overall is in good shape, bought new about two months ago and only has about 200 rounds through it. Will come with two 13 round magazines. Depending on what you have I can also include an extra 15 round magazine (modified Beretta 92 mag) and some 9mm ammo.

Just picked up a different compact carry gun, so I'd like to swap this for a bigger 9mm. Looking for a mid or full sized 9mm. Primarily looking for a polymer framed striker fired 9mm such as a Springfield XD9, Glock 17 or 19, Ruger SR9, or M&P9 but would consider similar 9mm's in this size range. Only looking for 9mm's though, and no Taurus or Kel Tecs please, with the one possible exception being a PT92.  Would be fine with adding cash for a higher value trade, so feel free to let me know what you have.

If not interested in trading I will sell it with the three mags and 50 rounds of 9mm for $350 FIRM.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested, texts preferred.

Thanks!"

Canik S-120 (CZ75 clone) $400 (Sale pending)

Ask any question you'd like. Very well informed about these two weapons, their manufatures and history.

Just poking around to see if there is any decent offers out there for trade, however, specifically looking for a truck with bed, 4x4 preferable, tho not a necessity. Of course cash can be added on top for the right trade, errr truck. 

1st up in the package deal is a Taurus PT92fs 9mm para/luger.  What is special about this Taurus is it is an all steal production from the original Taurus tooling line they bought from Beretta in the early 80's.  

Simplified, this weapon is from when Taurus did BEST what they used to do well, make copies.  

This particular version is the KING of its line.  The original production line of the Taurus's 92 series is the most highly sought after in the line and are by far the hardest to come by as they are known well for their quality and reliability. They differ slightly in ""style"" and design from their modern cousin, the Beretta 92's, in that their safety is frame mounted creating a 1911 style safety that can remain ""cocked and locked"" or otherwise known as condition 1 unlike the modern Beretta's that have built in decockers. With some exceptions however, they are for the most part interchangeable with Beretta stock or high performance parts. Modern Taurus 92's design started in 1991.  It differs from the original tooling line in that polymer is now used in place of steel in some parts and the safety is now a three position safety, position one/condition one, position 2 fire and position 3 as a push down decocker.  The modern Taurus version has been charaterized as significantly less reliable and moderately less durable than it's all steel production, brother. However I'm fairly certain Taurus itself would beg to differ.

This Taurus comes with twelve 15 round magazines (two Beretta modified), a camo 'Bug Out' holster and a Midway USA ""tactical"" pistol case. Bluing 95%+, grips some dings and scratches. Normal wear and tear for a weapon that is 25+ years old.  I'm 2nd owner runs and functions reliably. Would trust with life, makes a great bug out gun/package and too add, Taurus's life time guarantee.

Next in the package deal is my Canik55 S-120 9mm para/luger with factory Cerakote Titanium finish. Cerakote is one of the toughest finishes on the market. It out-performs any competitive gun coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications. Having this done as a factory finish is part of what makes this weapon so special, but there is so much more that make's Canik's take on the Classic CZ75 special. 

The Canik S-120 is a clone of the popular CZ75 ""cold war, Eastern Block"" staple. CZ75's are to the Europeans what the 1911 is to Americans (1911 lovers, I have one of them too so don't hate cuz its not for sale or trade).  Besides the Cerakote finish, what makes the CZ75 design so special is its world renowned combat accuracy as stated by James Grant from 'The Truth About Guns' web-blog:

""Unlike most American handguns, the CZ-75... have a slide that sits inside the frame. Why does this matter? Accuracy. In [all] my years of hands-on experience with firearms, I’ve found that the most accurate semi-automatic pistols consistently have a slide that rests inside the frame. While I can’t scientifically confirm that statement, I will say that – in my hands, at least – guns of this nature, the P210, Hammerli and CZ type guns, are consistently more accurate than most other semi-automatic pistols.... 

...Having the slide seated inside the frame rather than attached outside of the frame allows for more slide-to-frame contact in the cycling of the action. Assuming that the rails do their job, this should make the slide recoil in a more consistent manner, because there’s less room for erratic movement."" 

This is a view shared by many expert marksmen, although admittedly, opinions are like a certain bodily orifice, everybody has one. 

All Canik pistols are manufactured in Turkey by Canik55, a NATO-certified small arms maker that manufacturers small arms for many military and law enforcement organizations. All arms produced by Canik are manufactured to NATO specifications, with ALL INTERNAL PARTS chrome plated, and each model must pass a stringent 50,000-round durability testing protocol.

Caniks are truly special in their adaptation of the CZ75 platform and a must have for any tactical combat shooter. 

This Canik S-120 [low round count, 100-200 rounds through barrel] comes with two 17 round Mecgar magazines and an IWB holster produced by Bianchi. This inside waistband design provides comfort and concealability with an ultra-thin, lightweight design. Ideal for casual carry, it has soft suede construction with a thumb break design for those who prefer more security. The Adjust-A-Break thumb break provides adjustability via hook & loop on the back of the holster allowing a custom fit for a variety of similar pistol in one holster size. This holster also fits the Taurus and fits my 1911 like a glove.

This was posted was from Ruger Collectors Assoc. forum back in 2011.  I copied one of the posting on the thread for your viewing. 

""I believe that you actually have the model PP94DL, the extra P indicates ""Tactical Fingergroove grips"" while the DL means Decocker & the built-in ""Tac-Star"" Laser sight. The Red Eagle News Exchange says that there were only 208 believed made of that particular variation so it is a pretty rare pistol. I do not have a good estimate of its value....if it were mine, I would add a pretty good premium to it over a standard P94.""

These are the heavily sought after collectible.  I guarantee you have never seen one in person.  DA/SA hammer. Nice three dot sites.  Comes w/3 mags.  Safety & decocker.  Ruger box.  Gun is in like new condition as you can see.  Just put brand new batteries in laser.

When I bought this revolver it was fitted with a scope, which I removed and sold. However, it will come with a ""B-Square"" system with scope rings so that a scope may be mounted if desired. I planned to do a lot of reloading so I have 100 Hornady 240g XTP bullets as well as 750 new unprimed Norma cases and 80 primed Norma cases that I would like to go with the gun as I will no longer have any use for them. This package will also include a new box of 20 Federal Fusion 240g cartridges and a Bianchi chest holster that is large enough to fit the revolver and a scope. This is the perfect package for someone who wants to start hand loading as well as hunting with a high power revolver. 

For everything in this package I believe that $1000 is a fair price.

You can contact me here OR through gunbroker.  This is offered so buyers will have the confidence of knowing this is not any kind of BS scam. See my feedback there please.

Price is listed on GB and that price is half new price ($80) on midway for these rings that are as new only missing the card they came on.  Shipping is included. USPS MONEY ORDER ONLY....NOOOOOOOOOO paypal.

Here on this site I list things for which I will take trades!!!  See below for many items I would consider in trade. Some I will be picking up along the way so contact me ASAP if you have trade items.  TRADING we need to be fair to both parties. It's either new price to new price in comparison or used price to used price when comparing value.

Hoping for a win win trade where both move things they no longer need for something they can use BUT if someone has several items I need I may give them a bit more since saving me time, otherwise the cash price for these is the best of all deals IMO.  I also have a SINGLE 1"" version of the same rings if someone also has a single one due to one being lost or whatever.

Please Read

Who Am I:
My names Chris. I have done countless Glock Trigger/Slide jobs on my own Glocks as well as many others, I do other guns as well. I am legally allowed to possess a Handgun, I can show you my CCP and Mil ID so you know I'm not a felon. I do not own a shop, I do this as a hobby and to help people with cost. I will however do the same if not better job then you will get at a gunshop for a fraction of the price, you can pay over $100 for a polish job at gunshops! I enjoy gunwork and I do this as a hobby, I have been for many years and I am very familiar with Glocks.
-------------------------------------------------
Why Polish Internals?:
Polishing is like waxing a floor. Less friction equals smoother surface, which in our case equals a physically smoother operating gun and a smoother feel to the user. Glocks come stock with a 5lb trigger pull which in reality is closer to 6lb, sometimes 7lb due to all the friction from factory coated parts. Polishing will bring it to where it should be with stock parts which is roughly 5lbs, thus making the trigger pull feel lighter then your used to. I also offer two parts to further reduce trigger pull and enhance smoothness, that when coupled with the polish job will make your Glock operate as smooth as possible and make the trigger pull break like glass every time....Pull the trigger on one of my glocks before you commit and see for yourself!
-------------------------------------------------
What I offer:
I will completely disassemble the gun(slide and frame), clean the entire gun including the bore of the barrel where I run a oiled cloth through just to remove heavy sediment, polish all friction prone internals and reassemble. Can also polish Barrel Feed Ramp at your request with no additional Fee.
Price $30

I will Remove the Factory 5lb Connector and replace it with a ""POLISHED"" 3.5lb connector. This reduces the trigger pull to roughly 3lbs-3.5lbs.
Price $15

I will Remove the Factory 5lb Trigger Spring and Replace it with a 6lb Trigger Spring. Why heavier here? The Trigger Spring actually assists the Trigger in Pull/Reset, a Heavier one will make for a Smoother pull and Smoother Reset.
Price $5

I will refinish your scratched/worn barrel by slightly sanding, degreasing and applying a coat of Black DuraCoat DuraBake which is a heat treated form of Duracoat making it hard as nails once its heated.
$15
-------------------------------------------------
Turnaround is 48hrs, however in most cases it is ready for pickup next day, I say 48hrs for a 1 day buffer in case I have something going on with work. Cant beat that! Also I can install what ever custom parts you have purchased on your own. There will be a ""Pre"" and ""Post"" work form to fill out stating what services will be provided and that your giving and taking back possession. A copy will be made for you to keep.

Feel free to contact me to setup a time, thanks.

This is  very nice pistol upper that was built using the proper techniques, including usin. milspec Aeroshell grease on the threads and between the barrel extension and receiver. I have put about 250 rounds through it with zero malfunctions (seriously!). It is important to use a heavy buffer to ensure reliability.
