Excellent shooter, I believe the serial number puts it in the 1960s, but don't quote me on that. Action is perfect, case-hardened hammer and trigger. Hammer has a pin, no transfer bar. Haven't done any work or modifications to this revolver, it's exactly as it left the factory. The gentleman I bought it from claimed it had never been fired, but take that with a grain of salt. Comes with a leather paddle holster. $650 OBO.

It has a Zev Tech Fulcrum trigger, a Zev  Tech polished titanium striker, with marine cups and a 6lb. Firing pin spring. I also have the 5lb. And 4lb. Firing pin spring for it. I use the 6lb. Because it's setup as my self defense gun. So the trigger pull is 4lbs. And I left some pre travel in it, but you can adjust it down to 1.5lbs, with no pre travel or after travel. The trigger is super smooth, and breaks very crisp. It also has a tungsten double spring recoil assembly, a Ghost Evo 3.5 lb. connector, 3lb. Trigger spring, and polished titanium safety punger with a reduced power safety plunger spring. It has Trijicon Tritium night sights, and all 3 mags have the +1 Pearce grip extension. All the internals have been polished, and it is in mint condition. This pistol shoots great, and I have never had any malfunctions with it. I have put around 400 rounds through it with about 175 being through the new KKM barrel. I have over $1,200.00 in this gun so please keep that in mind when offering . I don't expect to get a full return on it, but I won't trade it at the value of a stock Glock either, but I will return this one back to a stock Glock, and trade it at normal value."

This truck was formerly owned by the United States military with its authentic ""army green"" paint job and is in amazing condition. It is powered by a legendary Detroit Diesel Series 60 engine that is a 6 cylinder, 4 stroke motor with 550 horsepower. It is known as the ""million mile motor"" because you can easily do that millage without any repairs or engine work. The truck has been vigorously maintained as you can see read the numbers on the fan belt and alternator. The truck has an automatic transmission, air brakes, rear wet line, dual side adjustable exterior search lights, heated mirrors, rear mud flaps, permanently mounted tow hooks and auxiliary plow lights on top of the cab. The hydraulic attachments for the plow and wet line are all clean and look new. The interior is extremely clean; the glass windows do not have any cracks or chips, while the seats look brand new, and the headliner is not stained. 

 The truck is 288 inches long, 98"" wide and 131.5 inches tall. The curb weight without the plow is 42570 pounds (17900 pounds in the front and 24670 pounds in the rear,) While the truck is very high up, the steps and handles installed make climbing inside very easy. The plow controls are easily accessible and clearly marked. The vent windows are not rusted and open easily. The truck already has a rear trailer hitch installed. 

 This truck has signs of use and wear consistent with its age. The truck is amazingly rust free, however there are some rust spots in the rear of the truck. The main ones to list the suspension springs, brake drums, and where the brackets meet the frame to secure the rear concrete weight. There are also rust spots on the four corners of the rear truck weight. Please see the pictures for the exact condition. The amber plastic cover for the rotating roof warning light is also missing. The tires (size 425/95/R20) have very bad cracks on the side walls and will need to be replaced. 

 This is a unique opportunity to own an automatic plow truck that is a blast to drive. The motor will never give the future owner any issues as these are known to run forever. Please look at the pictures carefully and feel free to ask me any questions."

It features a popular and practical Flat Dark Earth cerakote finish. Cerakote is an ultra rugged, high temperature, high performance ceramic coating ideal for firearms use.

The M6A2 rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI carbine systems feature their short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance.

This rifle's 14.7"" barrel is Cold Hammer Forged for exceptional longevity and accuracy, and has a popular 1:7"" twist rate for stabilizing the heaviest rounds. M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. The barrel is also spiral fluted to reduce weight by 20% and increase heat dispersion. The muzzle is threaded and an AAC 51T Blackout flash hider/suppressor adapter is fitted. The 51T is a clever design that functions effectively as a flash hider, and also allows installation of compatible suppressors in seconds without tools. The 51T is pinned and welded to comply with federal law.

This rifle features a 12"" lightweight sculpted quad rail handguard derived from LWRC's REPR platform. As in all of LWRCI's rifles, the bolt carrier group of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. The fire control group is also treated with this proprietary nickel coating for exceptional slickness. A B5 SOPMOD adjustable butt stock and MagPul MIAD pistol grip are outfitted to accommodate any operator.

Even though I dislike 1911's this gun is built absurdly well, and functions incredible. I can see why they are bought and sold for so much, just from being made this well.

Anyway like I said I am mostly looking to trade, because I don't know if anyone would even want to pay out cash for what these the gun is actually worth. However there is no harm in offering, I suppose."

Gas Piston operation ensures outstanding reliability and cleanliness. The barrel is Stainless Steel, Match Grade and hand lapped, turned to a proprietary contour and then wound in Carbon Fiber, resulting in a lightweight barrel with the accuracy of a target bull barrel. Christensen Carbon Fiber barrels are three times stiffer than steel barrel of equal weight. The Christensen Arms patented carbon layup process produces a barrel shell that has zero thermal expansion coefficient, which brings shot after shot consistency. There is a Titanium bird cage-style flash hider with defense point serrations. This rifle has a Timney trigger system Made in the USA with a pull weight of 3 pounds.

The lower receiver is a precision milled 7075-T6 aluminum forging, and the upper receiver is an eye catching proprietary 7075-T6 aluminum billet design with heavy walls and top mounted Picatinny rail for easy and secure installation of optics. The bolt carrier group's nickel boron coating acts as a protective finish and polishes the receiver each time it cycles. Oversized takedown pins are installed for easy cleaning or receiver changes. A MagPul CTR stock is installed, as is a comfortable Hogue pistol grip. The Handguard is a proprietary Carbon Fiber design with top and bottom mounted rails.

 The 919 is performance motorcycling with its sleeves rolled up--a pared-down, lightweight package ready for any kind of riding you like.

 Features & Benefits 

 Unique features 

 Muscular 919cc open-class engine--inspired by the legendary CBR®900RR--pounds out impressive torque and surprising top-end horsepower. 
 A feathery 428-pound dry weight makes the 919 the lightest bike in its class. 
 The comfortable, upright seating position is ideal for commuting, sport riding and long trips. 
 Honda's latest programmed fuel injection (PGM-FI) and electronic digital ignition maximize power output and offer immediate throttle response. 
 Stylish, dual, center-up exhaust exits below the rear cowl. 
 Massive square-tube mono-backbone frame and a large aluminum swingarm combine to provide an ideal balance of rigidity and flexibility for superb road feel. 
 43mm adjustable cartridge front fork, single-shock rear suspension and lightweight cast aluminum three-spoke wheels contribute to exceptional handling. 
 Engine/Drivetrain 

 Compact 919cc DOHC liquid-cooled inline four-cylinder engine is tuned for low-end and mid-range power for spirited acceleration. 
 One-piece upper crankcase/cylinder assembly, right-side cam-drive design and a narrow 32-degree included valve angle help make the 919 engine the lightest, most compact powerplant in its class. 
 The 16-valve cylinder head with a 10.8:1 compression ratio promotes efficient combustion and high horsepower production. 
 Direct shim-under-bucket valve actuation system is compact, ensures high-rpm durability and allows 16,000-mile valve maintenance intervals. 
 High-pressure PGM-FI delivers fuel at 50 psi to four injectors, each mounted in a 36mm throttle body. Fuel is delivered through four nozzle holes in each injector, producing a highly atomized air/fuel charge for maximum combustion efficiency and power. 
 Advanced PGM-FI features a sophisticated throttle sensor and advanced fuel-injection mapping to produce smooth and linear throttle response, responding precisely to fine throttle adjustments. 
 A 16-bit electronic control unit (ECU) provides two digital 3-D fuel-injection maps for each cylinder and one digital 3-D ignition map for cylinder pairs, creating ideal fuel mixture and spark advance settings for superb rideability. 
 Liquid-cooled oil cooler and a lightweight aluminum radiator keep engine temperatures in check for consistent performance and long engine life. 
 Spring-loaded scissors-type gear on the drive side of the crankshaft and a rubber-mounted, floating clutch cover help reduce noise. 
 Weight-saving features include a compact, lightweight one-piece alternator. 
 Unique four-into-two-into-one-into-two exhaust design features expanding-diameter tubing leading into the two center-up mufflers, contributing to strong mid-range torque and an exhilarating exhaust note. Stainless-steel exhaust header and main pipe are attractive and corrosion-resistant. Polished stainless-steel muffler covers shield passenger's legs from muffler heat. 
 High-capacity 380-watt AC generator. 
 Maintenance-free automatic cam-chain tensioner. 
 Smooth-shifting six-speed transmission with gear ratios carefully matched to the engine's powerband. 
 Durable #530 O-ring-sealed drive chain. 
 Chassis/Suspension 

 Massive square-tube mono-backbone steel frame utilizes the engine as a stressed frame member. Together with the reinforced steering head, the chassis provides an optimal balance of rigidity and tuned flex for superb handling. 
 A single box-section downtube reaches to a unique front engine mount that incorporates a cross member to link the frame to the engine's solid front mounts. 
 Lightweight aluminum swingarm features a large one-piece cast pivot block and extruded triple-box-section spars. 
 43mm cartridge front fork with adjustable preload with compression damping and 4.3 inches of travel offers unparalleled rigidity for precise action and excellent handling on a variety of road surfaces. 
 Lightweight aluminum upper triple-clamp adds rigidity for even better steering control. 
 Single-shock rear suspension features a high-quality damper with seven-position-adjustable spring preload, 5.0 inches of plush wheel travel and a remote fluid reservoir for added suspension control in all riding conditions. 
 Braking system features two huge 296mm front discs with four-piston calipers and a 240mm rear disc with a single-piston caliper for exceptional stopping power. 
 Super-light hollow, aluminum-alloy three-spoke wheels with 3.5 x 17-inch front and 5.5 x 17-inch rear dimensions.

 Aviation-style fuel cap. 
 Engine-mounted manual fuel enricher provides smooth idling speed for cold engine starts. 
 A bank-angle sensor shuts off fuel supply to the PGM-FI system if the motorcycle tips over, but is unaffected by bumps and vibration during normal operation. 
 A large multireflector headlight with a twin-filament H4 low/high beam provides superb road illumination. 
 Maintenance-free battery is lightweight with sufficient starting capacity for all riding seasons. 
 Rugged plastic chip guards on top of the fork sliders protect the front suspension from flying debris.

I put magpul accessories on it and gave it an adjustable JP Enterprise gas block. 

There are a few aesthetic marks and dings on it. The paint I gave it is slowly becoming worn, particulary around the magazine well, charging handle and barrel. The pin on the gas block protuded a bit so I tried to knock it back some, but snapped it. It functions as it should though and is just aesthetic damage. Other than the aforementioned problems it shoots excellent and is my favorite AR in the collection. Bills dictate a sale unfortunately.

My father who was in the AC business recently passed away, but I am not. He had two 30lb bottles of older Sercon R12 freon and twelve 15 ounce bottles of Ig-Lo R22 laying around. I see all kinds of people asking all kinds of money for it but to be honest I'm not going to try to milk anyone.

Give me a reasonable offer and you'll probably get it.
Can split the R12 bottles but I'd rather sell the 12 R22 cans all together.

658,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3477658,For Sale:  WWII era Walther P.38,"North of Dayton, Dayton, Ohio",$ 425,"Listed On: Monday, September 8, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a WWII (Nazi) era Walther P.38.  This is not a post-war P1!  These are chambered in 9mm.  I have had it for over 15 years.  

Pros:  It is fully functional, reliable, and accurate.  Everything works like it should.  It is double action with a right hand safety.  The finish is in great condition, with a nice patina on the grip and trigger guard.

Cons:  Numbers do not match.  The barrel is pitted, but there is still decent rifling.  It shoots very well despite this.  The magazine is not original.  It is stamped ""Mexico"" and one of the feed lips is mangled, but it still feeds 100%.  The lettering that should be on the slide is worn.  I'm thinking it may have been reblued at some point, but it still matches the grip blueing, so maybe not?  The grip covers are 50s-60s era aftermarket.  They're made by Franzite of Chicago.  Although not original, they're actually collector's pieces as well.  The action spring and spring stud are not original.  They were missing when I got the gun.  I replaced them, but the stud is very loose.  It won't fall out with the spring and grips in place, but could fall out if roughly handled during cleaning.  Something to watch for.

Overall, this is a great piece of history!  It is an amazingly modern handgun for the era.  It even has a ""chambered round"" indicator, which is shown in the hammer picture.  If you're looking for a historic shooter, or a good sidearm for reenactment, this is it!

iOriginally designed for the infamous RPG-7 rocket launcher, the PGO-7 is a 2.8x optic with (working)PSO style illuminated reticule for low light shooting. 
The scope is designed for used with RPG7 although more famously used as a point scope on AKM and AK74 in the Soviet - Afghan war, bringing to light modern need for low-power daytime use scopes.
Accepted by any RPG / AK / RPK / PK/ SVD rail system. Would make a nice finnishing touch to an AK rifle or in a scope collection.
Comes with carry pouch, two lens covers (amber, dark), but will need battery
