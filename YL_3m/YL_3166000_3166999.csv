Description

MAG5-60
The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. May be kept fully loaded for extended periods without spring fatigue.

This stuff is near indestructible. I have seen torture test that are unbelievable. People have left guns with this coating in Salt water for 12 months without a single spot of corrosion.

However, having said that, this gun has been cleaned regularly anyway.

Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by Sig Sauer, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. Featuring the Sig internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. SigLite night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. For more information please feel free to contact me at REDACTED.

The AK design is rugged and reliable, and this short, stockless version is a fantastic compact package of devastating 7.62x39 firepower. Keep it in your house, behind the seat of your car or truck, or maybe in a briefcase. It is a pistol, so yes, you could even carry it under your coat in the wintertime (with a Georgia Weapons Carry License, and carry it with a round in the chamber. This pristine piece has only ever had 20 rounds through it. I installed K-Var handguards on it, and a TapCo trigger. I had bunch of other fantastic parts on it like a Krebs safety, a TWS topcover and peep sight, a PWS compensator and a US Palm Grip, but I sold those off separately to bring the price down. Five magazines are included in this deal. It was my intent to eventually do the paperwork and SBR this Draco, but I don't have the time to wait or the money for the stamp right now. I'm getting married next year, so this is no longer a priority, and I have better uses for the money this thing is tying up. I have the ACE side folding skeleton stock that I can include for another $120 if you want to SBR it someday, and I also have just shy of 2000 rounds of Herters 122 gr FMJ ammo as well that I will sell for $480. After all, a firearm without ammo is nothing more than a club or an expensive paperweight. Buy what you want separately, or take everything for $1300 and be all set and ready to hit the range or take on those zombies. I would also consider a trade for a blued (not stainless) Ruger New Vaquero in .45 LC with a 4 5/8"" barrel + cash."

There's nothing wrong with it. I purchased it in 2011 when they were scarce and converted it with the help of my machinist father. The conversion was done to exceed that required by the BATF 922, not just to make it look awesome. Be careful what you buy because not all 'conversions' are equal... some are illegal. This one has an ACE (long) skeleton stock, with a folding mechanism and folding drum adapter so the stock can lock in position with the drum installed. All it needs to dump the mag in that position - from the hip- is a different spring to compensate for the lack of shoulder. From the shoulder it fires whatever will fit with the help of an MD arms gas puck and improved regulator plug. The front site ball was removed and replaced with a threaded in set screw (with the spike point up) when I drilled out the 4 gas ports.. from the factory 2 were partially closed, one was obscured and it wouldn't fire low-brass. No problems now. The fire control group and trigger guard has been relocated and replaced, the pistol grip is CAA with the adjustable fit for your hand. The fore-grip is a SGM tri-rail with a removable folding vertical grip installed. This comes with an MD Arms 20rd drum, pro mag 10 round stick, and the stock 5 round stick mag. Also a single point sling that attaches to the folding stock mechanism. This has been fired and enjoyed... so I know it works. If you want to buy it bring a box of shells and it'll eat them up. I'm not interested in taking less so don't ask. Sale will be cash in hand in person, bring PA identification. NO SHIPPING."

Since then, this lens has been put back in it's original box, wrapped just like it came from the factory. It is in like new/excellent condition. If you wonder about moving up to the ""L"" series of lenses, and if the quality of the picture is worth it - it simply is. I wondered as well, and this was my first ""L"" lens. It was my ""go-to"" lens for wildlife photography, etc. The picture and color quality are superb - as they are with all Canon ""L"" lenses. They are worth the extra investment.

Great opportunity to own and exquisite handgun at a great price!!! HK is top of the line. This gun was a gift to me - I decided I was the P30s.... so that is why I am selling...

Weight: 1.72 lbs

INFO ON THE GUN: The P30L (for Long), has a slide and barrel that measure approximately a half-inch longer in length. Otherwise the P30L is essentially identical to the P30. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstraps inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user.

Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases, magazine release levers, and a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame (for applicable variants). A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator providing a reminder of a loaded chamber that can be subtly seen and felt. 

Extensively tested, the P30L model has been adopted by several international police and security agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30L naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions."

I'm looking to trade for a Shield 9mm (no thumb safety model preferred) or XDS 9mm (4.0 preferred, 3.3 ok, post recall serial or recall verification a must). I'm looking for a dollar for dollar trade deal. We'll assume equal depreciation on a deal with both guns being used and assuming equal condition. The night sights are the only significant expense I believe adds value to a gun. So I'm looking for an even trade on an XDS (MSRP $549) or a Shield (MSRP $449) & something to equalize the deal, both preferred with night sights."

 The Ruger LCR, (Lightweight Compact Revolver) represents one of the most significant new revolver designs in over a century. This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted, specially coated, stainless steel cylinder. Each of these components give the LCR a unique advantage over traditional revolvers.

 The lightweight, chemical-resistant polymer fire control housing contains the entire fire control mechanism, providing a tighter dimensional relationship of the components than if divided between a traditional grip frame and cylinder frame. The end result is that the fire control components are assembled with less hand fitting involved, resulting in a highly consistent, quality product at an affordable price.

VV N320 is one of the finest pistol powders available and is preferred by knowledgeable competition/action pistol shooters.  It is known for its consistency, clean burning and easy metering characteristics.  N320 has a comparatively fast burn rate.  Load data is available for 9mm, 40S&W, 45ACP, 45 Colt and other pistol calibers.  

A little goes a long way.  I get well over 2000 super-light recoiling 9mm competition loads per pound using 147 gr bullets in a fast powder/heavy bullet combo.  See the Brian Enos forum for more information from top shooters.

The Intratec TEC DC-9 ""assault pistol"", also known as DC-9, TEC-9, or, if manufactured after 1994, as AB-10, bears the dubious distinction of being one of the most widely used ""criminal"" guns in USA. It was used in several mass murder cases, as well as in unknown, but definitely large number of street fights and other violent crimes. TEC-9 became ""famous"" for its ""evil"" appearance, large magazine capacity (which offered significant firepower), and for low price. Unsurprisingly, these features made TEC-9 very popular among various marginal types. For any serious or professional shooter this gun vas of little value - it was too big and heavy to be carried comfortably, it was too unreliable when firing anything but FMJ ammunition, and the accuracy with very crude fixed sights was about marginal.

The TEC-9 design was started in Sweden, when the Interdynamic AB company of Stockholm developed a relatively simple submachine gun. Since Sweden was a poor market for such product, a subsidiary company Interdynamic was established in Miami (Florida, USA), to market Interdynamic guns in USA. As the full-automatic weapons market in USA is very restrictive, the basic submachine gun was converted in semi-automatic only variant, apparently suitable for civilian US market. This semi-automatic pistol, like its submachine gun predecessor, was a simple blowback design, firing from the open bolt. It was designated Interdynamic KG-9. But, sooner than later, US Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) found that this semiautomatic pistol can be easily converted back to full automatic, and restricted it manufacture. Interdynamic redesigned the KG-9 into ""closed bolt"" design by adding the separate striker, and designated it KG-99. About the same time (mid-1980s) the Interdynamic of USA turned into Intratec Firearms, Inc, based in the same city of Miami (Florida). Intratec initially  produced the KG-99 under the designation of  TEC-9, but about 1989 renamed it into DC-9. With the introduction of the infamous US Assault Weapons Ban in 1994 the Intratec pistols were prohibited for manufacture (but not for ownership, if made before the ban). Intratec subsequently slightly redesigned the basic design, dropping some ""assault"" features like the threaded barrel, barrel shroud, and forward pistol grip. In this ""post-ban"" version the pistol was manufactured and sold as AB-10 (AB stands for After Ban). The AB-10 pistols were sold with 10-round magazines, but still could accept both factory and aftermarket high capacity magazines from its predecessors, TEC-9 and DC-9. There were several manufacturers in US, who made copies of DC-9, such as AA Arms, which produced DC-9 look-alike AP-9 pistols. Like originals, AP-9 pistols were of cheap construction and marginal reliability.

The Interdynamics and Intratec pistols are blowback operated, semi-automatic weapons. The major difference between Interdynamic KG-9 and Intratec TEC-9/AB-10 line of pistols is that KG-9 fired from the open bolt, and had a fixed firing pin; the Intratec pistols fire from closed bolt, and have a separate firing pin and a massive striker, which interoperates with the sear. The receivers of all versions are made from steel tube (either carbon or stainless), the frames (or ""lower receivers"") are made from polymer, integral with pistol grip and magazine housing ahead of the trigger guard. The tubular receiver is hinged to the front of the frame. There is no manual safety. The open-bolt Interdynamic KG-9 pistols featured a special cut, in which the charging handle can be locked when bolt in retracted. The KG-99 and Interdynamic pistols have manual safety built into charging handle - to lock the bolt, one must push the charging handle inward. All pistols are fed from double stack, detachable box magazines; standard magazine capacity was 20 or 32 rounds for pre-ban guns, and 10 rounds for post-ban guns. After-market magazines were offered in various capacities up to 50 rounds. Permanently fixed open sights were not adjustable, and often misaligned. In the pre-ban TEC-9 and DC-9 versions these pistol accepted screw-on barrel extensions, which had purely cosmetic purposes, or silencers (which were illegal in many jurisdictions)."

Gun has had about 200 rounds through the barrel, so still in nearly new condition, cleaned thoroughly after every range visit. Upgrades include a new Mainspring housing to eliminate the ILS, an Ed Brown competition mainspring, Wilson Combat Bulletproof sear spring, Wilson Combat A2 Bulletproof sear, an STI Titanium Hammer Strut, a Harrison Design and Consulting long black trigger, and a Wilson Combat full length guide rod and also a set of VZ Operator Grips. Also purchased Wilson Combat ETM Mags for it. None of these upgrades are in the photo below as I haven't gotten a chance to take a new photo yet and will get some this evening when I get home. Can throw in ammo for the right price, have plenty of 9mm to add to a deal.

If you believe my asking price is too high for a used Range Officer, feel free to do the math on all of the additions that are included in that price point and you'll find that I have invested a little over $1,150 easily into this gun. Please keep that in mind if making an offer as well. Thanks."

The PK380 is not just good looking. It is small and good looking. That makes the PK380 excellent for concealed carry. Its small grip is ideal for shooters with small hands. The slide is easy to operate, making it a good choice for women. The light weight goes unnoticed in a pocket or purse. Credit Walther Performance Design for another hit. Small is indeed beautiful."

The PK380 is not just good looking. It is small and good looking. That makes the PK380 excellent for concealed carry. Its small grip is ideal for shooters with small hands. The slide is easy to operate, making it a good choice for women. The light weight goes unnoticed in a pocket or purse. Credit Walther Performance Design for another hit. Small is indeed beautiful."

Say you want a pistol for self defense, home defense or lawful concealed carry. There are so many choices out there. You want a pistol that could be a carry gun as well as enjoyable to shoot and chambered in a caliber that can knock down an assailant. Get a Witness in polymer. Compact or full size or even better yet, get a Witness P Carry to give you that added advantage in a carry/defense pistol while keeping the fun of shooting a Witness pistol. Witness Polymer Pistols can be converted to 22LR, 9mm, .40SW, .45ACP & 10mm"

Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber.
