300 AAC BLACKOUT - HANDI-RIFLE


Caliber:300 AAC BLACKOUT
Weight:5 lbs.
Length:16.1” Low Profile Barrel
Mount:5/8-24TPI
The H&R Handi-Rifle, made to AAC specifications and chambered in 300 AAC BLACKOUT, is a 30 caliber rifle in a very compact and lightweight package with such minimal recoil that anyone can comfortably shoot it. This durable, optics ready break action single shot rifle is ideal for the beginner and great fun for the experienced shooter. The barrel is a low profile lightweight 16.1” barrel threaded 5/8-24TPI with a 5R 1:7"" twist. The rifle accurately sends rounds down range whether feeding it heavy subsonic or high performance hunting ammunition. The phosphate steel action and barrel are complimented by the compact, lightweight super tough glass polymer filled black stock. All models are equipped with the H&R transfer bar system that makes the Handi-Rifle one the safest single shot platforms available today."

The world of tactical rifles forever changed in 2004 when Springfield Armory® introduced the M1A™ SOCOM 16. 7.62NATO power in a package this small was previously unthinkable. Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16′s unique design.

""The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory®’s forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect."""

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights.

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

583,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3698583,For Sale:  Remington 870 12-ga Home Defense Customized,"Home of The King, Memphis, Tennessee",$ 450,"Listed On: Sunday, March 8, 2015",Shotguns,Remington                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"NEED a reliable HD shotgun to protect your family?
Very low <100-rnd mileage, pretty much like new-condition 2005-manufacture (before more recent quality issues) 18.5"" CYL barrel Express with no significant scratches or wear marks and shiny bore. This particular barrel patterns within a torso target out to 25 yards with premium FliteControl 00-buck, rivaling Police IC choke barrels; I'd be happy to email you pic to substantiate this claim.  And this pump will reliably cycle even Wal-Mart low-brass birdshot for inexpensive practice or worst-case SHTF pick-up.
OEM +2 mag extension for 6+1 (2-3/4"") round capacity.

BUT, what really sets this 870 apart is her custom ALREADY-INSTALLED extras:
XS Tritium (2014-production) Big Dot front sight - extremely quick, vastly superior sighting under ALL (day/night) lighting conditions vs OEM bead;
Wilson Combat ScatterGun Technologies Hi-Viz green tailed mag follower & Wolff heavy duty spring- helps reliable mag feeding and prevents spring binding in high cap mag tubes;
Vang Comp Big Dome safety - affords convenience of essentially ""auto-off"" deactivation when your index finger slides down off the side of the receiver onto trigger;
OEM synthetic stock has been shortened from 14"" to 12-7/8"" Length of Pull to afford faster shouldering and squarer tactical stance - and a particularly ergonomic benefit for women users;
OEM economy recoil pad REPLACED by top-of-the-line seamlessly-fitted LimbSaver unit to reduce felt recoil and improve follow-up shot acccuracy (I'll include OEM pad to compare);
Hogue OverMolded short Police-style forend - for superior tactile grip under all conditions and (vs OEM longer Sportster unit) allows installation of a side-saddle for extra on-board rounds, and you can dump tubed rounds without cycling the live action.
Lastly if you want a Pistol Grip (only), I'll SWAP in a new Hogue Tamer PG in place of the shortened Rem regular stock.

This same 870 NEW from Budsgunshop.com is going to cost you $350 + transfer + TIC = ~$400 PLUS the $150 in upgrades = $550, so you'll easily save ~$100 ( & probably an additional $50 vs local retail + tax + TIC + upgrades) on a premium quality home protection tool and the upgrades have already been done for you. 
I'm only selling this beauty because she's been a back-up to my primary 870P workhorse and I just replaced her with another Police model.  
No OEM box or paperwork but I'll hand her to you in a fitted gently-used Kolpin zippered soft case (another ~$25 value).

$450 OBO CASH FTF in greater Memphis area.
Must have valid TN DL and be willing to sign duplicate Bill of Sale attesting to legal firearm ownership status (which only you and I will keep copy of).

No Trade please. Please write to my mailbox directly via...(kelvinalonge0@gmail.com) Designed by John Browning, the Model 1911 was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985 and is still carried by some U.S. forces today. The Model 1911's longevity is due to Browning's often-imitated design, which incorporates the short recoil principle.

My daughter won this rifle at a kids competition (good for her!).  She already has a Ruger 10/22 rimfire rifle that she likes, so we're going to sell this to buy or trade for a scope and perhaps some other accessories she can mount on her Ruger 10/22.  New retail for this Ruger American Model 8303 is typically $300.

Here are some key features and specs:
• Patent-pending Power Bedding® integral bedding block system positively locates the receiver and free-floats the barrel for outstanding accuracy.
• Ruger Marksman Adjustable™ trigger offers a crisp release with a pull weight that is user adjustable between 3 and 5 pounds.
• Includes two interchangeable stock modules that provide comb height options for scope or iron sight use. Compact models come with short length of pull modules. By simply removing the rear sling swivel stud, stock modules can be changed in seconds.
• A 3/8"" rimfire scope base is machined into the receiver, which is also drilled and tapped for Weaver® #12 bases (not included).
• A 60˚ bolt provides ample scope clearance, while an easy-to-use, receiver-mounted bolt release allows the bolt to be readily removed without requiring a pull of the trigger, a unique safety feature among rimfire, bolt-action rifles.
• Also Includes: Williams™ fiber optic front sight and 10/22®-style adjustable, ""V"" slot, folding-leaf rear sight; sling swivel studs.

This is a Winchester 100, in 308, it is semi-auto, with a 21 inch barrel.  It shoots great.  It was made in 1970.  It has pop up iron sights and a rail attached to throw your rings and scope on.  It comes with an extra Mag, they are hard to find and it cost me about 50 bucks about 2 years ago.  You will not find a better deer gun.

This gun is pristine and only 100 rounds through it. I haven't had the time to shoot competition anymore so this is the only reason I am selling it...so no trades please! If I was interested in more firearms then I wouldn't be selling this one. I just don't have the time to shoot it. This is the highest capacity 9mm handgun on the market and is the softest shooting 9mm pistol I have ever shot. I sold my glock custom race guns, CZ Shadow, and others after buying this one because nothing shoots nicer. I will even let a potential buyer shoot it prior to purchase. It also comes with 3 backstraps for different hand sizes and everything else it came with new. I have $1100 into it so asking $750.

I got this one in trade about a year ago.  I've put about 200 rounds through it.  I'm not sure how many rounds have been shot but its clean and shoots great.  I have 2 new mags in the original packages and 2 used.  1 of those has only been to the range once so it's basically new. I have a Ruger 10/22 and just want to see what's out there.  I could also have cash to add from my end to make the trade even.  I prefer an email response and if I'm interested I'll send my # to talk or text.  Eotech (512) could be included in the right deal but I'm not interested in selling by itself.  I have other uses for it. $400 trade value rifle + 4 25 rd mags.  Eotech adds about $300.  Thanks for looking
