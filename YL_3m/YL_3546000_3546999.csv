Comes with night sights, one slightly extended magazine, and full kit.  In excellent condition!  Buyer pays for background check.

Often referred to as the ""Pocket Glock"" or ""Baby Glock,"" the Glock 26 debuted in 1995 as the perfect concealed carry pistol. Only about six and half inches long and four inches tall, the Glock 26 is simple and lightweight in a conceal carry holster. Backed by the quality and history of excellence carried by Glock, the Glock 26 remains a popular subcompact semi-automatic pistol nearly 20 years after its debut and is primarily used by civilians interested in concealed carry.

The Glock 26's size only allows for a two-finger pistol grip but its double-stacked magazine still carries ten rounds of 9mm ammunition. Not just a smaller version of its predecessors, the Glock 26 was created through an extensive redesign of the frame, spring assembly and locking block. Featuring no less than three independent safety systems, the Glock line utilizes two internal, automatic safeties as well as an external integrated trigger safety. The internal mechanisms are comprised of both a drop safety and a firing pin safety. Once the trigger is squeezed, the three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other. When the trigger is released, they automatically reactivate."

I'm selling my Tri Star Raptor ATAC Shotgun. It's a 12 Gauge and has been well taken care of. I promptly cleaned it after every shooting session and fully cleaned it prior to first use. I've put around 50-60 rounds through it (2.5"" bird, 2.5"" buck, and 3"" bird). As you can see in the pics there are some fairly light scratches here and there from regular use but nothing out of the ordinary. The gun is $330 + tax new at Academy where it was purchased. 

Here's a link to Academy and a link to the mfg's web site, they have amazing reviews:

As he stated, a flare gun is legal to carry concealed.
You can buy inserts to put in them.

But what he is not telling you is once one of those inserts are put into the flare gun, it makes it a weapon. And in the eye of the ATF it is considered ""Other"" by definition.
This means you must submit a form thru ATF and a fee of $200 to legally carry this as a weapon.

So the $250 flare gun price, and $200 tax stamp, which would have to be paid for EACH insert, is more then what you can just buy a Judge for.

Plus you wouldn't be able to carry it concealed unless you had a permit.

Bottom line people.....don't listen to these dumb asses that circumvent the law to make a buck. Do your research before an idiot like this lands your ass in jail.

Have fun, and be safe!"

The bungee makes carrying a long gun for extended periods much less taxing on the body. I am only selling because I've decided to go back to their 1 point bungee, it is just my preference. It has the quick adjust fastex buckle like a magpul or vickers sling for one handed rapid adjustments and come with standard adapters so it will fit any weapon (even without a sling point, just wrap around the palm swell of the stock) or able to accept the addition of any hardware with in seconds.

The last photo shows the part installed on the Tavor.

 FLEx stands for Fulcrum Located Extra swivel. It provides a centralized location for use with a single point sling or just an additional swivel location for a 2 point. It can be mounted on either side and with the swivel towards the front or rear of the gun. It replaces the plastic factory port cover very easily. But its greatest feature may not be the extra swivel you gain but it also seals off the port from escaping gases that tend to leak out of the factory cover and hit you right in the face. This phenomenon has become known as ""Tavor face"" and leaves you with black smudges on your cheek and shooting glasses. This problem is exacerbated with suppressor use. This is truly a must have if you are running a suppressor."

Excellent condition Saginaw/Inland Non-imported rifle. Meaning the rifle has not been a foreign police weapon or spent time in any other country other then the possibility of the German or Japanese WWII theatre. 

Wood is excellent with only a few tiny knicks. No cracks. Beneath grip still has nickel sized old painted #5 indicating arms room, soldier number, etc. 

Metal is excellent with zero rust or corrosion.  No pitting. Barrel and bore are excellent.  Picture showing close up of bolt area depicts white grease,  not marring or damage. 

Rifle has been babied. Only thing that has been changed out are springs throughout gun and magazines to ensure reliable shooting. Originals are included! And reliable accurate shooting is exactly what this beauty is capable of. Purchased from FFL dealer a few years back. Round count from me is less than 100 with perfect reliability. 

Includes two original 20 round magazines,  original double magazine pouch, gas wrench, and sling. 

Can meet this evening for you to further look over this piece. Looking only for RESPONSIBLE next owners.

Excellent condition Saginaw/Inland Non-imported rifle. Meaning the rifle has not been a foreign police weapon or spent time in any other country other then the possibility of the German or Japanese WWII theatre. 

Wood is excellent with only a few tiny knicks. No cracks. Beneath grip still has nickel sized old painted #5 indicating arms room, soldier number, etc. 

Metal is excellent with zero rust or corrosion. No pitting. Barrel and bore are excellent. Picture showing close up of bolt area depicts white grease, not marring or damage. 

Rifle has been babied. Only thing that has been changed out are springs throughout gun and magazines to ensure reliable shooting. Originals are included! And reliable accurate shooting is exactly what this beauty is capable of. Purchased from FFL dealer a few years back. Round count from me is less than 100 with perfect reliability. 

Includes two original 20 round magazines, original double magazine pouch, gas wrench, and sling. 

Can meet this evening for you to further look over this piece. Looking only for RESPONSIBLE next owners. 

Only trade interest would be a Glock 19 Gen 4 FDE. Never hurts to offer though. Ask any questions. Thank you, Tyler."

What began as a single pistol became a family of models that
would serve a full spectrum of tactical needs. SIS transitioned
to the Kimber 1911 and also agreed these pistols could be
offered to the public. SIS pistols have stainless steel slides, frames
and serrated mainspring housings. Unique features include a
flat top slide and the SIS Night Sight™ with a flat shoulder
that allows one-hand cycling. The lightweight SIS Hammer™
reduces lock time, and the SIS-pattern slide serrations and
gray KimPro II finish gives these pistols a striking appearance.

The M9A1 is an evolution of the legendary Beretta M9 military semiauto pistol, developed with the advice of several law-enforcement and military agencies around the world. The M9A1 Compact With Rail Inox is a smaller and lighter variation that features an attractive and super-resistant stainless-steel (Inox) finish. Its many tactical features, ruggedness and absolute reliability make it a great choice for on- or off-duty carry, as well as personal defense or concealed carry. 
Compact and Super-Resistant 
Compared to its full-size counterpart, the M9A1 Compact Inox is a full ¾” shorter and 2.3 oz. lighter, making it even more comfortable for all-day carry. Also, its shorter trigger-reach will make it simple to shoot even by users with smaller hands--and even for that first double-action pull. While in the holster, its super-resistant stainless-steel finish makes it stand up to sweat even on scorching summer days, while also making it more impervious to corrosion between shooting and cleaning. Includes 2 13 round magazines and one 15 round magazine. Very hard to find. Beautiful gun."

This is a well kept Glock that I have had since my college days back in the early 90’s. I am the sole owner as I purchased this new directly from a dealer. It has about 2,500 rounds though it. It is very clean and works flawlessly. 

I am not interested in trades of any kind. I cannot sell to anyone who resides in a state that restricts this firearm in any way. I will either ship to active FFL via UPS and the buyer pays for shipping or I will meet someone at a gun shop/FFL holder for the transfer. I will not sell to anyone with just an ID. It is the buyer’s responsibility for any additional transfer/registration fees as well as knowing the laws in there own residence state.
