Browning 024115103 BL-22 Micro Midas .22LR Rifle

Get your young shooter off on the right track with a high-quality Browning BL-22 Micro Midas. Featuring trimmer dimensions, a shorter barrel for reduced weight and a 12″ length of pull that is perfect for smaller frames, the BL-22 Micro Midas is in a class by itself. Sure, there are other lever-action 22 rimfire rifles available, but no other has the features, reliability, quality and accuracy of the BL-22. Speaking of features, the highlight of the BL-22 is the short 33° lever throw that makes cycling faster for adults and easier for younger shooters. The easy to load tubular magazine holds any combination of 22 short, long and long rifle ammunition, all of which are on the menu for the BL-22. Unlike some 22′s the BL-22 features quality that rivals other Browning firearms. From the machined steel receiver to the fit of the finely finished wood, these superb rifles are Browning’s through and through. Bring one along the next time you head into the field on a varmint hunt or just to roll a few tin cans.

Everything has been purchased within the last 6 weeks.

As is normally the case with most projects I undertake, the thrill was in finding the parts and building the gun, once it is all done, I tend to get bored with it and want to move on to the next project, which will be a left hand Savage Mark II once this gun sells.

The Intermediate Pistol Course is all about getting comfortable with your firearm.  This course will drive the core marksmanship fundamentals required to master the manipulation of your firearm.  This course will take you out of the comfortable static shooting most people do at the local range.  Emphasis is taken on instilling safety and proficiency with your firearm.
This course will prepare you to properly, safely and effectively unholster your firearm and present it to a threat if such need should arise.  The dynamics of shooting at closer distances will be explained and the hands-on drills will drive home the importance of the core fundamentals.
This course is 25% classroom and 75% hands-on and will have you firing your handgun for approximately 6 hours.  Manipulating your firearm under new pressures and timed constraints will prepare you for the unexpected.  This course will not only teach you the skills, but will also give you the confidence you need to feel comfortable handling your firearm in worst case scenarios.  This course is 1 day of hands-on lecture and hands-on drills."

I bought a bad batch of 300BLK. Martin called and was super apologetic. Said he wanted to make it right. I shipped the ammo back to him to fix. They refuse to respond to my emails and phone calls. Now I'm out the ammo and my money. My bad for being so trusting. I had been contemplating suing but the fee to file was almost what I have lost in the transaction. If there are more of you out there that want to join me in a small claims lawsuit and split the fee, send me an email.

I'm not usually this type of person, but here in northern nevada we're a pretty tight shooing community. I can deal with the bad ammo (everyone makes mistakes even Hornady) but the complete lack of willingness to take care of it is baffling to me.

***PLEASE NOTE: The folding sights pictured ARE NOT INCLUDED with this shotgun.****

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

The wood finish and bluing of the barrel are all in good condition but I believe the firing pin or pin components needs replaced as the pin is no longer striking the primer with enough force. Also, the hammer will no longer stay cocked back when placed in the firing position.

Overall the shotgun is in good condition with the exception of the firing pin situation. It is a 410 gauge and unfortunately I have no use for this shotgun.

p.s. I'm getting a lot of messages asking for more details. A Colt python was listed at a very low price. I answered the ad which was flagged and removed after a few hours.
I continued to correspond with the ""seller"". They would not give me a phone number to call them. Their messages were written in bad or broken English ...totally different than the ad for the gun was written. I asked them to take the gun to a gun shop in their area and I would send the money to the dealer and they could pick it up there. Needless to say I was dropped like a hot potato.
They had several listings for other guns at normal prices, only the python was listed low. Also the person was a member since the day of posting only.

It covers safety, hands on classroom training, live fire training at the range, personal gun selection, cleaning/caring for a firearm and the laws/rules/procedures for the FL Concealed Weapons Permit. I also have a section of the class dedicated to personal defense with a firearm.  It is not necessary to own a firearm to attend the class as I have demo models.  If you own a firearm I recommend you bring it to class so you can train with it.  We typically spend 3 to 3 1/2 hours in the classroom and about an hour on the range. Once you complete the class you will receive a certificate that satisfies the requirements for the FL CWP.  You then fill out an application, have your fingerprints and picture taken and submit the application.  The cost of the actual permit is $70 and the fingerprint / back round check is $42.  The permit is good for 7 years.  I hold the public classes in the conference rooms at Homewood Suites by Pensacola Airport (or your location for a private class of 4 or more students).

It covers safety, hands on classroom training, live fire training at the range, personal gun selection, cleaning/caring for a firearm and the laws/rules/procedures for the FL Concealed Weapons Permit. I also have a section of the class dedicated to personal defense with a firearm.  It is not necessary to own a firearm to attend the class as I have demo models.  If you own a firearm I recommend you bring it to class so you can train with it.  We typically spend 3 to 3 1/2 hours in the classroom and about an hour on the range. Once you complete the class you will receive a certificate that satisfies the requirements for the FL CWP.  You then fill out an application, have your fingerprints and picture taken and submit the application.  The cost of the actual permit is $70 and the fingerprint / back round check is $42.  The permit is good for 7 years.  I hold the public classes in the conference rooms at Homewood Suites by Pensacola Airport (or your location for a private class of 4 or more students).  The class is $75 per student and may be paid in cash, money order or local check.

 Mark 23 The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more. One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole! The Mark 23 is available in .45 ACP Features: • Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profile •Match grade trigger •One piece machined steel slide •Frame mounted decocking lever and separate ambidextrous safety lever •Can be carried “cocked and locked” in single action mode with the safety lever on •Patented HK recoil reduction system •Corrosion resistant blued finish •Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame •Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves •Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories •Ambidextrous magazine release lever •Extended slide release •Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator •Patented Lock-Out Safety device Dimensions .45 AUTO Overall length 9.65 in.

I would like to trade my Beretta 90-Two for firearms below. It looks LNIB. It was fired approx. 100-150 Rds tops. These Berettas selling right now up to $800-850 area in this condition. Very collectible. Many people mistaking these with polymer frame guns. Frame of the pistol is metal with wrap around polymer grip. Also you can always buy 9mm barrel from regular Beretta 92 FS and shoot 9mm ammo without even buying 9mm magazines. Under plastic cover there is a picatinny rail for your acces. They were all made in Italy. Most beautyful Beretta ever made ( in my opinion) I never seen one on Armslist.
Comes with a box ,Manuals and papers just like from factory.

The Colt LE901-16S is a “Modular Carbine,” which means it can be adapted to any AR-15 platform upper. This isn’t a new concept, because there are of course a whole bunch of different caliber uppers for ARs.

748,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3095748,For Sale/Trade:  Beautiful 21' Four Winns Liberator with 460 big block,"Bloomington, Indiana, United States","$ 9,800","Listed On: Sunday, June 8, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"had a deal fall through so the boat is still available.
 This is a turn key water ready boat with no issues.   
I have for sale a unique boat that is in excellent shape and has been updated with tons of extras,
to start with it is an 1988 Four Winns Liberator 211 it has a very healthy big block 460 Ford engine with Cobra outdrive.  The motor runs great has a choppy idle and a ton of power (low 60s on gps) the entire boat was checked out at the beginning of May and received a clean bill of health from an actual Marine mechanic, the only issue was 1 of the 2 batteries was not keeping a charge ( I have since replaced both batteries with new deep cell marine batteries)  the batteries both run through a switch which allows you to choose between battery 1 or 2 or both so that you wont have a dead battery after listening to the stereo for hours and can charge both when boat is running.  I replaced the head unit with a Jensen marine unit that has both aux/usp jacks as well as CD and radio functions, the radio is played through new kenwood Marine speakers and sounds great ( it is wired for a sub and has an amp but I have not messed with that just mids and highs).  Both seats up front have been redone with the last 2 years as was the sun deck that covers the engine, it has a canopy that I never messed with.  The boat is a cuddy cabin that is an open style cuddy no bathroom or sink, everything is in good shape and it can fit several people comfortably.  I received maintenance records for the last 13 years from the previous owner and it was always stored inside. The boat is in fantastic shape and you will not see many of these running around the lake, and not one this nice.  The whole exhaust was redone last year and a baffle was placed in the exhaust to quiet it down a bit.  I have left over tubing to put in place of the baffle if you want it louder.
  The trailer is near new and was completely restored 2 years ago and updated with new everything, winch, jack, toolbox, and all wiring.  Updated with all LEDs and was sandblasted and repainted with original graphics, brakes were all redone and updated surge brakes along with trailer brakes were all redone. It is an easy load trailer.
        I have titles to both the boat and trailer, I also have a list of extras that come with the package price including; 2 newer tubes, ropes, anchors, a 2nd Stainless Steel Turbo prop, a very nice Garmin marine unit with satellite gps and depth finder, life jackets, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some things.  Feel free to call/text with questions REDACTED my name is Steve I'm asking $9,800 (its insured for 12,500 and books out higher without the list of extras)  or best offer I'd also be open to trades plus cash( high end firearms only I'm not looking for a bunch of handguns or AKs plus cash) , I have a short video of the boat running and it has been on the water once this year with no issues.

Beautiful Colt Combat Commander 9mm. All original except sights were replaced with adjustable Williams fire sights.

The box is a 150th anniversary 1836-1986 so I would I would imagine this gun was produced in 1986 or somewhere very close to that. *************** Please ensure this is legal for you to own and to be shipped into your area before buying. *************** $40 shipping from my FFL to yours. want to receive emails saying ill take it,lol..."
