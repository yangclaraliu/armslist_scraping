King County, Washington, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Friday, November 21, 2014",Handguns,Taurus                                                                                ,357 Magnum                                                                                ,no type,Revolver,"To start off I want to say thanks to all my fellow Armslisters. I have had a lot of fun and met some great people buying, selling, trading & building here on Armslist over the last few years.
So before this 594 B.S. goes into effect I just thought I'd put a couple handguns up for trade to see if I can get one last trade in before we have to rectify this recent legislation mishap to enjoy this site again.
    For trade I have a Taurus 605 .357 revolver and an older Glock 20 10mm. The Taurus has a 
2-1/4"" barrel, 5 shot cylinder & blued finish. I am not the original owner so the round count is unknown but I have only put 100rds (.38x50 g .357x50) through it myself and judging by the guns condition I don't think the actual round count is high enough to be of much concern. Finish is still in good shape and no function issues, it's a pretty decent little snubby actually.
   If you'd prefer the G20 I am taking trade offers for it as well. It's a later 2nd Gen Glock (1st Gen for the model 20) so it DOES HAVE the 3 pin frame, not the 2 pin frame of earlier productions that had cracking issues in the 10mm. I has seen a lot of use and has had some frame modification done by the previous owner as well. So it is a truck gun for sure but the funnest truck gun I've ever owned hands down. This gun is the reason I fell in love W/the 10mm cartridge.  The gun has Tru Glo night sights on it and comes with two 15rnd factory mags, one of them with an Aredondo +5 extention on it, and for fun a 3rd 15rd factory mag with a Kriss mag extention made for the G21 fitted on it that holds 30rds. Like I said, the frame was modified though. The grip has been reduced, the rear grip channel is filled in, the frame has been refinished in a green color similar to OD green, some texturing of the frame was done and it has one of those gripforce beavertail thingys on it. Like I said, a truck gin for sure. But I actually do like how it fits the hand. To me it actually is an improvement compared to the factory grip on my other full-sized Glock frame."

Belgium Browning Hi-Power in excellent condition.  Cerekote Flat Dark Earth.  All matching numbers.  Good luck finding a Belgium made Hi-Power for cheaper than this one is posted for.  I hate to get rid of it but need the cash.  The pistol has been reworked inside and out by a gunsmith.  

do your research, it is easily a $1k - $1.2k pistol.  The price is lower because everyone willing to pay its true value want either nickel or blued.  The good news is that the cerekote will last while blueing will not.  If nickel or blueing is really your taste, then you could probably buy this pistol and it redone for less than its $1000 - $1200 value.

386,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3731386,For Sale:  SilencerCo Salvo 12,"Fayetteville, Fayetteville, Arkansas","$ 1,400","Listed On: Sunday, November 13, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The SilencerCo Salvo 12 is the first and only commercially-viable shotgun suppressor on earth. It represents an incredible advance in engineering and technology, and carries with it the same quality and service as SilencerCo’s other products.

Every year, millions of sportsmen and women venture into the fields to hunt. While rifle and handgun suppressors continue to increase in popularity, shotgun owners have been without a real solution for ear protection. Some choose hearing preservation in the form of earmuffs or plugs for relief in controlled environments, but spurn their use in the field or in a home protection scenario, where the ability to detect other sounds is critical.

The Salvo 12 is modular in nature — the shooter can add or remove sections to balance their sound suppression, weight and length needs. At its full length of 12 inches, it brings sound down to 137 dB at the muzzle — well below the 140 dB hearing-safe level set by OSHA.

Whether you grab a shotgun for hunting, shooting clays or home defense, the Salvo 12 fits most common shotguns — provided you have a choked barrel. The suppressor attaches to the the existing choke threads via an adapter. Due to differences in shotgun manufacturer and choke preference, it is important that you select the correct adapter.

The Salvo 12 is just one more example of the type of innovation that has garnered a fiercely loyal customer base for SilencerCo.

HEAVY 32 H&R MAG. +P  Ammo - 130 gr. Hard Cast Keith (1125fps) - 20 Round Box

This 32 H&R +P load is designed for those who need a very deep penetrating hard cast heavy load. This load should penetrate about three feet into flesh and bone. While we have not tried it, based on our knowledge of other like-designed revolver loads in 357, and 44, this bullet should easily penetrate a large bear’s skull. The bullet is 21-22 BHN and is properly lubed and will not substantially lead foul barrels.

We are using a flash retarded powder so that the shooter will not be blinded by his/her own gunfire in low light situations.

See our below velocities fired from real world, over-the-counter revolvers. We do not use long laboratory barrels to establish our published velocities as this will produce unrealistically fast velocities and will not tell the customer what his/her gun is producing in the real world where it matters.

1164 fps - USFA Sparrow Hawk 7.5 inch
1139 fps - Ruger Black Hawk 5.5 inch
1133 fps - Ruger SP101 3 inch
You’ll note the absence of the Taurus Titanium 2 inch revolver we referenced in the press release of our 100gr. JHP 32 H&R +P load. (ITEM 36A) We elected to remove the Taurus data from this press release as not only did we have to polish the tool marks out of the Taurus chambers to get smooth extraction as we mentioned in the item 36A press release, but our particular Taurus would “key hole” cast bullets. We did not experience this with any other test guns, including many that are not referenced here. Only the Taurus would not shoot hard cast bullets well and only the Taurus gave sticky extraction of fired cases, unless we polished the chambers. We experienced no issues of ANY sort with ANY of our other test guns.

This very popular Chinese made Norinco SKS can pack ten 7.62x39 rounds (loaded by stripper clip or by hand), that will give you enough power with a large enough round to rip through just about anything your shooting at.

You can't go wrong with a Norinco, well made guns for a very reasonable price.

Less than 300 rounds through barrel. I have a 7.5 pistol upper for trade for a 10.5 upper. I would like a straight trade for the upper. So that means no sights, no red dot, no bolt, no flash can, charging handle and even the rail covers. I keep my attachments, you keep yours. I just want the same set up as mine but just with a longer barrel and rail so basically upper with 10.5 barrel and free float quad rail.  This may be a long shot but maybe you bought a 10.5 and wanted the 7.5, here is your chance to trade.

I have this high end AR-15 to offer as partial trade. It is built on BMG Raptor matched upper and lower. 

Barrel is a 1/9, which will better stabilize the common 55 grain ammo, as well as down to 40 grains and up to 70 or so. It also has the Vortex flash hider, much better than the birdcage type. It has a 2nd gen Magpul flip rear sight and a Yankee Hill HK style front sight that is a flip down integrated with on the gas block with bayonet lug and sling swivel. Forward grip is a high end aluminum flip up or down with interior compartment. 

The real advantage in this gun is the upper and lower. They are built by Bend Manufacturing Group and are incredible receivers. These are matched upper and lower and provide zero play in the mate up. They make for a much more precision platform. Additionally it integrates an enhanced trigger guard, cages all the controls to reduce the chance of accidental mag drop or bolt catch/drop. It has a flared magwell built in. Also they changed the geometry of the brass deflector to pop the brass forward and up, which makes for a nice consistent brass pitch. They are billet receivers instead of cast, and the tolerances of all the milling and hole placement/tolerance is spot on. 

Basically this is built similar to the set up on the 6920 except with a flip down front sight, and using super high end upper and lower receivers with the more versatile 1/9 twist barrel and superior flash hider. This makes for a great CQT weapon, but with the quality of the parts it is built with you could mount a scope on it and have a tack driver out to 600-700 yards with a 16 inch barrel."

The caliber stamp on the barrel says ""280 Rem. or 7MM Express Rem."", built during the caliber name designation changeover. I have never seen another one in this caliber and barrel profile combination, and it is a tack driver. It is polished blue / wood stock, not cosmetically perfect, but vey nice for it's age, and it is mechanically perfect. I have owned it since the late 1980's. It is equipped with a super nice Leupold 12 power 40 mm target scope with fine target crosshairs, and adjustable objective lens. There are none of these packages around, but I don't use it, and it is a shame for this classic to stay in the dark in the safe.

The msrp on this gun is $300 they can sell between 250-225 the reason I have it listed at $250 is the stock and forend cost $79 and it cost me $45 dollars to get the stock and forend put on by my gunsmith.
