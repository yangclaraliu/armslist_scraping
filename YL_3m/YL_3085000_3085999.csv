I don't want a carbine.  I want a full length 20"" M16A4 clone with a fixed stock.  This PSA carbine is a sweet rifle that has only had a total of 10 rounds fired through it.  It is built on a PSA PA-15 MULTI lower, PSA upper.  The free floated black tube is drilled to allow better heat ventilation.  The gas block is railed to hold the flip up BUI's.  It has the 3 position collapsible butt stock and a Magpul MOE pistol grip.  I will include my TAC Vortec red/green dot sight.  Here is the catch:  The carbine currently has a rifle length buffer spring in it.  I bought the wrong one by accident.  As a result, the bolt catch currently will not lock back.  The spring is simply too long.  They are dirt cheap however and the weapon fires and cycles without issue.

The KLR is a known work mule; it is the preferred mode of transport by the US Marine Corps and numerous police forces around the world. Over the course of its 25+ ongoing years of production, Kawasaki has not made any major changes to the proven design, keeping the KLRs easily fixable, parts low cost and readily available. The foreseen challenges of a transcontinental trip meant the original bike needed to be improved. Hundreds of hours of research and design considerations were put into the bike to fit the stringent requirements for sturdiness, comfort, reliability and safety"

It is in like new condition.  Shot less then 30 rounds thru it.   I used this as my carry gun.. but carried it rarely.  I usually kept it in a padded holster in my car.  I found the slim frame with the bravo company concealment holster extremely comfortable when I did carry it.  What I really liked about the 10mm is the variety and power of the 10mm round.  Included is hollow points that exceed 1200fps.  And expensive buffalo bore 220 grain ammo strong enough to drop a buffalo.   I do not recommend shooting the lead 220 grain ammo without a lone wolf extended and ported barrel.   Cost is around $125 but worth it if you do any hunting.

There are a few great advantages to this the bullets used will have a higher BC( ballistic coefficient ). Which means the bullet flies farther, straighter, truer, greater velocity, high energy, and less recoil. It is ballistically far superior to the .308.

Sights - Tangent-leaf sight graduated to 2000m 
Total Production : 135,770 
Bayonet: Models 1889,1899 & 1906 

As early as 1903 there discussion about the adoption of a lighter, easier to handle rifle, with increased velocity cartridges. It had been determined that there were severe ballistic shortcomings to the 89/96 action /GP90 cartridge combination. In late 1907, the Swiss Rifle Commission gave permission to Waffenfabrik Bern to create 200 rifles for testing purposes. The rifle were built with the following configurations:

fifty rifles with 1889/96 Barrels firing GP90 cartridges, 
fifty rifles with 1889/96 Barrels firing GP90 cartridges, and re-milled cartridge chamber, fifty rifles with 1889/96 Barrels and new cartridges and re-milled cartridge chamber, 
fifty rifles with new barrels and new cartridges

Other modifications included the removal of the magazine cut-off, improved sights, and an integral rifle rest. While the integral rifle rest was discarded as superfluous, the testing otherwise proved successful.. This led to the authorization of the creation of 900 Rifles and 100 Carbines, for the purposed of testing the new GP08 (later redesignated GP11) cartridge. The 1908 Rifles and Carbines were fitted with Model 1889/1900 style 6 round magazines, and improved sights. The 1908s also had several unique features, not found in other Schmidt-Rubin models. The locking lug sleeve of the 1908’s bolt had three circular holes, presumably for weight savings purposes. In addition, the relief cuts on the top of 1908s receiver were of different length, with the longer cut set along the center of the receiver, with the shorter cut off to the side. On all other Schmidt-Rubins, the relief cuts were of equal length, and both cuts were equally offset from the centerline of the receiver.

By around 1907, the Swiss knew the old GP90 cartridge was inferior to those being adopted by their neighbors. So they started testing a new round. They built the 1908 series for this purpose. The 1908 has some unique feature, not seen in other Schmidt-Rubins, including three holes in the bolt. Testing showed the VGP08 cartridge produced significantly better results than the GP90 cartridge. Consequently, the VGP08 cartridge was adopted as the GP11 cartridge.

It was determined that the 89/96 could easily be converted (Model 1889s could not) to handle the new cartridge by re-barreling the rifle.

1889/96s were converted to 1896.11s buy replacing or modifying the following:

A new barrel was added. 
Already fitted the the barrel were new front and rear sights.
A pistol grip was grafted onto the stock of the rifle.
The new rifles were also fitted with 6rd magazines, similar to the 1889/1900 pattern magazine, minus the reinforcing ridge, although the magazine did include a bolt hold-open feature for when the magazine was empty.
A new trigger-guard was fitted to accommodate the new magazine. 

However, it took several years for all the 89/96s to be converted to 96/11 and 1911 Rifle production continued until 1918. Rather than leave large numbers of troops unarmed while the rifles were shipped off for conversion, they were re-issued Model 1889s. (Troops with Model 89/00 Short Rifles and 05 Carbines were re-issued 1893 Carbines).

Swiss soldiers are roughly classified into two categories, elite and reserve. Elites are under the age of 30, reserves are over the age of 30. Any trooper reaching reserve status, whom had a 89/96 during the changeover period was issued a Model 1889, and kept it for the remaining term of his service. Raw recruits, were issued Model 1889s as well at this point in time, and were later issued 96/11s or 1911s.

The various Canton Arsenals were given different priorities regarding when they were re-equipped. However, I'm not sure what those priorities were."

Bought it just over a year ago with the intention of my wife carrying it but, unfortunately for me, she has fallen in love with my XD.  Still a great firearm and I've carried it myself.  I've put about 150 rounds through it and I've been pleasantly surprised with it's accuracy.  Great pocket pistol or purse carry gun.  Included are two  (6 round) magazines, one which I've added an extension to that allows for better control for larger hands (I have the original magazine cap too), a plano hard case,  a pocket holster, ankle holster, owb holster, 100 rounds of herters FMJ target rounds, and 40 rounds of defensive ammo.  I'm not hurting for money or desperate to sell, so please no unreasonable, low-ball offers.  NV residents only and cash only.  Email with your phone number and if you prefer call or text and I will get back to you at my earliest convenience.  I work varying shifts so please specify best time to return your call.  If you have additional questions, feel free to ask.  There is quite a bit of good information on the firearm on sites like youtube, or see the  review from guns.com:  http://www.guns.com/reviews/taurus-738-tcp/ and you won't be displeased with this well-cared for American-Made firearm."

Do you want to shoot in a more dynamic setting?

The Intermediate Pistol Course is all about getting comfortable with your firearm. This course will drive the core marksmanship fundamentals required to master the manipulation of your firearm. This course will take you out of the comfortable static shooting most people do at the local range. Emphasis is taken on instilling safety and proficiency with your firearm.
This course will prepare you to properly, safely and effectively unholster your firearm and present it to a threat if such need should arise. The dynamics of shooting at closer distances will be explained and the hands-on drills will drive home the importance of the core fundamentals.
This course is 25% classroom and 75% hands-on and will have you firing your handgun for approximately 6 hours. Manipulating your firearm under new pressures and timed constraints will prepare you for the unexpected. This course will not only teach you the skills, but will also give you the confidence you need to feel comfortable handling your firearm in worst case scenarios. This course is 1 day of hands-on lecture and hands-on drills.

Original owner was elderly (my grand father) and did not know it was a valuable gun I will provide the history I know about it with the rifle. Box has been authenticated by numerous collectors is in nice shape showing age dated 55, tape is old that is on it, it has a price hand written on the outside which looks like it could be removed if wanted, paperwork is also nice. We have seen plenty of reproduction boxes, they are fairly easy to identify and rarely have the correct base markings and show the correct aging, if this one is not correct its fooled a lot of guys, this rifle has been displayed at two collector shows and not one person has claimed an issue. If you have been looking for a collector grade Model 62 they just do not get much nicer than this.  I usually answer emails in the mornings and evenings. The shipping amount is posted on this listing and will be in addition to the amount you bid or the buy now price.

This listing is for a Winchester Model 62A pump action 22lr rifle. Serial Number 372645 manufactured approx 1957. FEATURES: 23"" round Barrel, and exposed hammer. CONDITION: Excellent this is one of the nicest we have seen. Minor wear on the slide areas, a couple of marks in the stock all of which are shown in the photos. 
Original owner was elderly (my grand father) and did not know it was a valuable gun I will provide the history I know about it with the rifle. Box has been authenticated by numerous collectors is in nice shape showing age dated 55, tape is old that is on it, it has a price hand written on the outside which looks like it could be removed if wanted, paperwork is also nice. We have seen plenty of reproduction boxes, they are fairly easy to identify and rarely have the correct base markings and show the correct aging, if this one is not correct its fooled a lot of guys, this rifle has been displayed at two collector shows and not one person has claimed an issue. If you have been looking for a collector grade Model 62 they just do not get much nicer than this.  I usually answer emails in the mornings and evenings.
