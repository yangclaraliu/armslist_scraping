This rifle has been test fired 30 rounds, and bit brass twice.  The gun needs about 1000 or 2000 rounds run through it for the spring to really break in enough for it to cycle quickly enough to keep up with the bump stock rate of fire.  

MSRP on the Slide Fire stock is $400.

For $90 extra, I can upgrade the FCG with a new Tapco G2 Triggger, Tapco AK Retaining Plate, and polish the feed ramp and float the bolt rails for optimum.  This gun really needs the trigger upgrade to shine, in my opinion, but will run great as is, also.

Drift-adjustable, white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned in polymer front sight. 6+1 capacity 400 series stainless steel magazine with flush baseplate.
Kahr's attention to detail, use of the finest materials and employment of the most precise manufacturing methods results in semiautomatic pistols of exceptional quality and reliability. The barrels are machined from solid, round billets of high-tensile-strength proprietary steel, then drilled and rifled to match-grade tolerances. Slides are precisely machined from 416 stainless steel bar stock, then heat-treated and tempered to optimize durability. Kahr's cocking-cam trigger system employs a cam to unlock the passive safety and finish cocking and releasing the firing pin. The system provides an unbelievably smooth double-action-only trigger stroke. A patented offset barrel places the trigger mechanism beside the barrel lug, raising the shooter's hand close to the centerline of the bore. This, combined with the ergonomically designed grips, results in a remarkable degree of shooting comfort and control with reduced muzzle flip and felt recoil. Every Kahr pistol is made in accordance with the strictest international manufacturing standards and is individually tested before it is sold.

Rugged black polymer frame is checkered and stippled for nonslip grip. Stainless steel slide. Drift-adjustable, low-profile white bar-dot combat sights. 7+1 capacity.
Kahr's attention to detail, use of the finest materials and employment of the most precise manufacturing methods results in semiautomatic pistols of exceptional quality and reliability. The barrels are machined from solid, round billets of high-tensile-strength proprietary steel, then drilled and rifled to match-grade tolerances. Slides are precisely machined from 416 stainless steel bar stock, then heat-treated and tempered to optimize durability. Kahr's cocking-cam trigger system employs a cam to unlock the passive safety and finish cocking and releasing the firing pin. The system provides an unbelievably smooth double-action-only trigger stroke. A patented offset barrel places the trigger mechanism beside the barrel lug, raising the shooter's hand close to the centerline of the bore. This, combined with the ergonomically designed grips, results in a remarkable degree of shooting comfort and control with reduced muzzle flip and felt recoil. Every Kahr pistol is made in accordance with the strictest international manufacturing standards and is individually tested before it is sold.

The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use. The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes.

In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 or 4.0 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it, and pretty soon you’ll forget it’s even there.
The XD-S® Single Stack consistently astonishes and delights shooters on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The trigger on the XD-S® Single Stack feels more like it belongs on a target pistol than a carry piece. Shooters who are used to difficult, heavy triggers on deep concealment pistols will be astounded at the smooth, crisp XD-S® Single Stack trigger.

You will also feel a reduction in recoil...a $50 option!) I shot about 200 rounds through this gun since I purchased it new in June of 2013. I had it polished in July 2013. 
This gun is well constructed, and feels really good in the hands. I added grip tape over the original (ugly) factory plastic grips. These guns are underrated. Mine has always chambered and cycled with a variety of factory ammo. Excellent home defense gun. Ammo is readily available on the net. Similar in ballistics to a .357 magnum. Heavy construction minimizes recoil.

best offer or trade.

Ladies and gents, due to some medical bills that will be coming in the next few months (due to my wife expecting a baby and having her diabetic meds changed), I’m liquidating about half of my collection. I don’t wanna do it, but I need the cash more.
All the items below are for SALE. My only trade considerations will be gold or silver in coin (spot price) or bullion (95% spot price).  Any other trade offers will be subject to public ridicule. J
All prices are assuming I have to drive approximately 1 hour to meet. The closer we meet, the lower my prices. If I drive beyond an hour, I’ll do a google map of the route to where we meet, give you the total mileage for the round trip, and add $.50 per mile to the price of the gun, rounded down to the nearest $5. No shipping.
1)      Ruger 10/22 (22 LR) Carbine- Wood stock and blued barrel. I purchased this firearm new in 2013, and have put approximately 1000 rounds through it. Comes with factory box, lock, 10 rd mag, a BX25 mag, and 525 rds of Federal bulk HP ammo. $300
2)      CZ-82 (9x18)- Stock pistol with 2 factory mags. I love shooting and carrying this gun, but as I said, some things have to go. Includes a High Noon Split Decision holster, 100 rds of 9x18 FMJ rounds and 25 Hornady Critical Defense rounds. $400
3)      Bulgarian Makarov (9x18)- bought in non-working condition, replaced a trigger bar, and it works perfectly. Finish is in great shape, and internals look good. Comes with 4 factory mags, Barsony Leather pancake holster and double mag pouch, a set of Makawrap grips, 100 rds of FMJ ammo, and 25 rds of Hornday Custom defense ammo. $500  
4)      Beretta 85F (380 ACP)- satin nickel finish and wood grips from the factory. Great little shooter, and even prettier to look at. Gun comes with 1 beat up mag that works about 3/4 of the time, and 3 factory mags that are 100% flawless, as well as the factory box. I have a small bag of factory ammo, approx. 20 rds. $600
5)      Hi Point 995 (9mm)- old style carbine with a camo painted stock. This is my bedside long gun, and it has been a blast. The paint job actually looks really good, and I don’t even like camo. Includes 2 mags, and an ATI stock that is fully functional, but is missing a cover plate and some screws. I used it without both and the gun shoots like a dream. Comes with 100rds of WWB ammo and 50 rds of 147 gr HP ammo. $325
6)      CZ P07 Duty (9mm)- this gun is fairly new to me, but spat out 200 rounds during a range day like it was going out of style. I had two malfunctions with CZ 75B mags (a ProMag and a 10 round mag), but absolutely no failures with Factory CZ P07 mags, 16 rd factory CZ 75 B mags, or 16 rounds Mec Gar CZ 75B mags. The gun has been stippled, and had the feed ramp polished. Comes with 2 mags, factory box, and 100rds of WWB ammo. $400
7)      Ruger Security Six (357 Mag)- I love this gun, but I gotta do what I gotta do. Stainless Steel gun with a 6 inch barrel, this is about as classy a revolver you can get that isn’t a Smith and Wesson, and nothing is stronger. This has been my nightstand gun, and I have no complaints about it. Lockup and timing are excellent. Gun comes with factory manga grips, factory target grips, and 50 rds of ammo. $550
8)      Beretta 950BS Minx 4” (22 Short)- this is a funky little pistol that you don’t see very often. Most people have seen the Beretta tip up pocket pistols (Bobcat, Tomcat, etc). Before those came out, you had the Minx and the Jetfire (25 ACP). The Jetfire remained, and the Minx was replaced. In addition to the pocket sized versions, there were some made with 4 inch barrels. This is one of them. It comes with the factory box, 2 magazines, and 150 rds of 22 short ammo. $450"

These are no longer imported and impossible to find. It is truly the best of the AK rifles. I am the original owner and sad to see it go. It has been a safe queen for years and has only seen daylight on a handful of occasions. It was produced at the Molot factory on an RPK receiver and is solid as a rock. Mechanically it is perfect and visibly it is like new. There are two slight imperfections that could easily go unnoticed. The magazine release has some small marks where the magazine normally contacts it and the muzzle break has some discoloration on the sides (see picture). The rifle has seen approximately 200 rounds and is still a baby. It has always functioned flawlessly with almost no recoil (similar to a .22 rifle). It has been exceptionally cleaned and oiled after each of the three times it has gone to the range and the chrome-lined bore is like new. The rifle will come with a scope mount (not the scope), manual, the original tools kit and oil bottle, safety lock and the original box (the box is a little beat up). Because I live in NY, the rifle will come with one 5 round magazine (30 round magazines pictured will not be included) The receiver will accept all AK47 style magazines.

I'm selling my beautiful Noveske rifle. It is a from factory Noveske, not pieced together with different parts from here and there. It has the very sought-after keymod rail. It is extremely lightweight and is a pleasure to shoot. It has been to the range one time and had about 60 rounds put through it. I cleaned the rifle and put it away. 

If you do some research online, you will find that Noveske products are extremely difficult to come across. It is not with a happy heart that I part with my rifle. Noveske lowers go for up to $500 online... Just a stripped lower. Uppers can go for $1500... You can see how a complete rifle from factory can be worth so much.

Arsenal SGL-21 built on a Saiga Russian receiver.  Russian AK imports are now banned, so get this pre-ban unit now while you can.  It has received a custom SGL Premium Upgrade from Jim Fuller of Rifle Dynamics. His builds have a current lead time of 12+ months for a reason. A Rifle Dynamics AK to M-4 adapter holds a Magpul UBR stock with an extended recoil pad firmly to the receiver. A US Palm grip and Krebs Safety were installed to further improve ergonomics, along with a Fuller rear modified sight which greatly improves upon the factory rear sight. The bolt and bolt carrier have been honed, and the trigger has been tweaked to perfection. It has a smooth takeup before breaking crisply (at around 5 lbs if I had to guess). Because I wanted to keep the factory sight radius, I chose to forgo Rifle Dynamics front sight/gas block combo. Instead, they installed a lightweight front sight tower for me and neatly welded up holes from the old one. At the end of the barrel is a permanently attached AKBC Battlecomp muzzle brake. Lastly, the gun was completely dehorned before all the metal surfaces were sandblasted, parkerized, and top-coated with Norrells grey Moly Resin Finish. She is a work of art and shoots like a dream. Round count is less than 200.  A Rifle Dynamics upgraded AK is about the best you can get.

847,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3314847,"For Sale:  JG Beta Spetz AK AEG, gas Glock 26/27, DE triple shot M56L, lot of AK parts","Danville, Indianapolis, Indiana",$ 50,"Listed On: Sunday, August 31, 2014",Paintball/Airsoft,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Used to be into airsoft a 5 years+ ago or so but got back into firearms.  Need to get rid of some of the stuff that I still have. Feel free to make me an offer, I'm just guessing on the prices since I've been away from it for so long. Would like to meet up face to face in west Indy, Brownsburg, Danville, Plainfield, and starting next week Greenwood.  Will also ship at your cost but note I will ship as-is.

First is a JG Beta Spetz AK underfolder AEG with a rare (at least back then) SRC thumbhole handguard, I have siderails for the handguard but they are off since it interferes with the stock folding.  Made to replicate the AK SMG in the first Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.  Can't remember all that I did to it, I believe the gearbox is pretty stock but has a tightbore barrel that I again can't recall what it is, maybe a Madbull.  $50, no mags, no batteries

Next is a Gas Blow Back Glock 26/27 clone.  I used this as my trainer when the Glock 26 was my main carry gun.  It has 4 short mags and 1 long mag.  I would bet though that most of the mags leak now. $50

Next is a Double Eagle M56L triple shot shotgun and a non-work authentic Tokyo Mauri M3 Super 90.  The TM has the common broken nozzle problem if I recall correctly.  I was going to transfer the Double Eagle parts into the Tokyo Mauri but never got around to it.  The Double Eagle works fine and includes 14 shells, some TM, some Chinese knock offs. $50

Last up and unpictured is a lot of mostly Tokyo Mauri body style clone AK stuff.  I have probably 5 bodies, about the same number of front ends, several gearboxes, lots of gear box parts.  Enough to keep a Tokyo Mauri/clone AK running forever or probably build a few with lots of spare parts. (I was an airsoft hoarder LOL)  I will be able to send you pictures via email or text but even then I probably won't be able to get everything.  $200"
