These were very well made rifles to compete with Remington 700 featuring a heavy duty action.  In fact Marlin was sued over it's design of the MR-7 by Remington stating it was patent infringement of their 700. They apparently won because the MR-7 ceased production in 1999. Marlin also loosely borrowed safety technology from Ruger and a magazine box design from Browning for the MR-7 model.  Marlin's new 30-06, the XL-7, is no where near the quality of the MR-7. Marlin are obviously better known for their lever actions but this is a fine quality bolt action rifle.  I will include the Burris mounts and 1"" rings pictured with the rifle. I will also include 20 rounds Federal Premium 180gr Trophy Bonded factory rounds and 5 Corelokt and 10 brass.  There is a small ding in the bolt side of the buttstock. I have adjusted my asking price for this already. Look these rifles up for value before you make an offer. Lowballers will not be responded to, don't waste your time or mine. You MUST leave a phone number if you want to be contacted back.   Asking $500 or best offer."

At H&R, we’re proud of our single-shot heritage and the fact we’ve been a part of the American hunting and shooting tradition from the beginning. This versatile and economical shotgun design has changed very little since we started building them back in 1893, because it works. Our break actions have long been the choice of straight-shooters who want the most out of their single shot at game or a clay target. They’re lightweight, quickpointing and have very few moving parts to maintain. These guns open smoothly when you press the lever, lock up tight as a bank vault door, and our Transfer Bar System acts as a safety to prevent unintended firing. Also, each gun comes complete with its own special locking device for safe storage. Our Pardner® lineup pays homage to our total entrenchment in the shooting sports with a wide range of options to cover every situation and budget. 

All models are single shot, break-open action with side lever release, automatic ejection.

Famous for their handiness in the woods and extended-range patterning ability, our Pardner Turkey Gun lineup includes a wide range of options from which to choose. In addition to our 10-gauge model, we offer 12-gauge models in camo with fixed full chokes or screw-in turkey chokes, and a 20-gauge, 22""-barreled compact model with camo-finished hardwood.

The VEPR is simply the highest quality rifle based on the Kalashnikov design. The VEPR(tm) Rifles and Carbines are sporting arms based on the famous Soviet designed RPK machine gun. VEPR rifles are manufactured at the historic Vyatskie Polyany Machine Building Plant (a.k.a. ""MOLOT""). Molot has been building excellence into their firearms for over 50 years.

Product Description from Website:
 Product highlights:

    Brand new in box
    RPK-type extra heavy duty receiver
    Hammer-forged chrome-lined barrel
    Chrome-lined chamber and bore
    Thumbhole walnut stock

The semi-auto hunting rifles VEPR are designed for medium-sized and big games. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). 

VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market 

The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope. 

All VEPR rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual."

Glock 27 Gen3. Less than 500 rounds thru it. Ghost Inc. 3.5lb trigger connector, Wolff competition hammer spring, extended mag release, kydex IWB holster. 5 mags 4 have extensions. Barrel has been gunkoted copper. Great CC weapon. Has a little holster wear. Very smooth shooter. $550

Beretta PX4 Storm type c. Took this in trade for a rifle. It's a good solid shooter. Has some cosmetic issues. Slide has been cerakoted green, rear sight has punch marks on it and looks like a mismatch. Grip has been fully stippled. Comes with 2 mags, box, book, shoulder holster, set of adjustable sights that need repair. 
I had planned on striping the slide, gunkote it, fix the adjustable sights then use it for trading barter for a new/old rifle. But I just don't feel like messing with it. 
This is a very solid shooter. I've personally put 200 rounds down the barrel with flawless performance. It will make a great carry or truck gun. $325 as is or 450 with rebuilt fixed sights and gunkote the slide (I have FDE, copper, and light gray in stock other colors will be +$20)

FN FS2000
FN SCAR 16S
FN SCAR 17S

Looking for the scars to be in close to mint as possible, stock preferably. Would like FDE but only if all the parts are close in color (Ive seen the FDE with 2-3 drastically different shades). Otherwise Id take black. Do not need a ton of magazines/scopes so please do not add them if you want a great deal more for the rifle because of it. 

The FS2000 I am willing to work with more on the condition due to it being out of production for a bit. Do not care about color so much, but would prefer the stock grey/black. Again, I do not need a ton of accessories for it, if it FN brand (tagged FN with trademark) I will definitely consider paying for the extra add ons (FN Cleaning kits, magazines, cases etc...), but thats it. 

Send me your price on the rifles if you have them, I have access to both of the scar variants from Scott AFB PX and from local vendors with them in stock so Im not going to pay retail. The FS2000 appears fairly frequently on gunbroker, so please keep the 2500-3000$ offer to yourself. Dont want to be rude, but with a in person transaction there are no fees to pay on your part, no shipping, no worrying so I dont expect to pay as if there are. 

Please send pictures, I live on the Illinois side, will do an FFL transfer if that makes you feel comfortable and will pay the fees for that as well. Thanks."

I have built many of these over the years and this is last one. I am selling for what I have in it. $775.00   I am good at building these guns but my shooting preference is big bore single shooters. I was going to keep but am getting into Cowboy Action and of course that means different guns. Would work a trade for Marlin CB .45 colt or similar rifle. Been taking up space in safe for a year so it is time to let go.  I assembly with Mil-Spec parts and tolerances are line-on-line. I also run across a 5.56 GO/NO-GO gage to verify head space. Willing to travel in Nevada to complete deal. NV residents only and no felons. Will respond to Emails but prefer phone calls to weed out scammers and lowlifes. 775 four one zero 1747. Thanks for your interest. NOTE: Manufacture listed as Doublestar as there are no selections for CUSTOM. However the lower internals are Doublestar so not totally off-base."

The bolt is long and sturdy with dual opposing locking lugs. The separate bolt head employs a plunger-type ejector. It cocks on opening. The lockup is tight enough that it takes a good slap up with the palm to release it and a slap down after running it forward to chamber a round. Although compared to some rifles, the safety seems almost like a World War II design used on the Springfield ’03 or other rifles, but I actually like it: Flicking it to the right puts it on “safe,” and the left is “fire.” This safety locks the firing pin to the rear when applied.

Probably the first thing most shooters will notice about the AR-30A1’ is its large muzzle brake with dual baffles. I’ve shot most of the current .338 Lapua Magnum sniping rifles and have found that a muzzle brake is a necessity. This brake is screwed on using 3/4×24 threads, the standard for many suppressors.

A utilitarian aluminum chassis that is bedded using a V-block keeps weight down and enhances accuracy, as does the free-floating, 26-inch barrel. ArmaLite offers two versions of the AR-30A1, Standard and Target models, and I received the latter for testing. The Target version features an adjustable cheekrest and buttpad to help tailor the rifle to the shooter, allowing them to get the best cheekweld. The cheekpiece allows 1 inch of vertical adjustment, while the length of pull may be adjusted from 13.6 to 15.6 inches."

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

The bolt is long and sturdy with dual opposing locking lugs. The separate bolt head employs a plunger-type ejector. It cocks on opening. The lockup is tight enough that it takes a good slap up with the palm to release it and a slap down after running it forward to chamber a round. Although compared to some rifles, the safety seems almost like a World War II design used on the Springfield ’03 or other rifles, but I actually like it: Flicking it to the right puts it on “safe,” and the left is “fire.” This safety locks the firing pin to the rear when applied.

Probably the first thing most shooters will notice about the AR-30A1’ is its large muzzle brake with dual baffles. I’ve shot most of the current .338 Lapua Magnum sniping rifles and have found that a muzzle brake is a necessity. This brake is screwed on using 3/4×24 threads, the standard for many suppressors.

A utilitarian aluminum chassis that is bedded using a V-block keeps weight down and enhances accuracy, as does the free-floating, 26-inch barrel. ArmaLite offers two versions of the AR-30A1, Standard and Target models, and I received the latter for testing. The Target version features an adjustable cheekrest and buttpad to help tailor the rifle to the shooter, allowing them to get the best cheekweld. The cheekpiece allows 1 inch of vertical adjustment, while the length of pull may be adjusted from 13.6 to 15.6 inches."
