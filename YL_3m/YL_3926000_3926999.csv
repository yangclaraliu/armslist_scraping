Year of Manufacture: 1977 

Caliber: .22 W.M.R. (Winchester Magnum Rimfire) 

Action Type: Bolt Action Rifle, w/ Detachable Box Magazine 

Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked ""THE MARLIN FIREARMS CO. NORTH HAVEN, CT. U.S.A. / MODEL 782 -- MICRO-GROOVE BARREL -- CAL. 22 W.M.R. ONLY"", and has a ""JM"" contained in an oval. The left side of the receiver is marked ""19779238"". The right side of the barrel is marked with the safety ""warning"". 

Barrel Length: 22"" 

Sights / Optics: This rifle is mounted with a brass bead post style front sight dovetailed into a ramp, with a detachable hood. The rear sight is the standard fold down semi-buckhorn with elevator. The receiver is grooved to take clamp on scope mounts. Scope attached is a Tasco 4x15, perfect for sighting varmints and small game. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The one piece stock is WALNUT (not a laminate or picture of walnut ), with impressed checkering on the pistol grip and the forearm areas. The comb of the butt stock is Monte Carlo style and there is a Marlin hard black plastic butt plate with white spacer. The stock is fitted with sling swivels, sling is attached, and has the traditional Marlin ""Bullseye"". The LOP measures 13 ¾"" from the front of the trigger to the rear of the butt stock. The stock has no chips or cracks and no marks. The stocks rate EXCELLENT PLUS overall condition.

Mechanics: The action functions correctly. Rifle has been fired about 50 rounds, 30+ years ago, and will hit a dime, dead center, at 100 yards. Cleaned and oiled every 6 months for 37 years. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: An official Marlin leather carrying sling is provided. The sling is in Fine condition with only a few scuff or compression marks. There is also one unmarked magazine which functions correctly. Also comes with a Weather Shield tan leather carry case, model # 1291, Made in the U.S.A., also in EXCELLENT condition. 

Assessment: This Marlin looks as if it may never have been fired, but since it was, I can not sell it as new. Stored it very carefully in a humidity controlled display case in Michigan with other collectables. This rifle appears ""like new"". Chambered in .22 W.M.R. this rifle is an excellent gun for pests or small varmint control, particularly when out fitted with a scope. This rifle will make a fine present for a young man learning to shoot with the best rifle he will ever own, or for a collection piece of Marlin Rifle history. It is without a doubt the best rifle I have ever owned, all parts made in the U.S.A. and assembled in the U.S.A."

Magazine Write UP---AL390 Synthetic gives hunters a weather-proof edge. The AL390 is now available with a rugged, durable stock and fore-end built of advanced polymer compounds reinforced with fiberglass. This makes the stock strong, rigid and impervious to the harshest weather. The gun has a smooth, matte black finish from rubber recoil pad to muzzle, to cut glare. Built-in sling swivels make it easy to prepare your AL390 Synthetic for the field. The weight is unchanged, producing the same reduced recoil for which the standard AL390 is so well known. Now even if you're soaked through in your blind or battling an early freeze, the stock of your AL390 will emerge unscathed."

The lands in the barrel look brand new with a perfect bore. The rifle comes with the original hanging tag and owners manual. The rifle also comes with a hand fitted Browning Safari case that was purchased from same place in the early 70s along with a vintage Torel hand tooled Cape Buffalo sling. The case looks like new and comes with both keys and the Browning Instruction manual plus care card. Also comes with one box of vintage Winchester ammo and one box of empty cases.

I've added an aftermarket forearm (pump) that allows picatinny railing; recoil reduction pad (wife likes) and two velcro attachments to hold 5 shells (see pics, its a Chris Costa/magpul reccomended upgrade). 

Additionally, I have a Surefire Vertical Foregrip WeaponLight (http://www.surefire.com/illumination/weaponlights/rifle-carbine-smg/verticalforegripweaponlights.html).  It's kind of a shame, this light is worth more than the actual shotgun ($800). The light has a swing lever clamp that latches to a picatinny rail and it has pressure pads on the foregrip to activate the light. 

An average Mossberg 500 Tactical..maybe I can expect $500. The light alone is woth $800. I know there is no realistic way I can expect $1,300 for this grouping. Im asking $950 for the pairing of the shotgun and the light. 

Im reasonable, hit me up. I'd prefer to sell together, but would consider peicing them out.

Everything still Works and is all original part wise, It has a nice chrome finish and about 80percent of the finish remains. it also has it's original grips with the nice Hopkins&ALlen Logo on them. Its a 6 shot cylinder with a 4inch octagonal barrel. The barrel was so pitted and beat and recently at my home I shot 2 blanks out of my Hopkins&Allen Revolver and the last blank I fired the bore fractured in 2 places. The Bore has a hair line fracture on the top and on the bottom of the Barrel. I was told by a qualified Gun Smith that the bore / barrel can be yanked off and replaced with another Hopkins&Allen .32 S&W centerfire chambered barrel or He said I could just have him create a barrel to replace the Original. It's not a Super pricey fix as everything else still works and is almost in new Condition as I've babied my Hopkins&Allen Revolver since I've owned it, it's been in my Revolver collection for years. My Revolver says Right on top of the frame above the cylinder, Model #6 and in big letters it says Double Action. Before the bore fractured, I've personally only fired S&W .32 regular ""shorts"" thru it even though I was told by a Qualified Gun Smith some years ago I could safely fire the more powerful .32 smith and wesson Longs, he just said you can but don't have to. I'm looking for a value of at least 70dollars for the project Revolver and a value of about 30dollars for the ammo and the Blanks, so about 100bucks total for everything. Also when I brought my revolver to be checked after the bore split / fractured I asked the Gun Smith if it had anything to do with the ammo or the blanks and he clearly stated to me as I thought, the bore really couldn't handle much more because of it being so pitted and Old. I never had the smith take the barrel off yet Because I figure it's still a great gun with life left and just needs some work and you'll basically have a new Rvolver. I have about 40 to 45 .32 S&W blanks to scare pests off and for training under noise/pressure, and I have around 30 to 35 rounds of .32 regular, ""shorts"", Their 82grain LRNs bullets Made by Untied State Cartridge Company.

This gun has no previous owners and has not been shot at all. I really like it but I have not had time to take it out and shoot it so it has been in storage. I paid about $1,800 for it during the Ammo shortage when all guns and ammo were overpriced. I do not expect to get  my full money back but I am asking for $1,200 hundred because I am the only owner and the weapon has never been fired. I know they can be found for a little cheaper than mine but from what I have seen they are relatively rare. I am not desperate to sell this gun so if I cannot get $1,200 I will just keep it. Please do not call me asking for a deal. If you are interested please call Mark at REDACTED between 12-5pm. I am located near Universal Studios. Cash only, must have Florida drivers license and preferably concealed weapons permit.

This is the M360J, or 360J, not the M&P 360 or the 360PD. Those are .357 Magnum, and were common production guns. This Airweight, as noted by the placement of the serial number under the cylinder release (also inside the crane as with all S&W revolvers), is a unique limited run from S&W, and was for Japanese Law Enforcement, but a few were sold in the States. They are tough to come by and this one is brand new. Weighs exactly 14.82 ounces. 5 shot, .38 Special, and modern day .38 Special S&W revolvers can shoot +P, just not +P+. I have dry fired it, the double action is typical of S&W J frame revolvers, but the single action is ultra light and crisp! This revolver looks like a mini version of the Night Guard, a discontinued S&W revolver that was built on the L and N frames, so not quite as concealable as this 360J.

Info from the www.JPrifles.com website:

Whether as a complete carbine, upper or lower assembly, the newly released JPGMR-13™ 9mm is a versatile platform that measures up in terms of both function and accuracy. The GMR-13 is available on either our JP-15™ or PSC-11™ upper receiver for a blowback-operated carbine that includes our 9mm Silent Captured Spring standard. The end result is a system that cycles with virtually no recoil, allowing for extremely fast sight recovery with solid 3 MOA accuracy from a pistol cartridge usable out to 100 yards.

With the high-performance ammunition available from many manufacturers, the GMR-13™ makes a solid choice for a competitive match carbine (especially considering the cost savings of 9mm ammo over .223) and is also well-suited to home defense applications given its impressive .357 magnum-comparable ballistics with a carbine-length barrel. The lack of concussion in enclosed spaces and greatly limited over-penetration issues when compared to most rifle cartridges only enhance its suitability in this arena.

Designed from the start with the needs of law enforcement in mind, the GMR-13™ accepts the same G17 pistol magazines as Glock 9mm pistols for carbine/sidearm compatibility and is also available in select-fire configurations. Built on the PSC-11™ upper receiver platform with its dual charging systems, the GMR-13™ readily accommodates those with training backgrounds on either the HK or AR-15 platform. Also available for military and law enforcement, the complete rifle package includes our own JP select-fire trigger setup for precision trigger control in both semi- and full-auto modes. As with all JP rifles, the GMR-13™ comes with parts and service readily available from a trusted US manufacturer."

Bought for my AR15, never used. Still have original box and receipt. 

A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic 

• Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. 
No need to fumble with switches prior to use.
• 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.
• In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking 
and maintenance easy.
• Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared 
to iron sights and magnified scopes.
• Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with 
Aimpoint 3X Magnifier and Concealed Engagement unit.
• Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world 
conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.
• Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).
• Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.
• Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with 
both covers closed in an emergency.
• Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces.
• Modular mount set up for use on flat-top AR15, M4 Carbine and M16 rifles. 
(Adapter available for carry handle mounting)
• Removable spacer. Remove for use on shotguns and sub-guns.
• QRP2 rail grabber mount. Snap knob three times for a perfect mount. 
Will not deform your rail like many other mounts.

Here are the specs:

VLTOR VIS Carbine monolithic upper receiver. The upper receiver and rail are one single        piece. There rail is all one perfect piece from back to front. No gap.
YHM 14.5 inch fluted barrel with a pinned and welded muzzle brake.
YHM flip up gas block front m4 sight with sling adapter
SCT nickle boron bolt carrier group. Carrier is made of 8620 steel. Bolt is MPI/HPT 158 carpenter steel. 
Strike industries extended charging handle. 

This is basically an upgraded m4 rifle upper, with a 14.5 inch barrel and a carbine length rail. Every single part on the upper is brand new purchased for this build, and assembled at PT Firearms in Cross Plains. Rail panels are already installed on both sides. I have a Magpul XTM kit on the bottom of the rail, If you would prefer a Magpul AFG2 instead, let me know. For those unaware, barrels must be 16 inches for the gun to be legal. anything under a 16 inch barrel is considered a short barreled rifle. The one way to get around this is to have the muzzle brake pinned and welded to the barrel. This means if you wanted to change the brake you would have to go to a gunsmith. I see no reason to do so, as it is a good brake and tuned to the barrel perfectly by YHM, but I wanted to clarify that. Please don't make offers, I have over $1150 into this and it is new and unused. Also, I am not looking for trades on this, I am selling because I need money. If you would like to attach it to a lower to test it and have a place to do so, let me know. If you don't have one I can bring one. Thanks for looking."

Will accept 2 cheaper handguns plus cash depending since I am looking for a cheaper 22 pocket size semi-auto (no junk aka no Jimenez/Bryco/Hi-points ect) and a 22 rifle. 
I can do better pics for serious inquiries.

Their custom package includes the milling of the slide, tall night sights for co-witnissing, the RMR (this is the amber reticle), and finishing work.  Basically, it makes the 9mm more like the FNX45 tactical, but in a size that smaller handed people can use.  The package price from there is $885 plus the pistol. 

The pistol comes NIB with 3, 17rnd mags, and, I've got about 500rnds of 9mm, as well as, as kydex holster. 

As it turns out, I can't seem to get used to the grip angle vs a 1911 in relation to the RMR.  My ""natural"" hand position has the barrel slightly high and puts the dot out of the sight picture.  I'm sure I could get over it, but someone that is more accustomed to non 1911's would get more use out of it.

Anyway, there is quite a bit of tech in this pistol.  I'm mainly looking to trade.  Obviously, 1911's are high on the list.  I prefer 4"" models and they have to have ambi safeties.  I like nice, stainless revolvers in 357.  Nothing longer than 6"" unless it's a King Cobra.  Also considering a nicer optic for my 308 than the Vortex PRS.  Not that it isn't ""nice"", but I'm considering putting a Mark 4 leupold on it for ""street cred""....  Those are just high on my list of needs.  I'm open to just about anything.  If you are proposing an AR, I'm only interested in top tier, factory built.

Trade value is $1250 roughly depending on your trade.  If you want to pay cash, just make me an offer.  I can sell the pistol alone, but not selling the RMR unless the pistol sells.

If you aren't familiar with the Cougar design it is the precursor to the Beretta PX4 and uses a rotating barrel action to improve accuracy and lower recoil. Identical to the Beretta Cougar aside from the name on the slide; Stoeger is a subdivision of Beretta.

Have a few different compact carry guns so I'd like to swap this for something a little bigger.  Looking for mid or full sized 9mm handguns, not looking for anything in particular so feel free to let me know what you have.
