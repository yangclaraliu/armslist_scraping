This rifle is EXACTLY to spec as military issue.  Ordered the scope midway thru June. rcv'd beginning of July.  8500 or best offer.
   It's a 1-10 twist 28"" barrel. mil spec mil dot reticles get you on target and re target much faster and easier it is also a first focal plane so it reads the same at 100 yards as it does 1000 yards you don't have to worry as you do with second focal planes. You will have to build up your own load data in how you shoot and your zero everyone's zero is different. It is a Kahles mil spec reticle just release last year and rated over Nightforce and leupold. I used 250 grain Sierra bullets and lupua brass. I have the load data on the gun which you are happy to look at if you want to come see it. I load mild grains.  Not to hot not cold. Right in the middle. If I can remember right it was 85-86 grains hot is closer to 90. I still took a 1.8 mile shot with my loads and was 3-4 on the target. 

Comes as a package- (means, I WILL not break it up, so quit asking.) includes-  Barrett 98B with 2 clips; Mentioned Kahles Scope mounted and bore sighted; 270 round of Lapua .338; Pelican 1750 hard case- waterproof to 50 meters; Kestrel 4500 Shooters weather meter; Bushnell Elite 1500 laser distance finder; RCBS lapua .338 die set; Soft Carry case-backpack; sandbag; Terrain mat; Nylon brushes Rod cleaning kit; Rounds, primers, powder and brass for self loading.

   Trades I'm looking for-  Automotive- Cars- something worth 10k or so on kbb private party... show me what you got.
 trucks- something worth 10k or so private party on kbb. sorry, no 2wd trucks- not worth much in colorado.  Again, show me.
 motorcycles- prefer 2009 and newer 1000cc sportbike- R1, GSXR1000.  Harleys- 2007 and newer- full size, no sportez - maybe a nighttrain if clean and lower mileaged. 

Precious metals- Gold, platinum, etc prefer no jewelry- but if you are just talking metal value we can talk.

Electronics-  if brand new in the box, computers, flat screen tv's etc.  used stuff is a pain to sell, which is all i would do with it.

combinations of cash, and any of these things is also a possibility. NOT looking for collections of tools, chunk of land in the middle of nowhere wyoming, old tv's, your daughter- UNLESS she can cook and clean, isn't too hard on the eyes, and knows when to keep her mouth shut.  (that was a joke of course... do not want some liberal readin this and deciding i'm in some sorta slave trade bs...)
    Here is link to retail price of just the rifle from barrett-  http://www.barrett.net/pdfs/Price-List.pdf
     For payments, I would hold title to something borrower owns, that has a value over 10,000 dollars- motorcycle, truck, car, property etc... This would be the collateral for the loan.  Since weapons do not have titles, this is only way to solidify the loan.  Would like to have it paid off within a year, maybe 2 tops.  Payer is borrowing my money, since they will have possession of the Barrett, and getting to use it.  I am offering this because I know that not everyone is is liquid enough to afford this high end of a rifle, all at once."

Lol, I know I paid way too much for it, but he needed the money to keep his apartment after an illness. I gave him $225 for it. This one is 175. I knew I'd lose some money when I bought it. But he needed it.

Now this shotgun isn't going to last if you put thousands of rounds through it on a target course, but I shot it a few times and it functions fine. There is a repair on the left side of the butt (at the front of the action) that could probably be done better. Personally I would just leave it as is and use it as a rough weather hunting gun. If you scratch it, who cares? The butt hasn't been shortened. Bores are great, and bluing is presentable - for a Boito it's pretty good. Chokes are Modified and Full. It would also make a good youth gun, since it is a 20 gauge apparently built on a 12 gauge frame. Recoil is negligible.

Lol, it's just a beater shotgun, but it doesn't look bad, and there aren't many $175 over/under shotguns out there are there, huh?

And if you don't like it just send it back and I will refund your money when I receive it. If you are local here in NM, just make it $175 plus $25 shipping.  Believe it or not, this shotgun is 50 years old nowadays, so I can ship to a C&R. I can also ship it to a New Mexico resident with proof of residence and age. You don't need an FFL to receive this in-state by mail, and it doesn't have to go through a dealer.

Please don't expect a Parker here. But it works and shoots and I think you might actually like it. If I bird hunted more, I would just keep it. 

Thanks for looking!

It is a straight blowback pistol in .22 Long Rifle only, with a fixed barrel solidly attached to the frame.

The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy and steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. Polymer is used for the magazine catch, mainspring housing, non-rotating grip safety filler, and the body and follower of the 10-round single-column magazine. 

It is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun. Safety features include the traditional left-side thumb safety and a gun lock on the right rear side of the slide. A third safety feature is the gun’s automatic trigger safety, which blocks the trigger until the slide is fully forward into battery. Finally, the hammer features a half-cock notch. The front sight is a fixed sight and has been designed to allow extra material so that it can be filed to adjust for the individual shooter. 

The Chiappa is a fixed barrel blow back design that maintains reliable functioning with minimal friction. The reliable return of the slide in combination w/ fixed front and rear sights maintans a constant return and quick, accurate follow-up shots. It includes two 10-rd magazines."

The cylinder holds 5 rounds. It was purchased for $400 out the door brand new.

As most of you probably know, Rossi (and Heritage Arms) are owned by Taurus so this model has the Taurus safety which requires the use of a supplied key to lock up the hammer. As a side note, I am not sure if the 3"" barrel is still available. All I seem to see anymore are 2"" and 4"" models.

PROS:
*Surprisingly accurate out to 20 yds. (2"" groups or so)
*Good SA trigger
*Graduated ramp on front sight 
*Good balance
*Grip doesn't become slippery when shooting with sweaty hands.
*After a couple hundred rounds, it is showing zero signs of wear. (not a lot of rounds but on cheap guns sometimes that's all it takes)
*Not sure if this is necessarily good BUT, the gun never felt as though it needed to be broken in.
I've been quite happy with this gun for the price. Sure I prefer a Ruger or S&W, but for $400 new, I couldn't really ask for anything more out of this gun. Accurate enough for bunnies and concealable enough for self-defense. Put a dot of white paint on the front ramp to zero it in at 7 yards, and even the wife can shoot it accurately.
This pistol comes with 50 rounds"

The trigger pull is amazing, and it is a really accurate pistol. It has less than 200 rounds through it. The back strap is also stippled to give it extra grip.  This can be swapped out if you don't like the stippling. The only reason I am looking to get rid of it is because I have 3 M&Ps. 

I also have a Blade Tech Kydex holster with a drop and offset attachment that I can add in for the right trade.  (Or a comptac if you'd prefer)

I am mainly looking for Sigs in 9mm or .45. I would consider other trades if they intrigue me."

357,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3503357,For Sale:  HK VP9 new July 2014 model,"Laguna niguel, Orange County, California",$ 900,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 30, 2014",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"Off roster pistol hard to find in CA 

Comes with lock two 15 round blocked mags 10 round  CA  compliant 

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014."

The old finish was stripped and refinished with teak oil so there's no shine and it looks great. I also stripped and reblued the metal. As with most T53, the numbers don't match, and there are several ""authentic battle damage"" scars on the wood but no cracks. Someone had cut ""Nuri"" into the butt stock. I've shot about 1,000 rounds at the range and meticulously cleaned after each use. Must have a permit for transaction.

I purchased this gun new last spring for turkey season and put maybe a box of shells through it. The guns not even broken in yet. Fun gun to shoot and wonderful for stalking turkeys. It's short barrel and light weight design are ideal for hunting.  The thumbhole stock is a great addition and makes it easier to steady the gun. All and all I'm ready for something new. I also have the orignal box and all the papers. I paid $450 for the gun at sportsmanswarehouse and also another $35 on the choke tube. I am negotiable but theres not much wiggle room."

555,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3503555,For Sale:  Used Manurhin MR 73 w/ honest holster wear,"Anywhere, Lexington, Kentucky",$ 500,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 16, 2014",Handguns,no type,357 Magnum                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"If you are a revolver fan and want to know a little about this weapons pedigree do a little research. You will be quite surprised. The MR73 was standard issue with France's Gendarmerie and in some police units including Special Weapons and Tactics teams (RAID, GIGN and comparable units).

The GIGN selected the MR73 in part for its ability to almost indefinitely withstand 150 rounds of full-power ammunition during daily range practice. These teams also use MR73's with scopes and 8"" and 10"" barrels for tactical purposes. Over one million rounds were allegedly fired through one example.

Every MR73 is match grade accurate, shipped with its own factory test target fired at 25 meters. Averaging 15 rounds, no group over 20mm (0.8 inch) diameter with selected ammunition is allowed.

The MR73 has an adjustable trigger weight in both double-action and single-action modes- a feature not found in any other revolver. These adjustments do not alter the strength of the main spring, ensuring reliable primer ignition. This is due to the use of roller bearings in the trigger mechanism along with extensive hand fitting and polishing of components during assembly. The MR73 requires more than 12 hours of hand-fitting at the factory, making it about 50% more expensive than competing U.S.-manufactured brands.[3]

The revolver can be converted to 9mm Parabellum with a supplied replacement cylinder.

Cylinder chambers are finished with an impact process that makes them glass-smooth and extremely hard. The factory proof-fires each cylinder chamber with .357 Magnum ammunition generating 30% more pressure than the C.I.P. maximum allowable pressure for the Magnum cartridge. The factory guarantees that the cylinder will not burst or show any bulging or deformation with .357 Magnum ammunition developing double the standard maximum allowable pressure of 300 MPa, meaning the cylinder can withstand 600 MPa (92,800 psi, or 46.4 tons per square inch).[5]

The frame, cylinder, and barrel of the MR73 are made from ordnance-certified, alloyed steel. Barrels are manufactured by cold-hammering. The rifling is formed during the forging process, eliminating the need to cut the rifling as a separate manufacturing step. This creates an extremely hard and microscopically smooth internal barrel surface.

Unlike a Colt Python or Old Smith this pistol is a shooter. I paid $700 for it. It might seem high given the condition but, I assure you this weapon will outlive a similar pistol manufactured today. I WILL INCLUDE 100 rounds of .38 and 100 rounds of .357 magnum.

I was told buy C.A.I. that this paticular pistol was carried and used by the Elite Austrian Paramilitary unit called Cobra. They have since switched to glocks. And I imagine they were sitting in a weapons armory and were traded in. If you have any interest in MR73 as a collectors piece the time to buy it is, when you see it.

If you are a first time buyer but hesitant to ""pull the trigger"" on your first firearm, please consider this: History has proven that firearms are one of the best investments (almost) any one can make - provided that they are kept in excellent condition - and their long term appreciation exceeds most conventional investments. Real estate, silver and even gold do appreciate over time but with huge fluctuations: Time after time they can simply fall through the floor and stay there for a long time. I have never seen that happen to firearms in good condition. Attitudes and laws change, you are free to own them today but who knows what tomorrow will bring.  Don't worry too much about fishing for the absolute bottom price: Take good care of your arms and they will serve you well in many ways. Why not start your collection today with this inexpensive - but a whole lot of fun to shoot - rifle?

SIG  PROPAGANDA: Sig Sauer P320, a polymer-framed service pistol designed from the ground up with the input of law enforcement officers. The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. 

Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. 

Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. 

With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

The Astra A-100 is a Spanish double-action/single-action semi-automatic pistol that was manufactured by Astra-Unceta y Cia SA beginning in 1990. It was distributed in the United States by European American Armory (EAA)
Unloaded Weight	2.17 lbs.
Overall Length	7.09 in.
Barrel Length	3.35 in
The A-100 is a recoil-operated, locked breech design with improved Browning-style linkless locking. The lock up is similar to the Browning High Power or CZ-75 with locking lugs on the top of the barrel which mate with lugs in the slide (not with a single lug in the ejection port like a SIG P22X.) The pistol's safety features include a manual decocking lever, firing pin block, and hammer safety.[1] The A-100 lacks a manual safety, but depends entirely on a deliberate pull of its trigger to fire it; in this way it is similar to the SIG P22X series of pistols. The double action trigger pull is relatively long and heavy, thereby precluding the need for a safety as the probability of an inadvertent discharge is low."

Really any bolt action with a standard bolt face will work, so would also consider .308 chambered Enfields, 1903 Springfields, or newer rifles.  Since I only need the action, a gun with a ruined bore or stock that I can get for cheap would be best.  But open to lots of things so let me know what you have."

This Ruger is the result of a major project. I was a beginning shooter when I bought the rifle. I couldn’t find the paper! Embarrassed, I decided to make myself a better shooter, find the best ammunition, and make the rifle as accurate as possible. The result is a rifle that can shoot a ten round magazine within a half inch circle at 50 yards. And I still need some work as a shooter.
The only original pieces on the rifle are the receiver and magazines. There is a choice of three barrels: 16” Whistle Pig aluminum over steel, 16” Magnum Research carbon fiber over steel, and 16” Majestic Arms aluminum over steel. All seem to shoot about the same. The Whistle Pig is my favorite. It is fluted, vented, and weighs about a pound.
There is a machined slide, an extended titanium bolt handle, extended magazine release, Timney trigger, Integramount scope mount, Sightron Big Sky 4.5x14 42 target sight, and a beautiful laminated ambidextrous PWS T-Rex stock.
The rifle has turned out well: it is very accurate and beautiful."

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY 
This listing is for ONE magazine, but winning buyer can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges.  This listing is for One magazine; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Owners of the Lee-Enfield .303 caliber British Army rifles are basically 3 variants: the Number 1 series, older style rifles; the #3 that is a Mauser type rifle; and the #4 later style. The #5 Jungle Carbine takes the same magazine as the #4. If you have a #1 or a #3, or smle3, this magazine will NOT work in your rifle. Since the days of ten dollar Navy Arms Import magazines for the venerable Number 4 Mk 1 Lee-Enfield British .303 rifles is now two decades past, here is Pro-Mag’s offering, and its steel bodied construction is so simple. Caliber, of course, is .303 British, and This magazine holds 10 rounds. These magazines will fit the #5 Jungle Carbines, because those were reconfigured #4’s; but they will not fit any other variants of the Lee-Enfield. Followers are nicely stamped flat blue steel, and solid blue steel bodies and floorplates. All these are brand new, manufactured in South Gate, California; and we certainly need to support whatever is left of employment and of the firearms industry in California. Packaging advertises Pro-Mag’s Lifetime Warranty, certainly an attractive feature, and the company domain is promagindustries. Service address is included with the packaging, if that should be necessary. Replacement pricing on the military magazines, extremely hard to come by, is upwards of $60 apiece. We’re offering these brand new Pro-Mags, however, each		for only	$ 29.00.	Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.
