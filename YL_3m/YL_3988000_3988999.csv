Finally, this is the missing piece to your MK2 collection. 

Here is some info on the MSI that I was able to find out:

“Hello, your MK2 knife was made by MSI (Manufacturing Specialties Inc.) in Texas on US contract sometime in the 1980's. They were actual Gov't issue knives. They were rather crudely finished as compared to the other Mk2 makers. According to Frank Trzaska, usmilitaryknives.com, he has only been able to find 1 contract for MSI for about 5500 knives making MSI MK2's among the rarest of all the MK2 knives made since WW2. They don't turn up on eBay very often. When they do, even the ""tent spike"" conditioned ones bring pretty good coin. Mint to NM examples w/ sheaths usually bring a few hundred dollars. I would strongly recommend against doing anything (even sharpening) your MSI knife. Frank Trzaska wrote about the MSI knives in the 10/2007 issue of Knifeworld. I hope this helps.”

""Delivery to USMC circa April 1983 the MSI example is by far the scarcest and, in my opinion, the most valuable. Made in very low numbers in the 1980s by Manufacturing Specialties of Allen, TX. The MSI knives are missing from most collections of Mark 2 blades due to their scarcity and the generalized lack of knowledge. ""

Here is part of an article by Frank Trzaska entitled The Post War Knife, Combat, Mark 2 which was written before his 2007 article:

""There is one knife in the lineup little to nothing is known about, the M.S.I marked knives. The first example I viewed was in 1990 to the best of my memory. It first appeared in print in Bernard Levines Guide third edition which was published in 1993. To say they are scarce is an understatement! It took me a few years to secure the first one and from talking with other collectors I can count about seven in total. A recent purchase of some surplus knives by a collector from the Marine Corps storage in Okinawa revealed several MSI marked knives in a 1989 dated sealed wrappers. The one I purchased had the internal wrapping paper dated 1987 while the outside wrapper was dated 1989 which suggests it was a repack at some point. The knife itself was exposed to air in the packaging as when it was removed a thin film of white powder like mold was present. It wiped off easily. While this alone does not establish proof of government purchase like a contract copy would, but it firmly establishes that the MSI knife was in the supply chain and would have been officially issued to a Marine. The knives are very crude in appearance with fit and finish masked by a heavy Parkerized finish. The typical handle is thinner then normal but the other specifications all fit the bill. All observed have been black in color with typical black scabbards. Obviously made in small numbers this one continues to confuse the collecting community. If you have any information about it I would be glad to hear from you.

The M.S.I. marked knives are crude in appearance and very hard to find. The knives have black handles and black scabbards. The marking on the knives are not stamped in a straight line. The U.S. over the M.S.I is not centered correctly. This is true on the few knives observed. A real challenge to find and tougher yet to find information on.""

The model number for this particular rifle is the M70AB2. Only shot about 40 rounds total through it. Very accurate, no problems. I'm only selling because I'm much more into the AR platform. I don't really want to purchase all the mags/accessories all over again for another platform (the AK) so I'm going to stick with what I know. 

What's Included:
- Century Arms M70AB2 Rifle
- 1 Tapco 30-Round Magazine
- 2 Surplus Magazines 

The Tapco magazine functions fine, but there is a small bit of play with it. The surplus mags both fit in there super snug and are great. I actually prefer those.

If face to face the buyer must be: a) an Ohio resident; b) not prohibited from owning this weapon; preferably a CHL holder. 
If from out of State I can ship from my FFL, but we will have to talk details on payment, shipping, etc. 

Thanks for looking!"

The Benjamin 397 .177 cal. rifle is a multi-pump pneumatic. The hardwood stock is sleek and lightweight and sports a raised cheek piece. The rifled brass barrel is finished in black and sends pellets screaming at 800 fps! You can vary the velocity by the number of pumps (up to 8). The rich wood stock of this airgun is carved to fit the arm and the eye for smooth, clean shooting. Although this gun has been made for decades, the manufacturer continues to put extra fine details in the rifle, such as a swelling in the forearm to make it easier to pump and a fully adjustable rear sight. You can put a scope on the 397, but you'll want to use the B272 intermount to do that. At 33 feet, this airgun can deliver a half inch group. It's accurate and it's forever.  Gun is selling for around 170$ new.

This is an Austrian-made gen3 Glock 19, in virtually brand new condition. I'm the original owner, I purchased it brand new over at Northside here in Columbus, about 4 years ago. I've fired it maybe 3 times, with a total round count of,at most, 100 rounds, not even close to fully broken in.
 It functions absolutely perfectly; firing, feeding, ejecting, all is 100% exactly as it should be. The sights are dead-on, and exactly as they came from the factory.
The pistol has largely been a bedside gun, just sitting in it's case since I got it. Again, you can't tell it from a brand new one under the counter at a gunstore, so the price is firm.
Included are all the factory-original stuff: hard case, cleaning kit, paperwork, spent shell casing, and both 15-round mags.
Prospective purchasers must be over 21, and able to legally own a firearm. Buyer must also be a Georgia resident, and able to prove it with valid drivers license or carry permit.
I do have my Georgia carry permit, so everything's good on my end.
I haven't gotten any pics yet, but it is what it is, if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all.
If the ad is still up, then I still have the pistol. I won't respond to e-mails asking, ""do you still have the item?"".
E-mail, or text at 706-3O4-0-4-nine-four.
Thanks for looking......"

I thought it was stuck in the action it fit so good . should really make it shoot great  you can tell this one was done by a gunsmith not your average bubba. the wood on this stock is very nice don't see wood like this any more unless you pay top dollar for it.  I am asking 350.00 the  rifle is in Bullitt County Ky thanks..

I just bought this gun about a month ago and have only 483 rounds fired. Flawless in performance and function. I have everything you get when purchasing new (manual, test fire casing, 2, 7-round magazines, 3 different recoil springs, lock & NRA stuff).I am selling because I would like to get another Kahr (the Kahr T9 with Night Sights to be specific).

Model: King Cobra Ultimate 


Date of Manufacture: 1988

Caliber: .38 Special / .357 Magnum 

Action Type: Single and Double Action Revolver With Swing Out Cylinder 

Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked “King Cobra”. The right side of the barrel is marked “.357 Magnum Cartridge / Colt PT. F.A. Mfg. Co. Hartford, Conn. U.S.A.”  The left side of the frame is marked with a “Rampant Colt” logo. The left side of the grip frame at the top front of the trigger guard is marked with a “VP” in a triangle. 

Barrel Length: The barrel is 4” 

Sights / Optics: This revolver is mounted with a white outline rear sight adjustable for windage and elevation and a red ramp front sight pinned to the barrel rib. The barrel rib and the top of the frame have a matte grey finish to reduce glare. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grip is one piece checkered black rubber with gold “Rampant Colt” medallions on both sides. The grip has 3 finger grooves. There are no flaws in the checkering, and no handling marks noticed on the remainder of the grip. The grips rate in about Excellent overall condition. 

Type of Finish: Bright Stainless (This finish is so highly polished it almost looks chromed. Please see our pictures.) 

Finish Originality: All Original 

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp. There is no erosion. 

Overall Condition: This revolver retains about 99% of its finish.. The cylinder has a drag line .The hammer serrations are sharp. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear. Overall, this gun rates in about Excellent condition. 

Mechanics: The lock-up on this revolver is tight. The trigger is smooth in double action and crisp in single action. The action functions correctly. We have not fired this revolver. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: None 

Assessment: Wow! What a great looking revolver. Please see our pictures. This revolver is a little heavy for a carry gun, but is Excellent for home defense. The heavy ribbed barrel and rubber grips should go a good job of absorbing the recoil and allow fast double taps. Maybe a little IDPA competition would bring out another way this revolver really shines. 

Special Note: although there is no box. I have done the research and found this is a fair market price. Please feel free to do the same. You will find the price is fair."

For your consideration is my custom Ruger 10/22.  The stock is an Archangel target model, adjustable LOP, adjustable pressure block for barrel forward of the Vblock.  Great shooter prone or off a bench.  Receiver is a factory Ruger part, unmodified but for paint.  Rail has been properly installed with blue Loctite.  Bolt has been headspaced, firing pin has been re-profiled and pinned.  Rear of bolt has not been radiused, this is to slow down the speed of the action for the hotter Stinger rounds.  Trigger has been worked slightly, but is a factory Ruger trigger.  I'm not sure why, but I had it out when I took the photos.  It is included.  Barrel is the very rare Green Mountain stinger specific barrel with a 1:18 twist rate in .920 profile.  The chamber was a bit loose when I bought it new, so I had it set back a hair by my 10/22 smith, but it's so slight that no wedge is required.  I call it a stinger-match chamber.  There is a front QD sling post for your bipod as well.  The charging handle is a Magnum Research heavy piece designed for the 17M2 conversion, also to slow down bolt speed with the hyper velocity rounds.  This rifle will not cycle standard HV ammo unless you replace the charging handle with something lighter.  It will cycle Stingers, Quick-Shoks, and the Aquila hyper velocity ammunition.

All stupid Hickenlooper laws apply, sorry.  My FFL can do the transfer up near Brighton if you need."

Here is Russian made Silver Bear ammunition for the venerable .45 ACP. Manufacturer is Barnaul Machine Tool Plant of Altay, Russia. Importer is Bear Ammunition Co. of Illinois. Cases are zinc plated steel, and bullets are 230 grain Full Metal Case Lead Core, plenty effective for protection and cheap enough for training, qualification, and range work.

Barnaul factory specs show 885 feet per second muzzle velocity, and 360 foot-pounds of muzzle energy from a 5 inch barrel. Like any steel case ammunition, Sig and Glock owners generally need to avoid it. Works best for Rugers, Smith & Wesson metal frame .45s, 1911 full size pistols, and carbines. Replacement pricing on similar loads from Remington, Winchester, and Federal is $30 per box or more.

I'm only selling because I've recently gotten a new 22 magnum.  Typical wear marks from a rifle built in the early 1970s.  No rust, smooth action.  It has a new firing pin.  

Winchester model 275 is a .22 cal. magnum (WMF) pump action rifle. It is identical to the model 270, which is chambered for standard .22 cal. short, long and long rifle. Because the beloved pump action rifle is no longer in production, it is a sought after collectors piece, like following its predecessor, the model 61.

This pump action was chambered in the .22 magnum caliber and has a tube magazine with a capacity of 10  .22 Magnum rounds.

The Winchester model 275 is one of the rarest in the 200 series for Winchester rifles. 

All Winchester 275s were produced with a 20.5 inch barrel, a fixed front sight, adjustable rear sight and a rail for scope mounting.
