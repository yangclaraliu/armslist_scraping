NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY This listing is for ONE magazine; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. Note that some of Triple Kâs magazines do not always come packaged, as the photos show. Please read this ad carefully and study the photos to see whether your Star Model B Pistol is the slotted or non-slotted variant. Triple K magazines work, but they will require some slapping and repeated insertion, ejection, and slide cycling, about 20 times right off the bat in most cases. Most of us whoâve been in the firearms business for any length of time came to know Triple K Manufacturing through their excellent leather gear. Triple K has been in business since 1946. Of all the manufacturers, Triple K is the only source left for magazines to fit many discontinued firearms. Photos show specimens of the Triple K #484M, their blue steel magazine to fit the Star Model B pistols chambered in 9mm Parabellum. This magazine is for Star model B Pistols that have a slot in the front edge of their grip frame but where the forward floorplate tab fits into place. This fine California company Triple K is the last man standing for Star Magazines since the demise of both Interarms and Star Echeverria in 1998. Construction is all steel, from the bottom of the contoured steel floorplate to the top of the stepped steel follower. This magazine holds 9 rounds of 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm caliber. This magazine fits only the Model B Stars, with Slotted Grip Frame, see the photos; but it can be readily adapted by most anyone who has a bench vise to fit the BS Model and Non-Slotted B Models. For owners of the BS and later, non-slotted B Models, please check our number XMRPMBBS, factory BS Mags because they work from the get-go. This 484M Magazine will not work in the Super B, BKS, or BM models at all. The 1952 Spanish Israeli Police Star Model B in some of our photos is not included, of course, and we are not offering it for sale on this listing. Weâre offering these brand new Triple K magazines each for only $ 29.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

Note that the warranty address is 2222 Commercial Street, San Diego, CA 92113. We are not a warranty station. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

If you are not familiar with them, do yourself a favor and research them.  
PWS makes the best piston system on the market, hands down.  Only piston AR out there with long stroke modeled after the venerable AK47, all other pistons out there today are short stroke and require more proprietary parts which are more prone to failure as all of these short stroke systems utilize metal on metal action, where as the long stroke does not have metal on metal contact.  System is super reliable.  Another great part to add is that the PWS mod 0 and mod 1 both weigh less than 7 lbs! so you're getting a ultra reliable piston driven AR with the weight of a traditional DI gun.  

These guns are dreams to shoot..I wouldn't be selling them if I didn't need the money.

PWS MK116 Mod 0 chambered in 556---$1500 OBO, cost $1750 BNIB 
PWS MK114 Mod 1 chambered 223 wylde---$1750 OBO, cost $1950 BNIB 
if desired, would sell both together for 3000.
can send pics if interested, haven't had time to take pics / upload but will plan on doing so in next few days hopefully.

Thanks for looking.

Make me an offer.

had to select POF as PWS was not listed...again, do some research, I've handled POFs, LWRCs, Sig 516s, Ruger SR556s..PWS is the best of them all."

Up for sale is a 5.45x39 Saiga. I had planned on this being my ""go to"" rifle for the future and is set up as such.  I jut got bit by the .308 bug instead. This rifle has had about 500 rounds of NON corrosive only ran though it.

 It has been converted back from sporter to military form. It has a correct  Russian 90* gas block and bayonet lug; both of those things are Russian AK74 milspec and most Saiga conversions don't have this. It also has an Echo 93V3/QD sling mount and Polish Beryl milspec railed hand-guard with vertical foregrip. The hand-guard is Polish MilSpec made of high impact polymer with a aluminum heat shield, great for mounting a tac light to your ak without clamping it to the barrel. It also has a Russian chrome lined muzzle brake, not some off center Tapco paper weight. It does not have the muzzle brake pin, but that is a easy to find $5 part available from APEX or KVAR.  It also has a Tapco G2 trigger.

It also comes with 9 Milspec mags, 5 Bulgarian steel reinforced Circle 10 black mags, 1 TAN Bulgarian Circle 21 mag, and 3 Polish Tantal mags that were re-coated by the  importer. Again, these are NOT American junk mags, these are all top quality MilSpec mags.

Also includes a BCS industries 5 cell Molle chest rig in ATACS FG with upgraded harness. This is a VERY heavy duty chest rig that will take much abuse.

Also included is an ammo can full of BANNED surplus 7N6 5.45x39 Soviet surplus. A little over 1,000 rounds. If I get a serious inquiry I will make a definite count.  

This rifle AND this ammo is BANNED by our........""great leader""....And NO MORE will be imported. I have the original inspection paperwork from the Izhmash factory.

Will take $1,5000 cash, or trade for semi auto .308's (with cash towards me or you, depending on the trade). HK91's, PTR's, M1A's, GOOD FALs's."

Elzetta calls this light the scorcher and when you see it running night or day you will know why. Its mounted in a Elzetta indestructible ZSM mount they are the leading suppliers to DEA and ICE and FBI HRT team. The weapon laser is a new AIMSHOT LS8300 green laser. Try to find or buy one of these. They are only sold to Elite SOF on official military PO only. Not to the publc or even LE Agencys. This one came from Afghanistan and was sent to me by a close friend who is a SFO. Its the brightest laser you have ever seen day or night and after dark it looks like  something from a PINK FLOYD concert. You can follow the beam as far as you can see and the dot is unbelievable. Yes if you get caught with this epically mounted to the gun I have never seen you before. This laser makes the rest of them look like they came from WAL MART. Comes with two tail caps and zero tool. The only other one of these I have ever seen sold on GB about a month ago for 859$ and they went crazy over it! Thanks so much for looking.

Sig522 for sale! The gun was purchased brand new 2 years ago, put 100 flawless rounds through it, then it has been in the safe ever since.  The rifle comes with the case and everything from the factory (rifle did not come with any sights and will NOT be sold with any optic) as well as a Sig Sauer target heavy barrel and brand new Black Dog Machine 25 round magazine. The rifle has a small, .5in scratch on the upper reciever. It does not affect the function of the gun and is barely noticeable. 

Would prefer to trade for a pump action 12g shotgun and for buyer to sign a bill of sale. I can be contacted through email. Thanks for looking!"

1. Chilean M1895 - Great shooter, smooth action. Bluing is probably around 55-60%, bore is lightly frosted but still has a lot of shine and strong rifling. Receiver, barrel, stock and trigger guard match. Stock has crisp cartouche on left side of the butt.

2. Czech vz.24/52c ""sniper"" - Great condition, bluing is 95%. Bore is excellent with no frost at all, near new. The handguard has been chopped back, but the previous owner did still have the other half so that will come with it if you wish to splice/glue it back on (should be an easy fix), doesn't look bad with it off though, almost looks like a cross between a Kar98k stock and a vz.24 stock. I put a Weaver k4 microtrac scope on it, crystal clear. Very smooth bolt. All numbers appear to match otherwise. Comes with sling.

3. Venezuelan FN49 - Nice stock, bluing at around 85-90%. Bore very lightly frosted but lots of shine and strong rifling otherwise, lots of life left. Mostly a mismatch of numbers but there are two or parts that match (can't remember off hand but will check and update later). Great shooter with a very nice trigger. The second to last fin on the muzzle brake has chipped off but I can order a new brake to be sent to whoever it goes to, accuracy has not been affected at all by the missing fin merely cosmetic. Has the slots on the side of the receiver for the scope mount (if you are lucky enough to have or find one!). Comes with sling.

I am also including a bayonet for the FN49 and another Weaver K4 scope with the lot

The MRAD adapts to a variety of user needs without sacrificing performance. With unfailing accuracy, this bolt-action system continues to define a whole new class of long-range precision rifles. The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity. The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended. Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color that blends into any environment - every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle. The Atlas BT10-LW17 Bipod is constructed of T6061 Aluminum and is hard anodized.

This bipod mounts directly to any 1913 style Picatinny rail using the included ADM 170-S lever. This bipod features built in pan and cant up to 15Â° +/- preload. The legs are stainless steel and are notched for a positive lock on your desired length (5 positions) and have a knurled grip area. The feet are removable by pressing the pin and can be replaced with any of the other Atlas feet (not included). The Atlas BT10-LW17 Bipod is proudly Made in the USA! NP-R1 RETICLE 1 MOA elevation spacing and 2 MOA windage spacing are ideal for precision long range shooting, benchrest and all-around use. The fine reticle subtensions are effective for rangefinding objects of various sizes. NP-R1 reticles in Nightforce 5.5-22x50. Originally developed for the U.S. militaryâs extreme long range shooting and hard target interdiction, both 5.5-22 Nightforce NXS models provide a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. These characteristics, combined with the extreme ruggedness and reliability of every Nightforce riflescope, make them ideal for even the largest calibers. The slim profile of the 5.5-22 x 50 NXS makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. Its superb resolution at high magnification opens an entirely new world of extended range shooting for the accomplished marksman; Nightforce shooters are now accurately reaching to 2000 yards and beyond."

The MRAD adapts to a variety of user needs without sacrificing performance. With unfailing accuracy, this bolt-action system continues to define a whole new class of long-range precision rifles. The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity. The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended. Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color that blends into any environment - every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle. The Atlas BT10-LW17 Bipod is constructed of T6061 Aluminum and is hard anodized.

This bipod mounts directly to any 1913 style Picatinny rail using the included ADM 170-S lever. This bipod features built in pan and cant up to 15Â° +/- preload. The legs are stainless steel and are notched for a positive lock on your desired length (5 positions) and have a knurled grip area. The feet are removable by pressing the pin and can be replaced with any of the other Atlas feet (not included). The Atlas BT10-LW17 Bipod is proudly Made in the USA! NP-R1 RETICLE 1 MOA elevation spacing and 2 MOA windage spacing are ideal for precision long range shooting, benchrest and all-around use. The fine reticle subtensions are effective for rangefinding objects of various sizes. NP-R1 reticles in Nightforce 5.5-22x50. Originally developed for the U.S. militaryâs extreme long range shooting and hard target interdiction, both 5.5-22 Nightforce NXS models provide a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. These characteristics, combined with the extreme ruggedness and reliability of every Nightforce riflescope, make them ideal for even the largest calibers.

The MRAD adapts to a variety of user needs without sacrificing performance. With unfailing accuracy, this bolt-action system continues to define a whole new class of long-range precision rifles. The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity. The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended. Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color that blends into any environment - every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle. The Atlas BT10-LW17 Bipod is constructed of T6061 Aluminum and is hard anodized.

This bipod mounts directly to any 1913 style Picatinny rail using the included ADM 170-S lever. This bipod features built in pan and cant up to 15Â° +/- preload. The legs are stainless steel and are notched for a positive lock on your desired length (5 positions) and have a knurled grip area. The feet are removable by pressing the pin and can be replaced with any of the other Atlas feet (not included). The Atlas BT10-LW17 Bipod is proudly Made in the USA! NP-R1 RETICLE 1 MOA elevation spacing and 2 MOA windage spacing are ideal for precision long range shooting, benchrest and all-around use. The fine reticle subtensions are effective for rangefinding objects of various sizes. NP-R1 reticles in Nightforce 5.5-22x50. Originally developed for the U.S. militaryâs extreme long range shooting and hard target interdiction, both 5.5-22 Nightforce NXS models provide a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. These characteristics, combined with the extreme ruggedness and reliability of every Nightforce riflescope, make them ideal for even the largest calibers. The slim profile of the 5.5-22 x 50 NXS makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. Its superb resolution at high magnification opens an entirely new world of extended range shooting for the accomplished marksman; Nightforce shooters are now accurately reaching to 2000 yards and beyond."

Fantastic looking rifle that will turn heads everywhere you go and no one will have one just like this!  If you see anything in the pics that doesn't look right, it's a problem with the picture, not the rifle.  I chose through a handful of those Gold Medallions and picked this one and then sent the stock off to a custom stock maker in MO to have the shiny Browning stuff stripped off and a nice hand-rubbed finish applied.  I remember that being about $400 alone.  I have a very nice illuminated reticle Swarovski scope on it now that isn't included, but can be purchased for an additional $1250.  I have the box, a Browning sling and a nice Browning soft case.  I also have a nice synthetic stock with a Decelerator recoil pad for hunting so you don't scratch that beautiful wood.  It has the BOSS system, and I have the conventional recoil attachment so you can choose to use the brake at the range and the CR attachment while hunting.  It's a shooter and when I use to shoot it a few years back I remember it being MOA or close to it with a few different ammo types.  I haven't shot it in years and I'm cleaning out my safe and working on rearranging a few things.  Check out my other listings and load up your safe with some nice weapons!"

This rifle has never been shot. Do not need bill of sale but will need to peek at valid GA license and 21 or older. 

Barrel: 16"" Chambered in 223 Wylde, with a 1/8 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system. The modified A2 profile barrel is made of 416 stainless and lead-lapped for accuracy. Barrel is finished off with a Midwest Industries SSK 12"" free-float rail, low-profile gas block and an A2 flash hider.

The .223 Wylde hybrid chamber was designed by Bill Wylde of Greenup, IL to exploit the accuracy advantages of the .223 Remington chambering without pressure problems or compromising the functional reliability of semi-auto weapons like the AR-15 family when using 5.56Ã45mm NATO military ammunition.

It comes in a wooden display box and has all the paperwork. It has a ""Nickel Finish"" and looks amazing. The Smith & Wesson Model 27 is the original .357 Magnum revolver and was first produced in 1935, and many versions of it are still in production today. The Model 27 was built on Smith & Wesson's carbon steel, large N-frame, and was available at various times with 3 1/2"", 4"", 5"", 6"" or 8 3/8"" barrel lengths and had adjustable sights. When first introduced by Smith & Wesson in 1935 it was known as the Registered Magnum. The model was essentially a custom order revolver. Barrel lengths could be had in quarter-inch increments from 3.5"" to 8.75"" in length. In addition to the different lengths of barrels available there were different grips, front sights, triggers, hammers, and finishes available. Each Registered Magnum came with a certificate of authenticity. Even though it was introduced in the middle of the Great Depression and was extremely expensive, Smith & Wesson found itself backlogged with orders for the four years that it produced the Registered Magnum. The Kansas City Police Department issued the Registered Magnum to its officers, and many other law enforcement officers across the United States carried the Registered Magnum. In 1939 Smith & Wesson stopped producing the Registered Magnum. It was replaced with the .357 Magnum.
