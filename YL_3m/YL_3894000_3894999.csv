The previous owner put a ""handful of shots"" through it. I haven't shot it at all. When I got it, it hadn't been cleaned and it was not dirty at all.  The gun looks new.  I had to grease the rails and oil the gun because it was too clean.  :) The modification I have done is I polished the barrel hood to a mirror shine.  The barrel originally had a black barrel hood (I left the rest of the barrel black).  I also put a little white paint on the shooter's end of the front sight post. This 1911 looks and feels fantastic.  The only reason I am selling it is because I had purchased a Springfield Armory Range Officer and I don't need/want two 1911's.

This bullpup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition. The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG."

Im writing to bring my situation to your attention. Pike County Sheriffs department issued me a citation for ""Breach of Peace"" for shooting my (legal) guns, during legal (country law) shooting hours. The deputy said its NOT for the guns, its for the noise. Definition of ""breach of peace"" is in-sighting war, violence, or threatening others. A trumped up charge to suffice my pesky neighbors on speed dial.

I ask that ALL shooters of Pike County Illinois stand with me and tell these out of control ticket writing police officers that enough is enough. They need to do their jobs, NOT fold to whiny neighbors that have the cops on speed dial. We MUST let them know that this kind of behavior from an elected official (Sheriff Petty) will not be tolerated. 

They are supposed to follow the laws just like the citizens. I followed ALL the laws. My shooting has never been excessive, despite what the neighbors say. They are full of the typical liberal lies, and I was ticketed because the cops were tired of them calling in for me shooting. 

I was visited by sheriff's deputies a total of 5 times in a week. 4 times they told me that Im doing nothing wrong, and that Im following ALL the laws. On the fifth visit, they issued the citation.

A citation for ""Breach of Peace"" was issued to me at my house on Saturday 12-20-14 @ NOON - For shooting trap in my yard (6+ acres). We shot for 45 minutes.

This problem does not stop with me. I've learned that many, many, many people are having the same issues. 

ITS TIME TO END THIS NOW.

Pike County needs your support.

Lets fill the court room and peacefully protest this. If they get away with actually prosecuting this ticket, YOU COULD BE NEXT!"

When it comes to rifles this is the cream of the crop. Walnut wood, stainless steel, floating barrel, 24 K gold engravings and Leupold VX III B&C Scope. 
It comes with gun case and a few rounds to sight it in. It usually takes 3 rounds to sight the rifle in, I shoot Remington 180 grain rounds through it.  At the moment I have it set at 200 yards for me. 

I came from southern Arizona, the shots normally taken on a Couse Whitetail Buck are around 300 - 500 yards across canyons. Difficult hunting conditions, that's why the 200 yards.

This gun is in excellent condition. Every time I show someone this gun they ask if I am ever going to hang it over the fire place to admire. 

Text images for now, I will post some later today. I am not looking to trade. 
Thanks for looking."

No other firearm brand can lay claim to the legendary reputation of Winchester Repeating Arms®. Through the genius of John M. Browning, many of these all-time favorites are forever a part of America’s history. When it came time to chase a band of outlaws out of town, blaze a trail across the Great Plains or face down a charging grizzly on a narrow trail in the High Rockies, the men whose legendary courage tamed the Wild West chose to arm themselves with a genuine Winchester rifle or carbine. It was the gun they carried with absolute confidence, knowing that their lives and livelihoods depended on it shooting straight and true every time they pulled the trigger.

These magnificent historic rifles are limited production models and each one is crafted to the most exacting standards. This level of quality takes time and talent, and with so many classic variations in detail — like case colored receivers, different barrel lengths, deluxe and commemorative models in both rifles and carbines — it means that Winchester Repeating Arms will not have every historic model in the product line every year.

This is their 8 shot tactical revolver. This is the model with the fixed rail. As typical with Performance Center's pieces, the design, workmanship, fit and finish and stellar. I have owned both the fixed and removable rail version, and liked this one better, but I have to sell. Scandium alloy, with stainless internals, trigger and hammer. I've owned in 2 years and purchased this new. Fired approx 200 rounds of only qualify ammo, and is in perfect working order. This has been well cared for and maintained, and used lightly at the range occasionally. There is a small scratch near the end of the muzzle that you can see in the picture, but other than that blemish, the weapon is flawless. It did not come with the metal case I have seen that come with earlier purchases, but I do have the receipt for purchase, and original case and lock. The R8 is light for its size, feels awesome in the hand, deadly accurate, fun to shoot, kind of unique, and comes with the stuff listed below.

China called it the Type 53 Carbine and it has been widely exported. 

This specific example was produced in December, 1953 at Plant 296 and is technically a T53 shi (Translated Trails Rifle).  It is in really decent shape for its age and the metal finish is worn to a nice even 10-15% patina.  The stock is dense like walnut and exhibits only a few scuffs and bruises from military service and the surplus importation process.  This is an older import that predates the really hammered ones that are coming into the country now.  Comes with the original sling as shown in the photos.  Rifle is import marked on the receiver, is non matching, and is missing the cleaning rod.

Very uncommon to find a Trails rifle today and would be a welcome addition to any Mosin-Nagant collection.

Never carried, as I didn't want to scratch it or anything. It's only been out of the box a handful of times. Round count is less than 100. Gun comes with about 100 rounds of fmj, give or take a little. Also comes with 4 magazines and slightly longer floor plates for a little extra grip if you've got big hands like myself. Box, lock, and paperwork all included. Msrp on this gun is between 875 and 950, so I feel like 750 is fair with the ammo and mags included.
