The Good:
She shoots great and had zero hiccups. Has about 180-200 rounds through it. She could obviously use a trigger upgrade as it's just a GI trigger from the kit. If you want a new trigger, I have a some new Geisseles for an extra cost. Tight lock up, but not too tight that you have to hammer out the take down pin.

The Bad:
When I took the original rifle home, I found blemishes from the guy that owned it previously. The pivot pin holes have the anodizing worn away on the outside from attempting to ""shotgun"" the upper when there was resistance. Also, there is a scratch from who knows right before the buffer tube. These blems are minor but I have pics upon request. The upper's rails have some wear from scope usage, but that is normal.


This rifle is used, but the parts I upgraded were all brand new.

$1375 or $1200 if i keep the magzines, the stock, and the PWS FSC30. No trades unless you're willing to take a loss on your trade value. If you contact me and then after I respond I hear nothing back you're wasting my time. Don't waste my time b/c I will not waste yours."

Up for sale is a 5.45x39 Saiga. I had planned on this being my ""go to"" rifle for the future and is set up as such. I jut got bit by the .308 bug instead. This rifle has had about 500 rounds of NON corrosive only ran though it.

It has been converted back from sporter to military form. It has a correct Russian 90* gas block and bayonet lug; both of those things are Russian AK74 milspec and most Saiga conversions don't have this. It also has an Echo 93V3/QD sling mount and Polish Beryl milspec railed hand-guard with vertical foregrip. The hand-guard is Polish MilSpec made of high impact polymer with a aluminum heat shield, great for mounting a tac light to your ak without clamping it to the barrel. It also has a Russian chrome lined muzzle brake, not some off center Tapco paper weight. It does not have the muzzle brake pin, but that is a easy to find $5 part available from APEX or KVAR. It also has a Tapco G2 trigger.

It also comes with 9 Milspec mags, 5 Bulgarian steel reinforced Circle 10 black mags, 1 TAN Bulgarian Circle 21 mag, and 3 Polish Tantal mags that were re-coated by the importer. Again, these are NOT American junk mags, these are all top quality MilSpec mags.

Also includes a BCS industries 5 cell Molle chest rig in ATACS FG with upgraded harness. This is a VERY heavy duty chest rig that will take much abuse.

Also included is an ammo can full of BANNED surplus 7N6 5.45x39 Soviet surplus. A little over 1,000 rounds. If I get a serious inquiry I will make a definite count. 

This rifle AND this ammo is BANNED by our........""great leader""....And NO MORE will be imported. I have the original inspection paperwork from the Izhmash factory.

Will take $1,5000 cash, or trade for semi auto .308's (with cash towards me or you, depending on the trade). HK91's, PTR's, M1A's, GOOD FALs's."

History: At the outbreak of WWII, BSA was the only factory producing rifles in the UK. During the Battle of Britain in 1940 the BSA factory was bombed several times by the Luftwaffe, destroying the machine shops and stopping rifle production.  The British government and BSA immediately established “shadow factories” throughout Britain to increase arms production in areas less vulnerable to German air attacks. The Royal Ordinance Factory was then established at Maltby and produced Enfield rifles. This rifle was one of those produced early in the war during the Battle of Britain.

I bought this as a collectible and have not fired it, but everything functions perfectly. Was used in WWII. Good cond.

This listing is for One set of grips. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-set price and with no additional shipping charges. Photos show black polymer replacement grips to fit S&W models 469 and 669 pistols chambered in 9mm caliber. Smith & Wesson only produced the 469 and 669 compacts between 1983 and 1988, but they were immensely popular and without peer. These little guns are so durable, they will be in service as long as any of our readers shall live. These are replacement panels, virtually identical to most of the issue grips except without logo. Construction is hard black polymer with standard size reverse detent risers, and with checkered texture lower panels. Since a person has to disassemble the pistol and its grip frame to install them, we advise at least consulting howto com or a credible disassembly video. These grips will only fit Smith & Wesson Model 469 and 669 pistols. They will Not fit a Smith & Wesson model 3913, will Not fit a model 6906, will Not fit a model 59, will Not fit the nozzle of a 1958 Rubbermaid 2 Quart Water Bottle. They will only fit S&W 469 and 669 pistols chambered in 9mm, often known as the Mini. Grips for any discontinued Smith & Wesson pistol are not easy to find, and these are among the most difficult. We’re offering them per set at only $ 29.00.

For your consideration, I have a Ruger M77 Mark II rifle chambered in 223, NOT 223/5.56, complete with scope and Ammo.

The Rifle itself is completely stock, stainless barrel and action, Super crisp trigger with adjustable stop, and it shoots perfectly. In some of the pics you will see that at one point someone had tried to camo paint the entire gun, minus the scope, so there is remaining reddish paint in the lettering, grooves and recesses. I left the camo wrap (tape) on the barrel to cut down on scope glare in direct sunlight.

The rifle comes mounted in the original lightweight stock (complete with the red paint). 

I am including a very nice Hogue overmolded target stock. Great stock, just too heavy for field use.

Also included is a Bushnell Banner Series 6x - 18x X 50mm Wide Angle adjustable eye relief scope Mounted in Ruger Stainless rings. The scope will need to be rezeroed.

And last but not least is the Ammo:
13 1/2 boxes (270 rounds) of American Eagle 55gr FMJ Boat Tail that has been sitting in my climate controlled vault since 1991.
And 3 X 30 round boxes (90 rounds) of American Eagle 55gr FMJ Boat Tail, unopened current production.

When you add it all up, this really is a good deal, since the gun alone MSRP is $749 right now. So the price really is firm.

I will travel within reason.

The only partial trade I may consider would be a Hi-Point Pistol or Carbine, or H&R single shot rifles/shotgun.

NH ID and Carry Permit required for sale.

Thank You for your time."

This listing is for One set of grips. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-set price and with no additional shipping charges. Photos show off white polymer, imitation ivory replacement grips to fit S&W models 469 and 669 pistols chambered in 9mm caliber. Smith & Wesson only produced the 469 and 669 compacts between 1983 and 1988, but they were immensely popular and without peer. These little guns are so durable, they will be in service as long as any of our readers shall live. These are replacement panels, virtually identical to most of the issue grips except without logo. Construction is hard off white or ivory color polymer with standard size reverse detent risers, and with checkered texture lower panels. Since a person has to disassemble the pistol and its grip frame to install them, we advise at least consulting howto com or a credible disassembly video. These grips will only fit Smith & Wesson Model 469 and 669 pistols. They will Not fit a Smith & Wesson model 3913, will Not fit a model 6906, will Not fit a model 59, will Not fit the nozzle of a 1966 Fleet’s brand saline bottle. They will only fit S&W 469 and 669 pistols chambered in 9mm, often known as the Mini. Grips for any discontinued Smith & Wesson pistol are not easy to find, and these are among the most difficult. From our poor memory, no one made imitation ivory grips for the Minis, even when they were in production by S&W. We’re offering them per set at only $ 29.00.

This was handed down through the family but my priorities have shifted. I can't even begin to tell you how beautiful this rifle is! I had it checked out at cabelas they have one in their heritage vault. There price is $7300. Completely original and fired maybe 12 rounds through it's pretty much gone from one gun safe to the next and handled with care! It has a low serial number. I just had a baby and I had to take off work unpaid and my rent is due! I need $1000 and that's all i am asking for a $6500+ rifle. If I don't sell it by the first I am going to trade it in and get newer guns to sell those to get the $1000 I need for rent so if your looking for something like this get it before they sell it for retail price.

The 6906 is one of Smith & Wesson’s best pistols ever, with more safety features than anything else on the market. Type is blowback action semi automatic. Construction is stainless steel slide assembly and internal parts combined with a lightweight alloy frame. Barrel is distinctive knurled muzzle for consistent bushing fit, 5 groove right hand 1:18.75 stainless, 3 1/2 inch. Slide is stainless steel, with serrations forward of the safety levers, .925 width. Note the full length steel guide rod. Sights are matte blue steel, dovetailed front and rear, 3 dot Novak Combat type. Frame is type 3, round serrated face trigger guard with serrated front strap and one piece factory polymer grip. Trigger is .304 smooth faced black matte steel, with matching finish .265 Bobbled Hammer. Magazine is stainless bodied factory 12 round; so capacity if 12+1 rounds of 9mm Luger caliber ammunition. Frame thickness is 1.02 inch. Overall length is 6 7/8 inches from muzzle to grip frame strut, with a height of 5 1/2 inches from the top of the rear sight to the end of the finger rest magazine floor plate. Weight empty is 26.5 ounces, with center of gravity at the magazine release. The Smith & Wesson 6906 is a good feeling, well balanced, accurate pistol. It also has an ambidextrous lever safety, as well as a firing pin safety and magazine safety. It will not fire single shot if the magazine is removed. Double action trigger pull is smooth and consistent, 12 pound vicinity; and the single action pull measures about 6 pounds with minimal felt creep.  This lot of 6906 pistols served with the Puerto Rico Air National Guard. From their serial number prefixes, they were manufactured between 1990 and 1993. Surface detractions are moderate, with holster wear and contact scouring as the photos show. We rate them as Good, perhaps Very Good, 70 percent vicinity by our estimate; but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our finish grading. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. We estimate these pistols have been fired fewer than 1500 times for annual qualification, no rounds at all for a 6906 Smith & Wesson. We’re offering the Smith & Wesson 6906 Compact in the photos, or one of its virtually identical mates, 		for only	$ 369.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 12 shot magazines are restricted, $15 off but no magazine. Includes Connecticut, Hawaii, and Maryland. Remington Golden Saber +P Ammunition is Not Included.

I have a BHP Model 88 right now and its more of a ""safe"" gun due to it being a rather unique BHP. Now im looking for a ""working"" BHP.  The model im looking for is the Hi Power Practical. I chose that model because it has better metallurgy and is capable of installing night sights. 

The other model I was looking for was an Arcus 98 DAC. Pretty much a clone of the BHP except is has a 4"" barrel(similar to the FM Detective slide for the BHP) and its DA/SA(I think its both).  Now I think the 98 DA wasn't compatible with Hi Power magazines. I have quite a few HP Magazines. So I would like a model that is compatible with HP Magazines since I have a lot of them.

This is what im looking for. What I don't need is:
- Magazines (if the Arcus 98 DAC isn't HP magazine compatible)
-Holsters

The Tavor SAR Rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier. The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier. Among its advantages, its bull pup configuration- the rear center of gravity enables a rapid acquisition of the target and provides the ability to fire the weapon with one hand. The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material; therefore, it is very light. The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat. The Tavor is state of the art modern design weapon which includes modular picatinny rails. ""Flattop"" rails for multiple single line accessories and devices are also available. The Tavor SAR Rifle is a complete platform that comprises optical devices and other accessories, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the XXI century.

Had a deal on this, but they bailed out after making me drive an hour and wait two. So to try this again....


I picked up this awesome weapon in trade, but because I already have a hand cannon, I am not as in love with it as I thought. It is an awesome piece, and is a first gen Israeli import pistol. The .357 DE can handle the hottest of loads, and runs flawlessly, chewing through everything. The frame size is slightly smaller than the .44 (slightly) which makes it easier and more comfortable to shoot. The bore has polygonal rifling, much like an HK. 


This is a very early serial number, 83xx... First run!


This pistol is a real show stopper, and is in absolutely stunning condition. The BCG is clean, and there is very, very little handling wear. (Most DE pistols are handled more than they are shot.) 

The pistol will include one magazine and a hard case. 

This variant of DE is far more affordable to shoot, as .357 mag ammo is far cheaper than 44 or 50!

Works great but it's too high a cheek weld for my shooting style, it's best with an optic mount but your preference may vary. Wood has a few safe marks, gun hasn't been shot too much, probably 3-5 magazines worth.
The factory bolt carrier is ""in the white"" (not chrome lined like some gun salesmen seem to believe). So just for giggles I put some gun blue paste on mine. That's about the only ""modification"" I made to it.
I won't even charge for the ""custom"" work I did to it. ;-D

Comes with 6 polymer magazines, Master Moulders, they've worked w/o fail for me.

Wouldn't mind a trade for cheap ar-15 like one of those DPMS Century refurbs, or a WASR-10/63 w/ a bayonet lug.
Cash is king though, other trades considered. No pistols, shotguns or hunting rifles. Would trade up for a good 7.62x39 AK.

It is a Remington 700 chambered in 7mm Remington Ultra Magnum. It was purchased for a once in a lifetime Elk Hunt that never happened. So after collecting a little dust in the safe for a few years, it is now offered for sale with all the ammo and goodies bought for it.

The gun itself is a Stainless Steel action, with jeweled bolt, 25 1/2 inch Fluted Stainless barrel with a professionally installed Muzzle break. The rifling is of course perfect as the rifle has never been fired.
The stock is a synthetic 2 tone grey Remington with sling swivels and a new Harris Bipod.
The Scope is a Cabela's Premium Alaskan Guide 6.5x - 20x X 44mm with low rise mounts and rings. There is the tiniest bit of surface rust on the rear scope mount.

Ammo: Included is 2 boxes (40pcs) of Remington Premier Ultra Mag ammo with 175gr Swift A-Frame Pointed Soft Point bullets. And 50 rounds I loaded myself using new Remington Brass, SPEER 145gr Pointed Soft Point bullets, and 91.2gr of Hodgdon's H-1000. As well as the Redding Die set I used to make them. I have been reloading for 30 years, but the hand loaded ammo has to be sold as use 'For components only' legally. So if you opt to fire it as-is you do so at your own risk.

If you have an upcoming hunt of a lifetime, this rifle will get the job done from a great distance and drop whatever it is you are hunting.

Of course a NH ID and Concealed Carry Permit required, or we can run it thru a local FFL.

The price is $2,500.00 for all, or best REASONABLE offer. Possible partial trades would include a Ruger 44 Mag Semi Auto Rifle, or S & W 357 Revolver.

I can e-mail better pictures if you need them, I am limited in size on here.

Thank You for your time."

this is a 32 caliber rim fire, six shot revolver whose barrel swings up to allow the non-fluted cylinder to be removed for loading. It has a 5” octagon barrel and a spur trigger. It is referred to as a model Number 2 old model revolver and also the model number 2 Army. This is because earlier issues of this gun were used extensively as a personal side arm by officers and enlisted men during the Civil War. This gun has a blue finished and shows wear. However, the overall condition is very good and it functions very well. The grips are varnish rosewood with a square butt profile. The grips have an ""x"" notched into it on one side, possibly a marking from a kill in the war? A total of 77,155 of these were manufactured from 1861 to 1874. As a history note, General George Armstrong Custer was known to own a pair of these and ‘Wild Bill” Hitchcock, while Marshall of deadwood was carrying a model Army number 2 the night he was shot holding aces and eights in August of 1874
