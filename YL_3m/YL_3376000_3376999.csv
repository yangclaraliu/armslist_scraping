The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
      The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.

The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward."

The new, remarkably ergonomic SIG P227™. It’s a .45ACP that holds 10+1 rounds — but you’d hardly know it from the thinness of the grip. Take hold of this high-power, high-capacity pistol and you’ll see first-hand how
we’ve stacked the odds in your favor.

Very smooth shooting, has never jammed, no feed issues. All around great, reliable sub-compact c&c or range firearm.

Included will be two BCM barrel nuts, one barrel nut complete with the BCM delta ring assembly, and an AOP Mfg. complete BCG + charging handle. (AOP supplies BCGs for companies like Wilson Combat and LWRC.) I also have a Troy rear sight, a PRI barrel nut wrench, and a generic AR-15 wrench for the castle nut, and flash hider. Both are torque wrench compatible. Can include a BCM upper parts kit if you wish. I will sell this as a package deal,

Why choose Brothers N Arms? In a word – Quality. After all, when you squeeze that trigger, quality is what matters. Quality is what keeps you safe on the battlefield and on patrol. Quality is what keeps your rifle running at the range and wins you competitions. We wouldn’t build anything that we wouldn’t shoot or own. With years of military and law enforcement training, our designers and machinists know what it takes to make a quality weapon.

Quality is about the little things. Our uppers, lowers, and bolt carriers groups are all made on the same factory floor right here in America in order to ensure industry leading fit and finish. All of our rifles sport free float hand guards with low profile gas blocks. Our standard triggers set the bar high with a clean, crisp break. Quality rifles like these deserve to go right to the range, so out of the box you are range-ready with a set of Magpul flip up sights (select models vary). There is no need to spend even more money getting set up with sights just so you can go out and enjoy your new quality rifle.

The barell measures 20.5"" in length and has an excellent bore with sharp rifling. the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of other Soviet or Chinese-made AKM's, resulting in increased rigidity and improved overall accuracy. The trigger pull is light and the action is smooth. The overall length of the rifle is approximately 40.5"". Unfortunately no magazine is included with the rifle.

These are hard to find and come from an era when gun makers made high quality firearms built to last a lifetime.  I will include the pictured Bushnell variable power scope with the rifle as well.

It dates to about 1951 and so qualifies as a C&R firearm so it can be transferred without the expense of the FFL and BGC fees.  I am asking $249.00 OBO, FTF in NorCO area, cash sale or trade.

This gun shoots 45acp factory ammo flawlessly. Will also shoot 45 super but i have not tested that ammo. Last but not least it fires the mighty 460 Rowland which achieves 44magnum ballistics in a semi-auto weapon. It has truglo/TFO nightsites bought in January 2014. Pachmyr slip on grip. Stainless Steel solid guide rod. Custom recoil springs. Barska laser light is included at no cost with the gun. The original guide rod and barrel come with the gun also included is the aftermarket case, and the original case with all XD gear except the speed loader. 2 working mags and 1 mag missing the spring and and spring plate are included.  Also included are 56 rounds of Rowland 460 185gr JHP ""Johnny's Personal Carry"" rated at 1550fps and 1000 FPE. Also inlcuded are 23 rounds of unknown HP's that i received by mistake from Rowland.com. I have all the aftermarket springs included with the gun. It requires the marked ""Rowland"" magazine to fire 460 ammo as well as the 22lb spring that is marked in a bag. To shoot 45 acp the gun requires the mag marked ""Double Spring"" and the 16lb recoil spring.

This is a badass gun i am only parting with it to fund another cool project. Ammo is readily available but i recommend gunbroker. Gun is in excellent condition with some slight scuffing on the barrel in certain wear places.

I have owned this Sig for a long time. I dropped it off to have it Cerakoted and the smith fucked it up. The magazine release has a spring loaded pin that needs to be depressed before being removed. My guess the ""smith"" used a punch and knocked out the tiny portion of the frame the pin catches on. I had it rewelded but it was too soft and the release has since worked itself out. It worked flawlessly for the several hundred rounds before it failed again.

 Its a shame because finding West German made sigs in good condition is getting harder to find. The pistol has had a trigger job and spring kit installed in the last couple years. I have even used it in IDPA occasionally at the Master level. 

 You can use it for parts, or have a competent smith fix this very easily. I just recently acquired a mk25 and x5 so I have decided to not pursue repairing this one. From what I have seen just the complete slide and barrel sell for I think my price is more than fair for a complete pistol."
