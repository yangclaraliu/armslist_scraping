Gun is in good condition, i got it years ago and had only shot it once.  I have had it sitting in my safe for years and figure its about time for it to have a new home with someone who will get some use out of it.  There is no rust but there is 2 small dents in the wood of the stock and 1 small scratch.
It comes with a improved cylinder choke and I had more chokes for it but I have not found been able to find them.

Beautiful engravings on the steel
This is a beast of a gun, it has definately seen some use and has been a great duck and goose gun. There are scratches on the steel, nothing major it just shows some use. There is also signs of where rust developed and then was cleaned off. The wood is in good condition with beautiful engravings on it. 
I have had some problems with ejecting 3 1/2 inch shells.  You really need to pump it back hard with the 3 1/2"" shells but I have not had any problems shooting 3 inch shells.  I would only use a 31/2"" shell on my last shot anyway so it did not really affect me besides unjamming the gun if it did happen. Its actually pretty rare that it does jam on the 31/2"" shells but I just wanted to be clear about the only problem I have ever had with this gun.

Everything works perfectly and the rifle looks new as it has been fired very little since it was refinished & customized. 

This firearm has had the following modifications performed:

Bolt was modified to accept magazines while the bolt is closed.
Bolt locks in the open position when the magazine is empty.
Firing pin was removed and modified to eliminate the chance of a slam fire. 
The trigger was worked by a gunsmith. Very smooth & crisp. No creep & clean break.
Entire rifle was sanded and refinished in flat black satin coating. Rated at 1200 degrees.
Original front sight was paint bright red and the gas tub rail serves as a rear sight.
Gas Tube, Piston & Gas tube cover were replaced with USA made Tapco replacement parts.
The gun is 922r compliant with parts to spare and they are all stamped with USA markings. 
If you don't know what that means you should google it before buying an SKS or AK.

I have ALL of the original parts (all work and are in good condition):

Original 10 round magazine (# matching)
Original dust cover (#matching)

Original bayonet, attachment & spring

I will also include a Tactical rifle bag with 4x mag pouches, 1x  large mag pouche & a small accessory pockets.  $50

I will also throw in about 100 rounds of ammo so you can test the reliability and function immediately. 

The barrel on the rifle is in excellent condition and the milled receiver is also in great shape. The bolt and internals were removed, cleaned and blued to prevent rust and the 3 piece rubber recoil buffer was installed. The stock and gas cover were installed and hand fitted by a pro. The fit is so tight that you have to remove the stock before you can remove the gas tube - This ensure that the reflex sights holds zero. The rifle function flawlessly using a wide range of ammo. Itâs not as accurate as my AR at long range but it more accurate than my AK long or short with considerably less recoil. I paid somewhere around $350 for the rifle, I have put a couple of hundred in mods and a couple more in accessories. The original assembly parts alone can sell on ebay for $100 or more so I'm listing the rifle, tac bag, 6 hi cap mags, 3 separate sights, ammo and everything listed in order to see what it will fetch... I will consider all cash offers and firearm related trades but would prefer to have some cash in the deal. Honestly, I donât need the gun nor do I need to sell it... I don't expect to get my investment back but I just thought I would list it and see what happens. If you have questions or would like to make a reasonable cash and/or trade offer just let me know. Thanks, be safe and have a great day :-)"

It has been a joy building it but must sell to pay bills. It is brand new never been fired. Converted the proper way to original specifications of a Russian AK 12.
This shotgun will function and cycle all different types of loads without constant gas plug adjustment because of its Tac-47 Auto Plug.
List of modifications:
Conversion kit, barrel nut & tromix mini monster muzzle brake, chaos extended titan quad rail & HK style sight set, extended magazine release, gas piston performance puc, scorpion finger groove pistol grip, magpul AFG, recoil buffer, Tac-47 auto plug And more...

This was a personal build that I never got around to training with. I wouldn't part with this shotgun if I didn't have to. I could ask for much more for it but its priced to sell quick at only cost of parts (no labor fees included in build).
It comes with (3) sgm 12rd mags (2) agp 10rd mags and the original 5rd mag. It currently has a tapco muti position stock on it but I will install a (Bonesteel folding stock adapter & skeleton stock) for $200 more. Just let me know...

I'd be interested in trading it for a different mid sized .40 or one of the police trade in Glock 22's that have flooded the market lately. I just bought an engagement ring for my girlfriend so I have no cash to add to a trade, so looking for an even trade only. Really only interested in .40's but would still consider 9mm's.

Selling a freshly built AK47. If you are a AK purist, move on. If you are looking for a wicked AK, read on- 
Here is the story....
I started with a MAK-90 parts. Looked around for the best possible heat treated US made receiver for the Chinese parts. Stumbled across a company called My Guns Northwest out of Talent Oregon. The owner Matt Yeamens, is the only guy in the country (to my knowledge) that builds and sells awesome quality, pre manufactured, 1.5mm thick US replacement receivers for Chinese builds. After doing my homework, it turns out that Matt is a renowned AK builder and one of the best in the country. So, needless to say, I found my builder for the project. I bought a 20"" Green Mountain rifled barrel blank, a few tasteful Tapco parts, got my stuff together and sent it off to Matt, to have him build me a killer AK. Before I sent my parts, I stumbled across Sabrewerks 13. A company that builds the best scope mounts for AK's, PSL's, RPK's, etc. After speaking with the owner, I decided on the PSL/RPK scope mount and rail because it was designed for a heavier barrel, which in turn allowed Matt to do the heavy barrel build. This mount is pressed and pinned onto the barrel and is the absolute most solid mount I've ever seen. And It should be for $250! I had Matt thread the muzzle concentrically to the bore & with 5/8x24 RH threads for standard .30 cal US muzzle accessories. Has the Tapco G2 trigger. Got the gun back and had It sprayed matte black cerra-kote. I literally have over $1300 into this build and it runs strong and looks beautiful. Test fired for function check only.

And I have a nice CZ Slavia 630 in .177 for sale.  Both are nice shooting air rifles with fantastic triggers (Diana is adjustable).  If you don't know what either are Google them.  They both have glowing reviews.  Both should last a lifetime with care.  The Diana is an airgun that should retain heirloom quality for several generations (infinitely better than anything you could get at any of the big box outdoor retailers). 

The Diana has a few minor handling marks, and I would like to get $275 for it with the mount and scope.

The CZ has original box and plastic.  (and has had a trigger job)  I would like $120 for it. 

If you take them both I will make you a deal at $350 for the pair.

As with most things African this rifle has a long story behind it, and the person fortunate enough to buy this rifle will receive a copy of that story from the African hunting magazine in which it was printed. This beautiful rifle features Turkish circassion walnut stock with an engraved steel grip cap, horn trigger guard, quarter rib with folding leaf rear sights, ivory bead front sight with folding hood and a handmade case covered in Hessian and made in the ""Old African"" method. This rifle has been restored to its original glory by a master gunsmith in Pretoria, South Africa, and he did such an impeccable job of workmanship that Purdeys of London offered him a position when they were finished proofing it. The Gibbs-Farquharson rifle is the rifle that Bill Ruger patterned his beloved Ruger Number One after. This rifle and cartridge combination are capable of taking any game animal on this planet, and in fact, it was used to take all the ""Big Five"" of Africa and has never been wanting.

As with most things African this rifle has a long story behind it, and the person fortunate enough to buy this rifle will receive a copy of that story from the African hunting magazine in which it was printed. This beautiful rifle features Turkish circassion walnut stock with an engraved steel grip cap, horn trigger guard, quarter rib with folding leaf rear sights, ivory bead front sight with folding hood and a handmade case covered in Hessian and made in the ""Old African"" method. This rifle has been restored to its original glory by a master gunsmith in Pretoria, South Africa, and he did such an impeccable job of workmanship that Purdeys of London offered him a position when they were finished proofing it. The Gibbs-Farquharson rifle is the rifle that Bill Ruger patterned his beloved Ruger Number One after. This rifle and cartridge combination are capable of taking any game animal on this planet, and in fact, it was used to take all the ""Big Five"" of Africa and has never been wanting. Words just do not exist to adequately describe this rifle and the adventures it has been on."

The Rock Island Armory 1911 series consists of a product line of single-action recoil operated semi-automatic pistols. They are designed and manufactured by Armscor in Marikina City, Philippines, and distributed in the United States by Armscor USA, located in Pahrump, Nevada.

RIA (Rock Island Armory) 1911s are clones of the US Military G.I. M1911-A1, the standard issue US Service pistol from 1911 to 1985. Most RIA models are targeted for the low-end price point of the 1911 pistol market and are basic entry level MIL-SPEC versions of the 1911, however, the RIA Tactical, Compact, and Match models offer additional semi-custom high end features. The Compact model features a skeletonized hammer and beavertail grip safety while the Tactical model also adds a target-grade hammer and trigger as well as an ambidextrous safety, and enhanced contrast combat sights. Armscor is an ISO 9001 certified-compliant company which manufactures Rock Island pistols using CNC (Computer Numerical Control) equipment. RIA 1911 series pistols are constructed of 4140 chromoly steel with a cast frame, and are available in .45 ACP, .38 Super, 9mm Luger, and .22 TCM chamberings.

This is the older original model before they backed off on quality and reliability (and I am not referring to the CM9 on quality and reliability issues). I have seen the older model PM9âs sell for $1,050! There is a simple reason for that. The newer models are just not built with the same quality and absolute reliability. It comes with two magazines (6 round flush and 7 round extended) and a Custom Galco Jack-Slide holster. It has been broken in and is in like new condition. Original factory box and all paperwork. 

If you want a new model I saw one in Gander Mountain in Houston for $975. (donât forget tax)

This pistol is available for inspection and purchase at my home in the Delaware/Powell area. Or, we can meet at a nearby public parking lot if you prefer.

For sale or trade. Low round count Ruger LCR 357 with Meprolight front night sight installed, two right hand Bianchi leather holsters (OWB and pocket), factory box, zippered case, paperwork, 19 rounds Hornady 158 gr XTP hollow points, and 45 rounds Precision Cartridges 158 gr FMJ practice loads. 

Very clean rig - I bought it from the original owner.  Carries and shoots great (even with 357 full power loads - the LCR design really soaks up recoil!). Only about 150 rounds have been fired through it between the two of us. 

The ONLY trade interest I have is a Smith and Wesson J-frame 38 (or 357!) snub nose with no internal lock in similar condition.

Cash price $400 for the package. 

Located in Argos - along the US 31 corridor. FTF only - no shipping. I can meet as far south as Peru, as far north as US 6, west to Grovertown, east to Etna Green. Show IN drivers license and License to Carry Handgun, nothing recorded. For those who question this requirement, I apologize if it offends, but I can't perform a background check so I will deal only with those folks the State Police have cleared.
