Prefer cash for best price on my gun. I can throw in some hollow points for the right deal.

My email and text number are below as this sights emailing doesnt work often.

I got this gun in a multi gun trade from original owner, has Sig Night Sights, Holster, lock, one extended mag, original carry box and papers.  I have this same model in 9mm and in .380 and dont need another right now.  They are awesome carry guns for men or women and fit great in small and medium hands, but with ext mag, still work for most large handed individuals.  My mom who is a senior and has arthritic hands actually carries same model too as the trigger pull is minimal and it has a safety thats easy to disengage.

Was told it was unfired but carried.  It is in great condition and I think they probably fired a few rounds through it to test it out but not completely sure.  I have not fired it but it functions perfectly otherwise.

Send all reasonable cash offers.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or guns,  ammo or extras for the right AR in .308, I cant add cash.

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, CDNN, classic firearms or J&G when they are in stock, dont need anything full retail, craze inflated or BPS or Gander pricing.

I would prefer to buy things with my cash so I have the initial warranty but if its the right deal, I am willing to work on my guns price too, but since I prefer cash deal, its really going to have to be a trade I really want thats in great shape or new.

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and  condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'm really looking for a Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, or similar price ranges $1000-$2000.....Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built.  Must be new or like new.  I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's prefer pistol plus cash, possibly rifle if even trade.  I would consider Zastava m92 PAP  (I know they are out of stock in some places, but they pop up weekly under $500 and I can wait)  others i'd consider if not canted  CAI Centurion 39 ,  Yugo M70AB,  Yugo Zastava NPAP,  CAI Centurion 39 Tactical AK, Draco or Mini Draco ....... No wasrs, not interested in saigas even though I know they can be great and arsenals are out of my price range.

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus..........  Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  Glock 30s, possibly Gen 4 21......no stippling please   (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600)  Also possibly an LCR if under $400 plus cash, prefer .357 but open to .38

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or  hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale  required. 

I will try to post my other guns I have for sale/trade today or tomorrow.  Sig Tacops 1911 threaded barrel $1050, Spikes Ar 5.56 $950, possibly Glock 27 with lots of extras $600, Spikes .300 aac in FDE $1350, possibly Mossy Tactical 12ga with lots of extras $500  all prices are asking prices assuming every one will negotiate, so I can be fair if others are with me.

The gun is in perfect working order with some frame and slide finish wear/scratches from normal use. It is German made. These are said to be much better quality than their American produced counterparts. It comes with lots of extras. First it has night sights that are very bright, short reach trigger, Blackhawk Serpa holster and comes with 6 magazines. 1-15rd, 2-20rd and 3-10rd. This is everything you need in one package. I originally bought this from a friend when he got out of Navy and he bragged how accurate it was. He wasn't lying. This is a tack driver. I have shot many guns and these sigs, especially the German made, are the most accurate pistols I have ever shot. It is almost unbelievable. Like shooting a laser beam. My wife was even shocked. Whens the last time your wife was speechless over a gun? Doesn't happen often with mine. Thank you for looking at the auction.

I have up for sale/trade a M1A Scout Squad in a Troy MCS Chassis that has been cerakoted burnt bronze. The gun has about 500 rounds through it and it has been maintained and cleaned extensively, so it is in great shape mechanically and cosmetically. The cerakote was done just recently and it really gives the gun a striking look while also providing a tough, corrosion resistant finish. 

The gun's stock is a Magpul STR stock that has also been cerakoted burnt bronze. The stock muzzle brake has been upgraded to a Smith Enterprises Vortex flash hider.  The pistol grip is an Ergo grip, and the vertical grip is a genuine GPS-02 grip pod with steel inserts. You can also see that the gun has Magpul XT rail covers. 

This package also includes 12 magazines (20 round), one of which has been cerakoted burnt bronze to match the gun. I also have the original rear sight for the gun. 

The scope and mount have been sold.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of brand new, factory fresh, and hard to find Heckler & Koch VP9 9mm pistols.  The VP9 is the newest model out from H&K.

 I just have a few  in stock, and I have them priced to sell for just $595.00 each.

Heckler & Koch 700009-A5 VP9 9mm Pistol, Striker Fired, 4.09 Inch Barrel, 15 Rd, Night Sights
In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.
Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitor’s. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
VP9 pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

Its in good shape, is only about a year old and hasn't had a lot of rounds through it. Decent trigger and most importantly to some doesn't have the hated internal lock.
I like snubbies but I dont like this one as much as other J frames Ive had.

I'd like to trade it for a Ruger LC9s (NOT interested in a standard LC9) or SR9c, M&P Shield 9mm, or possibly similar 9mm pocket sized guns. Would also be interested in a Glock 42, but that's the only .380 I would consider. No Kel Tecs or Tauruses please, and not interested in rifles or shotguns, if the right deal doesn't come along I'll keep it.
For the right deal or ammo I can include 50 rounds of 158 grn hollow point .38 special.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Henry Benjamin Tyler Henry Original Rifle H011, 44-40 Winchester, 24 Inch, Lever Action, Blued Finish, 16 Rds, Henry H011

Invented in the late 1850s by Benjamin Tyler Henry, this revolutionary lever action repeating rifle was the most important firearm of its time and went on to become the most legendary American firearm of all time. Patented in 1860 and first used during the Civil War, the rifle’s rapid fire capability and high-capacity tubular magazine stood in amazing contrast to its single-shot musket counterpart. It became known as the rifle you could “load on Sunday and shoot all week long.” After the war, the Henry rifle headed west and went on to play a significant role in the homesteading of that great frontier.
Now, the Original Henry Rifle is back in all its American-made glory.

The Original Henry Rifle is virtually identical to its history-making forerunner in all aspects. The only exception: it is a .44-40 caliber. The 1860 version was made in caliber .44 Rimfire, also invented by Benjamin Tyler Henry, but long an obsolete cartridge. Every other facet remains true to its inventor, and each gun’s serial number begins with the initials BTH in his honor.

Made with the same American pride and attention to detail as all Henry Repeating Arms rifles, the Original Henry Rifle features a hardened brass receiver with the same tensile and yield strength as steel; a one piece, 24 1/2 inch octagonal barrel/tubular feed; a genuine American fancy walnut buttstock and a classic folding ladder rear sight paired with a traditional blade front sight.

Description
In 1980 we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil “lock, stock and barrel” and immediately sought to improve on the classic Beretta design, resulting in the acclaimed Taurus Model 100 pistols. Today, we’re taking these pistols further than they’ve ever been. Most notable is Taurus’ drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety that is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic “cocked and locked” mode as well as a functioning DA decocking lever. Available with fixed sights, you’ll be able to face any situation without compromise.

I was a gunsmith many years ago; this was one of my personal rifles. I used it for a display at shows and then I hunted a couple deer seasons with it. The rifle only has about 2 boxes of ammo thru it. 

This gun started out as a new Savage sporter. I removed the factory med weight barrel and replaced it with a heavy barrel that was properly head spaced to the action. The barrel was re-crowned, threaded 5/8-24 and a LR-308 flash hider was added. Everything is trued up and smoothed out. The entire barreled action was cleaned, stripped down, aulm oxide blasted and coated with KG Teflon Gun Kote OD green. The bolt is coated in KG Teflon black along with the DNZ scope mount. The trigger has been lightened and is crisp, but not so light to be unsafe for hunting or field use. The rifle is mounted in an OD green and black spider web style B&C stock. The bipod and case is included with it, but the scope in the picture IS NOT included in the deal. 

This is a really nice and unique rifle; it would cost a lot more than what I’m asking to build it today. I’m asking $1100 OBO for the gun, case and bipod. Also included with the gun are the following items: sling, lock, protective silicone gun sock, bore cleaner and a package of Mil-Spec rifle grease. I’m sure I’ll find a few more items to throw in the deal too.

I'm near the TN/AL line, not far from the Pulaski area.

I have the redesigned Mini-14. Black Synthetic stock with Stainless barrel.  Rifle has exactly 3 mags through it.  This is the new design (SN# 582-XXX).  This have a redesigned and heavy barrel for much better accuracy than the old models.  Better front and rear sight as well.

Rifle comes with all factory goodies (box, papers, lock, scope rings) along with 11 mags and a picatinny rail.  6 factory Ruger metal mags and 5 Tapco mags.  $240 worth of magazines alone.  Shop around, you will not find a better deal on a comparable Mini-14.
Scope is just a cheap 3x9 and will be included for the right deal.

Ruger 5817 Mini-14 Ranch SA 223 Rem 18.5"" Syn Stk Stainless Steel

The Mini-14 Ranch rifle offers inherent accuracy, light weight, low recoil,
and a quick repeat shot capability that makes them the favorite of ranchers
and outdoorsmen. Best for small to medium-sized game hunting when
maneuverability and a few quick shots might be needed.

Nice and heavy duty AK made in Serbia with a cold hammer forged barrel and thick receiver. The rifle is in great shape with very good bore. No canted sights, shoots very straight. I bought it new last year from Mills. It originally came with some cheap plastic furniture which I got rid of and customized the rifle to my taste. It handles quite nicely and shoots smooth with the Manticore Arms muzzle brake. Rifle weighs in at just under 9lbs fully loaded with a steel mag. With the stock collapsed it's only slightly over 35 inches long. I have put over 1200 rounds through without a single failure. It just eats up any ammo! I always clean it after shooting. Hard for me to part with it, but if I can get $640 for it, I will sell it to focus more on my ARs.

UTG railed handguard w/Magpul forward grip
ACE collapsible stock w/ Magpul MOE furniture

The Rock Island Armory 1911 series consists of a product line of single-action recoil operated semi-automatic pistols. They are designed and manufactured by Armscor in Marikina City, Philippines, and distributed in the United States by Armscor USA, located in Pahrump, Nevada.

RIA (Rock Island Armory) 1911s are clones of the US Military G.I. M1911-A1, the standard issue US Service pistol from 1911 to 1985. Most RIA models are targeted for the low-end price point of the 1911 pistol market and are basic entry level MIL-SPEC versions of the 1911, however, the RIA Tactical, Compact, and Match models offer additional semi-custom high end features. The Compact model features a skeletonized hammer and beavertail grip safety while the Tactical model also adds a target-grade hammer and trigger as well as an ambidextrous safety, and enhanced contrast combat sights. Armscor is an ISO 9001 certified-compliant company which manufactures Rock Island pistols using CNC (Computer Numerical Control) equipment. RIA 1911 series pistols are constructed of 4140 chromoly steel with a cast frame, and are available in .45 ACP, .38 Super, 9mm Luger, and .22 TCM chamberings.

Polished internals include:

Frame; Locking block, trigger bar, striker safety lever, ejector, sear

Slide; feed ramp top and bottom, striker safety, striker, slide rail (chambers a round)'' rides on sear''

Custom work:

Frame; removed OEM stipleing front & back, shortened trigger over travel & take up (set just past trigger reset about 2mm), 

Slide; light green inlay (high heat paint 2500 degree), trijicon (green) front sight by Dawson precision ''OEM rear sight (blue dots)''

This gun has the smoothest slide of any xd or xd(m) and has a trigger that breaks like glass
No OEM band new one feels like this one nore a well broken in xd series pistol 
700 rounds through it works beautifully Springfield also offers lifetime warranty on the GUN not the owner they do and will fix anything they can, usually free. They will return the gun back to oem spec. No fancy trigger job not one polished part, I don't recommend doing that."

I have given it a custom ""light"" stipple job that many seem to like (HKpro members have recruited me for stippling jobs) It is not a typical DIY job; 3.5 hours went into it. This package includes a comp tac IWB holster, a Viridian CTL light (no laser), 1 standard flat magazine, 1 custom pinky removed mag, 1 USPc 13 round mag, 1 USPc X-grip adapter, and 1 P30 X-grip adapter.
