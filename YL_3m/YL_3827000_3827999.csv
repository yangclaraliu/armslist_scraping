The gun comes with one 9 round magazine. It is very clean and has a great feel but has one small issue. Recently, it has failed to fire a couple of times due to the hammer not releasing when the trigger gets to the breaking point. It still fires about 8/10 times the trigger is pulled. Taurus has a lifetime repair policy and will fix it for free but I don't use the fun enough for it to be worth the trouble of sending it off for me. It would be a great gun for someone who likes to work on guns or wants to spend the $20-30 to send it to Taurus for a free repair.

I have a very nice Springfield Champion Operator 1911 that runs flawlessly. It's currently wearing Beautiful Wilson Combat grips and I think the stock grips are around here somewhere. The Trijicon nite sights are still very very bright. It also has a Wilson Combat Full length guide rod installed along with a Wilson Combat National Match ultra-light trigger with an outstanding trigger job. I haven't weighted the pull yet but I would put it at 2.5-3lbs. And the reset is perfect. It comes in the original case, with 2 original mags, but I have plenty more 1911 mags laying around that I could throw in to sweeten the deal if needed and I mean quality mags. Chip McCormicks, Springfields, Kimbers, Colts, etc. And last but not least...... It's also equipped with a brand new Crimson Trace Rail Master Pro (the green laser/light and strobe combo). One of if not the best handgun combo lights out on the market. I paid $300.00 for mine and still have the original box with all of the paperwork.  I have around $1300.00 tied up in this amazing handgun and it is very much worth it.

What makes the AMT Lightning such a special rifle is it is an exact copy of the Ruger 10/22 except its receiver and barrel are completely stainless instead of aluminum. It has a grooved receiver not a tapped receiver for mounting a scope. The other great thing is it uses any Magazine that the Ruger 10/22 can use.
The rifle also comes with a synthetic stock and a stainless steel skeleton folding stock that is manufactured by Butler Creek.
It is an outstanding rifle for hunting or putting in a pack.

Colt Defense - Roll Mark Change.
August 5, 2011 at 1:38pm

Colt Defense is discontinuing the use of the LE “restricted to Military and Law Enforcement” roll mark. As soon as existing production runs are complete, models previously roll marked as LE6920 and LE6940 will be roll marked as SP6920 and SP6940. This change applies immediately to all new orders. In addition, existing orders will be filled with rifles marked with the new model numbers as soon as the LE roll marked inventory has been manufactured and shipped.
Accordingly, proceeding from this date forward, all orders for LE6920’s and LE6940’s will be entered as SP6920’s and SP6940’s respectively.

Good accuracy for stages with slugs with the ghost ring sight. 

I've seen a lot of questions on line about the mag capacity and loading.  I have no issue getting 7 rounds of 2 3/4"" in the mag tube with about 1 1/4"" of spare space.  I use strong hand load two most of the time and I find the gun geometry is fine for that.

From my research it was made as a cheaper version of the Remington 1100 for Kmart. It is a simpler version of the 1100, being a non-gas blow-back design. You can use 1100 barrels on it, which in fact it technically already has one as it is a gas blow-back barrel, giving you a great number of barrel options.

30"" barrel, full choke, 2 3/4"" shells. Fires very well, very accurate when I shot skeet with it. Haven't used it for much else and don't really have any use for it. Unfortunately don't hunt, at least not yet, so might be a good option for that for those that do.

Free CZ stuff, and High Noon quality gear!  Making my move to a new CZ, so this unused stuff that' been sitting for a while and has to go. HIGH NOON HOLSTER company products are not cheap but some feel they are the best for CZs or other guns. I've been using a hybrid IWB for carry for a year now, and this gear sits idle. This gear is not cheap by any means from HN, and it does take up to a few weeks to months to get it from them. Not so with me. ======================================================================== This RAMI holster should fit RAMI, RAMI P, and RAMI BD models. So here goes. Black horsehide carry package: Tail Gunner IWB holster. ($209 from HN, but no longer ava in horsehide. Great condition with some wear on the strap finish.  
This holster and gear carries great. You also get the like new HN Key fob. Single mag pouch for Staggered 9mm/40 RAMI or CZ75 mags called the Tie Breaker.($59 from HN) 

HIGH NOON's ""Rock Steady "" belt in is size 42 and black horseshide ($159 plus $14 shipping at HN, but not in black horse anymore)
It has the stiff liner and is still serviceable.See the pic.

Also: High Noon DOUBLE TAKE double mag pouch in black horsehide for double stack 9mm/40 mags.( $104 from High Noon)
(pic)

This stuff still has years of service in it, and priced below what High Noon would charge you. 
The IWB holster is no longer available from them in black horsehide, same for the belt that
I can see.

Nor, would you get any CZ, CZ-USA clothing or other neat stuff!


Free CZ GEAR!




You also get the Free CZ Shirt (Size 2XL but they shrink a bit) 2 CZ Caps ( CZUB, and CZUB 557) and 2 CZ notebooks.
CZ-USA pin and CZUB pin.

3 CZ Lanyards, and 5 P-07 Duty key chains...great as small gifts.



This stuff is not available in the states, except from me.


You do get 2 CZ caps with this auction.

ALSO included in the box (Will ship it Priority Mail)

(2) CZ Mousepads (see a pic of one in my other CZ RAMI holster auction)

The Ransom Master Series Rest is the only machine rest to successfully accomplish the goal of precise, repeatable handgun accuracy testing. Introduced in 1969, it has become an international standard for accuracy testing.

Key Features



Patented BDC reticle: The BDC reticle allows hunters to hold 'dead-on' at ranges exceeding those previously thought possible. The BDC's unique see-through ballistic circles offer an incredible advantage for long range shooting, yet allow a normal sight picture for shorter-range shots where the crosshair itself is the aiming point.

Extremely bright sight picture: Allows for high-resolution images even when hunting in the least desirable conditions.

Versatile magnification range: Offers the flexibility needed for any type of hunting situation, from heavy timber to the open prairies.

Waterproof, fogproof, shockproof: Nitrogen filled and O-ring sealed.


Multicoated optical system: Multicoated lenses boost light transmission up to 98%—unheard of in similarly priced scopes.

Generous, consistent eye relief: Keeps your brow safe—even with the heaviest recoiling cartridges, lightweight rifles, and severe shooting angles.

Precise hand-turn 1/4-MOA click adjustments: Positive-click reticle adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting even with heavy recoil.

Sun Shade Adaptable: 40 mm & 50 mm models."

I have 3 boxes of unused Remington 270 ammo that will be included, each box includes 20 rounds.  Fantastic gun, smooth and accurate, if you are looking at this listing, you know that the Remington model 700 is a classic, and this is the quality wood version.  I have priced to sell, seems like these sell for around $749-900 new.  This is as close as you can get to new.  Would be happy to answer additional questions or send more pictures.  Love the gun, but can't justify keeping when don't hunt, going to invest in AR instead, would consider AR trade, not random parts."

60 rounds of Yellow-Tip Heavy Ball ammo, 20 rounds of quite rare Chinese brass-cased lead core ammo, and 12 rounds of low-recoil high velocity 46-grain Czech training ammo.  All are pictured.  All ammo is in impeccable condition, and the casings and bullets look brand new.

  Cases are solid brass, and are Berdan primed.  If you want to reload them, you can convert them to Boxer primed casings with a drill press.  The process takes all of 3 minutes per casing, and works wonderfully.

  Current prices for the yellow-tip run from $0.65-$1.00/round.  I'm asking less than that.  I will not mail ammo.  If you want it shipped, it's gotta be FedEx, which will run you around $30.00.

  I also have an excellent condition 91/30 stock set with all hardware (pre-war, I believe), a front sight assembly, and a very small amount of Norma 7.62x54R de-primed brass casings.  Let me know if you're interested in those, and I'll send pictures."
