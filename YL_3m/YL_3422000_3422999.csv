Well, we came up with something that offers the HIGHEST performance at a reasonable price. The ST-T2 buffer is one of the softest shooting, smoothest, and quietest buffers on the market; not to mention it looks awesome! It doesn't have any weights to move around or fluids to leak out like some other buffers, so it's 100% maintenance free! 

Contact Armory Dynamics /REDACTED
www.armorydynamics.com
http://www.armorydynamics.com/parts/ar15-m16/lower-parts/spikes-tactical-st-t2-heavy-buffer.html

The ST-T2 buffer weighs in at 115g/4.05oz. (Depending on the density and size of the HDTP, the weight can vary slightly) and the body is CNC machined from solid billet Aluminum bar stock for strength and durability. To finish it all off, it's Anodized matte black and laser engraved with our Logo. 

So you're probably wondering what's inside of this thing to make this thing so great and different? 

Each ST-T2 buffer is filled with HDTP which is short for ""High Density Tungsten Powder"" and topped off with a Mil-Spec bumper. Because of this, there aren’t any reciprocating weights inside to make a lot of noise and it also makes for a very smooth cycling rifle. The ST-T2 eliminates the chance of bolt bounce, helps with muzzle rise when firing in full-auto, and cuts down on felt recoil. As you can tell, it's a HUGE upgrade from a Standard Carbine buffer! It's designed for .223/5.56 but it works in all Calibers!

Ok folks I have a mossberg 715P Tactical Pistol for sale. I just bought it two weeks ago, have never fired it, and found out I'll be moving to Canada for work for a while and cannot bring this with me.

It was purchased new from Cabela's 8/10/14 and I have the receipt. I am willing to include any range of accessories at various discount prices, I'll also automatically include the two tiny boxes of .22LR cabela's gave me with the gun (boxes of 20). 

The laser/light is a Barska kit and works great, mounts great, etc. It's quick-detach which is nifty. The reflex is sweet two, four reticle options, 5 brightness settings, red/green selection. Both accessories look and feel as though they were designed for this gun in particular.

Gun itself was $269.99
Reflex site was $79.99
Laser/Light was $79.99
Hardcase was $50.00

What I'm selling for;
Gun alone - $240
Gun + Reflex - $310
Gun + Lights - $320
Gun + Reflex and Lights - $370
Gun + Reflex, Lights and Hard Case - $400

All originally cost me +$490.00, as I said, nothing has been used (not even the attachments). I have all of the allen wrenches they came with, soft-cloths, etc. The only thing altered from original is the cutting out of the case-foam.

I have a 1940 Mosin Nagant 91/30 made at the Tula Arsenal.  It has been through the usual rearsenaling that most 91/30s have been through.  This particular one I upgraded with an adjustable front sight that allows the front sight post to be elevated. Front sight can be adjusted via a small hex screw. This considerably improved the accuracy, particularly with handloads.  This rifle has also had the bore polished with JB Bore Compound which reduces the notorious ""sticky bolt"" syndrome.

285,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3422285,For Sale:  32-40 Marlin Ballard Rifle (1 3/4 model) from late 1800s,"Western Racine County, Racine, Wisconsin","$ 2,050","Listed On: Monday, December 1, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Marlin Ballard rifle (MARLIN FIRE ARMS CO. NEW HAVEN CT, USA BALLARD'S PATENT, NOV 5 1861) from around 1889 or so.  

The rifle is in great shape given its age (see pictures).  It has a period accurate round barrel from GEO . C . SCHOYEN.

I had this rifle inspected by my gunsmith when I acquired it 6 or so years ago.  He test fired it and all was OK. 

The rifle has a set trigger, pop up rear elevation sight married with a hooded barrel band front sight (with crosshair).

The rifle comes with 40 rounds of 32-40 so that you can put the rifle back to the use for which it was intended instead of having it be a safe queen as it has for me.

Here is some other information about the Marlin Ballard:  23 distinct models and submodels of Ballard-design rifles were made by the Marlin factory. With so many follow-on variants, the Marlin Hunter became the Marlin No. 1 Hunter, then followed the No 1 1/2, Model 1 3/4, Model No. 2, and so on and so forth. These guns were designed for hard service and reliability with Rocky Mountain Sights, solid construction, and beefy stocks that could take abuse. They came in large calibers that included not only the very respectable .45-70, but also .45-100, .44-77 Sharps, and .40-90 Ballard. These rounds were extremely accurate at long range while still carrying a tremendous amount of energy downrange. As such, they were among the most popular big game guns of the late 19th and early 20th century and many a prospector, hunter, and homesteader carried them into the wilderness from Colorado to Alaska and felt better for it.

The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle. Like the other .22 LR firearms offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. The estimated retail price for the 416 pistol is $459.

Operation

A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK 416 Pistol. The dust cover functions and the bolt remains open when the magazine empties. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’."

Overview:

Custom-grade accuracy is now within reach of virtually every hunter. Using the expertise that's dominated bolt-action technology for more than 50 years, the engineering team started from scratch and combined their most advanced, accuracy-enhancing features to create an all-new platform. This sleek, hardworking tack-driver is even built differently. Now in Mossy Oak® Break-Up™ Infinity™ Camo Pattern.

Crafted in our newest manufacturing facility using proprietary methods that create the tightest tolerances from rifle to rifle, by the most efficient means possible. Perhaps the first thing you'll notice are the striking lines of the new stock design. Inside, it's a true performance-enhancer, with a dual-pillar bedding platform that free-floats the barrel for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. The black synthetic stock contains a high nylon fiber content which gives the stock superior strength and rigidity. Also helping deliver those inherently tight groups is a precision button-rifled barrel. For shot control, it's equipped with the crisp new CrossFire™ trigger system that's user adjustable to suit your preferences. The 783 features a steel detachable magazine with a steel latch. Standard calibers have a four round capacity and magnum calibers hold three rounds. Like with all Remington bolt actions, expect a lifetime of rock-solid reliability. From the next generation in a legendary bloodline. 

Key Features:
New CrossFire™ trigger system, factory set at 3 1/2 lbs. and user adjustable from 2 1/2 to 5 lbs.

Reason for selling: as a PCP rifle this thing requires a 200bar/2900psi charge in its integrated tank (~80 shots worth). Either a specialized floor pump or a scuba tank w/regulator & special fittings is required to charge this tank. I have neither and don't have enough interest to make that additional investment. Also I don't have the 2 rotary mags or the fill probe that would have come with the gun- about $70 purchased from pyramidair.com or from http://www.hatsanusa.com/parts/ Cylinder was charged when I got it and I've fired a few dozen rounds through it without a magazine so I can attest that it is in fully functional condition.

The PPQ M2 Navy is a true breakthrough in ergonomics for self-defense handguns. The styling is elegant and trim with a sculpted grip that meshes smoothly into the hand. The PPQ M2 has a reversible mag release button and an ambidextrous slide stop. The 'Quick Defense' trigger works in conjunction with a fully pre-loaded striker assembly. The trigger pull of 5.6 lbs remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. The PPQ M2 has two drop safeties and a firing pin block for safe carry. Because the firearm is in a constant cocked state, the striker does not protrude from the back of the slide. The polymer frame has interchangeable backstraps and an integral Picatinny Mil-Spec rail. It has low profile, 3-dot sights with a windage adjustable rear. The PPQ M2 has Tenifer-coated slide and 4.6"" threaded barrel. The gun also includes a flush fit 15 round mag, as well as an extended 17 rounder. We are also full line stocking dealer for Thompson Machine Suppressors if you are interested in a can.

The slide has textured paint on it which makes it look really ugly but makes the slide extremely easy to grip and cock and adds to the camo effect.

I'm getting rid of it because I do not like the .380 cartridge. I ran a box of ammo through this gun and it worked great but I prefer a .45 ACP for carry. I have no need for this gun.

These retail for $1800.00 

Internal parts are have residual graphite on them. 

The padlock is in great shape with minor stains, scuffs and marks from use. Please look at photos. There is some VERY MINOR finish missing from the shackle but it wont hender the security and integrity of the padlock in any way. 

This padlock has been designed to resist liquid nitrogen freeze attacks, prying attacks, torch attacks, cutting attacks, explosives attacks and most other forms of physical attack. The Medeco core utilizes special pins that must be lifted and rotated to proper positions in order to allow for the sidebar to retract and free the cylinder; unlocking it. The cylinder has ceramic inserts to help deter drilling attacks. This lock is virtually bump proof. I say virtually, because it is proven that MEDECO can be bumped open, but producing bump keys for medeco locks is a heck of a process that most ordinary people and locksmiths cannot commit to. 

This padlock will meet and surpass your security requirements.

                                              Nomenclature:
With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters."

In addition, the 26"" barrel has been cut from 26"" down to 22"" and a recessed target crown has been added.  Upon installation, the rifle was torqued back to Bell & Carlson factory specs.

Since owning the gun only factory Federal Gold Medal Match ammo and factory Hunting ammo has been shot through it.  I have all of the brass that has been shot through this rifle (260 rounds).   The gun has been cleaned and maintained.  If you are not familiar with the factory rifle it includes a matte varmint barrel and Bell & Carlson M40 fibrerglass stock.  I do have the original box as well as the factory X mark trigger that I will include for extra parts.  

In the picture the rifle is displayed with a Triad tactical adjustable stock pad, a Seekins Precision 20 MOA (#6) picatinny scope base, 160 rounds of once fired Federal GMM brass, 100 rounds of assorted once fired hunting ammo brass, badger bone , and cheap winchester bi-pod.  

I am asking $900.00 OBO for everything pictured.


I will sell the gun alone for $750.00 OBO with the Timmey trigger.  That is less than the MSRP of the rifle with a much better $125.00 trigger. (Includes rifle, box, x-mark trigger and currently installed Timney trigger).

I have a Armalite AR-24 ""Tactical Custom model,"" 9mm pistol for sale.
It has had maybe 500 rounds run through it. 
It is accurate and trouble free.
I bought it new in 2010 and fired 50- 100 rounds a year through it.
It is an all steel, full sized pistol with 15 round capacity and adjustable, 3 dot sights. It has a 4.8"" barrel, forged frame with checkered front and back strap and Sig 210 like slide, excellent beaver tail to prevent hammer bite for those with large hands. Rubber checkered grips. It can be carried ""Cocked and locked"" or hammer down in traditional double to single action semi auto style. Very CZ 75 like.
It has never been apart other than field stripped to be cleaned.
It shoots good and always works. It is an easy gun to shoot due to the low recoil/weight of an all steel gun but is not the best CCW (= big and heavy)
Super house, auto, range or belt holster gun.
I have noticed that although it works with what ever you feed it, it is at its best accuracy wise with 124 grain bullets
It has two magazines, box papers, warranty card cleaning kit. Everything it came with as new.
Overall condition is all but new. No marks or scratches. No finish wear other than the slightest on the hood and end of barrel. It's a really nice, dependable pistol."
