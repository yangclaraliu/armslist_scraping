A little bit about this run of Colts first. The commander was first made in 50 and sported a skeletonized slide and an all aluminum lower frame. This is the reason for the patina and two tone appearance to the gun. The first big production they did started in 1952, after the small run of I think less than 1000 that was done in 1951 and an even smaller number in 50. So this is a technically a first generation Commander if you want to term it as such. It is all original down to the grips and magazine that comes with it. I do not have the box or any documents to match. 

The gun itself is in great condition. The finish on the slide is a little rough, and can be seen in the pictures. Mechanically, the gun is in great shape. Has a clean bore and shoots like a Colt should. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask. Im asking $950.00. Please feel free to make offers, but i am not looking for trades at this time."

This compact leg rig is perfect for a day at the range, a training class or in the field when you want to run a low-profile set up. The combination of 2 Double Decker Tacos and an additional Pistol Taco between them gives you an endless number of applications. It is easily adjustable to your mission or training.

The Double Decker TACO® combines our modular rifle mag pouch and a modular pistol mag pouch into one secure unit. This unique pouch can securely hold an infinite combination of mags and other accessories. The original Taco® forms the base and USGI, HK, PMAG, ARC, FAL, AK 30/ 40, LR20 and M14 magazines are all held securely and deployed easily and silently on demand. The Taco® even works for certain radios, flash bangs and smoke grenades and provides this versatility while taking up only 3” horizontal inches on your platform.

On top, we attached a Pistol Taco®. This versatile pouch will hold almost any pistol magazine. Single stack, double stack. It makes no difference. 1911, HK 45, M9/Beretta 92, Glock, XD mags are all held securely . The Pistol Taco® can also hold a variety of multi-tools and flashlights.

All Taco® pouches are made of Cordura, an injection molded polymer and shock-cord. The pouches maintain a positive, adjustable grip of the mags and do not require any other securing systems unless desired. Webbing tabs are sewn in on the top for use of ""over the top"" bungee retainers (not included). Additional loop Velcro® is sewn in the inside of the rifle pouch if the user wishes to use adhesive backed hook velcro on his magazine body for added security.

The padded leg panel attaches to your belt in two places for comfort and function. The padded mesh back and rubberized leg strap ensure performance and stability. Running, jumping or lunging will not displace this panel from where you want it.

**Bi-Tone** Kel-Tec PF-9 9mm
Comes with original manufacturer box, papers and two extra mags(1 extended)

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

The Citori is more than a shotgun, it is the quintessential representative of the quality of the Browning brand. Wood-to-metal fit is paramount on the Citori and with tight, consistent junctions it doesn’t disappoint. Action components are machined to exacting tolerances, heat-treated for greater strength and fitted using the traditional lampblack-and-file method to ensure the precise fit of critical components prior to being assembled to the action. It is this extreme level of craftsmanship that leads to the dependable function, impeccable looks, championship performance and respect from both Citori owners and the competition alike.

I have shot it quite a bit but it needs a forearm. I have the tenon and forend tip though. Repros are like 40.00. Originals can also be found if you look.

It has a nice bore. Works great. Made around 1906 I suppose. The front sight is missing as I removed it. It was not original anyway and you can pick up a front aftermarket about anywhere that will work. I will even throw one on if you wish.

It is 100% fire able as is but the barrel does get warm without the forearm..

Good looking old Marlin and a great shooter grade.

I want 550.00 FIRM and may take a partial trade of another lesser valkue Firearm and cash too.. I can also add some ammo and handloading dies for a little extra too.

My camera is not the best. Coming to view it in person is the best anyway..

I was told the trigger is mechanical instead of inertia, so you can shoot the second barrell even with a FTF. It is definitely a nice trigger.  The gun has some honest wear on the wood and on the receiver, but nothing horrible or that you couldn't refinish if you had time in the dead of winter.  Included is a very nice custom case that is black with red accents. I just have a too many 12ga shotguns and I have been primarily shooting 28ga lately, so I am selling this to fund other rifle projects.  

Trade?  Maybe.  I could do full or partial trades, but it would have to be a precision rifle, either Remington 700 or Savage in a an accurate caliber.  6mm BR, 6mmx284, 6.5x284, maybe 6.5 Creedmoor, 280 Ackley Improved, 338 Norma Mag, 408 Cheytac or 375 Cheytac.  No interest in ballistic turds like 308 or 30-06 or 243 or 270.

Quality AR15 full uppers in 300 Black, 6.5 Grendel or 458 SOCOM would also be considered."

This rifle is a wonderful piece to anyones artillery. Please note that this rifle has had less than 300 rounds fired with  no jams. I am selling the semi-automatic rifle, 2 magazines, and 50 rounds for $700 or best offer. 

The Beretta Cx4 Storm semiautomatic carbine is a sporting or personal defense firearm with a particularly captivating appearance and simplicity of use. The blowback type locking system and the bolt safety ensure reliability, great stability and precision in follow up shot. The extractor, the ejector and the cocking handle are easily reversible for right and left hand use.

The manual safety button and the magazine release button can also be reversed from one side of the carbine to the other*. The cold hammer forged barrel is chrome lined and made of high resistance steel for maximum resistance to corrosion and increased barrel life.

Extensive use of technopolymers has allowed the development of a light and technically advanced firearm as well as equipping it with very modern an ergonomic lines.

Rounded forms are snag free, facilitating handling and rapid shouldering and aiming."

This is one of the best off of the shelve rifles that I have ever touched. Amazing trigger and control. This is one of the best Sig Sauer rifles ever produced. It is a Swiss design and one of the best piston systems ever invented.This is like a redesigned and much more refined Swiss made AK.the piston system is adjustable for more or less pressure 
depending on what kind of ammo you run.
-about 240 rounds through it. Sharp Shiny Bore
 -POF ghost ring and diopter sights
-  I shot this and then an HK 416 and decided to get this it was
I never get to use this rifle and it has been just sitting barely used and I need cash. I hate to see it go but I need other things more right now.
- 1 in 7 twist rate 5.56 16 and 1/2 inch barrel
-super accurate even with iron sights only
- side charge just like an AK
-Swiss style furniture
-2 point sling with two point  end plate
-Magpul pistol grip and trigger guard installed
-This is one of the nicer ones that did not get recalled.
-Almost no  wear but since the shell deflector is part of the receiver and no lug, the -----finish wears just behind the ejection port but perfect otherwise that little spot tends to wear fast but in no way effects the way it shoots That is the only blemish on this gun. I've never seen one that didn't have that.I put it large in the pics.
-The bolt and bore look untouched
-The lower receiver is milled alloy as where the upper is SS.
-chrome lined barrel with sharp,shiny bore
-under 200 rounds through it and you can inspect it and see that it has just been sitting in the safe.
-Piston driven which is basically a redesigned AK piston and bolt plus dual spring recoil
-Very smooth action
Has been called the best piston system ever.
-accepts all AR/M-16 magazines.
-60 round surefire magazine only fitted, never used.
-gen 3 40 and 30 round Pmags included along with a 2nd gen windowed Pmag, one Sig mag
-150 rounds of 5.56 L.C. brass-new
-Brass catcher-new
-and more.
-New in box green laser sight

Up for sale is my Hornady Lock 'n' Load Auto Progressive Press. I have had this press for approx. 6 months now. Due to me obtaining a job that requires me to travel 3 weeks a month minimum, I have lost the majority of my free time I spent at the range. For the very few times I get to shoot its more ideal for me to just buy a couple hundred rounds every 4-6 months now where before I was shooting 2k rounds a month easy.

This setup is absolutely everything you need for the ultimate reloading experience. It comes with all the high end accessories such as a dillon case trimmer for trimming long neck cases (such as the .223/5.56) completely automated in one of the 5 stages of the press. you can hook up a shopvac to the trimmer to collect all metal shavings for a mess free experience.

I also include a (guestimate) 250Lb reloading table that is heavily reinforced that i spent approx 200$ building. I actually stood on the table and lightly jumped on it (im 210lbs) and it didnt bow the slightest bit. It will be able to handle all your reloading pressure. It has a raiser made for the press so the lever is ideal arm height when sitting in a normal computer/office chair.

The Nagant M1895 Revolver is a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire. The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62×38mmR, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile and allowing the weapon to be suppressed (an unusual ability for a revolver).

I installed Harrison Design night sights on it and will include the original sights as well. I take excellent care of my guns, just ask anyone who's bought one from me. There's no idiot mark, but there may be a light mark or two in the parkerized finish, though after oiling it I couldn't find any. There are a couple small marks in the dovetail where I slid the new front sight in. I rarely carried it and when I did it was in a leather holster so it has virtually no holster wear. I'm asking $850 (night sights weren't cheap, nor was tax). Need to have WA DL, CPL, and bill of sale for my records since I bought it new.

It's got 4 different reticles to choose from (single dot, crosshairs, circle with dot, and circle with dot inside crosshairs) and 7 different power levels. It works fine, no scratches or dings ect. Lens cover is included and one battery. It goes for about $60 brand new. I'd take $40 for it but I'm really more interested in a trade. Things like a picatinny rail that'll fit a mossberg 500 or maybe some small to medium sized traps. Or hell I'm interested in all kinds of odd ball hunting/fishing things so just shoot me an offer.

I purchased this P226R back in 2012 as the tacpac. Cost nearly 1200 then. Last year I sent it off to Bruce Gray who does some of the best custom Sig work in the US. He set me up with his short reset and lighter competition trigger and upgraded the extractor spring. I got it back and shot 300 rounds. Loved it but needed more done. So I sent it to TJcustomgunworks. There they did a whole package of reduced recoil spring, shortening the ejector, custom hammer spring, reduced weight, deburred the slide and made it smooth as can possible be to rack the slide. Also polished and deburred the feed ramp. Total cost of work done on the gun with parts close to another 1000. Only 600 rounds shot. Price is firm and no trades will be considered at all. Price is set at $1000. I also have for sale in Arizona. Pics will be sent only through text in order to make sure buyers are serious. Thanks.

I'm selling this one cause i picked up another a few weeks ago and i plan to upgrade it and use for competition. Sale includes custom kydex holster, 3 mags, and the sig tacpac holster. Gun is in great condition with signs of wear on the barrel from shooting 600 rounds.

2013 Upgrades for TRG22/42

Recoil Pad

2013 upgrade introduces an improved recoil pad. Our proprietary pad is a combination of a new material and construction which significantly reduces felt recoil. The new recoil pad provides better recoil management and adds to the comfort allowing extended sessions at the range, even with the heavier calibers.

Bolt Release

Newly constructed bolt release adds to the overall ruggedness of the TRG platform. Care-free and reliable operation is guaranteed even when extreme force is applied on the bolt release while cycling the bolt. The new bolt release is featured in all TRG 22/42 configurations

Trigger Mechanism and Bolt Handle

New fully adjustable two stage trigger mechanism featuring newly designed and ergonomically positioned and ambidextrous safety lever allowing easier access and use. Trigger guard is now milled from high grade aluminum, providing ruggedness and more positive magazine attachment. Bolt handle and it's attachment to the bolt body has been redesigned to withstand rough handling more than ever before. And as usual, the new trigger mechanism as well as all other 2013 upgrades are compatible with all TRG 21/41 and TRG 22/42 versions."

The 4506 is a traditional double-action/single-action pistol. The first shot is fired in double action mode. Each subsequent shot is fired single action mode. It features one-piece Xenoy wrap-around grips with either a curved or straight back strap. The 4506 was produced from 1988 to 1999.

Like most 3rd generation Smith and Wesson semi automatic pistols, the 4506 features a combination safety lever and decocker mounted on the slide, a plunger type firing pin safety, a magazine disconnect and a pin mounted, pivoting spring actuated external extractor.""

Note: this will not make your gun full auto

Are you building Rifles? Why not put the best parts in for your customers? Carbon build up is virtually eliminated with this coating. If you need only one let me know. If you’re looking for the finest BCG on the market today, search no more! Nickel Boron has proven itself to be the most durable finish on the market. It’s much smoother than Hard Chrome, it’s easier to clean, makes the rifle cycle smoother, it can be run almost lube free for thousands of rounds, and it will never chip, peal, or flake off! Because of these benefits, Nickel Boron is being adopted by the Military as well as many Government agencies. As you can see, these BCGs are a huge improvement over a standard Phosphate BCG and it’s even an improvement over Hard Chrome. Upgrade to a better BCG today. You won’t be sorry! This BCG works in AR-15s semi auto or fully auto. This BCG does NOT make your rifle fully-automatic.

The PK380 is not just good looking. It is small and good looking. That makes the PK380 excellent for concealed carry. Its small grip is ideal for shooters with small hands. The slide is easy to operate, making it a good choice for women. The light weight goes unnoticed in a pocket or purse. Credit Walther Performance Design for another hit. Small is indeed beautiful.

REMINGTON 870 EXPRESS 12GA 18"" Tactical SpeedBead OPTIC  

Custom REM 870 EXPRESS 12GA utility gun featuring an 18"" fixed Cylinder choke barrel, single front bead sight, non-glare matte finish and 5-shot capacity M4 style adjustable folding stock. Storage in pistol grip and stock.

The sight alone is $250, plus the stock is $230 plus the remington brand shotgun. This does not include installation time and fitting. Priced fairly.

Installed:

Burris Speed Bead.

The radical SpeedBead System handles many of the factors that make wingshooters miss, and turns poor shooters into good shooters and good shooters into great ones. With the SpeedBead System, both the target and the red dot remain in focus. The optics and their position on the sight plane eliminate the need for perfect left/right, up/down head position for an accurate shot. The innovative mount puts the center of the optic directly in line with the ventilated rib, so altering your shooting style is not necessary. And with 3-1/2 inches to 4-1/2 inches of eye relief, there is absolutely no worry about your eyebrow running into the sight nor any interference with your hand gripping the shotgun. Should the common CR-2032 five year battery ever fail, you can revert to your front bead without visual obstruction. For a better view on rising targets, there are 1/8 and 1/4 risers available. Windage tool included.

Original stock included.

Walmart, Bi-Mart, Sportsman's Warehouse, Dick's, Big-R and all other LEGIT big-box retail stores are not gouging so why play into this crap?

Since no one has the ballz to say it-- i will:

I can see paying $35 per brick for someone to stand in line for you, but co-mon! REALLY?!?!?!?! 300% markup is friggin insane.... talk about take advantage... and your not helping the situation AT ALL! either by selling at these insane prices, or BUYING at these insane prices and encouraging the gougers.

I dont care if thats what gunbroker.com and gunbot.net and other online retailers have them for sale also at insane prices.... they are gouging people and taking advantage of the situation just like you armslist 'dealers' and 'personal sellers' out there. And you dont even post your ammo in the ammo section - you also post it in the firearms section for people to see! I could also rant about the delusional prices on most of your firearms too (especial charging above-new prices for USED firearms) but ill save that for another day....

/spoiler alert
I have seen all of you standing in the same lines as me EVERY Thursday at 9am at Sportsman's Warehouse to get my weekly ration given out to the public vultures, and you don't see me listing my crap on here now do you? and if you did... i don't gouge!

Email me with others if you know of them so we can take away from the gougers and ill post them here 
/end spoiler alert (i will add more spoilers as i think of them and find them)(or any corrections)

So, until i see Walmart, Bi-Mart and the other big-box retail stores start to jack their prices WAY WAY up, then this is WRONG!

.... and I KNOW FOR A FACT your 'dealers' and gougers out there did not pay $75 per brick! I hope you choke on it.

... and by the way... I have all the bricks of 22lr I need to last thru this bad situation... and i paid avg price of $23 per brick. I waited in lines just like YOU!

PS) keep on emailing me with your butt-hurt remarks with your real email addresses... i have tons of junk email sites to sign you up on..... in the meantime, i will continue to bump this listing back to the top every few days and DO MY PART IN RAISING AWARENESS!

2013 Upgrades for TRG22/42

Recoil Pad
2013 upgrade introduces an improved recoil pad. Our proprietary pad is a combination of a new material and construction which significantly reduces felt recoil. The new recoil pad provides better recoil management and adds to the comfort allowing extended sessions at the range, even with the heavier calibers.

Bolt Release
Newly constructed bolt release adds to the overall ruggedness of the TRG platform. Care-free and reliable operation is guaranteed even when extreme force is applied on the bolt release while cycling the bolt. The new bolt release is featured in all TRG 22/42 configurations

Trigger Mechanism and Bolt Handle
New fully adjustable two stage trigger mechanism featuring newly designed and ergonomically positioned and ambidextrous safety lever allowing easier access and use. Trigger guard is now milled from high grade aluminum, providing ruggedness and more positive magazine attachment. Bolt handle and it's attachment to the bolt body has been redesigned to withstand rough handling more than ever before. And as usual, the new trigger mechanism as well as all other 2013 upgrades are compatible with all TRG 21/41 and TRG 22/42 versions."

2013 Upgrades for TRG22/42

Recoil Pad
2013 upgrade introduces an improved recoil pad. Our proprietary pad is a combination of a new material and construction which significantly reduces felt recoil. The new recoil pad provides better recoil management and adds to the comfort allowing extended sessions at the range, even with the heavier calibers.

Bolt Release
Newly constructed bolt release adds to the overall ruggedness of the TRG platform. Care-free and reliable operation is guaranteed even when extreme force is applied on the bolt release while cycling the bolt. The new bolt release is featured in all TRG 22/42 configurations
Trigger Mechanism and Bolt Handle

New fully adjustable two stage trigger mechanism featuring newly designed and ergonomically positioned and ambidextrous safety lever allowing easier access and use. Trigger guard is now milled from high grade aluminum, providing ruggedness and more positive magazine attachment. Bolt handle and it's attachment to the bolt body has been redesigned to withstand rough handling more than ever before. And as usual, the new trigger mechanism as well as all other 2013 upgrades are compatible with all TRG 21/41 and TRG 22/42 versions."
