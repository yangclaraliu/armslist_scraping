I posted this shotgun some time ago and had many inquires.
But never sold the shotgun because I was concerned if the gun fired correctly.
I purchased shells and tried firing some rounds, the gun shot fine but will not eject the shell?
The shell gets stuck every time half way every time ejecting.
I did not sell because I did not feel good selling this way thinking I may just have repairerd?
Anyway, I have no time with the house and job to do this.
I AM DROPPING THE PRICE TO $400 as is. Or will consider another working shotgun, double barrel would be nice.
I have no paperwork on this gun. 
Thank you


I was given a A5 16 gauge recently from a family member prior to moveing from Massachusetts to Trenton Nc.

This is to much gun for my needs.
I know little about the shotgun, but it's in good condition. 
Stock has normal wear, could be blued but it's not bad and could be used as is.
I have done a little homework on the gun:
Because it has no decorative scrolling on the gun it should be pre 1937. Browning did not start scrolling decorative designs until 1937, this is only what I have been able to look up?
Not the gold trigger, and has the forward safety."

So I'm out of pocket between 1750-1800$ on this one. I'm not looking to get that for it, but I'll not be giving it away either. Serious inquiries only no tire kickers please do some research before offering. I will not travel outside the charleston area. I may entertain trades with cash to boot-or maybe a multi gun/item trade-no shotguns or hunting rifles though, and no .22(I'm boycotting that crap). 
Just to clarify-here is the cash value I'm looking to get-
810$- for the upper with rails, 5.56 barrel setup, and sights(not optional)less the bcg/ch/conversion
950$- with bcg/ch no conversion 
1500$-complete package(I would rather keep the conversion)"

After doing some reading on it I found out that the VEPR 12 as well as the Saiga 12 can be picky on what kind of ammo is used it in and may need some fine tuning to shoot the cheap stuff.  The prob seems to be  that the casing on cheap ammo tends to be on the soft side and that is a prob for semi auto shotguns.  Anyways as I was saying I'm not into shotguns don't really know much about the ammo for them and just being up front to what I found out.

I have, for sale or trade, a Sig P250C in .40 S&W.  It comes with the original case and I bought a second 13 round magazine for it.  The bottom of the mag is marked with glow-in-the-dark paint so it can be located if it's your nightstand gun.  

If you are not familiar with the model, the P250's fire control group is the serial numbered and traced part of the gun.  Any FCG can be assembled into a full size, compact or subcompact and is available in .380, 9mm, .357 Sig, .40 S&W and .45ACP.  You can assemble it with a compact slide on a subcompact grip module if you want barrel length without sacrificing concealability.  There are also spacers available if you want to purchase a full size mag and want to use it in a compact grip module.  The grip modules are cheap, so if you decide to ""re-texture"" and don't like how it came out, you can buy another grip module for, at the most, $50 from Sig and you're literally, good as new.  It is a Double Action Only with a smooth, light pull.  There is a short-pull trigger available.  This gun does not have one installed, but they're available for about $35.

These guns all came with a single magazine. For the compact .40/.357 Sig it is 13 rounds.  I like having a second magazine, so I bought another mag.  Anyone who knows Sig, knows they're proud of their magazines and Mec Gar doesn't make one for this model of gun.  An extra magazine is around $50.  

I'm not going to say this gun is Like New.  It's not.  It has also not been shot out.  The rifling in the barrel is still crisp and shiny.  The top of the barrel shows wear.  The top of the portion outside of the chamber is no longer black.  I have a number of additional detailed photos and can take more if there's anything you want to see.  It has plenty of life in it and it's a Sig. They design and build a top notch pistol, then they support it well.  

Most of all, I would prefer to trade and if the gun I'm getting is in prettier condition, I am willing to add cash, ammo or reloading powder to the deal.  When calculating the value of what I am trading, I want to make sure the second magazine is taken into consideration because they're not cheap.  I am willing to ship to an FFL at your expense, but it is ultimately your job to make sure it is legal for you to own.  If you live in a state that limits magazine capacity, we can negotiate on that point.  If you get denied on your NICS check, we'll need to discuss a resolution."

I have, for sale or trade, a Sig P2022 in .40 S&W. It comes with the original case, large & medium grips, holster and I bought two 12 round magazines for it. The bottom of each mag is marked with glow-in-the-dark paint so it can be located if it's your nightstand gun. 

If you are not familiar with the model, they were made in Double/Single action and DAO.  This one is Double/Single.  It is very ergonomic and points instinctively.  It has a de-cocking lever and an adjustable angle and retention magazine.

These guns all came with a single magazine. For the compact .40/.357 Sig it is 12 rounds. I like having additional magazines, so I bought two more. Anyone who knows Sig, knows they're proud of their magazines and Mec Gar doesn't make one for this model of gun. An extra magazine is around $50. 

I'm not going to say this gun is Like New. It's not. I would say that it is broken in.  It has been cleaned after firing and properly stored.  The finish on the barrel (the finish wears off the barrel first) is still intact. The rifling in the barrel is still crisp and shiny.  I have a number of additional detailed photos and can take more if there's anything you want to see. It has plenty of life in it and it's a Sig. They design and build a top notch pistol, then they support it well. 

Most of all, I would prefer to trade and if the gun I'm getting is worth more, I am willing to add cash, ammo or reloading powder to the deal. When calculating the value of what I am trading, I want to make sure the additional magazines are taken into consideration because they're not cheap."

Sighted in with 6 rounds, cleaned and put away in the vault. I've got too many lever actions and it's time for this one to be adopted out to a new owner. I've checked on these that have sold in the last 18 months and have seen anywhere from $599 to $900. I'm throwing this out for $500 obo. That is only because I don't have the box. I know...how could I have lost the box to such an awesome piece of Connecticut steel? Beats me but it's gone. No trades as I have other projects going. Cash and I'd rather not ship.

Cleaning out several unused but almost new rifle scopes.

Item for auction is a lightly used Pentax Gameseeker III 8.5-32 X  50mm Rifle Scope w/ nice QD mount. Original Retail was $150 to $175. It has only been used several times at the range only and does not meet my needs. This scope is in AS NEW condition, but relatively speaking, is an inexpensive scope, not really suitable for sub MOA accuracy beyond 100 yards. 

Pros: This scope is good as new. Good for daylight use at medium range to 100yards. AO adjustment is good. The QD scope mount is very good but needs tightening with small wrench for optimal tightness. 

Cons: Factory new is not great. Magnification and light intake is good up to about 24x then tends to cloud progressively moving up to 32x. Using a 7.62mm the Zero occasionally drifts.

I would recommend it for a 2.23 / 5.56mm or smaller, at medium range.  If that is your intended use, then this scope is for you."

This listing includes the slide, barrel, grip module and Not One, But TWO thirteen round magazines.  The gun and all of the caliber exchange kits came with one magazine.  I prefer to have two, so I paid the $50 for another mag.  Mec Gar doesn't make magazines for this model and nothing else is compatible, so there aren't a lot of choices.

I won't say that this kit is Like New.  it's not.  It has seen use.  It's not broken down at all.  The rifling in the barrel is crisp and bright.  Unfortunately, so are a couple of places on the top of the barrel.  The slide doesn't show any wear because the finish is tough.  The grip is polymer.  It may have a scuff or two, but nothing that affects utility.  I have lots of photos (more than there are room for, so if you want detailed shots, let me know.  I'll send them).  

I have a bunch of .40 as well.  One box of Blazer Brass ammo comes with the kit (or the gun) If we're trading, it can go toward the trade.  If you;re buying it outright, you might want to get a supply of ammo at the same time (for additional cost).

The gun is also available as a complete gun under another ad on this site.  If this ad is still up, the kit or the complete gun is available.  The price is negotiable and is just a starting point.  As long as I can get what I want with what I get paid for this gun, it's all good."

When I jacked it up to fix it, I discovered one if the four engine cradle mounting points had broken. $350 OBO, or trade for two wheels, or things that expend ammunition.
Good:
Brand new battery this summer, front tires under 2k miles, rear tires under 1k miles, that's 600 dollars right there. Frame is straight and aligned when tires were installed.
Upper intake manifold went bad at 150k miles, very common defect of otherwise bulletproof engine, replaced with new. Another 550 repair.
New water pump before I figured out it was the manifold.
Lights all work as they should, windows, locks, tranny, a/c, heat.
Bad:
Brake lines still need replaced, engine cradle needs reatttached at the one point or replaced. I haven't the tools and equipment for it, nor the money for a shop. Connecting rod between wiper motor and wipers broken. I used RainX and didnt care. Cosmetic damage to two body panels.

Last bad is the worst, car will have to be a parts only vehicle. Due to a three month stint of unemployment, WI put a lien on my title for back child support. Basically meaning I can't sell it normally. So my options are to scrap it or sell it for parts. Selling for parts will put a lot more towards paying it off, of course, and would help me the most."

The Holographic Hybrid Sight I (HHS I) features an EXPS3-4 with a G33.STS magnifier. It has great utility for any shooter, whose target ranges vary from close to far. The HHS I provides a solution for engaging threats in close-quarter combat situations, then quickly transitions to a 600-meter targeting or surveillance situation. A quick switch-to-side (STS) mount offers simple, fast disengagement of the G33 magnifier.
The durable, night-vision-compatible system offers wide-field optical performance with superior light transmission for visibility in extreme low-light conditions.

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.
