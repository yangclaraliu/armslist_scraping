The place is like candy land for people like us. He had pretty much every brand of 22LR there is(Federal, CCI, Remington, Wolf, etc). And all at really reasonable prices. Way less than the fat POS Dennis has his priced at. You know,  the loser Dennis of DK Shooting Supplies that is listed as a  ""dealer"" in his ads. The same ""dealer"" you'll find at Walmart with his friends buying the Federal bricks for $23 and then charging you $65 a brick when he gets home. I mean gets back to his ""dealer store""/mom's basement. But seriously, I drove 35 min to DD's and it was well worth the trip. The owner is nice and his shop is awesome. So if you're looking for 22LR or anything else....make the trip. You won't be sorry you did. I'll be doing all my purchases with him from now on. And definitely go there if you're looking for a badass long gun. He isn't gonna sell you nothing that is gonna get you in trouble.  And he knows the laws if you are unsure about anything. Basically...great store, owner and inventory.  Just figured I'd put a positive post up for you guys for a change. Not 1 reason to do business with a fat troll when there's a legit shop out there that isn't trying to rip you off and take advantage of you. Everyone have a good weekend....except for Dennis/Butt crack magee. I hope you choke on 1 of the 37 McDonald's value meals you buy this weekend."

Bore is very good, shiny with decent lands and grooves. Nice stock underneath the shellac. (Which can be easily removed without much effort as its flaking off). Not sure if the stock is made from Walnut or Oak.
RC info; ""X"" Stamped on the receiver. There is flat black paint applied to the metal parts. The stock is covered in that awful Russian shellac.

I'll also throw in a left handed OWB holster.

More info:
The Glock 36 is a six-round, .45 caliber subcompact semi-automatic pistol designed for carry-and-conceal use. The Glock 36 is a “slimline” version of the Glock 30 that features a compact slide and frame chambered for .45 ACP cartridges. The first pistol to be manufactured with a single-stack magazine, the Glock 36 is only 1.3” wide making it hard to see and giving it minimal recoil, making it easy to shoot.

The Glock 36 also features a Safe Action trigger system that combines a trigger safety, trigger bar, and firing pin lock that automatically deactivate one after another as the trigger engages."

The only issue with these rifles is cosmetic, the barrels weren't stored properly and need to be heated and cleaned (reblued), the interior of the barrels are completely cleaned and ready to fire, they have no issues firing, I just put a few hundred rounds through them both recently to make sure, then I cleaned them again.

It's a constant process.

If you're looking for a REALLY COOL pellet gun, this is it!!!
Not many guns can fire pellets semi auto, this one can...and it does it FAST with a great trigger!
I get at least 80 shots per cartridge that I consider powerful enough to be useful useful, more if hitting paper.
This gun retails for over 120 dollars, and I'm willing to part with this one for $80 obo.


Here are some specs:
The GAMO MP-9 is a real replica from the B&T MP-9 9mm submachine weapon. MP-9 is a light weight,small size, folding stock airgun. The realistic tactical design from B&T, velocity of up to 450 fps, dual technology (pellet and metal BB's) and semiauto mechanism, make this airgun and excellent choice.


    Gamo MP9 submachine gun
    Semiauto
    Uses a 12-gram CO2 cartridge
    16rd magazine holds pellets or steel BBs
    Single-/double-action
    9.46 lbs. trigger-pull in double-action, 9.24 lbs. in single-action
    Fixed front sight
    Windage-adjustable rear sight
    Authentic blowback action
    Locking, folding buttstock (12"" to 21"" overall length)
    Up to 80 shots per CO2 cartridge


Do not use with long-skirted pellets, which may damage the gun's magazine. Long-skirted pellets include but are not limited to: Red Fire, Blue Flame, Glow Fire, PBA Bullet, Magnum, Master Point, Rocket or TS-10.

A replica of the B+T (Brugger + Thomet) MP9 9x19 SMG (a Swiss manufacturer), Gamo's MP9 gives you all the fun but with less noise and much cheaper, more plentiful ammo. Shoot either steel BBs or lead pellets. Delivers 8 shots in less than 1 second!"
