All original Beretta parts were kept, and I still have them along with a Smith and Wesson M&P blue box that I had lying around that the pistol will go with when it sells.

The trigger components have been surface polished only to provide a smooth single and double action pull. DA comes in around 7 and SA comes in to 4 pounds. The pull can be lightened more if you choose to remove hammer/sear material, however I did not. 

I do not currently have the box for it, it looks like it got lost when I moved. This gun is in very nice condition and has had less than 100 rounds through it. There are a few marks on it (very small, I couldn't grab photos of them) that I will gladly show you if you choose to buy it. They were caused buy just getting bumped when I pulled other guns in/out of my safe.

Long story short, the Palmettso State Armory lower was bought nearly 2 years ago and sat in the closet. Early this year, it was fitted with a melonite treated 16"" 1-7 twist Tapco upper, due to the superior qualities of melonite treating (vs chromelining or stainless steel). Rifle has a Magpul MOE hand-grip, but can be replaced with a standard USGI M16 grip if desired. Rifle will be sold with 1 mag, as shown.

About melonite treating:

""Meloniting (nitro-carburizing) is a heat treat process for barrels that hardens the barrel to apx. 70 Rockwell so they last longer, are more corrosion resistant inside and out, and also decreases friction in the barrel which can increase velocity. Chrome lined barrels can decrease accuracy, as it is a built-up layer of material inside the barrel. Nitro-carburizing changes the structure of the metal itself without building a layer in the bore, therefore increasing performance but not decreasing accuracy. Melonite treated barrels have proven to last 30% longer than chrome lined barrels, and are more accurate.""

Rifles sells for $700 or best offer. Only reason I am selling is to fund a port job and a nice scope for my new 45-70 deer rifle. Located in Henry County, and will only sell to individuals legal to own this firearm. Please contact REDACTED or email REDACTED for inquiries."

Sig Sauer gave the discreet, all-metal P238 platform some 9mm muscle, and the result is the P938: the first 1911-inspired 9mm microcompact by SIG SAUER®. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever all in familiar places.
A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 can pack six or seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame.
Sig Sauer has included both a 6-round (flush fit) and 7-round (extended) magazine with a finger-grip extension. In addition, this P938 also comes equipped with a SIG laser.

Original 22re motor and transmission. It's also an automatic which they did not make many auto with 22r motor.

 There is some rust on the rear quarter panels but nothing that can't be fixed.

 Previous owner took the carpet out painted the floors black and installed a new heavy black primed hood.

The only couple things that are a maybe concern for some people is the hose for the ac blew (but ac compressor works) and the air controls are hard to move and need to be replaced, and the inside button for the rear window does not work. That has never bothered me as I just used the key on the tailgate to roll it up and down.

The Tracking Point Rifle Scope System features:

Tag-and-Shoot: Tag-and-Shoot is how a shooter actually uses a Precision-Guided Firearm. The shooter puts the reticle on the intended point of impact, presses the tag button, and then pulls the trigger when he has moved on to the designated point of impact. The Precision-Guided Firearm does the rest.

TriggerLink: TriggerLink is an electronic connection between the tracking optic and the guided trigger. The tracking optic communicates with the guided trigger to ensure that the round is released at the precise moment required to make an extraordinary shot.
Permanent Zero: The shooter never again has to worry about whether his gun is properly zeroed. The Precision-Guided Firearm’s laser-based barrel reference system maintains a permanent, factory-set, perfect zero for every shot. It’s unaffected by shock, vibration, or other environmental factors.
Virtual Rest: Virtual Rest makes off-hand shots as easy as shooting from a stable rest. The Precision-Guided Firearm image is stabilized, so you can Tag-and-Shoot™ moving or stationary targets at extreme distances from an off-hand position.
Heads Up Display: HUD is the digital display that shows the field of view. The key user-interface between the shooter and the Precision-Guided Firearm, the HUD displays vital pieces of data including range-to-target, target velocity, shot angle, compass heading, gun cant, battery status, WiFi status, wind velocity and direction, kill zone size, ammunition type, temperature, barometric pressure, and time of day.

ShotView: The ShotView app streams real-time video from the Precision-Guided Firearm to a ShotGlass™ on the Recon Jet™ wearable, smart phone, or tablet. It’s ideal for communication in hunting and target shooting applications. Friends, colleagues, or fellow soldiers can see what the shooter sees in his tracking optic.

Average Launch Time: 2.4 seconds

Power: Dual Lithium Batteries

Operating Time: 4 hours

I have the box, catalog & mag that it came with that will come with it. This is true Noveske through and through and was purchased when John was still alive and making great rifles. The rifle is legal length at 16"" as it came from the factory with the pin welded on AAC 51T mount for anyone that might have an AAC Suppressor and also the BCM med tac latch. You will notice that there is a red Magpul  sticker on the side which can easily be taken off and have no remnants left over that it was even there. The lower and upper are the standard M4 variation before they went to the newer gen II/III models. Nothing wrong with this rifle at all, I just need the cash for another project. No trades at this time and I have no issue meeting in the southwest Ohio area but I will be making a receipt and/or copying license infor for the transaction. An Ohio CCW license would be great. If you live outside of this area, the rifle will be shipped from my ffl to yours as long as you are allowed to own these rifles in your state. Check your local city/state laws before buying.

I removed the magazine disconnect to improve the trigger and make it so you can fire the round in the pipe if the mag is removed, among other improvements.  I will provide the original parts to re-assemble the mag disconnect, but it is MUCH nicer without it.  I recommend doing a Google search on this subject if you are unfamiliar with what I am talking about.

I believe this is a Belgian police trade-in, but could be Israeli. Comes with one factory original 13 rd magazine and original lanyard ring.  All serial numbers are matching.

I may be willing to trade, feel free to make an offer.  Specifically I am interested in an AK and would be willing to add cash for the right offer.

NOTE: I realized that I am missing the pin that fits in the trigger.  Its sole purpose is to hold the mag disconnect in place. They are less than $5 if you want to re-install the mag disconnect, otherwise it is completely unecessary and pointless.  Feel free to Google search this subject if you are unfamiliar with what I am referring to. This gun shoots much smoother without it anyway."

I apologize to anyone who may have emailed about this when I originally posted it about 2 weeks ago. Due to a higher than expected volume of business at work over the holidays I became stretched very thin and did not have the chance to get back to you guys. If any of you are still interested, please give me a shout (except those that only wrote 'still available?')

If the ad is up I still have it. Not in a rush to sell just seldom shoot it and would rather have the cash and let someone else enjoy it. All the emails asking only if it is still available will be ignored. Cannot get pics to post right side up. Can text/email pics upon request.

Greatly prefer email or text. Can respond fairly quickly through email or text during the day while at work. If you call, please leave a message with your name and number and I will get back to you as soon as I can once I wrap up the work day.  REDACTED

The Tracking Point Rifle Scope System features:

Tag-and-Shoot: Tag-and-Shoot is how a shooter actually uses a Precision-Guided Firearm. The shooter puts the reticle on the intended point of impact, presses the tag button, and then pulls the trigger when he has moved on to the designated point of impact. The Precision-Guided Firearm does the rest.

TriggerLink: TriggerLink is an electronic connection between the tracking optic and the guided trigger. The tracking optic communicates with the guided trigger to ensure that the round is released at the precise moment required to make an extraordinary shot.
Permanent Zero: The shooter never again has to worry about whether his gun is properly zeroed. The Precision-Guided Firearm’s laser-based barrel reference system maintains a permanent, factory-set, perfect zero for every shot. It’s unaffected by shock, vibration, or other environmental factors.
Virtual Rest: Virtual Rest makes off-hand shots as easy as shooting from a stable rest. The Precision-Guided Firearm image is stabilized, so you can Tag-and-Shoot™ moving or stationary targets at extreme distances from an off-hand position.
Heads Up Display: HUD is the digital display that shows the field of view. The key user-interface between the shooter and the Precision-Guided Firearm, the HUD displays vital pieces of data including range-to-target, target velocity, shot angle, compass heading, gun cant, battery status, WiFi status, wind velocity and direction, kill zone size, ammunition type, temperature, barometric pressure, and time of day.

ShotView: The ShotView app streams real-time video from the Precision-Guided Firearm to a ShotGlass™ on the Recon Jet™ wearable, smart phone, or tablet. It’s ideal for communication in hunting and target shooting applications. Friends, colleagues, or fellow soldiers can see what the shooter sees in his tracking optic.

Well built. Brass, walnut and blued. With nice case coloring. Tiny pitting here and there if you look at extreme magnification. These guns were not prone to the spider fire and other dangers with timing issues of the 70s to 80s Pietta's and Uberti revolvers. While they are all typically made pretty nice, the Euroarms guns were known to be of great quality and overbuilt kind of like an Italian Ruger. The timing on this gun is still excellent and with a nice trigger. Does have some minor scuffing and a little bit of blueing wear towards the muzzle.

728,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3787728,"For Sale:  Seekins Precision Tunable Upper 15""MCSR Keymod Rail","knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 500,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 13, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Competition/suppressor ready brand new Seekins Precision AR15 upper with 15"" MCSR V2 Keymod rail and adjustable gas block. This is a high quality factory upper built by Seekins Precision. The 16"" barrel is Black Nitride / melonite treated which is more accurate and lasts longer than chrome lining. The extremely lightweight 15"" MCSR V2 Keymod rail is over $200 alone and has a 1.8"" inside diameter to accommodate suppressors. The Seekins adjustable gas block is another $60 and offers you complete tuning capabilities (see below). 

This upper should shoot a 1 inch group if you can. Throw this on any lower with a decent trigger and have a competition level rifle built by one of the top quality manufacturers in the industry. $500 takes it. 

For another $100 I will include a brand new $150 Seekins Precision Black Nitride full milspec M16 bolt carrier group and charging handle.  

From the manufacturer:

The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block lets you to fine tune your rifle's gas system for smoother cycling and operation. Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.
Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes.

The MCSR V2 rail is a comfortable, extremely light weight modular rail system that will work in any situation as well as comfortably fit a suppressor inside the rail. The MCSR V2 was designed to make using a quick mounted suppressor easy to install or remove while inside the rail.
The MCSR V2 rail is designed so that the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions will now accept all keymod accessories and have two anti-rotation QD positions per side (6total). the internal dimension of the MCSR V2 has increased to 1.8"" to accommodate most suppressors on the market."

The Tracking Point Rifle Scope System features:

Tag-and-Shoot: Tag-and-Shoot is how a shooter actually uses a Precision-Guided Firearm. The shooter puts the reticle on the intended point of impact, presses the tag button, and then pulls the trigger when he has moved on to the designated point of impact. The Precision-Guided Firearm does the rest.

TriggerLink: TriggerLink is an electronic connection between the tracking optic and the guided trigger. The tracking optic communicates with the guided trigger to ensure that the round is released at the precise moment required to make an extraordinary shot.
Permanent Zero: The shooter never again has to worry about whether his gun is properly zeroed. The Precision-Guided Firearm’s laser-based barrel reference system maintains a permanent, factory-set, perfect zero for every shot. It’s unaffected by shock, vibration, or other environmental factors.
Virtual Rest: Virtual Rest makes off-hand shots as easy as shooting from a stable rest. The Precision-Guided Firearm image is stabilized, so you can Tag-and-Shoot™ moving or stationary targets at extreme distances from an off-hand position.
Heads Up Display: HUD is the digital display that shows the field of view. The key user-interface between the shooter and the Precision-Guided Firearm, the HUD displays vital pieces of data including range-to-target, target velocity, shot angle, compass heading, gun cant, battery status, WiFi status, wind velocity and direction, kill zone size, ammunition type, temperature, barometric pressure, and time of day.

ShotView: The ShotView app streams real-time video from the Precision-Guided Firearm to a ShotGlass™ on the Recon Jet™ wearable, smart phone, or tablet. It’s ideal for communication in hunting and target shooting applications. Friends, colleagues, or fellow soldiers can see what the shooter sees in his tracking optic.

I am selling my Glock 19 Gen 4. I picked it up in early July of this year and have carried it almost everyday since. It has served me very well indeed, but it was time for me to change it up a bit so I am selling this wonderful little pistol. 
Just like all Glock 19's, it is chambered in 9mm, and as a Gen 4 it comes with all the accessories, including three 15 round magazines, four interchangeable backstraps, a speed loader, a hard plastic case and chamber lock. I am selling it with my Bladetech Kydex IWB holster. I also installed a set of Glock night sights about 4 months back, but other than that it is a completely stock Glock 19. It is very well cared for, with just under 275 rounds downrange, and thoroughly cleaned and oiled after every outing. It may have some very  minor holster wear but that is about it. 
I am asking $600 for the whole package, which I personally think is very fair given the holster and night sights. I picked it up for $600 and that was before the $80 night sights so I am actually taking a bit of a loss as it is.  I am open to other offers, but I do ask you, please don't lowball me. I would be willing to trade for a SIG P229 in 9mm, a 1911, maybe a rifle. Just make me an offer and I'll consider it. 
Also, I'm afraid I won't sell to anyone who does not have an Oregon CHL or who is willing to have me run a background check on them. Nothing personal, but you really can't be too careful these days. Also, please be willing to fill out a Bill of Sale for my records. Thanks for understanding!
It is definitely a sweet little gun! Thanks for looking!"

The MidwayUSA Scoped Rifle Case is a heavy-duty solution for anyone looking for a rifle case. These cases have been engineered with an internal, adjustable retention strap to provide exceptional protection for rifles. These cases are constructed with an advanced dual density bonded padding system that provides superior impact protection compared to basic foam used in other cases. The heavy duty padding is over 1"" thick on both sides to protect your rifle and optics investment from rough handling in storage or travel. Other enhanced durability features include heavy duty, 600D high-abrasion resistant ballistic fabric construction, and oversized self repairing coil zippers with sewn pull tabs. Lay flat construction allows this case to stay open on the shooting bench for ease removing your rifle, or as a padded surface to lay the gun on during breaks in the action. The fully wrapped webbing handles, reinforced seam stitching, metal hardware, adjustable shoulder strap and snag-proof 600 Denier lining fabric make the MidwayUSA Scoped Rifle Case an excellent choice for transporting your sporting rifles.

It started out as 700 sps with a 26"" varmit contour barrel. I cut the barrel down and threaded it at 24"" and it now has an AR10 flash hider to protect the threads. I was looking to suppress it at some point but I intend to build a little different rifle for my purposes now. It has a Bell and Carlson Tactical Medalist A5 stock with fully adjustable length of pull and comb. Has a BSA 4-14X44 FFP mil, mil scope. BSA does make a lower end scope, but this is not one of them. For the price, its a great scope. Holds zero and clear as a bell at its highest power. Also has H and S Precision floor plate and 2 10 round mags. They're single stack and center feed design. They feed better than Remingtons captured mag in my opinion. Rifle has also been camo painted. Its Krylon. Nothing fancy, but it worked good for my area. I hunted small varmits with it. It may have 200 rounds fired through it. If that. I got the gun in early 2013 and unfortunately it sat more than I would like. I'm looking for 2200 or best offer to put towards my next build. I'm not really looking to trade unless theres cash on top of a trade. But worst thing I can say is no. And please no lowballers. I know what my rifle is worth. 269 two one seven nine eight one eight.
