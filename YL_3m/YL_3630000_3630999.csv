The Spartan edition has an ""oil rubbed bronze"" nitron finish and 24k gold inlay, which is tough as nails and looks absolutely amazing in person. Depending on the lighting, this finish appears several different colors. The writing on the grips and slide reads ""Molon Labe"" in ancient greek, which means ""Come and take them"". This is what King Leonides told the invading armies when told to lay down their arms, and is a motto of patriotism and the 2nd amendment.


The pistol comes fully upgraded with match barrel, checkered front strap and main spring housing, magwell for faster reloading, skeletonized trigger and commander-style hammer, very bright trijicon night sights, lowered/flared ejection port, beavertail with memory bump, and much more. The slide to frame and barrel to bushing fit is absolutely perfect with no play, and the slide action is smooth as glass. The trigger is adjustable, and breaks clean and crisp. This gun is as accurate as they get, and is an absolute pleasure to shoot. This  gun has exactly 150 flawless rounds through it and is in perfect condition, not even broken in. 

The pistol comes with two stainless steel magazines, the original box and paperwork, a sig sauer bumper sticker, and for the right price I will include a sig paddle style retention holster and a custom made leather/carbon fiber kydex hybrid holster for in the waistband concealed carry (see pics).

215,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3630215,For Sale:  Colt riffle,"Georgia, Georgia, United States","$ 2,000","Listed On: Wednesday, October 22, 2014",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"In the predawn hours of April 17, 1961, the Deputy Director of the CIA placed a phone call to President John F. Kennedy urgently requesting promised air support for the Bay of Pigs invasion that been launched only hours before. The invasion force of Cuban expatriates had immediately come under heavy fire from Castro's waiting troops and were pinned down on the beach head. Kennedy refused the request for air support and that meant certain defeat for the 1,400 Cubans of ""Brigade 2506"" and the CIA backed overthrow of Fidel Castro. Shorty after the failed invasion, Kennedy fired the Director of the CIA, Allen Dulles and his Deputy Director, General Charles P. Cabell. General Cabell never forgave Kennedy for this betrayal and bitterly criticized him publicly, often describing Kennedy as a traitor. 

The man that made that fateful 4 am phone call to John Kennedy was the owner of the Winchester carbine offered in this listing. General Charles P. Cabell served as Deputy Director CIA from 1958 to 1962 when he was fired by JFK. He later gave the carbine to his brother, Earle Cabell who was the Mayor of Dallas, Texas when Kennedy visited that city - and was assassinated on November 22, 1963. 

This fine Winchester saddle ring carbine was made in 1920. It is in 30 wcf caliber and overall condition is 90%. The Lyman 56 receiver sight was installed at the Winchester factory according to the letter of provenance that accompanies the carbine. This letter is on Cabell family letterhead and the serial number of this carbine is listed. The letter will be provided to the buyer of this Winchester. 

This is a rare opportunity to own a piece of history that was owned by two prominent men during our nation's turbulent Cold War era. The failed Bay of Pigs invasion led directly to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 - we'd never been closer to all out nuclear war! 

I will provide any additional photos you would like to see, just specify the specific views you want, and I will try to answer any questions you may have regarding this Winchester.

The DB9 9mm automatic pistol features a 'ZERO-Energy' striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools allows for easy field stripping. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion"

Glock shoots amazing and has been my carry gun for two years. It has had over 2k rounds through it, all springs were replaced 7 months ago. Including the flat spring/recoil spring over the stainless steel guide rod.

Refinished at some earlier date???, fully functioning, Colt's first double action revolver. One beautiful revolver with 95% of finish remaining, although some of the bluing on the barrel is a little faded and the case hardened receiver has a few commonly found wear areas. The front sight has been lowered to enable it clear the holster quickly and/or make it a more accurate shooter. Attractive case hardening on the receiver with blued cylinder, barrel, hammer, trigger guard and trigger. This revolver, serial number 96543, was manufactured in 1894, now a spry 120 years old. Has a tight lock up and functions very well, especially considering the internal workings on this model were infamously its weak point. Blue Book values? Not knowing if it was refinished or not, but the fact that front sight was modified (would love to know by whom - a gunslinger?, an outlaw?, a Sheriff?) the starting bid for this fine revolver is for a Colt 1877 evaluated at between 60 and 70% for its fine action and good looks. This revolver will fit fine in any gun collector's case and where some collectors see the short sight as a flaw and degrading feature, to me it's a mystery. Did someone need it to be quick on the draw or some other reason? Let your research and treasure hunt begin."

It has spent nearly it's entire life in a closet in southern California and was only used on a few trips to the desert for shooting cans and such.  Based on the serial number, this rifle was made in 1965.  It is chambered in .264 Win Mag and holds three rounds (+1). I'm not sure what version of the model 70 this is, but it has a jeweled bolt and an adjustable rear sight.  This also has a Tasco 3x9 scope mounted on it.  The strap is from an old acoustic guitar, but I also have the original Winchester strap, though it seems to be missing a hook or loop (or maybe I just can't figure out how it works).  I will also include the few rounds of ammo I have, as well as the spent casings.  If you have any specific questions about the rifle's condition, please don't hesitate to ask.  I tried to get a shot of the inside of the barrel to provide an estimation of the condition, but it's a tough shot to take.  

As far as price is concerned, I really don't have an idea of what this rifle is actually worth because I don't know the variables of this model.   I've seen Winchester 70s in this caliber go for anywhere from $400 to $1200.  I know that I will never use this rifle to hunt with, and hopefully someone who is an avid hunter will appreciate it more than I ever will, so to me the rifle is worth $500 and that is my asking price.  Not interested in trades, sorry. 

Please email me if interested.  I can meet up with you anywhere in the Eugene/Springfield area."

I have contacted many warthog listings and had no responses so I am wondering if my messages are reaching the owners wanting to trade their warthog. The Tac S has an MSRP of $1219 but realistically sells for about $850 in this condition.

It is a highly public place and the deal will be done inside and on camera. They are my cameras and I am the only one with access to them. If you are interested, when we talk you will understand why I am doing this. I am not a dealer at all. Just a gun nut that owns another type of business. If you cannot travel to this location I will NOT do business with you. Feel free to email me and I will explain instead of flagging me cause you think I'm being a jerk.

This is extremely light weight and highly concealable.

Level II is often worn by police officers. A great balance between blunt trauma protection, versus cost, and thickness / concealability / comfort.

The front vest is 17x17, the rear is 12x16. As the vest is adjustable (velcro straps) it will support a wide variety of wearers.

For an additional $30 I will throw in two extra inserts:
1) Trauma Pad insert (decreases blunt force trauma/absorbs the shock)
2) Second Chance K30 insert -- this is a steel plate which will provide a considerable degree of extra protection, including decreasing the impact of some rifle rounds."

Vintage Manufacturing Date of 1975 

This is a very shiny and desirable vintage 1975 Colt MK IV, Series 70 Government Model .45 auto, finished in Colt’s beautiful Bright Nickel. The pistol has polished slide flats, and matte slide top and undercarriage. The pistol has factory checkered wooden grips with gold-colored Colt medallions that look really nice against the Bright Nickel finish. The grips have black grain running through the brown. The factory magazine is Colt-marked. The pistol has some small but noticeable marks primarily on the slide. Otherwise, the gun is in very nice condition with a shiny bore and a very smooth trigger pull – overall condition is around 90%. Series 70 Colt 1911’s keep going up in value, and the nickel finished guns are quite desirable.

These are built by Waffen Werks on their own American made receiver with a new/unissued Circle 10 Bulgarian parts kit and an American built chrome lined barrel.  All of the Bulgarian parts are matching numbers.  This one has the Bulgarian military brown painted wood furniture on it and it has some scratches in it from storage and handling.  I was going to sand it and see what kind of wood is under it and refinish it but I decided that the color gave it a classic look.

It has the military issue AK74 muzzle brake which is the best in the industry for these rifles.  If you haven't shot an AK74 5.45x39 with the true AK74 brake, it has almost zero kick and is a blast to shoot!   This one also has a G2 trigger kit for a great trigger feel as well as a USA made pistol grip for 922r compliance.  This rifle will come with 3 made in USA polymer magazines.  There are 2 thirty round Pro Mag magazines and 1 forty round Pro Mag magazine.

This rifle has NEVER had corrosive ammo fed through it, only noncorrosive Silver Bear.
