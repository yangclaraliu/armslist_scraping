These Tactical pistols are some of the best shooting 45's out there. This gun is as close as you can get to the Mark 23 without paying $2000. It features a Match grade trigger with an adjustable trigger stop, high profile adjustable target sights for windage/elevation, a threaded barrel for a suppressor, the o-ring barrel, and HK's ""Hostile Environment"" blued finish among other features.

 This particular gun is in great working condition. The slide looks fantastic showing some extremely light signs of use. No scratches or dings on the slide. The threading on the barrel is untouched, as far as I can tell. The only condition issue are as seen in one of the pictures on the back of the polymer grip where it looks like someone gouged the bottom of the grip a bit. Needless to say, that does not affect the precision or functionality of the gun and is purely cosmetic.

 The pistol comes with 1 ten round magazine with an upgraded magazine spring (a Wolff +10 spring)!

This price is only for the pistol and magazine - no case.  I have an original Eagle Industries tactical case (black) that I can include for an additional $100 (these cases sell for between $100 - $150).  This particular case is missing the suppressor pouch, but is a great useable example of these sought after cases.

M6A2 5.56mm 16.1 Inch Barrel Black VLTOR EMod Stock MagPul Pistol Grip Black Finish Troy Sights 30 Rounds
The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths and in either 5.56mm NATO or 6.8mm SPC. The M6A2 rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low-profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2 rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2 rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2 rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2 rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2 rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat which greatly enhances service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. The action of the M6A2 rifle is coated in our proprietary nickel coating that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2 rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

The Hi-Standard model B was the first produced of it's type by Hi-Standard. The Serial number dates it to 1937. It is still in excellent firing condition!!!! Many similar ones have sold for much more. 

When Hi Standard first started producing pistols, the first model they came out with was the model B. They made it in both a long barrel and a short barrel version. The one pictured is the long barrel model. The basic design was derived from an earlier Browning design, as was the Colt Woodsman. In fact, the Woodsman and the Model B look almost identical, although they are not.

The model B turned out to be a reliable, well made, and accurate pistol. Some people didn't like the grip, as for a person with large hands, it was on the short side. On later models this was changed, and the grip was extended. On later models the magazine capacity was increased from nine to ten rounds. Later models also incorporated a slide lock back lever, which the Model B did not have.

FS: Numbers matching, 1936 Tula arsenal Mosin Nagant model 91/30 7.62x54r. CN stamp designation. The marking literally translates to "" Snayperskaya Provernnaya"" meaning tested for use as a sniper. A Soviet document indicates that 54,160 rifles were produced in the PE form between 1932 and 1938. However only 12,752 top mount hex and round receiver PE/PEM’s were made in 1936. Figure it as a 50/50 split and that leaves 6,376 hex receivers. Of that number, how many 
A) survived the war, 
B) survived bubba's tender touch 
C) how many were left 'un converted~drilled/tapped for a scope and mount. 
and D) in better than average condition. 

My guess, not too very many at all. I hate the 'R' word but can call this one pretty damned uncommon & feel comfortable with that. I believe these unconverted models to be even less common than full drilled/tapped models.

This ol'vet is wearing a post war stock with an arsenal repaired toe splice. The shellac is flaking in a few places, not horribly so, but it's still there. It doesn't bother me so I haven't done anything to it. 95% blue/black remains on the metal. Clean muzzle crown, deep & strong rifling. Silky smooth action. Point of aim & damned accurate. 

$300 firm. If it doesn't sell I'm happy to keep this one in my collection.

The charging handle is a PRI GasBuster for suppressed shooting if your into that, or it simply offers a nicer charging handle with the extended latch. KAC VFG is siting under my rail which helps with an extended hold on the rail. The optic is a PA 1-6 GenII in a PA deluxe extended mount. Has a sling mounted attached to the buffer tube. Optic goes with the rifle unless the deal is good.

If any questions just email and ask.

Also have 500 rounds of Wolf Gold and 500 Tula steel cased for sale with it or added into it for the right deal."

This is a little different set-up from most you find, it has the 28"" barrel and Sporter sights instead of the Target sights, which is found on most of the 28"" barrel models, what does it mean exaclty I don't know, more rare or not, I'm not sure.  The receiver and bolt serial numbers match, which is huge when it comes to value.  As you can see from pics, the finish on metal is not in great condition and the stock has some bumps and bruises from use, but everything is in good working order and the bore is in very nice condition.  Depending on the model 75 and condition I've seen these going from $600 to well over $2,000, so hard to tell what it is worth, so I will start at $700 obo. in cash and see where it goes.  I'm happy to take more pics of any area you would like to see.

$700 obo. in cash or will consider good trades.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and Exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, another firearm, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I do not need anything in trade right now, but will trade if it makes sense on my end.  If you offer something of less value and do not mention adding cash or other to the deal, I will assume you want a straight trade and pass.  Same on your end, if you have something of higher value let me know what you are looking for on top.

Semi-auto rifles, AR, AK, Saiga, PSL, FAL, AR-10, AR-15 and variants.

Semi-auto pistols or revolvers in .357 mag & .44 mag.

This is a little different set-up from most when you can find them, it has the 28"" barrel and Sporter sights instead of the Target sights, which is found on most of the 28"" barrel models, what does it mean exaclty I don't know, more rare or not, I'm not sure.  The reciever and bolt serial numbers match, which is great when it comes to value.  As you can see from pics, the finish on metal is not in great condition and the stock has some bumps and bruises from use, but everything is in good working order and the bore is in very nice condition.  Depending on the model 75 and condition I've seen these going from $500 to well over $2,000, so hard to tell what it is worth.  I'm happy to take more pics of any area you would like to see.

494,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3152494,"For Sale:  Ballistic Advantage 16"" mid-length ar-15 rifle barrel","Cedar Falls, Iowa, United States",$ 220,"Listed On: Monday, June 9, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This listing is for a new, unfired barrel made for Special Ops Tactical by Ballistic Advantage, LLC. This barrel is 16"" long and is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO.  In my opinion the features of this barrel make it among the finest all-purpose barrels for the AR platform at any price point.

First this barrel features a unique profile making for the best blend of accuracy and weight available.  The common military profile is thinnest under the handguard and heavy at the muzzle which makes for a barrel that both gets hot and introduces ""barrel whip"" which degrades accuracy.  This barrel is built for just the opposite.  Its a full ounce lighter than a 16"" government barrel (27oz vs 28oz) and feels much more balanced without the extra weight out at the muzzle.  Yet it is much more rigid and accurate!

Also this barrel also has a QPQ Nitride finish both down the bore and outside.  This treatment which surface-hardens the barrel steel and greatly extends the life of the rifling and chamber throat.  It works so well that barrels treated with it are said to last 30% longer than hard chrome-lined barrels and are many times more resistant to corrosion.  Also unlike hard chrome plating, QPQ Nitride is a treatment and doesn't affect the tolerances in the bore and chamber leaving accuracy intact.  The process is also responsible for the attractive and scratch resistant flat finish on the outside of the barrel.  Its very similar to the process used on Glock slides and leads to a similar appearance.

The QPQ treatment is sometimes used on cheap barrels to make them seem desirable but to do it correctly the barrels must be treated before the barrel extension is added or the extensions can loosen during the heating of the process and lead to inaccuracy or failures.  Many manufacturers skip this step but that clearly is not the case on this barrel as it features a Fail-Zero nickel boron coated barrel extension.  This extremely slick coating has 3 advantages on a barrel extension.  It prevents the barrel from seizing in the receiver for easy installation and removal, provides the most reliable feeding via the feed ramps, and makes for a smoother working interaction with the bolt for less wear and action failures.

You can see this was a well-thought out barrel with a lot of features that set it apart.  Here's a full list of features:

    5.56x45mm NATO chamber also suitable for .223 Remington ammunition
    1/7 twist rate will stabilize virtually any available ammunition
    Mid length gas system is ideal for 16"" barrels
    Accepts common .750"" gas blocks
    Standard 1/2x28 threads for muzzle device
    4150 chrome moly vanadium steel alloy construction
    High pressure tested and magnetic particle inspected
    Unique barrel profile leads to enhanced accuracy and balance
    QPQ Nitride treatment for enhanced barrel life
    Fail-Zero nib coating for enhanced feeding and reliability


Please feel free to ask questions about this barrel.  Its an excellent cornerstone to a new or upgraded AR upper suitable for combat, competition, varmint hunting, and target shooting."

The mechanics are perfect and the bore is good with strong rifling but shows some frosting and shallow pitting, though still shiny. The deluxe wood is in good condition with much of the original varnish finish. The receiver is mostly bare with some blue in protected areas. The barrel retains 50%original blue, starting to patina, and the magazine tube is 50% as well. The rifle qualifies as an antique since it was made in 1895, but was actually not shipped form the factory until October 30, 1899. 

What make this gun unique are the close coupled double set triggers which are extremely rare on models 1892 and 1894. These triggers and the tang sight were probably added after the gun left the factory, as they are not mentioned in factory records as being shipped with the gun originally. The original special features when the gun was shipped are the take-down feature and deluxe wood."

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. The new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series.

Chambered in 9mm for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, Melonite® coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

Gun has had about 200 rounds through the barrel, so still in nearly new condition, cleaned thoroughly after every range visit. Upgrades include a new Mainspring housing to eliminate the ILS, an Ed Brown competition mainspring, Wilson Combat Bulletproof sear spring, Wilson Combat A2 Bulletproof sear, an STI Titanium Hammer Strut, a Harrison Design and Consulting long black trigger, and a Wilson Combat full length guide rod and also a set of VZ Operator Grips. Also purchased Wilson Combat ETM Mags for it. None of these upgrades are in the photo below as I haven't gotten a chance to take a new photo yet and will get some this evening when I get home. Can throw in ammo for the right price, have plenty of 9mm to add to a deal.

If you believe my asking price is too high for a used Range Officer, feel free to do the math on all of the additions that are included in that price point and you'll find that I have invested a little over $1,200 easily into this gun. Please keep that in mind if making an offer as well. Thanks."

The Model 1300-series itself features roughly twelve different models including the Model 1300 Black Shadow Deer Combo and the Model 1300 Ranger Deer. 

The Model 1300 Defender, which is billed to effectively handle 'security situations' can fire both rifled and buckshot slugs from a pump-action 7-shot tubular magazine system. The slide-action system is also billed as the fastest operating system available to any shotgun of this type. The surface construction of the weapon system is coated with a non-glare finish and is made of steel and composite materials. 

The Defender is available in 12 and 20 gauge. Combat models include the Model 1300 Police, Slug Hunter, Marine and Stainless Security. A removable TRUGLO fiber-optic sight is available. Due to its high magazine capacity and shorter than normal barrel length, the Defender and its related types of shotguns are banned for use in some European countries. Variants of the Winchester Model 1300 Defender include: Model 1300 Defender - Base 8-shot model Model 1300 Defender - Featuring pistol grip and full stock combo. Model 1300 Practical Defender

Ours was cerakoted FDE and features the Hogue overmolded stock and grip, as well as the factory Pistol grip.

Everything is as it came from the factory except, I did add a, still unused, Vortex Strikefire Red/Green dot optic (as shown in the pics). 

This is not an ""economy"" or entry level AR. This was custom made by PSA per my specifications. It has only the best components and various high up upgrades typically found in top level AR platforms (like POF, LWRC, etc.). 

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of the best AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests? 

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2rG8xXfDbg

This is the premium model, meaning it has such components as the CHF (Cold Hammer Forged) barrel, chrome lined pretty much everything, etc. The barrel for this firearm is made by FN (the same barrel that is used for the S.A.W. fully auto machine gun that the US Military uses. You can't find a more dependable and quality AR, with this many high end features, anywhere near this price point...period! I have a Colt and a Daniel Defense AR15 as well, and this PSA is easily on par with both these rifles from a quality standpoint. This AR has many upgrades, making it that much more reliable, easier to clean, etc. 

 To recap, here is everything included in this package:
 - Premium Model Carbine, chambered in 5.56/.223
- CHF (Cold Hammer Forged) barrel with chrome lined barrel and chamber (1 in 7 twist – can stabilize any available 5.56//223 round out there).
 - Upgraded ACT trigger group (makes the trigger pull much smoother and crisper for increased accuracy and rate of fire)
- Upgraded NiB (Nickel Boron) complete BCG (Bolt Carrier Group) – NiB is self-lubricating and much easier to clean than standard chrome lined BCG’s. 
 - Upgraded MagPul hand guard and rear BUS (Back up Sight)
 - Upgraded VLTOR BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle (Extremely well made, durable, and much easier to charge the weapon in adverse/stressful situations)
 - Brand New Vortex Strikefire Red/Green dot optic. Mounted and co-witnessed with sights
- New BlackHawk modular carrying case – plenty of room for extras, like mags, ammo, etc. 
 - Everything was fully installed and tested at the factory, with the exception of the optic which I added later, but never used.
- Owner’s manual and original box that it came in from the factory


 Price for the entire package is $995 OBO. No trades.

The SR40c features a through-hardened, stainless steel slide or alloy steel slide with Nitridox Pro Black finish. Though remarkably similar in size to the popular SR9c, the SR40c's custom slide design reduces recoil and slide velocity, making it more comfortable to shoot than many of its competitors. Its raked-forward front sight allows for easy removal from the holster and the rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable while the front sight is windage adjustable. Other features include an integral accessory rail, retraction grooves, an ambidextrous thumb safety and d-shaped magazine release, and a reverse backstrap. The SR40c comes standard with finger grip extension floorplates and an additional magazine. A grip extension adapter for a full-sized feel is also included.

Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series.

For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.
