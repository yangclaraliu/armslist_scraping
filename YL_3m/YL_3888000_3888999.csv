I am including the Crossbreed Appendix Carry holster I purchased that was custom made for the Shield with the Viridian R5 and has the ECR feature built in.  The holster is made of a combination of tanned horse-hide and black Kydex and is designed for right-handed draw.  The custom holster was $75 from Crossbreed and works extremely well with the Viridian R5 ECR Green Laser.

I am also throwing in an additional 10 sets of batteries for the Viridian R5, valued at just over $45. 


VIRIDIAN R5-SHIELD ECR SPECS:
    WEIGHT: .78 oz. (including batteries)
    CONSTRUCTION: High strength thermo molded polymer
    BATTERY LIFE: 1 hour constant 2 hours pulse
    USER ADJUSTABLE: Easy windage/elevation adjustments on laser

It's a 1999 Nissan Frontier extended cab, has the V6 and optional 4WD options.  The body isn't in perfect shape, it's been a work/mulch/farm truck for many years.  Just recently I got back from a trip at the farm and parked it for a week.  The next time I went to take it out, I couldn't get it to go in gear.  I'm not a mechanic, so I don't really want to mess with it and would prefer to just trade it to someone who doesn't mind working on it.  The truck still runs great.  4WD engages and runs excellent and even the AC still works!  It's been an extremely dependable truck over the years and has been very well maintained.  I'm the 3rd owner, my dad owned it since it was 3 years old and I've owned it the last 3 years.  It also has some all terain tires on it now that work excellent in mud, snow, etc.  It was recently re-wired to tow our popup camper, so it has both types of plugs ready to go on the back.

The carbine is equipped with a closed-bottom birdcage style flash suppressor. The barrel is rifled one turn in 11.25 inches, and has six grooves. A twenty-four inch barreled model will be offered in the future. The RFB uses commonly-available metric pattern FAL surplus magazines, and comes supplied with one twenty-round mag. The magazine slides up straight from the bottom, with no tilting necessary to slam it home with the bolt locked open. There are ambidextrous bolt release levers at the rear of the magazine housing on either side, and an ambidextrous magazine release at the rear of the magazine housing. The paddle-type mag release is very easy to use. The safety is also ambidextrous, with levers on either side at the top of the pistol grip. The charging handle pulls to the rear and is released to chamber a cartridge from the magazine, and can be easily and quickly switched to either side, as the operator prefers. This RFB carbine is a true fully-ambidextrous design. Nothing is compromised for left-handed shooters, and the rifle works just as well for a left-hander as for a right-handed shooter."

The optic itself comes equipped with a Larue quick detach mount for picatinny and a pelican hardcase with foam designed specifically for the optic. The optic is for 5.56 and includes a range finding bullet drop compensator to 800 meters.  The reticle style is a red ""crosshair"" as opposed to the chevron of the ACOG, which I find much simpler to use and zero without sacrificing any functionality.

This is an amazing piece of glass.  I have shot numerous ACOG's while deployed, and this blows them out of the water.  Incredibly durable, crystal clear glass, and a host of built in features (Reticle can automatically adjust illumination by sensing the illumination where you are aiming.  If it is a dark bush, illum will drop.  Bright spot, illum increases.)

The only reason I am selling it is I have recently purchased a new optic, and as I only have one 5.56 rifle, I do not need the extra glass.

MSRP from their site, which is where I purchased this from, is 1,600 dollars for this optic with the above extras.  You can get it for a steal at 1,200, though I will entertain reasonable offers. I can be reached via email through the site or at:

I'm putting my Remington R1 up for sale. It's in excellent condition, and I have fired about 50 rounds through it without failure. It's clean, no damage, etc. I'm just not sure quite yet if it's the handgun for me. I would love for someone else to get more use out of it. It's the standard black model with a five inch barrel. It is not the enhanced model. I'm listing quickly, so I have only attached stock Remington photos (but mine is identical). I would be happy to take/send some at a later time.  It's an excellent firearm, very accurate and easy to shoot.

Buying used skips the FFL fees, tax, etc.

It comes with the hard case, a gun lock, two 7-round magazines (everything included from factory).

Here's the Gander Mountain page with more specifics:
http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?i=GM436499

Must have PTP/PTC. I have all of my paperwork from the original purchase. 

I also have 150rds of .45ACP ammo I would be willing to sell for a discounted price with the purchase of the pistol.
Thanks!

The car has roughly just over 52,000 miles on it and has had all scheduled maintenance visits. This leaves about 25,000 miles worth of FULL warrantee. The car as well has brand new tires on it, and has been babied since I bought it. it was my work car and drove it on the highway to and from my office. The car has been Adult owned and I have been the only driver, non smoker and very picky with clean vehicles its truly been babied.

This shotgun is in like new condition with only four shells through it. If you are not familiar with this shotgun it is made in Turkey by the same factories that make the Canik CZ75 clones and TP9, Winchester SXP, and many other quality firearms. This is a 5+1 pump action that will chamber 3 inch shells. Has a built in recoil pad and pistol grip, as well as a nice set of fiber optic ghost ring sights, a receiver mounted picatinny rail, a removable breacher choke, and is VERY lightweight. This is a Benelli pattern shotgun and will accept extended benelli magazine tubes. Very similar to a Benelli M3 (sans the semi auto functionality) for a fraction of the cost.

Im interested in several things in trade. Ive had a few shotguns with pistol grips and ring sights and Ive found that I prefer a straight stock with a bead sight. This shotgun retails for $299, Id like to trade it for a similalrly priced 12 gauge shotgun with a straight stock, bead sight, and 18-20 inch cylinder bore barrel, such as a Remington 870, Mossberg 500/maverick 88, winchester sxp, or similar. Only looking for combat/hd style shotguns, absolutely not interested in field guns, sorry.
Might also be interested in a Taurus M85 or similar snub .38 special revolver, or a Polish P-64, or similar PPK style pistol in .32 acp, .380, or 9x18mm. Maybe a Ruger LCP or LC9, Taurus 709 or 740.
Would also be interested in gear/accessories for my AR.  Particularly looking for magazines, tactical vests for mags and gear, or would like a case of 5.56 ammo.  Im wanting a Vortex Strikefire red dot and magnifier as well.
Im also looking for a progressive reloading press, my turret is just too slow for the volume I reload.
Might consider other firearms but no .22's or household junk.  Looking for a trade value of $300-350, will consider partial trades plus cash.

If not interested in trading I will sell for $200 firm. I also have a decent amount of buckshot I can include for $50 extra. Will check and see exactly how much when I get a chance, but should be around 100 at least.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

All bolt handle lengths are 1 3/4"", which is 1/4"" longer than the factory bolt handle assembly kit giving greater clearance for the shooter's knuckles while racking the bolt.
The three tuning springs come in varying tensions for the ultimate in tuning capability.  Though by and large the standard tension spring will serve the shooter throughout the different ammunition velocities.  If, due to tolerance stacking or preferred ammunition the cycling of the action is out of sync then the shooter has the capability to change the spring without using the more primitive method of cutting coils to tune a spring.
Precision ground guide rod is made from hardened tool steel and held to 2/10,000"" tolerance throughout its entire length. The rod is nitride treated which gives its surface a 70C rockwell (harder than a file) surface hardness. Guaranteed the smoothest and slickest guide rod in the industry.

The NSR handguard was designed with the goal of being the lightest and smallest free floating forend option to the M16 family of weapons. The width of the NSR handguard before accessories have been installed is only 1.48"" The NSR handguard is available for sale as standard equipment on our rifles and upper assemblies, as well as a separate component for sale to the public. 

The KeyMod inter-locking rail system is a collaboration between Vltor Weapon Systems and Noveske Rifleworks. Separately, both companies were in development of their own systems, but later realizing that both systems were similar, a standardization of the KeyMod system came to be. 

The KeyMod system offers a mounting platform for a variety of (future) accessories and components. The days of the Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913) are numbered. The future of the direct mountable accessory is here and now. The KeyMod self-contained components/mounting hardware index and V-block onto the platform, achieving a secured and accurate hold to the system, while separate lugs take the recoil force off the fasteners. The pass through attachment method eliminates the need for loose screws and backing plates that can easily be lost, or difficult to install. Another advantage of the KeyMod system over the 1913 system is the direct attach eliminates the need for the 1913 system as a ""middle Man"" thereby reducing weight and accessory off-set from the center of the handguard."

711,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3888711,For Sale:  1993 chevy s10,"quantico, Northern Virginia, Virginia","$ 1,250","Listed On: Tuesday, January 6, 2015",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"recently bought this truck a month ago, and I now found out that i am not going to be able to take it with me when I move cross country. So thats why its up for sale. 
I have a 1993 Chevy s10 v6 4.3 extended cab. It has power windows and power doors. It also has a working heater and a/c. There is an aftermarket sony head unit installed and a speakers work. The body is in really good condition, considering it is a 21 year old truck. But like most older vehicles out here there is one cab corner that is rusted through which is on the passenger side. it has very solid chrome bumpers in the front and the rear. Again it is a 21 year old truck so some of the interior is obviously in used condition.
I recently just got a high milage oil change done. But have not got around to do a full tune up yet. the previous owner replaced the engine with the same motor with >80k but on the body and odo it has >200k 
It still needs to have all the inspections and emissions test ran because I have not gotten a chance to do any of it due to work. 
It would be a great project truck, or even a first vehicle. I have no problems when driving it what so ever so you don't need a trailer or anything like that to move it.

I have TWO Remington Apache 77's, made in 1980.  .22 Long Rifle.  They have the greenish\blue nylon stocks.  These are like the Nylon 66 , but newer.  I believe these were sold by Kmart back in the day.

Both are great shape considering the age and that the stocks are nylon.  The stocks are very nice with no cracks.  A few slight scratches here and there.  The mechanisms look very clean too.  There is light pitting on one side of one of the receiver for 1 rifle.  Light spots on the barrels in a few spots here and there.  Nothing that looks like surface rust.

They each come with a magazine....looks to be 10 rounds.

Selling these TOGETHER.  If you want just one, then buy both and resale one yourself.  In fact, you will probably make a profit seeing what these are going for.

$475 cash FTF.  I live just west of Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Shipping will be $25 conus for a total of $500 shipped for both rifles together.  

NO TRADES and PLEASE do not ask.

I have a Marlin 39A for sale.  I dated it to 1956.  .22 LR

This gun is in excellent shape considering the age.  There is some slight spots here and there on the barrel, but nothing that looks major.  The action is nice and tight, and the chamber contains nice deep bluing like it was not shot alot.  Bluing is nice and dark.  Hooded front sight.

The wood is in excellent shape with a few small dings in the stock.  No cracks.  It has a satin finish to it.

Can send more pictures to SERIOUS buyers.

These older 39A's are getting harder to find as most people keep them when they find them.  And this is of course a JM model.  It is also a take-down.  I've had this one for quite a few years myself.

$575 cash FTF. I live just west of Grand Rapids, Michigan. May be open to ship with insurance in a few days if not sold locally for an additional $30.

NO TRADES and PLEASE do not ask.

Thanks"

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

This freed up the small numbers of M1903 Springfield and the ever increasing number of M1917 Enfield rifles to be sent with the US Soldiers heading to Europe.  These Ross rifles were again called into US military service during WWII when they were issued to Costal Patrol units along the eastern seaboard. 

This particular one has been cut down to a Carbine length and the stock is seriously cracked (looks repaired).  Overall in fair condition and I would recommend an inspection by a qualified gunsmith prior to firing this rifle.  I do not think that this is a legitimate military configuration and feel that it's more of a sporter conversion done after the rifle was sold to the surplus market.
