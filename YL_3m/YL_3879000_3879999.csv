Since 1959 the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on should they have to punch out over a remote area. Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game."

The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer.


The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes. The magazine release button mimics the AR-15 rifle location. The manual safety also duplicates the AR-15 style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip. The top of the receiver has a carrying handle and integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories. The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts."

I bought it nearly 30 years ago from an older fellow who told me that his father brought it back from Europe after WWI. He had the story but no official documentation. I have however looked it over many times and there are no visible importer marks which does lend some credibility to his story, plus I felt like he was giving me the straight scoop at the time.

This revolver was produced in 1899 making it about 116 years old and all I can say is that it's in terrific condition for being so old. Most of the original blued finish is intact and the hammer, trigger and loading gate still has a lot of their original ""straw"" colors. There is some thinning of the bluing around the muzzle and a few freckles on the frame, but I'd put overall condition at around 90%.

The wood grips are excellent too with sharp checkering and no dings or cracks. The the bore and cylinders are in fine shape - shiny with strong rifling and without any rust or pitting. Everything functions mechanically just as it should.

Pistol comes with what I was told are it's original leather holster and lanyard which are in good condition given their age. Then there are two boxes of 8mm Lebel ammo by Fiocchi. This ammo is still produced but you do have to do some hunting to find it. I bought these two boxes a while ago at Sportsman Guide. Specs on ammo is 115 grain FMJ bullet at 880 FPS. So it's not a powerhouse by any means but it does have enough get up and go to get the job done.

Bottom line is that this is a very nice collectible that you don't see too often especially in this condition. It's a perfect addition to any military collection and especially so for those who specialize in French Militaria. 

Price is $650 for everything with pickup in the Brandon area. This revolver is 1 year shy of being a true antique by BATF definition so I won't ship it. Buyer must be at least 21 and a Florida resident."

I got the wife into shooting by getting her a .22lr pistol. She loves it, and she's a better shot than I am! I recently got her a matching 9mm, and now that's all she wants to shoot. Over the past year I've built up a supply of .22lr, but now I need to stock up on 9mm just to feed her habit! :)

I'm looking for 9mm 115gr ammo specifically, but will entertain other grain offers as well.

As you can see from the pic I have several makes and grains, from Federal Bulk to CCI to Remington Golden Bullets. Shoot me an offer, and if you don't have 9mm to trade I'll take cash as well. Cash price is $.08 a round for everything but the Federal Match and CCI  which is $.12 a round.

Local sale only please, no shipping.

Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers — only in a smaller, more concealable design.The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.

The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter’s hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.

A set of abbreviated “industry standard” mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines.

Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers — only in a smaller, more concealable design.The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.

The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter’s hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.

A set of abbreviated “industry standard” mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines.

This scope has a gloss black finish, & is in excellent condition. The lens are clear, & scratch free. The ring marks are minimal.

This scope has an A dial on it; which is by far the most popular dial.  We would substitute one of the other dials, if desired.

We can email close up photos, on request.

Shipping to the lower 48 states, will be $12.00. Please call: REDACTED, for a quote to Alaska, or Hawaii.

Although these Redfields were some of the best hunting scopes, ever built; at this point, they are almost 20 years old. We can not guarantee this scope is in perfect condition. Even if they look good, & there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them, you don't know for sure, until you mount the scope, & try it.

However, we do guarantee, there is nothing obviously wrong with the scope, we don't tell you about.

I have well over a dozen Illuminators, just like this one. All of them have been disassembled, & cleaned; & they work good. All of these original Redfields, should be disassembled, & cleaned, before mounting them on a rifle. This usually costs about $60.00. You should figure that in, when buying the scope.

We have used several scope repair companies. The two we would absolutely NOT recommend, to anyone; are: Iron Sights, & ABO.

We have sent a couple Redfields to Iron Sights, & it took a year to get them back, & they still had the same problems, they had, when we sent them in.

ABO, is even worse. They either can't, or won't, fix anything properly, & they do not stand behind their work. They are very expensive; also. We would not recommend you send a toy scope, or a Tasco (same thing actually), to ABO; much less a prized Redfield, such as an Illuminator.

That said; there are several other scope repair companies; which are reputable; who will disassemble, & clean a Redfield.

We take all major credit cards, with a 3% surcharge. We will also take a check, but we will have to delay shipping for a couple days; on out-of-state checks.

We are a retail store, so our items are subject to sale BEFORE they are reserved online.

If you don’t see what you are looking for, please call us at REDACTED. We can sell most scopes at very reasonable prices.

Thank you."

There aren't many of these rifles left from what I've heard so if you want something neat and different to plink with at the range, then this is the rifle for you! I'm not in a hurry to sell this and I really don't have to, but I would love to get an AR. So...don't low ball me or offer me crap! I'm Dave and you can reach me at REDACTED

Things I'm interested in for trades:

Yes, I will add cash to the deal if you want to trade but if you just want to buy, no less than $425."

I originally purchased this for coyote control around my farm but was informed by my neighbor/game warden that while it's legal to hunt coyotes at night with a shotgun, it's illegal to use IR scopes on them. I used it some this summer on my 22 for pest control of our garden but that was about it. It holds zero great and the picture is amazing for a Gen 1 IR sight. I just don't use it enough to justify keeping it. Brand new it was $500. I also added the top mount ATN Ir450 adjustable illuminator$120 that mounts directly to the scope as well as an additional Armsight IR450 adjustable illuminator$100 that i mounted with a universal QD barrel mount but i also have a picatinny rail mount for it as well. They both have variable illumination and dial focus. I used one for peripheral illumination and one focused center of the reticle. All together I invested $750 into this setup and it's hardly been used. It's in pristine condition. I just can't use it for what I intended and it sits on a shelf. 

I would prefer a trade. I'd be interested in a Glock 21 or 22, an XDM 40 or 45, or something similar. I'll  consider all reasonable offers. I already have lots of rifles, AR's, revolvers, and a couple 9mm's so not interested in those except possibly a Gen4 G17."

Blade front and notch rear sights, blue finish with casehardened hammer, trigger and trigger guard and fitted with brown checkered wooden grips.  they made very few with the Olympic chamber barrels in .22 caliber as they were used to shoot the Olympics with., and there are not many around like these. With the use of an Olympic chamber barrel you must seat the round down into the barrel lands to fire the gun. The cartridge seats easy to about the last 1/4"" of it's length then you have to push it down hard for a final seat prior to firing it. This avoided bullet jump in a barrel and allowed for much more accuracy on Target.

I bought this described as new, but he had been running a slide over it giving it some scratches. I also worked a slide on it, the one shown in the photo, but never fired it. I planned on making a target .22 but ultimately decided I don't like shooting .22, and would rather invest in an AR pistol (kind of schizophrenic decisions on my part) so offering it up here.
It has a VERY light (maybe 2 lbs) and crisp trigger that a smith did for me.
I also disengaged the grip safety as well (safeties do not belong on a target gun in my opinion) but I left most of it so that the safety could easily be reengaged by a dab of weld and a file.
RoCo grips - $115 from Brownells
All top notch parts (Wilson, 10-8, etc)
Hours spent polishing to near mirror finish
Contacting surfaces polished inside and out
Very nice, tight part fit. One of the better I have seen.
Trigger is in better condition than when pic taken - matches gun now
This is not a gun for children or people who shake. 

Only caveats is that, as a new frame, the feed ramp is not polished or machined to the projectile you chose (I was using a 22 kit that did not use it). Also, I just added the ejector because it looked wrong without one (also a part not used by my .22 upper) but it is not fit to the gun . It will work to eject shells but it is not well fit. 

Asking $450, which is not a lot considering the grips and smith cost me over $200 and I paid $200 for the stripped frame. I will consider trades of pistol length AR uppers, but very interested .223/5.56/wylde and 9mm. Thanks, JR"

I am a private seller located in Titusville FL (north Brevard county) You must be a Florida resident 21 years of age or older to purchase.

 Description: 
 The Micro Might handgun is a five shot, fixed cylinder mini-revolver. It is designed around an historical and simple single action mechanism. By ""fixed cylinder"" means that the cylinder does not swing out of the frame for loading and unloading. Removal of the cylinder is accomplished by removing the cylinder base pin and taking the cylinder completely out of the frame. By ""single action"" means that the trigger performs only one function: it releases the hammer.
 Ammunition Warning
 Micro Might Inc. produces and sells Micro Might handguns designed and chambered for two different calibers. The intended caliber is noted both on the shipping and storage box and on the barrel of the Micro Might handgun itself. If your revolver is chambered for 22LR, any good quality factory made 22 caliber ammunition in long rifle, long or short may be safely used in the revolver. The revolver will also safely handle high velocity 22 ammunition.
 If your revolver is chambered for 22WMRF ammunition, ONLY USE 22WMRF cartridges. This designation stands for 22 caliber Winchester Magnum Rimfire ammunition. Use of standard 22 caliber ammunition in the 22WMRF revolvers can result in malfunctions and serious injuries.
