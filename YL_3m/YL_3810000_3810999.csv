This is not a beat up police trade in, its in .40 caliber, in very nice shape with night sights.  Has the nice DAK trigger, which if you aren't familiar with gives it a consistent trigger pull for each shot instead of a da/sa transition, eliminating that ""problem"", while also being much better than a normal DAO trigger. Will come in its original case and depending on what you have to trade can include up to 4 twelve round magazines, a paddle holster, and around 125 rounds of .40.  

Its a great shooter but I haven't had a rifle for awhile, so I'd be interested in trading it for one.  Looking for an AK47 (No Romanian's please) or AR15.  Not looking for a $2000 custom build, just a good everyday shooter in good shape.  I'm okay with polymer lowers as long as the upper makes up for the price difference.  Not interested in hunting rifles or shotguns, if the right trade doesn't come along I'll be fine with keeping it.

PHP (Prvi Hrvatski Pistolj - first Croatian pistol) is a somewhat strange weapon which was hastily developed in Croatia during its war for independence in early 1990s.  By design, this pistol represents a mix between Beretta 92 and Walther P38 pistols. The basic short-recoil operated action with vertically tilting locking piece is similar to both pistols, the general appearance of the open-top slide is close to the Walther but the single return spring below the barrel is apparently an Italian influence. Trigger is of traditional double action type, and the safety consists of a manual decocking lever, located on the left side of the grip frame. Magazines are double-stack and hold 15 cartridges.
Comes with Croatian military holster, (2) 15 round magazines and manual.

Absolutely nothing is wrong with this pistol and I hate that I have to sell it, but my wife's car just needed substantial repairs and we could really just use the extra money. If you're interested, email me at REDACTED or text me at REDACTED.

Finding out your state's laws are up to you. When ordering from one of these states, you will need to verify with your local FFL dealer if the Firearm is legal before we will ship it to them. After verifying that the gun is legal, we have no problem shipping inside of these states. If you order a firearm without checking to see if it is legal, and we ship the gun to your dealer only to find it is not legal, the gun will have to be returned to us at the customer's expense. All shipping costs will be forfeited. Please ask your FFL dealer before ordering any firearm if you are located in one of these states. 
Shipments... All firearms, with the exception of black powder, must be sent to a Federal Firearms Licensed dealer (FFL). We will need legible copy of your receiving dealer's FFL either mailed, faxed, or e-mailed to us before we are able to ship out your gun. We ship the next business day after we receive your payment and FFL. We ship handguns via UPS Next Day Air for $30.00 except for Hawaii and Alaska Adult Signatures and Insurance are included in shipping fees. We ship long guns via UPS Ground. Adult signature and insurance are also included in the price of the shipping long guns. All of our guns are well boxed and packaged to insure a safe delivery. All of our long guns are shipped at a flat rate of $20.00 except for Hawaii and Alaska which are usually around $40.00."

If you know anybody in auto repair/tire shop, indoor ranges with lead traps, plumbing, roofing, dental, it might be worth asking... You could get free bullets! 

Most common sources of lead are wheel weights for balancing tires. These contain contaminates such as steel/zinc weights, steel clips, composite weights, etc that need to be sorted out before casting. Depending on your preferences, I can return 20-33% of your total actual lead weight into bullets. I can adjust lead alloy to your preferences as well water quenching to harden bullets. Lubed or unlubed. Sized or unsized.

I cast:
105gr round nose Can be sized to either .356"" or .358"" for 380/9mm or 38/357
170gr truncated cone .401"" 40 bullets
158gr swc .358"" 38spl/357 mag
230gr truncated cone .452""'45 acp bullet. Can also use in 45 colt
1 oz 12 gauge slugs*

Looking for free bullets? Just ask around at your mechanics shop. For example, your average 5 gallon bucket of wheel weights will weigh 150 pounds and yield 110lbs of lead. A bucket of wheel weights will amount to ~1100 230gr 45 bullets"

The barrel appears to have been replaced at one time with a Carlson's barrel, which is chrome lined and is threaded for choke tubes.

We are looking at trying to find an AR15 style rifle for him as an upgrade to his current rifle shooting experience which is with a 22lr. He is interested in AR's chambered in .223/5.56 only right now so any trades should be as such. 
We would prefer a trade to be not a completely stock gun since the values are dropping. AR should have some minimal upgrades over the stock version like quad rails or floating guard. Maybe some other upgrades as well to equal out in value what these 3 handguns are valued at.
Bill of sale trade with drivers license info and addresses listed along with gun info's from both sides. If local to Lima we can go to FFL dealer. Can meet if needed.
Handgun values are about the $850 range on just the 3 guns and nothing else so the accessories and ammo takes it up to about the $900-$925 range so the AR value should be close to that in TODAYS or pre price hike prices not what you spent for it last year or the year before when it was outrageous.

I originally purchased a 26"" 20 gauge 870 for my wife and daughter, but the LOP was too great for either off them, so I also bought a youth model with the shorter stock and 21"" barrel. After trying several youth guns at the range, I found their accuracy to be a lot better with the another gun, so I ended up buying something different instead.

I paid $320 for each gun in sale at gander with another $20 on tax on top of that. Neither of these have been fired and are new in their boxes. I will not take anything less than $300 power gun, so don't bother with an offer.

However it is ABSOLUTELY not the same as any other Mosin as EVERYTHING has been customized and altered and I have been on target on a 12 inch pie plate at a thousand yards which is only possible do to the extensive customization I have done to this rifle as it was gonna be gone smith for over a month. If Remington was to make this exact rifle it would retail for several thousand more than I am asking. I put a lot of love and effort into this build. Has a $1100 brand new Vortex Viper PST ffp EBR-1 MOA mildot scope (4-16x50) has illuminated reticle and comes with a lifetime warranty. In 20 years if you decide to smash it with a hammer you can call or text and they will replace it for free even if the damage was your fault. The scope is sighted in at 100 yards and you will use the turrets to make your adjustments, if you lose your MOA count I installed a zero stop so you simply twist it back down until it stops and then you will go back to zero and you know you will be at a hundred yards and can then start your turret adjustment over again easily. has flip caps as well. Rock solid industries MI-24c picatinny rail which was professionally mounted and drilled into reciever. off to one side of the rail is a 90 degree Picatinny rail and on the other is a 45 degree rail.also has a six inch Picatinny rail on the bottom front part of the stock where I have a Harris bipod attached. The barrel has also been cut down toto eliminate barrel vibration and also reduce weight on the pivot point for the free floated barrel.the end of the barrel was really crowned and also threaded 5/8"" x24 with a AAC 300 blackout flash suppressor work a T10 ratchet mount for a simple twist and lock for a silencer. Has a Timney adjustable trigger. A timney trigger shoe to fit the pad of your fingertip perfectly for a clean easy pull. this trigger is absolutely amazing and breaks with barely any pressure at the current setting. Has a free-floating Archangel stock but I went a step above and had it custom fitted to the barrel itself by my gunsmith.the original bolt handle has been cut off with a bent bolt rewelded andpolished. The bolt handle is threaded which I then attached a steel tactical bolt knob with a spiral pattern.also has a rock solid industries stainless steel firing pin spring for a faster trigger reset. I also put on a very nice sling. I can sell everything together for $1700or without the scope for $850. I would also knock money off for a KSG shotgun and a 45 caliber Glock possibly 40 cal. everything on this rifle is brand new and I just finished building it I am only selling this because I fell in love with the KSG shotgun and also need to pay on my credit card. I am losing over $1000 on this build at the price I am selling it for. The best way to reach me is calling Tom at REDACTED or texting me but I will try and check my email."

The gun has never been touched except with gloves, it comes with factory papers, optional walnut display case, and factory hard case with sleeve serial numbered to gun. This Rattlesnake can simply not be Improved on. The Rattlesnake is built on the Colt 1911A1 platform and has a Pearl Gray and Gold Titanium skin (finish) which is a first on any handgun. This Colt is fitted with genuine Diamondback Rattlesnake skin grips. I call this my eighth snake because other than the highly collectable, and sought after double action snakes, which there are seven of, this is the only other Colt snake! This snake is built on their famous 1911A1 semi automatic platform ""The Rattlesnake"". I have many pictures for you to judge this package for yourself.

Sighted in and hunted for one season in 2012, so less then 200 rounds thru the barrel. 

Stock has been shorten to meet my fit by cutting 1inch off.  If you interested, CZ USA still have some stock in stock, or with some work, one can put the stock back together.  I still have the sawn off part.  

Make me an offer.  I need the cash for this Holiday season, but please be reasonable.  Need to see in person to appreciate this rifle."

This is not a beat up police trade in, its in .40 caliber, in very nice shape with night sights. Has the nice DAK trigger, which if you aren't familiar with gives it a consistent trigger pull for each shot instead of a da/sa transition, eliminating that ""problem"", while also being much better than a normal DAO trigger. Will come in its original case and depending on what you have to trade can include up to 4 twelve round magazines, a paddle holster, and around 125 rounds of .40. 

Its a great shooter but I haven't had a rifle for awhile, so I'd be interested in trading it for one. Looking for an AK47 (No Romanian's please) or AR15. Not looking for a $2000 custom build, just a good everyday shooter in good shape. I'm okay with polymer lowers as long as the upper makes up for the price difference. Not interested in hunting rifles or shotguns, if the right trade doesn't come along I'll be fine with keeping it.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Thanks!

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

 A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

The Model 77 was made only from 1955 to 1963 and could be bought in either tubular feed, which was more popular, or clip feed. This one is a clip feed model, and it has an original Winchester magazine, not an aftermarket which I understand didn't work very well. Appears to be all original, I got it as part of an estate of a relative. Metal retains at least 95% of it's original finish with a few small dings and spots. Wood is at least 85% with the normal small dings and blemishes you would expect for a firearm of this era. The checkering on the forearm is worn down some in spots, but is still visible and defined. Face to face transaction only. I will consider trades, primarily handguns, and can/will add cash if required. While it's a nice .22, just not a Winchester fan or collector, and prefer stuff I can use. an take more photo's if you want to see something in particular."
