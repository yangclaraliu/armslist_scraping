Truly a collectors dream !!! This bike is a time capsule !!! You would search the rest of your life and not find another 1997 OLD BOY with 1,300 original miles!

1997 Harley Davidson Heritage Springer FLSTS

1,300 miles. That is NOT a misprint.
One thousand three hundred miles.
This bike should be shown and will win every show it’s entered in. How often do you see an all original 17 year old bike with 1,300 miles?

Fresh full synthetic oil.
New Harley battery

This bike was owned by a 74 year old gentleman that didn’t ride it, obviously.
I sold my cuddy cabin boat to buy a walk around or a center console, but when I saw this bike, I just had to have it !!! So I bought it. I miss boating too much to keep this classic and I can’t afford both, so it’s for sale.
I’m not desperate, I will keep it if I don’t get enough cash or a boat of equal value, or a less expensive boat and some cash. 
I might even trade for an every day rider, Harley only, and some cash to buy a small center console boat to cure my itch for the water. My 2003 harley Ultra has 65,000 miles and I usually keep a 2nd bike in the garage to ride, but I feel guilty putting miles on this rare gem. So, I could use another daily rider.

I’ve put some miles on the bike and it runs great and is an attention magnet !!! And I’ll continue to ride it a little until it’s gone.
Everybody loves it, it’s so classic and stylish. The history of the 1997 Heritage Springer is that it was designed after the 1948 Panhead. Those in the bike world refer to this as the “Old Boy”, again, after the ’48 Panhead.
If I keep it I’m getting that put on a vanity plate,,,”OLD BOY” !!!

Please don’t waste my time or yours with idiotic offers, price is FIRM !!!  It’s a 17 year old brand new bike. Go find another with 1,300 miles and in this condition. Oh wait, you won’t find one I’m sure. One thing is for sure, the value of this bike will only go up, never down. If you buy a brand new 2014 Heritage today, 5 years from now it’s worth $12,000.00?
What will this be worth in 5 years, over $20,000.00 for sure.

NO RIDES WITHOUT ALL THE CASH IN MY HAND !
Will also trade for Leer jet. Will need flying lessons."

Born of necessity, raised in the Army’s Marksmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available. The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible. This, along with being salt bath nitride finished, equates to unprecedented accuracy and durability. The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM. The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated. The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation. The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0™ quad rail for allowing your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor. The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements. We equipped it with the Geissele SSA® 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target. We also furnished the MK12 with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

****  More pictures available upon request. ****

The following description is critical and may make it sound to be in worse condition than it actuality is, but I would rather a buyer be pleasantly surprised than upset. This rifle was owned by one family for the last 50 years. The grandfather bought it, his son and two grandsons used it for 40 years. They shot it, carried it, stored it and hunted with it regularly.  For the last 10 years it has sat in the back of a closet until I bought it.

The receiver is not grooved for a scope. There has not been any after market modifications to this rifle! Many of the screws appear to have turned several times. The tube magazine is worn shinny with the use of the pump. The receiver is developing a patina in some places. The bluing is generally in good condition.

The wood is in good condition though it shows signs of significant use over the years. It appears there are finger ring marks at the grip, and the finish is mostly worn on the stock within an inch or two from the butt plate. There are no deep gouges or cracks in the wood. There are no cracks, chips, or other bad wood marks. 

The pump action functions smoothly. The internals of this rifle are in excellent condition.  The trigger pull weight is 4 lbs. The safety functions properly. The bore appears bright. The rear sight may not have been adjusted in the last 40+ years! This rifle is a classic shooter. 

I think the overall condition of this rifle is about 80%. That is the basis for cash price. I'm reasonable, but I'm not giving it away. I prefer FTF in Aiken, but if you pay all shipping, I will ship it to your FFL. USPS Money Order will be required for long distance transaction.

FEG receiver. 12.5"" original hungarian barrel with welded extended brake (shorter sight radius). Matching #s. Tapco single-stage trigger group. Wire folding stock (it's stiff, hasn't been used much). surplus hungarian grips (watch your 922(r) if using foreign mags). Speaking of that, metal mags may have a little side-to-side wobble, but remain firmly in place.
Comes with two 30-round polymer magazines, they load just fine, it's just not quite as sharp a rocking motion, and the foregrip can always be removed if it bothers you.

Gun is practically unfired, had one previous owner and he said he put 30 rounds through it, I believe him. I haven't put any through it myself. Has a few safe marks and finish wear.
Trying to save up some money for a Vepr-12  or a M16A4 clone, will trade plus cash for one of these, but I'm not interested in a bunch of ""custom"" mods and extras if I'm trading up.

$700 cash.

Prefer to meet in east DFW, Mesquite, Rockwall, Mckinney.

This being an early Chinese SKS it is of all milled construction, even the gas piston tube is milled, not stamped.  Also features a chrome lined barrel and chamber that looks nearly brand new.  The stock has no cracks and a nice grain pattern but as you can see it has definitely been there and done that.  The story that I heard for this batch of rifles is that they made their way from China to Yugoslavia/Bosnia and used there during the early 90s.  An individual even carved their name into the stock, it looks like the name ""Zerpiun"" or something similar, so it has some real deal trench art.  Bluing is around 60% (conservative estimate), but there is no rust anywhere.  Selling to make more room in my safe, plus I already have a few AKs so this gun doesn't see much use.  When I received the gun the sear had a negative engagement with the hammer causing a potentially unsafe condition, which is a common issue with these guns.  The sear has been recut to provide safe function.  

Rifle comes with sling, cleaning kit, and 20 brand new stripper clips.  Must be 18, have a FL Driver's License and/or FL CWP and sign a Bill of Sale.

When things get serious, you need a serious handgun by your side. That means you need the SIG Sauer P220 Combat Full Size Semi Auto Handgun. The P220 Combat is designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards. The pistol features the military's Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG's Nitron over a stainless slide. The internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction, while barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron which easily passes the military's accuracy requirements. The P220 Combat also passes the military's 240-hour salt spray corrosion test.

This is an early model Sigma 9mm. I am the second owner (purchased in April 2014 from a reputable CalGun'er) and I have not personally shot it. Previous owner stated he never had a FTF or FTE. The Sigma shows some wear, holster wear mainly, however it functions flawlessly. It was sent into S&W factory by original owner for a check-up (though nothing was wrong).

This model mimics the Glock 19 well, which is one of the reasons I wanted it. Smith & Wesson were sued by Glock for the Sigma being almost identical at half the cost. Hence S&W released their new, design compliant model, the SDV9E.

The Sigma comes with (04) 10-round magazines and .30cal Ammo Can case with foam insert to hold gun, 4 magazines, and is lockable (lock not included).

22 magnum ammo
Hey all,
I got real lucky and just had a big order of mag ammo process and it is on its way at a really good price. As a result of it I can “shift” the price and average it to all of what I have 22 mag wise, which lowers the price that these cost me and thus what they’ll cost you! That being said, here is what I physically have on hand right now, and I will be getting a decent amount more in in the coming week or so. 

I'm selling it at cost to me with shipping and tax so price is for pick up in Norman only. Would also consider trades for certain pistols (derringers in bigger bores mainly), looking specially for a PF9 actually, and even trades for certain other ammunition. Would also consider trades for 45 auto ammo. (Probably a 1-1 ratio depending on the ammo) Here is what I have available as of now:

-20 boxes of 50 rounds of 40gr JHP Armscor precision 22mag-$16 per 50 rounds (1.350 rounds in total) 

-20 boxes of 50 rounds of 40gr JHP Fiocchi Performance 22mag-$16 per 50


I will break it up however you would like to buy it box wise or you can buy it all. It is all the same to me. It is not the best price in the world, but at least I found some I could get available to y'all. Shoot me a text at REDACTED if you would like to arrange a trade or pickup. Or just shoot me a PM on here. Thanks and happy hunting!"

Full name--Romanian Cugir manufactured model PSL-54C semi-automatic 7.62x54R rifles
Romak 3 or III to its friends. 

This is a import, not a parts kit gun as you will find the FPK'S to be and some Romak's.

This rifle is a simplification of the Dragunov. The action is almost identical to
the famous AK-47 , but with the addition of a lug- locked action to handle
the wollop of the 7.62x54r round. 


The purpose of this rifle is to allow a greater reach out in range for a small
unit due to its caliber and the fact it is equiped with a 'scope. (One may
look at the meaning of ""psl"" in its name. From Wikipedia--""The PSL (Romanian: Puşcă Semiautomată cu Lunetă, ""semi-automatic rifle with scope"") is a Romanian military designated marksman rifle. It is also called PSL-54C, Romak III, FPK, FPK Dragunov and SSG-97 (scharfschutzengewehr - 1997).""

My gun is prestine, very nice shooting gun, numbers matching, and a matching set of mags. (4 total) Also included is a LPS scope.

The spots you see in the pics are pitting. If i had to guess, I'd say 2/1000-3/1000ths deep. Shoots just fine though. The cylinder pitting is only the one area shown in the pics...the rest of the cylinder looks great. NO pitting in the chambers or bore. Bore and chambers are great. 

Has a trigger job performed by Mr. Pedro Ortiz, our local and most excellent gunsmith. Single-action pull on this one is crisp, clean, and very light. Double-action pull is smooth as butter. Pinned barrel revolver from 1971.

Came off a Taurus PT1911 that had exactly (50) rounds through it. The Taurus logos were removed. All the original parts are included. Got it from a buddy of mine that decided to use the frame for a custom 10mm build. I was present when the (50) rounds were put through the complete gun...no problems whatsoever. 

This is a 2008 model, back when the had mostly (predominately) positive reviews. It appears the quality control has slipped in later years, but this is an earlier one and it ran just fine.

Figured I'd list it here before trying Fleabay. I'll ship this one for $10 more (PayPal only, no fees for me). Not gonna wait on money orders that never seem to show up. Not looking for trades.

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target.

989,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3185989,For Sale/Trade:  1985 Honda shadow 700vt,"Bedford, Bloomington, Indiana",$ 700,"Listed On: Monday, July 14, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"85 Honda shadow for sale. Clean title. Great cruising bike. Comfortable ride. It needs a stator. It starts but the stator isn't giving enough juice to start the battery. I have put a lot of new parts on the bike. I have put a new starter relay, new fuel hoses, new carb kit, complete brake check, fresh oil. I also have extra parts like rear brake cable, rear brake light switch and $300 aftermarket starter that is unopened. It doesn't need the starter but I bought it thinking it did because I have seen they go out before most other parts (wasn't the issue and it was unreturnable). Tires should be ok for this season may be good for next. Just depends how much you plan on riding it.

It does need a new wiring harness eventually. I haven't gotten into that. The headlight and radiator fan are hooked up to a kill switch. This is a great starter bike or future bobber project. If you have any questions please ask. You can email me through the site or text 812-679-885zero.

Make me an offer. I Will consider all items. Guns, vehicles, anything that has some value. I have my cc permit to ease ones mind."
