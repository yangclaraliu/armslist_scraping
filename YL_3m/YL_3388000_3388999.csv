This is a sub MOA rifle with Hornady 60gn VAMX steel case, and 1-1.25 MOA with 7N6 (@100 YDS). The goal of this rifle was to build an accurate and light varmint rifle. This cartridge is incredibly ""flat shooting"" and the point blank range for even the smallest of varmints is quite long. Ballistic The Advantage BBL is astounding, as well as hard coated bore for max life with corrosive ammunition. Approximately 500 rounds through the rifle. 540 rounds of 7N6 come with the rifle. NO MAGAZINES included with the sale of the rifle, MAGPUL .223/5.56 magazines work very well, but load @ 80% of .223 capacity due to 5.45 cartridge shape.

I have a little ammo to throw in, maybe 50 rounds or so.
Lettering has all been white colorfilled, the only thing not done is the ""fire"" lettering which I was going to do in red, however I did not have the paint to finish. It is easy to do and if you would like it done before the sale I would be happy to do it for you.

Gun also comes with all original trigger spring hardware, original A2 style grip, and grip screw. I have the box and paperwork for the scope as well as all the original packaging from the parts, including the Diamondhead rail.

Has only ever had Lake city 5.56 fired in it. Either XM855 or XM193. No other ammunition, and steel cased junk never touches my firearms. Any ammo that comes with it will similarly be Lake city 5.56. I have a few XM855s left but it's mostly XM193.
Rifle has less than 500 down the tube, has always been cleaned after every range trip and I only use Slip 2000 on it for lubrication. This build was done right and has functioned flawlessly. I may be forgetting one or two things, if I remember them I will edit the ad, if you are still reading this it is still available.

Price is set at $1000 as is, $800 without scope and mount.

It's a single-digit serial number rifle that was used for Army evaluation before they came out commercially, which is sort of neat trivia. Rifle features a one-of-a-kind PWS prototype muzzle brake that is installed. Besides that, it's a really nice, very accurate .338 Lapua rifle that looks pretty darn cool. There's some wear in the anodizing where the bipod would be mounted on the underside of the handguard, but other than that it's in fine shape. Comes with one Barrett polymer magazine and custom-cut foam insert to fit more mags and accessories.

Comes with a Pelican transit case.

I have a lightly used H&K MP5 SD6 chambered in .22lr for sale.

Overall condition is excellent, only a few light scratches on top of receiver. This is a great little plinkin gun with only about 1,500 - 1,800 rounds fired. Comes with one 25 round magazine. Very reliable with all common .22lr ammo in my area (CCI's, Win 555 bulk HP's, Fed HV HP's etc...). 

Well maintained, barrel is in great condition and always stored in inside a dry safe. I can provide a free basic gun lock if needed just let me know.

Here is what H&K says about this model:
SPECS:
System	Semi-Auto
Caliber	.22 l.r. HV
Capacity	25 rounds / magazine
Safety	Navy Style Safety Levers
Stock	Retractable
Grip	Navy Style Pistol Grip
Sights	Interchangeable front sight posts, rear sight adju
Barrel length (mm)	412 (16.2"")
Dimensions (L/H/W mm)	860 overall length
Weight (g)	2770 without magazine.

""This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5-SD chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5-SD is engineered as a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It's built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and a MP5-SD fake suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.

The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. A 25 and 10 round version of the magazine is available. Both are proportionate in size to the centerfire version's mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5 magazine.""

All Stainless Steel construction, very well built and heavy. The condition is 98% inside and out. From serial dating, the gun was made in 1990, and from what was told to me about it's history, it's only had about 300 factory rounds through it. It was my Uncle's gun and he sold it to me to finance a new rifle he wanted because he rarely fired it. These big revolvers don't really appeal to me, otherwise I would not imagine selling it. I would rather it be in the hands of a person who will put it to good use and get a lot of enjoyment out of it instead of taking up space in my safe. It comes with an Uncle Mike's Sidekick Holster.

Both of my sd9's have been the most reliable guns that I have ever owned, more reliable than my Glock 19 or 23 plus the Melonite finish is a heck of a lot more durable than Glock finish..
 Eats any 9mm ammunition you feed it. Accurate too. Has the Melonite slide ,  metal M&P sights with front night sight, rear sight is adjustable, self-defense trigger, and it has the loaded chamber indicator. The APEX tactical trigger spring kit has been professionally installed and the trigger pull is now down to around 5.5 pounds which is MUCH better than the factory 8-9 pound pull.
Everything is in good/great factory-like condition and has been VERY well cleaned/maintained, this gun is very hard to find nowadays yet VERY easy to find parts for since the cheaper/budget VE models are still in production. 9mm Sigma mags will work in this gun aswell, and any m&p sights can be installed on it. Have safety tape put on it to specifically match my grip, can leave on or take off very easy. The white filling in the engravings is temporary aswell.
 Love these guns, fortunately I got my hands on two of them a while back so I am willing to let one go.
Comes with Smith and Wessons seemingly-unconditional LIFETIME warranty (best customer service department in the firearm industry) , an extra 17lb polymer guide rod, the factory springs ( current trigger, striker, and trigger safety springs are apex tactical springs), THREE 16 rd steel magazines ( two of which are only a month old) and a Soft Armor owb/iwb holster with removeable snap-strap retention. Located in Jackson, willing to travel for the right trade/deal.

Pistol Features:
The PLR-16 is a conventional, long stroke gas-piston operated semi-automatic chambered to fire the 5.56 mm NATO and .223 Remington cartridges. This pistol employs a piston and recoil assembly located over the barrel, instead of behind the grip like some AR-based pistols, along with a Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. This pistol is configured with an AR-15 type rotating bolt, but a right-side charging handle mounted to the bolt carrier is used in place of a top-mounted AR-style charging handle. The blued 9.2-inch barrel has 1:9-inch right-hand twist rifling and a muzzle cut with 1/2-28 threads to accept standard barrel attachments like flash hiders and muzzle breaks. The rear iron sight is adjustable for windage and the AR-style front sight can be adjusted for elevation. The receiver features an integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail to accept a variety of optics.The magazine release is a square button located on the right side in front of the trigger guard. The manual safety is a cross-bolt button that blocks the trigger and sear from moving when engaged. The PLR-16 pistol arrives with a polymer 10-round magazine. The receiver also accepts most AR-15/M16-type magazines.

Rifle has had less than 500 rounds through it.

Bought it from the second owner a little over a year ago, took it out twice in the original stock and shot open sights. I then bought the JAE (2nd owner) and installed it and the ARMS mount (purchased the mount with the rifle, but I never shot it with it. Original owner used it a few times), and then put it in the safe. I have not shot it in it's current configuration.

Here's everything that's included in this setup.
Springfield M1A Standard (looks to be from around 2004/2005)
Original walnut stock - The sling bracket was removed by the previous owner, and the bipod stud installed (I may be able to switch it out with a stock that hasn't had that bracket removed, if the buyer is interested).
Original hand guard - Cracked where it was notched for the ARMS mount.
The JAE stock (in Titanium Grey - not as blue as shown in photos) with matching hand guard (also notched for ARMS mount, but not cracked) - Includes bottom rail, bipod stud, additional spacers, and palm shelf spacers. This has the titanium lugs instead of the aluminum ones the the current JAE comes with (a $299 upgrade for the current gen stock).
A third hand guard with a bad camo paint job - Was going to strip it to use on the rifle with open sights.
1 - 10 round mag and 5 - 20 round check-mate mags
Some additional screws that came with the JAE, and the stripper guide (removed to install the ARMS mount).

 Here is a bit about the rifle that I didn't even know about until reading this

""Since 1959 the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on should they have to punch out over a remote area. Through the years the AR-7′s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.

When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.""

764,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3388764,For Sale:  Perfect Grouse Gun!  (Remington 870 20 gauge),"down town, Missoula, Montana",$ 350,"Listed On: Thursday, August 14, 2014",Shotguns,Remington                                                                                ,20 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"This is the perfect grouse gun!  Its light weight (6 lbs, 2 oz), short barreled, and purpose built for chasing birds.  It’s a Remington 870 20 gauge express youth model with synthetic stock and the factory length of pull kit installed, so it’s now a full-sized stock with the full-size length-of-pull.  If you don’t want a full size stock, no problem, just remove some or all of the shims until it fits you perfectly!  Grouse like to hide thickets and dense cover, so a short gun is needed.  Because this is the youth model, it has the short 21 inch barrel that is threaded for chokes.  Rifle comes with 5 chokes: cylinder, skeet, improved cylinder, modified, and full.  This is a good selection of chokes that will meet your early and late season needs for birds, and also give you chokes that work great for home defense and hunting other game, and shooting clays.  All chokes are Carlson’s Chokes except for the modified choke, which is the Remington factory choke.  Choke wrench is included.  Grouse are hard to hit, so if you are like me, you will need a lot of practice.  Because this gun is a youth model, it has the soft squishy recoil pad, not the hard rubber pad that they put on most of their guns.  Practice all day and the combination of the soft recoil pad and the 20 gauge will not beat you up like other guns will.  Grouse are fast, so a fast fun is needed.  To help with speed, this gun has a Vang Comp extended safety button installed (the factory safety button is also included).  It’s practically impossible to get on the trigger without disengaging the safety, so you won’t miss any birds because you were fumbling with the small factory safety.  Gun also has sling studs installed so you can put a sling on it for the long walk back to your truck after a day of hunting.  As pictured, this gun only weighs 6 pounds and 2 ounces.  That’s actual measured weight, not the fake weights that most manufactures list on their websites.  This is one of the lightest shotguns that you’ll find, and anything lighter will probably cost over $1,000.  If you have hunted grouse before, you know how important a light gun is, especially after walking a couple of miles!  This gun is basically new condition.  I’ve shot 25 rounds through it as a function test and it didn’t have any problems at all.  Gun comes with 75 rounds of ammo, the original box and papers, and a BoreSnake for cleaning it.  Face to face sale in Missoula only, to a MT resident.  No trades please.  (If you noticed the small gap between the stock and the receiver, that is because I have a shim in the stock to change the angle to better fit me.  It’s very easy to remove the shim to close the gap.)"

These are from a special production run and there will not be more available unless another special order is placed at the factory so if you don't get yours now you may not have another chance. It is a definite BEST CHOICE!

Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.

The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

If you have any questions feel free to call or text me at REDACTED. I can meet anywhere in Yuma or the Foothills. I will not ship anywhere.

When’s the last time you saw an MC Operator for sale?  That’s right, you haven’t.  These are very hard to come by as Springfield doesn’t make very many of these and current owners rarely sell them.  Screw the railed Kimbers and Sigs, everyone knows the Operator is better.  The only other railed 1911 that can hang with this is the Colt Rail Gun.  

Condition:  Great condition overall, tiny superficial paint wear on right side of thumb safety shown in pics, barely noticeable take down mark (must angle the gun a certain way and look for it, purely superficial and not a scratch in the steel).  Gun is still super tight.  Made in the U.S. with NM (national match) frame and slide.  Has never malfunctioned, ever.  Only selling because I need to buy an engagement ring and need cash.  

Round count:  EXACTLY 502 rounds factory ammo, original owner.  This thing isn’t even broken in yet.  

Comes with everything from the factory PLUS:

•	Everything from factory (case, 2 factory mags, holster, mag pouch, brush, documents and manual)
•	Wilson Combat magazine well/funnel for faster reloads
•	Currently has black Ergo or VZ  grips, original factory Pachmayer wrap around grips included
•	2 barely used Checkmate 8 round mags (the only mags that the Springfield Custom Shop recommends) for a total of 4 mags!
•            Custom Kydex holster

The gun alone retails for $1300 plus tax if you can even find one.  Add in all the freebies and goodies and you know this package is a smoking deal.  Sell the Wilson magwell and extra mags if you want, I don’t care.  

Price:  ONLY $1050.  I’m taking a huge loss on this gun and you will NOT find a better price anywhere, period.  Price is firm, no BS, please don’t waste my time.  Do not even contact me for anything less than $1050 CASH because I will just ignore you.  
First one to email me “I’ll take it” for $1050 cash gets it.  This will NOT last long at this price.  

Email:  REDACTED

Must meet at a local FFL in or around Norristown/Philly.   

Also, as a perk to the buyer of this fantastic deal, I’m willing to sell 450 rounds of factory Winchester white box .45 ammo for $160.  That’s less than $18/box of 50 rounds.  NO ONE SELLS FACTORY AMMO CHEAPER.  THIS DEAL ONLY GOES TO THE BUYER OF THE MC OPERATOR, WHICH IS ALREADY AT A FANTASTIC PRICE."

I used a quick Google search to fix the problem but that did not help me.

I then decided to get professional help to solve my problem. After having received many quotations from various companies, I decided to go ahead with Online Tech Repair (www.onlinetechrepairs.com). 

Reasons I chose them over the others:

1) They were extremely friendly and patient with me during my initial discussions and responded promptly to my request.

2) Their prices were extremely reasonable.

3) They were ready and willing to walk me through the entire process step by step and were on call with me till I got it fixed.

How did they do it?

1) They first asked me to state my problem clearly and asked me a few questions. This was done to detect any physical connectivity issues with the printer.

2) After having answered this, they confirmed that the printer and the laptop were functioning correctly.

3) They then, asked me if they could access my laptop remotely to troubleshoot the problem and fix it. I agreed.

4) One of the tech support executives accessed my laptop and started troubleshooting.

5) I sat back and watched as the tech support executive was navigating my laptop to spot the issue. The issue was fixed.

6) I was told that it was due to an older version of the driver that had been installed.

My Experience

I loved the entire friendly conversation that took place with them. They understood my needs clearly and acted upon the solution immediately. Being a technical noob, I sometimes find it difficult to communicate with tech support teams. It was a very different experience with the guys at Online Tech Repairs. You can check out their website www.onlinetechrepairs.com or call them on 1-914-613-3786.

I would definitely recommend this service to anyone who needs help fixing their computers.
