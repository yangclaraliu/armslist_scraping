This is because they are built to exacting tolerances, maintain their zero under adverse conditions and, when folded, have one of the lowest profile top-rail footprints in the industry. Our highly versatile 200-600 Meter Micro Rear Sight features a finger-adjustable, rotating drum that enables shooters to engage targets from 200 to 600 meters with both speed and accuracy. 

Specifications: 
Material: Steel
Elevation Adjustable: Yes
Windage Adjustable: Yes

Zeroing Tips: 
25/300 Meter Zero: Place a target 25 meters down range. Turn the rear sight drum to the ""Z"" setting and fire a 3 round group(s). Adjust the front sight post and rear sight windage knob until the desired point-of-aim/point-of-impact is achieved. If possible, turn the rear sight drum to the ""3"" setting and confirm zero at 300 meters.
50/200 Meter Zero: Place a target 50 meters down range. Turn the rear sight drum to the ""2"" setting and fire a 3 round group(s). Adjust the front sight post and rear sight windage knob until the desired point-of-aim/point-of-impact is achieved. If possible, place a target 200 meters down range and confirm zero.

NOTE: Once zeroed by one of the above methods, the rear sight's 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 meter range marks may be used for engaging targets at those distances. However, because the range markings are averaged between rifle and carbine barrel lengths, the exact point-of-aim/point-of-impact sight settings may differ a click or two for a given rifle. If possible, fire your rifle at known distances and record your exact + or - clicks for each range.

Accepts Browning Invector chokes as well as Mossberg screw in choke tubes (much cheaper). Currently has an Improved Cylinder and a modified choke installed. Very nice walnut stock and forearm. Reallly a nice bargain O/U for trap or for a cheap duck gun. Just not my cup of tea. Would like to sell to fund another project, but will listen to offers for trades. Gun cost more than $450 after taxes and fees. Asking $380. Can send more pics if interested. Is really a nice looking gun. Many clay courses use these as their rentals due to their affordability/ruggedness."

The good, low round count already has the mid-barrel bead on it and shoots well. 

The bad, as seen in the picture it has some damage on the stock (hence the lower price) that does not interfere with shooting. I bought the gun like that and ran 20 rounds through it just fine.

It is in great shape, with low round count through it. I have only shot one box, so maybe 500 rounds, and the guy I bought it from claims to have shot less than that, evidenced by the less than half full box of .22 that came with it.

2 TRIGGER, EJECTOR, SPLINTER FOREND, 6LBS. 2OZ!! 

Most double gun enthusiasts are aware of the reputation enjoyed by the Winchester Model 21; a gun of superior strength and mechanical genius that was under the micro management of John Olin himself. With only 32,000 produced (compared to 250,000 Parkers!), any high condition, original Model 21 is a valuable, investment quality firearm sure to appreciate as you enjoy its use. This custom ordered Standard Grade gun, sn17897 shipped in 1946, is in great factory original condition with exceptional Field Grade wood and original metal finishes. Factory ordered with a 13 1/2"" LOP and the Winchester pad, the gun is fully documented through the Cody Firearms Museum. And it is a lightweight Model 21 20ga. that is at least 1/2lb. lighter than most you will encounter. That is A LOT IN THE REALM OF FINE VINTAGE DOUBLE SHOTGUNS! My experience is that M21""s are not as nimble and easy to carry all day long as a nice little Fox or Parker “O” frame. THIS GUN IS THE EXCEPTION! 

There are a number of unusual features, most notable being a rare double trigger gun WITH EJECTORS, a ""regular"" splinter style forend, M/F chokes, and the old style uncapped pistol grip stock that was discontinued in the late 1930's. Usually when a M21 has 2 triggers it is not an ejector gun. For the true upland enthusiast, THIS IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN ONE OF THE ONLY 2 TRIGGER, EJECTOR, TRULY LIGHTWEIGHT MODEL 21 GUNS YOU WILL EVER SEE.

I THINK it is a 1944 version, but I am not sure.  5 round capacity.  It has had a good deal of work done to it by previous owners.  

The gun is long and hard to photograph well, I can send additional pictures

I understand from the previous owner the work was done by a gun smith, but I have no further info.

The bolt is bent, handle and ball are shaved and the ball was non-slip textured.  The stock was recessed for the bolt handle.

The receiver was tapped for a scope mount.  The scope mount was shaved to accommodate the bolt movement, other than being tapped for the mounts the receiver is un-modified. 

The scope is a Bushnell ‘Stalker’ 3X9 40 scope.  It is clean, undamaged, and works great.  The scope should be worth $50.00.

The stock has been refinished and the wood is beautiful.  Whomever did the job left some defects, some ‘character’ marks and finished it is flat finish.

The gun is clean, rust and pit free.  The bluing is worn as you would expect on an 80 year old service rifle.  The serial numbers do NOT match.

I have fired this rifle it is very accurate and fun to shoot.  This is one of the nicest 8MM rifles I have ever seen

Local delivery only (approx. 35 miles radius from Parma Oh), Must be legal to purchase a firearm, please be ready with ID, CC permit preferred.   We can do a bill of sale if desired.  I know of nothing wrong with this gun, and I have had ZERO problems with it.  It is for sale as is.

when I bought it, it was configured as Variant 1 (DA/SA with Safety/Decock lever on left side)  I bought and installed the LEM conversion kit but leaving the safety lever in place which then made it Variant 5 (DA/SA only with Safety Only, no Decock on left side) with light trigger and spur less hammer

The receiver came from a stock Ruger 10/22 carbine, but it was stripped and professionally Teflon coated which gives it a very durable and good looking satin black finish.

 -Fold up height adjustable bipod		
-OCI Performance trigger group- starts with a brand new Ruger factory trigger group, upgraded with OCI polished performance components and auto bolt release, gives it smooth performance and a 2-1/2 lb tested trigger pull (stock is 6-8 lbs)
-Extended Billet Aluminum Magazine Release					
-Extended Billet Bolt Charging Handle

-(3) Ruger factory 10 round rotary mags		
-(1) Ruger factory 25 rd BX-25 mag			
-6 boxes (300 rds.) CCI Stinger high velocity ammo	

Only thing it needs is a scope and I purposely left it off because your taste may not be the same as mine in optics, and I’ve gotten some in the past that I didn’t like, and I didn't want to just throw some cheapy on it just so it would have one.

The only part of this gun that is left from the stock 10/22 is the receiver and the bolt. And they were even fixed up.

Nice little target gun.  I’ll take $425 for it. I’ve got a lot more than that in it, especially with the mags and ammo, but there’s something out there that I want more, so it’s your lucky day, and please, no trades   You can call or text me at REDACTED  I live near Skiatiook but work days in north Tulsa so can meet anywhere in between.

I have lowered the price on this. This bow (with accessories) is WELL worth this price, cost much more and is practically new. It has been shot, maybe, six times...just enough to sight it in. I love it, it is a GREAT shooter. I'm just more of a rifle guy and was wanting to try crossbow hunting.  It is incredibly accurate..especially up to around 60 to 70 yards...even better, of course, at shorter ranges. Actually it amazed me at just how accurate it is. 
I have 3 22 inch bolts included with it and 3 Rage broadheads as well as the cocking rope, a Barnett 4 x 32 crossbow scope and a padded carrying case (case was 50.00 alone..broadhead package was 40.00). This is a really good value for a turkey or deer hunter that wants to get into crossbows. The cocking draw weight is 175 pounds, which seems like a lot but the cocking rope makes it feel much less. The bolt velocity is 375 feet per second which is 45 f.p.s. faster than the average crossbow. The bolt flies so fast the eye cannot follow it. I also have included 3 field points that are great for practice (the Rage broadhead set also has a simulated broadhead so you can get the feel of shooting a broadhead). This is a great package at a great price! Get it before Spring turkey season starts! Thanks for looking."

The competition bug has bit me. I am looking to spend some money on some new gear and so this has to go.

I purchased this in early June of this year. I can't remember round count so let us just call it less than 500 rounds. 

This pistol is awesome and it is absolutely the best 9mm pistol I have ever owned. Fit and finish is second to none!

It includes everything it came with new and includes two 15 rounds magazines. (I have extra magazines that I will sell for $30 each)

Retail on these is $1295 but street price is right around $1000 for new. I am asking $850 FIRM. Email me for more info. All laws followed. Buyer required to provide positive ID, NC PPP or CHP and sign a bill of sale. We will both get copies of the BOS. Prefer a face to face meeting near Winston-Salem or I can ship on your dime to your FFL.

The 535 marks a new era for Mossberg pump-action shotguns.

It's chambered to handle 12-gauge, 2-3/4"", 3"", and even 3-1/2"" magnum loads, for maximum stopping power. Rugged and reliable, the 535 is the ultimate pump gun, loaded with features usually found on shotguns costing much more, all built into a lightweight design that's easy to carry.
