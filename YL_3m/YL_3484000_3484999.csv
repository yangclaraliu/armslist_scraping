NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, Not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Novak brand magazines got our attention for fit, finish, and function a decade ago. Here are the Novaks’ production mates. Manufacturer is ACT-Mag S.r.l. of Villa Carcina Italy. Exclusive importer and servicer is PSI of Seymour CT. Construction is polished steel body with perforations for round count, steel spring, center support injector type polymer cartridge follower; steel spring catch; and high impact polymer floorplate. Each magazine holds 8 rounds of .45 ACP caliber Ammunition. They will fit any Sig Sauer 220 series pistol chambered in .45 ACP that has an American type magazine release beside the trigger guard. It will not fit European release Sig 220s or Browning BDA45s because their magazine release levers are on the butt of the pistol, and this magazine’s floor plate will not allow those old 1970s and early 1980s pistols’ magazine release to engage. It will fit compact variants of the P220; but protrude from the grip frame. Like their chief competitor Mec-Gar, they lock the .45 open when it fires dry like they’re supposed to; they free-fall eject like they’re supposed to, and most important, they hold spring strength and function reliably in all manner of environmental conditions and even when left loaded for months at a time. Our Single Magazine price is $29.00. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, for only $23 each. Own 3 for only $ 69.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

87,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3484087,For Sale:  BAD GUYS HATE US!,"NORTH, Huntsville, Alabama",FREE,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 10, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Once upon a time, two bad guys came in to your home while you were away. They were ready to steal all your cool stuff. Unfortunately for them, your valuables were locked up in a quality safe purchased from and installed by Parker's Safes and Vaults. www.parkerssafesandvaults.com
They found your safe and began attacking it with pry bars and hammers. They quickly determined that your safe wasn't like the common imported safes. Bad guy #1 said, ""Let's just take the whole safe with us and cut it open in my garage!"" Bad guy #2 said, ""Heck yeah!"" They tried moving it, but it wouldn't budge because it was properly anchored to your floor. Then they got mad. They beat on the safe and used crowbars to pry around the door. They couldn't get in, but made a real mess of your safe. All the paint around the door was chipped and the lock was busted. They ran out of time so they grabbed your toaster on the way out of your house and fled. You came home, and immediately noticed that your toaster was missing. ""Oh no, what about the safe?"" you said. A quick look and you saw that it was intact but damaged. You called the police and filed a report. Then you called Parker's Safes. Great news! Your safe is covered under the manufacturers warranty and you'll be getting a new safe! And you lived happily ever after...

I know, I probably shouldn't quit my day job and become a writer. Fortunately for you though, my day job is selling and delivering safes and vault doors!

If you'd like a quality safe to protect what you treasure, call Aaron with Parker's Safes and Vaults. We'll help you find the safe that best meets your needs and budget, bring it to you and install it discretely without big logos on our trucks and anchor it down for you. And if you're ever in the situation where you need to file a warranty claim, we'll help you with that.

NO NYC. This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, Not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Novak brand magazines got our attention for fit, finish, and function a decade ago. Here are the Novaks’ production mates. Manufacturer is ACT-Mag S.r.l. of Villa Carcina Italy. Exclusive importer and servicer is PSI of Seymour CT. Construction is superbly finished nickel plated steel body with perforations for round count, steel spring, center support injector type polymer cartridge follower; steel spring catch; and high impact polymer floorplate. Each magazine holds 8 rounds of .45 ACP caliber Ammunition. They will fit any Sig Sauer 220 series pistol chambered in .45 ACP that has an American type magazine release beside the trigger guard. It will not fit European release Sig 220s or Browning BDA45s because their magazine release levers are on the butt of the pistol, and this magazine’s floor plate will not allow those old 1970s and early 1980s pistols’ magazine release to engage. It will fit compact variants of the P220; but protrude from the grip frame. Like their chief competitor Mec-Gar, they lock the .45 open when it fires dry like they’re supposed to; they free-fall eject like they’re supposed to, and most important, they hold spring strength and function reliably in all manner of environmental conditions and even when left loaded for months at a time. Our Single Magazine price is $33.00. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, for only $26 each. Own 3 for only $ 78.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

This 4.5lb 2-stage National Match trigger kit is for a stripped lower which does not already have a lower parts kit installed. Our Rock River trigger kit with 2Stage NM trigger includes all pins, springs, and parts to assemble a stripped AR-15 lower receiver with the upgraded 2-stage RRA trigger.
This National Match two-stage trigger from RRA is an excellent trigger for your AR15 rifle. These are used frequently in Varmint and Long Range AR builds where a lighter 2-Stage trigger really helps accuracy and round placement. These triggers come pre-adjusted by Rock River gunsmiths as a matched pair and drop in all mil-spec lowers with no adjustment necessary for an easy drop-in install. Rock River 2-stage NM pins are .1555 in diameter and are not recommended or designed to be used with .154 pins or .170 Colt lower receivers.  .1555 RRA Trigger pins will install in any standard milspec lower receiver without modification but may be noticeably more snug than the .154 pins upon install."

These are in Jeff Davis County and close to Valentine, TX. I do not own the mineral rights and these are raw acreage. Will probably need to be surveyed.

I have never had the chance to make it to the lots but I'm in need of the money at the moment. If you're looking for a place to go hunting I've read some good things about the area with white tail, aoudad, and lots of predators. 

But please, do your research before contacting me. I've spent a lot of time giving information as to where these lots are just to be told it's too far. 

You're obviously using the internet so please search Valentine Texas to get an idea of where the property is. Just in case I've uploaded some picture of where the abstract is located and where on the abstract the 3 lots are plotted. 

I have the deed in hand. Price is $1500 per lot or $4000 for all 3. Please no emails. Ask for Jonathan. This is the lowest I'll go on the price. Will trade for firearms, gold, silver, ammunition, or vehicles of same value. Trade value taken is market price. Also accept bitcoins.

Kimber Solo finger extensions, available in black, silver, and now pink hard anodized aircraft aluminum. Available through Amazon.com or our web store listed below. 

MAJOR MAG SPRING IMPROVEMENT: Having trouble getting 6 rounds in your 6 round magazine, replace the ridiculously stiff factory spring Kimber provides with a true performance spring. Easily accommodates 6 rounds and provides better feeding, and fewer jams. Many of our spring customers say it allows use of several brands of 115 gr. lower cost target rounds rather than having to use high priced hollow points just for target practice (we do not guarantee this). Springs: $9.50 + postage

IF LOCAL TO THE DFW AREA you can buy finger extensions and performance springs from the friendly folks at DFW Shooting Sports, 105 Bedford Rd, Bedford,TX. 817-285-0664.

I had this scope for a little over a month (still have box). Reason Im selling is that I was planning on doing more long range shooting than I actually have time for (or the money). This scope was going to be used as duel use for long range shooting and (long range) hunting. The fact that it is illuminated helps with the first and last minutes of hunting when it is still dark outside. Each level of illumination has an off between each level of brightness (which is much better than Nightforce scopes that have a preset level of brightness which cant be changed quickly). The glass on this scope is as clear as you will ever see. This is almost the best scope that I have owned, but when you get into such high-end quality scopes, the difference in quality is hard to tell. I need the money right now for another project and because I am not using this scope to its fullest potential. 

The scope is in like brand new condition. It is currently held by Burris extreme tactical rings (low), that have been lapped. Lapping reduces any pressure points the rings can put on the scope from any manufacture imperfections on the rings. This translates into a better secured scope and equal pressure all around the body of the scope. 

The anti-cant is a Holland Signature Series. I believe this is the best anti cant as it is very clear and strong yet not bulky. 

The rail is an EGW 20 MOA rail for a Remington 700 Long Action. 

I paid:
Scope $1400
Rings $63
Anti cant $65
Rail $45
----------------------------
Total $1573

Asking $1425 obo for all or trade (look below) 
This is a package deal My loss is your gain!

You are more than welcome to check out the scope but only serious inquiries. 
Scope will remain on rifle until I have cash in hand. I have no other scopes for my rifle so for the time being I need this one on it. 

Will only trade for Glock 20 with or without red dot (RMR or Deltapoint only) depending on what you have I'll decide how much cash on your end. NO TRADES FOR RIFLES, SCOPES, ACCESSORIES, ETC!

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY This listing is for ONE Magazine. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. At long last, here are factory Sig magazines for that company’s highly popular model 938 pistols, named model Nightmare. Manufacturer is [probably] Check-Mate Industries of New York, one of Sig’s more recent subcontractors but an old hand in the magazine business. Construction of the magazine itself is entirely stainless steel body and cartridge follower, with steel spring and a black polymer adapter that serves as a finger rest and covers the extra magazine body length that allows this magazine to hold 7 rounds of 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm caliber ammunition. That is one more round than the standard magazines that come with the Nightmare Pistols themselves when they are issued from the factory. This magazine will only work in the Sig Sauer or Sig Arms model P938 Nightmare Pistol. It will not work in a Colt Defender; will not work in a Sig P238; will not work on the dump lever of a 1947 John Deere Manure Spreader. We’re offering these hard-to-get, Sig Factory magazines each for only $ 39.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

I will keep it if I can not make a good buck on it as I love it ( I have the same gun in compact version ) 

Sarsilmaz is a company that is not going any where as they have been in the firearms business for 130 years and the quality and reliability shows ( youtube sar torture test ) this is the best 9mm handgun south of $700 I have ever owned ( I have had more than a few )

The SGL12-61 is finally here. Now you can have a Saiga shotgun with the same fit and finish as our SGL21 and 31 series rifles. The 922r compliant parts our mil-spec Buttstock, pistol grip and trigger group. It also uses the same lower handguard ribbed technology as our RPK series that provides advanced cooling. This makes the SGL12-61 the most advanced shotgun conversion on the market. 

K-Var is proud to sell FIME’s own 12 gauge Saiga shotgun. This Saiga 12 was manufactured at the Izhmash Factory in Russia and Imported through FIME Group, LLC in Las Vegas. This Saiga 12 is the perfect balance between price and added features for an extremely reliable semi-automatic shotgun. Featuring a high quality polymer handguard (styled after the RPK design) with a pistol grip, and a unique retainer that leaves your handguard free for a comfortable grip. 

The Lower handguard is modeled after the RPK style making it shorter than the standard Saiga handguard. Its unique system utilizes ribs designed to increase the surface area, while allowing quicker cooling of the handguard. This is perfect for those that are planning on doing a short barrel conversion or are looking to add the SG-405, new Picatinny rail system. These look great by themselves and they look even better with the Picatinny rails attached. The top portion of the handguard is extended up the sides of the gas tube and is vented to give it a more complete look. This handguard will make your Saiga 12 more ergonomically correct, which in turn makes it more enjoyable to shoot. 

Designed as an all purpose shotgun, this Saiga will deliver the unprecedented performance needed. Chambered in the versatile and functional 12-gauge round, this semi-auto shotgun has all the standard features seen on the original Saiga that allows it to operate in the harshest environments with virtually any type of ammunition. This rifle comes with a chrome lined barrel which allows the use of many different types of ammunition to include steel. FIME's Saiga 12 Is capable of cycling both 2 ¾“ and 3” magnum shells. 

As with all Saiga 12's, this shotgun is not designed to use low pressure shells. 

Saiga 12 gauges come standard with the bolt hold open feature. This allows for a quicker change time between magazines (ideal for hunters and home defense alike). With all of the available accessories on the market for these Saiga 12’s the possibilities are endless. You can convert your Saiga into the AK configuration or leave it in the current configuration.

This shotgun was manufactured utilizing the Kalashnikov gas system. This gas system reduces the felt recoil dramatically and will be a guaranteed hit with every squeeze of the trigger. It will be capable of shooting in either a single shot operation, allowing use of all the gases in order to increase the velocity of the round or in the standard semi-auto mode. 

As with all rifles and shotguns that K-Var offers these will be backed by FIME Group’s standard warranty, hunters, sportsmen, and persons interested in self defense can’t go wrong with this Saiga. 

Summary: Saiga 12 Gauge shotgun, LE Variation, chrome lined smoothbore 19” barrel - This Saiga 12 was manufactured at the World Famous Izhmash Factory in Russia and Imported through FIME Group LLC in Las Vegas, Nevada. This semi auto shotgun is featured original and added features configuration from Saiga. Will shoot both 2 3/4 “and 3” magnum. Bolt-Lock option and One-Shot or Semi-Auto Adjustable Gas tube, Black Stock Set, Warsaw Pact length Buttstock, RPK Handguard, Pistol Grip.

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR15/M16 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock."

I will include 2 30 round steel magazines with it, as well as the factory 10 round magazine which has been fitted to work with the bullet guide that was installed. 

Here's a parts list of what's all on the rifle-

* 8.5"" ACE skeleton stock 
* 1"" ACE extended buttpad 
* CSS Round bullet guide
* ACE folding mechanism
* CSS Internal receiver block
* CSS Billet bolt on trigger guard
* Tapco G2 trigger group
* Roninsgrips Mongo Grip

* Ultimak gas tube optic mount
* Primary Arms Micro Dot
* VLTOR offset scout flashlight mount
* Surefire G2X Flashlight
* ACE folding mech sling swivel

I'd also be willing to sell the rifle for $1025 without the flashlight/mount, MS3 sling, and the red dot sight. The buyer must have a valid Ohio drivers license and be willing to sign a bill of sale. I'd also prefer the buyer had a valid CCW license if possible too."

The FNS™ is an all-new autoloading service pistol design introduced to law enforcement in 2011. The FNS™ offers the simplicity of double-action striker-fired operation combined with the proven ergonomics of the FNX™ platform. The manual safety levers, slide stop levers and magazine release buttons are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel, and the checkered polymer frame has two interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

I bought this pistol for 700 dollars new.  I have decided just to continue to use my glock 19.  Full disclosure - the pistol was not fully striking the primers when I bought it.  I had to replace the striker channel liner, presumably due to damage during removal, installation, or factory cerakote.  There are minor scratch marks on the rear sight.  The gun functions reliably now, and the 200 round count is from testing.

Buyer pays background check and ffl transfer.

Price is firm.  This is a full ccw ready to carry kit."

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a brand new, factory fresh, and hard to find Springfield 1911 TRP Operator .45 acp semi-auto pistol.  This beautiful pistol features G10 grips, Armory Kote finish, night sights, tac rail, and a whole host of performance upgrades!

I just have 1  in stock, and it’s priced to sell for just $1,449.00.

Springfield PC9105LP 1911 TRP Operator, 45 ACP, 5 in, G10 Grips, Armory Kote Finish, Night Sights, Tac Rail, 7 Rd
The TRP standard line is designed around the same specifications as the FBI contract pistol, the TRP-PRO model. The Springfield TRP offers nearly the same performance and features as the TRP-PRO model at a fraction of the cost. From its fully checkered front strap and mainspring housing, to its durable Armory Kote Teflon or stainless steel finish, this gun can only be described as a knock out value.
The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.
TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.
