Custom shaved Hammer for Lighter Trigger Pull (Heavy spring also included)
5.45x39 surplus ammo generally requires a stiffer spring in order to sufficiently strike the primer. This results in a heavier trigger pull. In order to avoid this, I shaved down the hammer, lowering its weight and thus increasing its velocity. This results in a successful primer strike 100% of the time, without the heavier trigger pull. A heavier spring is also provided, should you prefer that option.

The Patent Pending Vickers Combat Applications Sling™ has revolutionized the way we carry automatic rifles. Developed with industry friend, firearms expert, and former 1st SFOD- Delta operational member Larry Vickers, the Vickers Combat Applications Sling™ incorporates key features from real world experience that makes the sling effective and durable - the choice sling requested by name. The Vickers Combat Applications Sling™ has been our most popular product of all- with service in every branch of service here at home as well as several foreign militaries.

Able to quickly transition from carrying a slung rifle comfortably to combat ready, the patent pending Quick Adjuster has bridged the gap between the two primary uses of weapon slings – from transporting to fighting. All VCAS™ Slings are built with precision and pride right here at home in the US with superior materials.

TEX 90 bonded nylon thread – never had a sling returned for stitching failure
Invista Solution Dyed CORDURA® webbing – low IR, soft enough for comfort but stiff enough to prevent rolling and hardening
ITW Acetal Hardware – Ghillie-Tex™ low IR military grade plastic reduces noise and weight (on acetal models only)
Differentiated Adjuster pull tab – different color stands out enough for quick adjustment, tactile indicator for use in the dark or with gloved hands.
To provide greater versatility, no attachment hardware is included but can still be threaded through existing slings loops. This sling can be combined with most hardware enabling the CAS to attach to almost any weapon.

As with all Blue Force Gear, it is made with excellence in the USA and carries a limited lifetime warranty."

Many upgrades have been done to this rifle. The archangel stock allows for adjustable cheek weld and shoulder placement. I cerakoted the rifle sniper gray. The bolt was cerakoted black. It has an adjustable timney trigger set at 2.5 lbs trigger pull. 6-9 quality bipod has been installed as well. It has an ATI turn down bolt and rail. I tapped the receiver on a drill press to install the rail so you can use rifle scopes. Without this modification you are limited to pistol scopes.

I've put about 40 rounds thru it.
The kit includes the complete upper assembly, and 2, 10 round mags.
The kit is compatible with Glock 29, 29SF, 30, and 30SF.
1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR Conversion Kits for the GLOCK pistol.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot."

1911 in .45ACP 
High Standard – Double Nine (.22 LR)

If you are sending me a trade offer let me know the value you place on your trade. If it’s a high estimate or I’m not familiar with aspects of the firearm (accessories, private manufacturers, etc.) I may ask for a price breakdown, that’s not to insult you it’s to better inform me. If your trade is worth more we’ll work that out too.

I bought the rifle to teach my grandchildren how to shoot but they just aren't really interested. I have several other .22 rifles so I don't really need to keep this one. It has only had 150 or so rounds through it. There are a few small paint chips on top of the receiver where a scope was mounted and one very small ding in the stock that is shown. Other than that it is clean. I can meet FTF in the Ashland area evenings or if you are from the Cleveland area I work just off of the I90 / Detroit rd exit in Sheffield Village and can meet at work.

It has a Yankee Hill quadrail handguard and muzzle brake direct from bushmaster. High quality upper is in mint condition and the removable carry handle has military sized apertures in the adjustable sight. I've had a scope mounted directly to the upper using standard height rings and the front sight didn't obstruct it at all. I also am including the handle mounted see thru scope rail that allows you to use the iron sights with the scope mounted. Soft rail covers and the slanted foregrip is also included. Very accurate polygonal rifled chrome lined barrel is very accurate. Less than 100 rounds fired through this upper and not a single failure. The gun cost $1400 new so I think $625 is a great deal for the like new upper.

The PCR is identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, but thanks to its forged aluminum alloy frame it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator. 
 Must have valid Mo ID and sign bill of sale. Thanks."

It is a special configuration. Also called by some a ""FRANKENSIG"". It is not found in Sig catalog. It is assembled with parts that are not normally found together on their regular catalog products. This gun is built on the MK25 frame with the mil spec picitinny rail, standard Sig slide with the short extractor. The grips are the E2 ergonomic stippled. It also has the Sig light night sights and my favorite the SRT (SHORT RESET TRIGGER). Need to sell to pay rent or risk getting kicked out. $700 dollar price is FIRM and very fair for gun that it is. May entertain $500 cash plus small caliber carry gun of $200 or so value I would put condition at an A with an A+ being new. Has less than 1000 rounds but I honestly didn't keep track. The wear on the gun is exactly the way this model Sig should wear. Please help me make rent this month. Hard times call for desperate meaures. This is my favorite gun I have and has been my primary HD pistol. Also easy to carry. Comes with box and paperwork as well as 2 15 round mags. A lot more pics if needed.

It's in perfect shape with less than 400 rounds fired (I think only 340 but I'm not positive), but round count shouldn't even matter because of the manufacturer's unconditional no questions asked lifetime warranty, every single part is guaranteed for life!
It's about as loaded as these can be (and still be practical) with a multi-colored laser dot scope, tactical light, flash suppressor, 3 position folding front grip (with a multi-tool inside for field stripping and cleaning), 4 magazines, a brand new padded sling, a carry case and I'm even throwing in a bore snake for easier cleaning.
It's one of the funnest guns you'll ever shoot. The 16.5"" barrel shoots regular ole 9mm FMJ 115 grain target loads up to over 1,500 feet per second with 575 foot pounds of energy, yet there's virtually no recoil with this gun (it's like shooting a .22 rifle) letting you have follow up shots as fast as you can squeeze the trigger AND actually still hit the bullseye each and every time! But it's not just a fun gun, you could easily load this with some real nice +P or even +P+ hollow points and have a very nice home defense or truck gun that pretty much the whole family could use (regardless of their height or strength) because of how user friendly and easy to use this carbine really is. 
Like I stated, I've fired less than 400 rounds through it, all were flawless and I clean every one of my firearms after each range trip. 250 or so rounds were various FMJ's playing around with different speeds and weights for fun and 100 were 115 grain JHP's that I carry in my handgun (same caliber keeps things simple in a SHTF scenario) ... the ballistics gel reacted as if I had fired hot .357's out of my 6"" barrel S&W; I was very surprised and impressed with the permanent cavity and the penetration! Unless you live in bear country, this will easily stop whatever threat you or your loved ones might face in your home.
I would keep this carbine forever, but I'm moving to Spain and then Germany (for work) for at least 4 years and perhaps even longer, so I'm selling my firearms instead of going through all the hassle of trying to ship them over and get them registered when I'll still be a US citizen. 
I'm not interested in any trades right now because we're selling just about everything we own (easier than shipping or storing for several years) and any new stuff I'd get, we'd just have to figure out how to ship or store that as well.
I'm also willing to sell 600 rounds of 9mm FMJ's for an extra $150.00 to the buyer if you want some affordable ammo.
Thanks for looking!

raiders carried Sharps carbines at Harper’s Ferry. And when the Civil War began carbine versions were ordered for the cavalry.

After the war the American Rifle Team used Sharps rifles adapted to fire metallic cartridges to win the first international long-range rifle match. In 1874 after 700 

Comanche warriors attacked 30 buffalo hunters in the Texas panhandle the hunters used their Sharps rifles to exact a punishing toll. By the early 1880s the long-range 

models had become the favorites of professional buffalo hunters because of their long-range capability."

The rounds were shot with the open sights.  Will include an extra 10 round mag and 100+ rounds (2 full boxes and the remaining rounds from the first box. Federal Game Shok and CCI Maxi Mag). $300, anything less than that and I will keep the extras.  

The next item is a Smith and Wesson Shield in 40 SW.  Bought August 11th 2014.  Does have the safety.  1 7 round mag and 1 6 round mag.  I put 2 7 round mags and 1 6 round mag through it.  Good little shooter.  $400 Firm. asking price will include a 50 round box of Blazer ammo .  

The ONLY trade I am interested in is a GEN 4 Glock 27 in near new condition.  Should include everything that came in the box.

The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols. The P239 is available in three calibers – 9mm, .357SIG or .40S&W – offering you the choice that’s right for you.

Title basically says it all. 5 shot LNIB 2014 S&W .44 Magnum with 4 inch barrel on the S&W L Frame, original box and paperwork. Perfect size revolver, shoots .44 special too.

Comes with extra Hogue grip, looks awesome, not seen in pictures (Email for it and I'll snap a few.)

Only fired 50 rounds through it a few weekends ago to feel the power, thing is awesome. Guess I just want other things more at the moment. 

Cost $729.99 NEW 2 months back before any ammo or the grip, MSRP is $849.99. Ammo was around $300, at about 4 boxes of .44 special and a box of 40+ .44 Magnum hollows

So the package NEW is worth >$950 New and $850 used fairly since it did see 50 rounds. Not looking to sell it really just saying what I see the trade value of this package at. Always open to compromise. Let me know what you got!"
