Cycles flawlessly, however the bolt release sometimes sticks in the upward position (happened to me 3 times so far) all it requires is to lock bolt to the rear and press down on an extended metal piece inside the chamber.

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

45,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3494045,For Sale:  ALG Defense ACT Advanced Combat Trigger,"Largo, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 64,"Listed On: Thursday, December 24, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The ALG Defense Advanced Combat Trigger (ACT) is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the ACT is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however it is sharper and the grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the traditional reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs. HardLubing is ALG's term for electroless Nickel plating with an integral modifier to the base nickel plate. Either Boron or Teflon is used to enhance surface hardness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance and also create favorable tribological properties of the trigger components. Testing has shown that differential coating of the trigger parts contributes to the sharpness of the ACT's single stage pull. The trigger component is plated with Nickel-Boron which has a high surface hardness combined with excellent wear resistance. The color is a pleasing matte light grey that may be painted on non-functional surfaces if the shooter so desires (such as the trigger bow that is visible outside the lower receiver). The hammer, disconnector and trigger/hammer pins are plated with Nickel-Teflon which combines a low coefficient of friction with good wear resistance. The Teflon impregnation colors the metal a mottled, greyish/green. Parts coated with Nickel-Teflon cannot be painted. Both coatings are highly corrosion resistant eliminating the oil seal of traditional phosphated firearm components."

This is a great package and price to get you out there and bag you a deer or turkey. I have a Diamond Liberty bow for sale from the maker of Bowtech. This is a great shooting bow and has killed deer and turkey's in the past couple of years. It is currently set up with a drop-away rest and a 4 pin sight. This bow is very fast and quiet shooter. Just wanting something different and like to change things up. I am selling it as a ready to hunt package. I am going to sell it with 5 Carbon Express arrows already set up for the sights. Also will include with 3 100 grain Muzzy Mx-4 broad heads. These are in a Trophy Ridge quiver. These are the same arrow and broadhead setup that took a nice northern Mo buck last fall. It does come with a stabilizer just not pictured in the ad.  Even to sweeten the package so you can buy the bow and go shoot it 5 mins later, I will include a True-Fire release. Let say this again there is nothing wrong with this bow package just switching to a new setup. This will not last long as this package due to Missouri bow season open now.  Will listen to any reasonable offers, interested in 1911.  Thank you for taking time to look at this post. Thanks and have a great day.  Contact Brad by email or phone 417/353-801three"

The pistol has around 400 rounds down range, but has been cleaned after every use.  It's a straight shooter, and is great for concealed or open carry.  The price is pretty firm, and I'm not really looking to trade, unless you have an officer sized 1911 in .45 that you'd like to part with. I am willing to ship to your local FFL, and will travel within 50 miles of my home to make the deal. Thanks for looking!!"

This  old  4 inch, .357 Magnum  war horse has a serial number that indicates a 1974-76 born on date. I am told it spent a career in a Connecticut Highway Patrolman’s holster.  Holster wear is evident but that’s all there is. No misuse or mistreatment here. . Bright bore, extremely tight lock-up and timing is perfect. Last year when S&W factory Smith was in Montgomery, I had a complete action job done on it. It is perfect internally. Hasn’t been fired since the action job. Buttery smooth and has awesome double action and single action triggers. The cosmetics are the only flaw on this revolver. It has Magna grips as you can see, white outlined rear sight although the white is fading, a red ramp front sight, a target trigger and is pinned and recessed.  Incredibly accurate N Frame!  Production ceased on Mod 28s in about 1986."

A favorite among Benelli shotguns, the Benelli Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.

The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever.

These are the lightest AKs out there. Have front vertical foregrip off and was going to weld a pic rail so the front grip would be adjustable. Ill give you the foregrip and you can put it where it was or i will be happy to show you exactly how i was planning on modding it. Also have a real nice brand new in box 7075 rail i think its a damage usa that i would add well below cost for the right trade or price if you were interisted in modding the gun that way. There are a few scratches on the AK. It functions like it should. I have not shot it much and dont need it sence i have two other AKs. The ak is built on a Nordic Spud and is not a garage build parts kit. Very good quality like you would expect from a hungarian build. Need another AR. If you have a high end AR I might trade a fully converted Saiga ak and this one for it. I dont mind low end Ars as long as they are a reputable company.

354,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3494354,For Sale/Trade:  Testo Electronic Refrigerant Manifold and Hoses,"Wheatfield, Crown Point, Indiana",$ 450,"Listed On: Saturday, September 13, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am looking to trade my Refrigeration Manifold for a Handgun or Semi Auto Shotgun.
I will add a Picture below and the description is below as well. Thanks

I have a like new Testo 557 Refrigeration Manifold w/6' Hoses, the manifold cost me $500.00 and the Hoses are Yellow Jacket with the 1' valved extensions. This is a great manifold, I only used it 4-5 times. I am selling it due to having my leg amputated so I dont need it any more.
 See Discription Below

Testo 557 Refrigeration System Analyzer with Vacuum Measurement

The testo 557 four valve manifold with a built in vacuum measurement is the next high performance, low cost Refrigeration System Analyzer from testo. The built in vacuum measurement allows the technician to know when they have reached the limits when evacuating a system. Building upon the easy to use testo 550 platform, the 557 has 2 NTC temperature probe inputs and can simultaneously calculate superheat and subcooling in real time. The 557 is ideal for servicing, maintaining and commissioning all types of air conditioning systems. The 557 will also perform leak tests on AC/R systems with temperature compensation, insuring accurate results. The testo 557 retains the robust housing that protects the analyzer from the everyday bumps and drops. It comes complete with 2 clamp probes, integrated hook, built in hose holders and a hard carrying case.
 Includes digital manifold, 2 clamp probes, batteries, calibration record and hard case

Features
 •Built in Vacuum Measurement
 •Aluminum valve block with 4 connections and built in sight glass
 •2 temperature probe inputs for simultaneous real-time calculation of superheat and subcooling
 •Readings are displayed in seconds
 •Compact easy to use, transport, and setup
 •Large easy to read back-lit display
 •Robust housing that protects the analyzer
 •40 Refrigerants on-board eliminating the need for PT charts
 Sensors:
 •PSI / MPa / Bar / kPa
 •Temperature F / C / K
 •Vacuum Micron / Torr / inH2O / C / inHg / Pa
 •Sensors: Pressure 2 x pressure sensors
 •Temperature 2 x NTC
 •Hose connections 3 x 1/4 SAE, 1x 3/8 SAE
 •Each of the temperature probe leads are 4 feet 9 inches long, tip of clamp to end of wire.

Measuring ranges:
 •Pressure HP/LP (rel): -14.7 to 725 psi / -100 to 5000 kPa -0.1 to 5 MPa/ -1 to 50 bar
 •Temperature: -58 to 302F / -50 to +150C
 •Vacuum (rel) -1 to 0 bar
 •Overload pressure 52 bar, 5200 kPa, 5.2 MPa, 754 psi

Resolution:
 •Pressure 0.01 bar / 0.1 psi / 1 kPa / 0.001 MPa
 •Temperature 0.1C / 0.1F
 •Vacuum 1 hPa / 1 mBar / 0.5 Torr / 0.5 inH2O / 0.02 inHg / 500 Micron / 100 Pa Accuracy (@ 22C/71.6F):
 •Pressure 0.5% fs (1 digit)
 •Temperature 0.5 C (1 digit)
 •Vacuum 1% fs (1 digit)
 NOTE: When testing the 557 and 570 we found the vacuum sensor resolution a little lackluster. A 500 micron resolution will tell you are in a vacuum, and if the gauge reads 0 microns you are somewhere below 500, but that is all. For high vacuum resolution we recommend the BluVac Digital Micron Gauge used with core tools to isolate hoses from the system.

Aside from the aesthetic features of the BPS Medallion, it still retains the rock solid construction that makes the BPS line stand apart from the competition.

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR15/M16 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock.

This is the ""Sig Anti-Snag"" model of the P229, so the frame and slide have undergone a dehorning process at the Sig Custom Shop that leaves them much smoother, allowing for a quicker, easier draw (please note that this model's frame does NOT feature a rail -- it is designed for concealed carry use).  The pistol features the factory Sig night sights, as well as the SRT (short reset trigger), which allows for quicker followup shots.  This model features the newer E2 one-piece grip.  I have also installed the thin trigger in this pistol, but the original thicker trigger is included and can be easily swapped out. 

This was my daily carry weapon, and it has been extremely well-maintained.  The pistol was purchased new, and has had a total of 850 rounds through it (no reloads or steel-cased ammunition), without a single failure-to-fire or failure-to-eject.  The firearm was cleaned thoroughly and re-greased after each range trip, and I performed regular full detail strip cleanings to remove any debris from daily carry.  The pistol is in excellent condition, and functions flawlessly.  

Included with the pistol are 3 factory 15-round magazines (MAG-229-9-15-E2), the grip removal tool, the original factory trigger, the manual, the original slide block, a gun lock, and the original case.  

I'm asking $750 for the entire package.  I also have a N82 Tactical Professional holster for this pistol, which is the most comfortable holster I have ever worn.  It features a hard plastic retention section, a leather with neoprene filling, and a smooth suede backing.  The E2 grip texture is quite aggressive, so having a holster like this that covers the whole grip is MUCH more comfortable.  I will sell the holster for an additional $25.  Please send me a message if you are interested, or if you have any questions.  Thanks!"

The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 AUTO offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber.

(The ""S"" prefix was 1926-1932. The ""S"" referred to the engineering change made to the ejector assembly. The Inspectors ""star"" was nothing more than a marketing gimmick. It could be found somewhere on almost every Marlin, from 1926-1941.The tang sight is a Lyman #2.) From a collector that sent me more info than I had before the first years of production, serial # S 4420. Early “S” prefix rifles are noted for superior workmanship & fine finish. This rifle also has the 5 pointed inspectors star on the upper tang & the “S” shaped pistol grip. Magazine tube fed lever action take-down rifle, chambered for 22 short, long or long rifle ammo. It has a 24” octagon barrel with what I think is a Lyman #103 tang sight adjustable for elevation , the receiver is case colored. The condition is outstanding , especially considering it is 92 years old. All stampings are sharp & clear, the barrel corners are still sharp, no boogered screws or extra holes & the serial number appears on both halves of the receiver. The bluing shows very little loss & has turned a nice even Patina. There are small pitting issues on the barrel looks like it sat in a gun rack for a decade or two, a few freckles & minor handling marks. The case colors are still visible especially in the protected areas. The stocks are a high grade walnut (2X or 3X?) & have beautiful burled grain. There are no cracks, the wood fits proud to the metal & it has only minor handling marks. The toe has had a chip rounded off The butt plate is hard rubber, checkered & embossed with Marlin. Mechanically sound; functions flawlessly & the take down feature works perfectly with no play or slop between the halves. The bore is bright & shiny with excellent rifling & no frosting. It is obvious that this has seen very little use & has been properly stored. This is one of the earliest Model 39’s known & it will make a nice addition to any collection"
