First off is a Smith and Wesson M&P 9mm VTAC edition with Warrior 6 dot day/night sights. The frame and slide are both FDE.  Comes will box, papers, 2 17 round mags, and a Raven Concealment Phantom Holster. The gun was made in 2014 and has no wear to the PVD finish on the slide.  The top of the barrel where the pistol locks up is starting to get some shine (actually had a little wear from the factory if you can believe that).  Its seen 100-150 rounds not exactly sure on count.

Next up is a Smith and Wesson M&P 9mm shield.  The gun is only about a month old with about 20 rounds through it.  Sweet shooter especially considering the size of the pistol.  It comes with box, papers, one 7 round and one 8 round magazine as well as a 
Galco Ankle Lite holster, and two custom kydex holsters made by a friend of mine.  The Shield shows some wear on the slide from being carried.  I was very disappointed at how weak the finish was on the high points of the slide but it does not seem to be wearing anywhere else.  This gun is a fantastic carry piece and is perfect for summer carry. 

Last but not least is the Beretta M9A1.  This gun is the beast with the rail built into the frame.  If you have ever wanted a beretta, this is the one to get in my opinion.  I was going to keep the gun in a glass case but decided Id rather have something to shoot.  It is in flawless unfired condition. Ive had it since April 2nd and I am the only owner.  It comes with two PVD coated 15 round mags from the factory as well as an 18 round mec-gar mag.  The M9A1 has much improved grip serrations, a beveled magazine well, and 3-dot sights over the standard service M9.

I am looking to trade 2-3 of these for a 1911 with rail.  I am looking for a Springfield TRP Operator (will trade all 3 for) Springfield MC operator, Springfield LW operator , Colt Rail Gun, Kimber Warrior, 1911 tradidional tac ops from sig sauer.

If intersted in buying any of these guns individually, text or email me for price.  I know this is a long ad, thanks for reading. REDACTED"

Five full boxes of Federal shells and 30 leftovers. 

I'll save you the internet searches: Gun goes on this site searches for between 325 and 375 median amount in the US searches.  On the web, budsgunshop, slickguns, and cheaperthandirt are all around the 335 to 346 range. Usually with free shipping to a FFl (with luck you might find one that charges you $20 for the transer). The hogue grip is $10 the cheapest I found, and the real Kahr mags were alway right around $30 each. I'm sure there are cheap knockoffs out there.  The shells are $17 per box of 50 and change the last time I went to Sheels (that's easily $100 in shells with no taxes--I included the 30 loose).  Buy everything searching around the net and maybe in a week, you will have it all for 335, 20ffl, 60clips, 10hogue, 100shells=$525 with no taxes. Go to sheels and maybe get it all today for $600.

I'll sell all for $425 today and even meet a reasonable distance to save on gas. You'll have everything you need except targets. No better deal around. I'm estimating everything low including the shells btw. Just realized that I forgot to include the $30 holster above, so the price is firm.

""The Benelli SuperSport is the ultimate in speed for shooters looking for a fast trap shotgun, competition shotgun, or sporting clays shotgun. The SuperSport's ComforTech recoil-dampening system allows the shooter to recover for the critical second shot up to 69% faster than with other comparable shotguns - that's fast! Couple the quick recovery speed with a ported barrel that keeps muzzle climb to a minimum, and it's doubly fast. The ComforTech system's special gel recoil pad and comb insert reduce felt recoil by up to 48% compared to the competition."""

Here is something that I am in no hurry to get out of, but do not carry or shoot. I am listing my beautiful beretta 92FS, INOX. This pistol was built in 1998, well before beretta began using plastic internal components. It has never been carried, and has sat in a safe in a coat of oil, only being shot on rare occasions. YOU WILL NOT SEE ANOTHER ONE LIKE THIS! The weapon has the original box, three mags, original grips, and an extra set of houge hand-all grips with it. It is FLAWLESS, internally and externally. There isn't any carry wear, firing wear, or damage to be seen. It's hands down, amazing.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A."

I've put around 200 (liberal estimate) Tulammo through it and it shoots very well, about as accurate as you can expect from a gun from an AK plant in the motherland.

It has a nifty (read: cheap but holds zero) side optic mount. Also 4 ten round factory saiga magazines and a cleaning rod. If I find the cleaning kit I'll add that as well, although they're super cheap online.

For $600 you get everything listed above AND a primary arms micro dot with a left hand dial and everything that came with it plus an extra battery.

148,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3150148,For Sale:  2000 Ford F-350 XLT Extended Cab 4x4 7.3 PowerStroke tow package auto,"Morris County, New Jersey, United States","$ 5,600","Listed On: Sunday, August 24, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"2000 Ford F-350 XLT Extended Cab (with both rear open doors), utility body, 4x4 (with the preferred warn locking hubs), power accessories, 250K miles on the legendary 7.3 Powerstroke Diesel, automatic transmission, aluminum wheels, black exterior, and gray interior. The truck comes with the power chip for enhanced performance and increased fuel economy (the OEM one as well.) Ford replaced the 7.3 engine to the less desirable and dramatically less reliable 6.0 engine after 2003. The 7.3 was made by the International Truck Company for Ford and has a reputation of lasting forever. 

The truck is pre-owned and has signs of use and wear, as you can see from the pictures. While the truck could benefit from a good cleaning, it runs great, without any warning lights illuminating on the dashboard. The front bumper has some chrome rusting, the body could use a compounding to remove some marks, please see pictures as that is the best way to learn of the exact condition of the truck. 

The interior includes molded rubber matching gray floor mats (driver, passenger, and rear.) The drivers seats has some the normal wear with rips on the bottom cushion, it has an Alpine CD player, vent shades, tinted windows, extra interior gauges, sun visor, roof mounted amber lights, tinted windows, running boards, engine block heater (plug in front of truck), tow package (hitch and electrical plug), three extra alloy wheels, and two extra wheels with tires already mounted on them (in the bed.) The truck recently has two new batteries added to it, new alternator, fan belt, new front brakes, and includes a brand new seat of brake pads for the rear. It even includes the tool necessary to remove the fuel filter. 

The utility body on the truck is badly rusted and will need attention or removal with replacement. The owner was going to replace it with a regular bed however decided to downgrade to a smaller truck. As you can see from the pictures the bed of the truck has rusted through spots, as do many of the compartments. I was unable to open the two drawer compartments (over the tire) and did not want to force them open. The truck is being sold for the value without the utility body. The truck was never used to plow snow and is a great opportunity for someone to have a full size truck that will not have any hidden costs in the future (tires, brakes, battery's, alternator, belts, fuel filter & removal tool, etc.) 

If you would like to see more pictures of the truck, please contact me as I have an online album with well over 150 detailed high resolution pictures, a video of the dashboard running without any warning lights illuminating, and a video of the engine running flawlessly."

First let me state that none of this rifle is ""PTAC"". ""PTAC"" is a sub-par brand that PSA sells. 100% of this rifle is PSA and EVERYTHING is marked such, even down to the SQR(Slim Quad Rail), and the carbine buffer, with Palmetto's logo. I Keep seeing people selling PTAC on here but calling it PSA, so be careful. If it looks too good to be true, it likely is.
Now on to the goodies:
Want something better then the run of the mill AR? Here is a custom PSA PA-15 Less than 2 months old.  I got it for my wife. She wanted light weight rifle with a long rail, and a low recoil.  The SQR feels amazing, much like the rails used on competition rifles, except you still get the quad rails. She loves it but wants something even lighter........Its detailed in “Zombi” Green as she wanted. Its just acrylic fill, can be rubbed out with spirits or you can change the color very easy, but wont rub out with CLP or cleaner of your choice. Rifle shoots flawlessly, the wife cuts out the 3” circle stickers we use with no magnification at 100 yards.  Its been fired 2 times, 3 boxes the first time and 2 the second so 100 rounds total.  Around $1400 in this package. Taking a huge loss for an amazing rifle.  Buyer must be 18+ with a valid Va ID and bill of sale. Good Guy card is a plus. For more info or pictures of anything just contact me.

Spikes lower with spider logo, spikes lower parts kit, Spikes T2 buffer, Spikes buffer tube and spider logo M4 stock. The only thing on the lower not Spikes are the take down pins which I swapped out for Yankee Hill EZ pull pins. These lowers are currently on an 8-12 month backorder according to Spikes' website. The lower has just recently been mounted to the upper but not yet fired.

The upper was purchased from BCM. Its a BFH upper with a 16"" cold hammer forged midlength barrel, BCM comp mod 0 compensator, VTAC TRX extreme 13"" rail, Spikes BCG and mil-spec charging handle. Also has the VTAC rail mounted QD attachment. Round count 200-300. Not a single mark on the upper.

Included is the Lone Wolf barrel with low round count.  Last year I paid extra to have the factory engraving placed on the underside of the barrel chamber so the exposed top would look smooth and professional.  This is no longer an option with new barrels, which I think makes it  look a bit cheesy.

I am also including with the package a barrel thread protector (not included with new barrels), and more importantly a Factory Gen 4 G17 recoil spring.  Using the stronger G22 factory spring can cause malfunctions since the 40SW spring is to powerful for the 9mm rounds to operate consistently."

Similar in appearance to Browning's (FN Herstal) P-35 model ""Hi-Power"" pistol, the BDM was actually a new design created to compete in service trials as a standard issue pistol for the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. However, the BDM was not ultimately adopted for issue by the FBI, and was instead sold only in the private market.

The Browning BDM was developed in 1991 by the Browning Arms Company, and unlike Browning's (FN Herstal) P-35 Hi-Power model, was manufactured only in North America.

The pistol is a magazine fed, self-loading, hammer firing type which was designed with a trigger ""mode"" switch installed on the left-hand side of the slide (actually only a flush inlaid disk with a bisecting groove), toggling between double-action/single-action(DA/SA) pistol mode, and the double-action-only (DAO) or ""revolver"" mode—though, of course, other than the similarity of the trigger mode, the BDM has no resemblance to revolvers. This mode switch is what gives the handgun its name, with BDM standing for ""Browning Dual Mode"" or ""Browning Double Mode"".

Variants of the design lacked the mode operating switch, and so were either full-time revolver mode, model BRM (Browning Revolver Mode), or full-time double action/single action pistol mode, model BPM-D (Browning Pistol Mode Decocker). Finishes included blued, matte-chromed, which Browning advertising called ""silver chrome"", and a two-toned combination of a silver chromed frame and blued slide, called the ""practical"" finish.

The BDM and BPM-D variants have an ambidextrous slide-mounted safety/decocker lever, which when operated always returns the pistol to the hammer down double-action setting for the BDM variant or to the pre-cocked setting for the BPM-D variant. After the next fired cartridge cycles the pistol's slide, subsequent rounds are fired in the single-action mode, until the decocker is used to drop the hammer to the ""safe"" position. The BPM-D innovation was the inclusion into the action of the pre-cocked mode in which the hammer is partially cocked and the hammer spring partially depressed resulting in a first shot trigger pull that is shorter and lighter than in the true DA variants. The BRM variant lacks a safety/decocker lever, leaving the pistol in the hammer down ""safe"" double-action position after every shot, i.e. DAO.

The BDM and its variants utilize removable cartridge magazines, of the double stack variety with a capacity of 15 rounds of 9x19mm Parabellum ammunition. To comply with the 1994 U.S. Assault Weapons legislation, BDM magazines were limited to 10 round capacity for civilian purchasers, although 15 round magazines were available for law enforcement use. After the 2004 expiration of the 1994 U.S. Assault Weapons legislation, 15 round magazines became legal and available in most states for civilian use.

391,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3150391,For Sale:  Winchester 1892 32WCF,"Windsor, Fort Collins, Colorado","$ 1,299","Listed On: Sunday, November 23, 2014",Rifles,Winchester                                                                                ,no type,no type,Rifle,"14-9031 This one is a 1909 Manufacture!!

The Winchester Model 1892 was a lever-action repeating rifle designed by John Browning as a smaller, lighter version of his large-frame Model 1886, and which replaced the Model 1873 as the company's lever-action for pistol-caliber rounds such as the .44-40.

When asked by Winchester to design an improved pistol caliber lever action, John Browning said he would have the prototype completed in under a month or it would be free. Within 2 weeks, Browning had a functioning prototype of the 92.[2] Calibers for the rifle vary and some are custom-chambered. The original rounds were the .32-20, .38-40, and .44-40 Winchester centerfire rounds, followed in 1895 by the new .25-20.[3] A few Model 92's chambered for .218 Bee were produced in 1936-38.[3]

The Winchester Models 53 (1924) and 65 (1933) were relabeled Model 1892's. Admiral Robert E. Peary carried an 1892 on his trips to the North Pole.,[3] and Secretary of War Patrick Hurley was presented with the one millionth rifle on December 13, 1932.

1,007,608 Model 1892 rifles were made by Winchester, and although the company phased them out by 1945, they are still being made under the Puma label by the Brazilian arms maker, Rossi, by Chiappa Firearms, an Italian factory, and by Browning in Japan. In its modern form, using updated materials and production techniques, the Model 1892's action is strong enough to chamber high pressure handgun rounds, such as .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, and .454 Casull. Despite being designed for smaller cartridges, the 1892's dual forward locking-block action is actually stronger than Browning's rear-locked Model 1894.[4]

Although the Model 1892 made its debut after the closing of the American frontier, and the true ""Guns that Won the West"" were the earlier Models 1866 and 1873, nonetheless the '92 became an indelible icon of Western mythology through its use in hundreds of motion pictures and television shows, standing in for its older siblings. John Wayne famously carried Model 92s in dozens of films and owned several personally, some with the distinctive oversized ""loop"" lever. Other notable screen 92s were those of Chuck Connors in The Rifleman TV series, and Steve McQueen's ""Mare's Leg"" in Wanted: Dead or Alive.[5]

Hollywood studios purchased the '92 in quantity because it was in regular production (until World War II) but looked sufficiently like Old West Winchesters to substitute for valuable antiques, and because in calibers .44-40 and .38-40 it could fire, together with the Colt Single Action Army ""Peacemaker"" revolver, the standard Five-in-One blank cartridge. This latter practice mirrored the real cowboys, who found it convenient to carry a rifle and a revolver chambered with the same ammunition.

430,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3150430,For Sale:  1983 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme ONLY 26K miles mint interior,"Roxbury NJ, New Jersey, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, January 18, 2015",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"1983 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme with only 26,800 miles with a 3.8 liter V6 and an automatic transmission. This car was owned by one family (2 owners were sisters) and is in amazing shape. The exterior is a light brown while the interior is brown. This car has several features including power windows, door locks, cruise control, rear defroster, air conditioning, and a factory cassette stereo system. 

 The interior is in amazing condition as it does not have any rips, tears, or stains. The arm rest is in good working condition as well as the seat belts do not show signs of wear. Many people including myself feel these cars have extremely comfortable seats. The car was never smoked in and the three ashtrays (two of the ashtrays are behind the driver & passenger seat) and cigarette lighter are clean, not showing signs of use. 

 The car has the original floor mats for all four seating areas and they are also in great shape (free of stains, tears, or rips.) The trunk area is extremely clean, not showing any rust while the factory black carpet looks is in mint condition. The spare tire and jack are also free of rust, properly mounted, and do not look like they have ever been used. The original diagrams are attached to the trunk lid on spare tire usage (one is taped on.) 

 The car has new white wall tires and mechanically has always been maintained. Currently the fluids look clean while the air filter looks brand new. The car has also passed New Jersey vigorous emissions standards and has a valid inspection sticker.

 Like all vehicles with age this car shows signs of exterior wear and I will list whatever defects I noticed here. The trunk has some rusty scratches on it. The driver's rear corner looks as if someone backed into something. The front corner roof on the driver's side has a rusty one inch scratch with a small indentation. The vinyl covering on the roof has tears while the trim that goes toward the front of the car is faded. The middle to lower panel on the driver's driver has a large indentation on it. As most of the wear on this car is external, please see the pictures to determine the exact condition.
 Mechanically the car starts up and all of the options are in working condition. The power stereo antenna struggles to go up thus the owner's mechanic unplugged it leaving it fully extended. The air conditioning does not get cool when it is activated and probably needs to be charged. The car sounds like it could have an exhaust leak and at times a check engine light comes on at times. I believe it is possible that the exhaust system is triggering this however it is not hindering the vehicle running at all. The exhaust system does looks like it's in great condition as it does not show any rot. Two of the wheels are missing the center caps covers. The vehicle does include the factory anti-theft tool to remove the wheels. 

 This is a great opportunity to own a one family female owned, factory original Oldsmobile with only 26,800 miles on it."

Ive only shot 18 rounds through this in its lifetime. I bought it new from a gun shop in MD. I'm ready to sell this  firearm now due to financial reasons. It comes with a really nice pelican case, a mid level scope (nothing special, but totally functional), and the sought after bi-pod for this rifle. At least when I purchased it, they were hard to get your hands on. I paid over 3600 for the rifle alone (with taxes and all), over 260 for the bipod, around 300 for the scope,  and about 200 for the case. So around 4300 dollars total invested. Im looking to get 3000 cash.

I have here a complete optics ready Hogan (Same as POF, used to be the same company) H308.  Gas Piston powered rifle with 16 inch barrel, full rail, 4.5 pound in house trigger with KNS pins.  More information can be found here: 

http://www.hoganguns.com

Breakdown of prices:
Rife - MSRP $2600.00 - new
12 PMAGS - $20.00 new
Magpul CTR with Larue RISR - $135.00 new
Magpul BUIS - $80.00 new
AAC Brakeout - $80.00 new
Slashes heavy buffer designed for gas piston rifles - $145.00 new

Also included
8 magazines worth (160 rounds) Federal Gold Medal Match 168 Grain - $224.00
2 magazines worth (40 rounds) Hornady Amax 168 Grain - $60.00
Additional pistons (2) to tune the rifle to the load you are shooting, similar to having an adjustable gas block on a DI rifle.

So as you can see, this is truly optics ready.  I've included a picture of my last 5 round string at 100m, and called the flyer that can be seen.  Without that one flyer, this is shooting at, or just under 1 MOA.  It is also worth mentioning this was shot in rubber mulch, on a bipod with a sand sock under the rear stock, not in a cradle or sled.

I have put only federal gold medal match 168 and 175 grain, and hornady steel case 155 grain match ammo through this rifle


Round count is at 540 rounds down range.

Not including the ammunition, the total cost was ~$3280.00, I'm asking $2600.00 for everything minus the ammunition, including the ammo will bring you up to $2850.00

There are a few dings on the rifle from use,  so I've chosen what I consider to be a fair price for the rifle, I doubt I'll be lowering it much, but I will entertain reasonable offers.

I'm looking for 5.56 rifles, ammo and such plus cash or additional firearms to meet close to the asking price.  Will reduce overall cost by a few hundred for trades provided the trade offers are good.  I'm really interested in the following:

IWI Tavor (FDE preferred, but black can work too)
Bushmaster ACR (again FDE preferred)
PWS 5.56 rifles
Any others you might have please let me know

Also interested in
FNX Tactical 45 (FDE)

Please don't bother emailing me asking if I'll take a price, and when I reply with either a midway price, or in one case lower the price by removing certain upgrades to meet your price, not reply to my return email, that's messed up, quite frankly.  Don't bother emailing me a price if you don't have the money to back it up, window shop elsewhere on the internet, not here.

706,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3150706,For Sale:  WWII USGI 1911A1 Parts,"Columbus, Columbus, Ohio",$ 450,"Listed On: Sunday, November 16, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is the last of my WWII USGI 1911A1 parts.  These were the 'best of the best' that I was keeping for myself, but my interests have changed.

I know everybody thinks their crap is stuff, and your stuff is crap, but I'll tell you this:  These parts are invaluable if you deal in WWII GI .45s.  It is very common to find an otherwise correct GI 1911A1, that somebody has swapped small parts out on - especially mainspring housings, triggers, and hammers.

As such, these parts have become very sought-after and pricey, as they are necessary to make these expensive collectible guns correct.  Do an advanced search on eBay, and check the box for ""completed listings"", and see what these things are selling for.  

For just one example, a coarse checkered Colt MSH like one that I have here just sold on 5/5 for $195, with NO internals and NO lanyard loop.  Mine has all internals and lanyard loop - and that's just one part.

So, here's what I have:

- Six (6) mainspring housings (two checkered; two 8-rib serrated; two 7-rib serrated.  The finer checkered MSH has the plunger pin but no internals.  One each of the 7-rib and 8-rib MSH has no internals)
- Three (3) short wide-spur hammers (two borderless; one bordered)
- Two (2) stamped triggers (one has what appears to be a Du-Lite blue on it for a US&S)
- Three (3) long tang grip safeties (one has nice worn look; one looks like it's been blued; and one looks like NOS and is ""x"" marked)

I calculated a conservative total value of these parts, based on average ACTUAL SOLD eBay prices - not even using the $195 example.  There is easily over $1000 worth of parts here - I'm not counting the blued grip safety in that number, as - while GI - blued is not right.  

My 'pre-negotiated' price is $450 firm.  The MSHs alone are worth way more than that.  I will only sell them as a lot, so please don't ask for individual prices, or ""how much for just the hammers"", etc.  I'm sorry if that sounds curt, but if I had the time to sell them individually, I'd list them on eBay and make a heap more $$$.  

I would consider a trade for certain WWII collectibles - particularly helmets.  Let me know what you have, the worst I can say is ""no thank you"".  

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you."

Rifle is sweet. I cant say the same about the magazines. They have new 7.62 mags that function better than the AR-stoners. I dont want to put any more money into this thing, i just want it to go to a better home. My loss your gain. Asking $850 or a trade. I have fired maybe 30 rounds through the rifle. I will sell it as an upper/complete with or without red dot vortex sparc optic. but for $850 for the whole thing i think its a bargain considering all you are getting. 8 mags. they have mags your can use this rifle to hunt with from 5,10,20,28,30 available online. feel free to ask me questions. I have the box to the vortex sparc and 6 of the magazines are still in plastic. i probably have the box to the magpul foregrip if its important.

I like .45 and can shoot it fine but it hurts my hands and would prefer a 9mm.  The Ruger was my carry and has some scratches but nothing major could be sanded/buffed out. The grips are good but not perfect, it has been cleaned after every range trip. If you don't know about there for the money are great and based of a 70 not 80 series and do not have a firing pin block and have a titanium firing pin, skeletonized adjustable trigger and Novak low-profile sites factory. 

The Walther P22 is less then a week old and is the Tac version hiviz-front site and comes with the T/B adaptor. It has the regular thread protector and 2 regular front sites as well. 
I have shot around a mag through it but don't want to mess with the break in/pickiness in ammo and don't want to have to stick to CCI ammo just to break it in or after if still picky.
I have a little over of 400rds of .22 some Federal Lighting, and a bit of AE JHPs.

For the .45 I have around 70rds of HPs 45 PMC 185Gr, 5 Speer, and 20 DRT 150Gr frangible JHP.

Have all factory stuff for both and the Ruger has to holsters in OWB/IWB."
