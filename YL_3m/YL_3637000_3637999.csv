Since 1959 the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on should they have to punch out over a remote area. Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.

When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

The receiver is also coated with Teflon™ for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics."

Yes, there are brass marks on the deflector, 100 (flawless) rounds have been fired through it! It's a RRA, it will eat virtually anything ammo. This one however, has had only ""match grade"" ammo put through it. I'm NOT going to go back and forth with the Q&A. I live in Olathe. Just drive over and look at the darn thing for crying out loud. I'm only willing to meet at the local PD for a transaction. Too many lunatics out there. You will have a valid KS ID, a CCW or Badge, and be willing to sign a bill of sale."

The rifle is not matching, which is normal for M38 Mausers, since the Turks built them out of spare parts to the same specifications beginning in 1938. The bore is in good shape because I have cleaned it thoroughly between shooting, and results in good accuracy at 100 yards. 

Included with the rifle are an authentic reproduction Turkish sling (seen attached), and 14 Turkish 5-round stripper clips -- great for the Turkish collector!

I'm asking $300 (or best offer) since this rifle is in really good shape for a Turk Mauser -- most of the time they are beat up beyond recognition and have terrible bores.

Message me if you're interested. I'm looking for face to face sales only -- no shipping across country. I'm also happy to provide additional pictures."

I might consider other trades if you have something interesting; let me know. Please be ready to add cash if your gun is worth less than mine. MSRP new on these is close to $1,600. If you buy it online, you're probably paying close to $1,450 to $1,500 after shipping, credit card and transfer fees.

Includes everything from the factory (two mags, small container of oil, manual, black grips, hard case, etc). Gun is in great shape, but has some holster wear on the slide. I replaced the black grips with green slim line grips from Raasco. Also includes three 8-round CMC mags and two 7-round flush fitting CMC mags.

Blueing is in excellent condition, no scratches. Stock finish is in excellent condition, very nice wood. There are a few very small dents here and there, and there is a very small chip near the top of the buttstock where it meets the recoil pad.

All of this that I described is very very minor and hard to notice. Overall this gun is in excellent condition. Bright shiny bore, smooth action, crisp trigger, and very light rifle. Great shooting gun, I could get all the rounds to touch or better when I shot at 100 yards. Selling to gather funds for a semi rifle.

The slim frame slides into my pant utility pocket and does not print, but I'm on and off the air base too often to conceal carry. 

I purchased a second magazine and a pinky mag extension to make range time more enjoyable. Also included is a hard case and keys for disabling the action. I have a .40 S&W nylon brush which may have come with the gun, I cannot remember, and you are welcome to it if you need one.

Without the additional magazine, this sells new on CheaperThanDirt.com for $334.17. I'll take $250 for this slightly used copy as described. I'll only sell to NE residents with a current handgun purchase permit or concealed handgun permit."

It's a newer Waffen Werks/DDI AK74 in 5.45x39mm.

Waffen Werks had problems in 2013 but DDI bought them out and rebuilt most of their rifles on in-spec receivers.  They are still honoring past warranties and so far all DDI rebuilds have been pretty top notch. This one was rebuilt by DDI.  It passes the bullet test and seems to be put together very well.  Straight sights, decent wood, etc.

This rifle is built on a Bulgarian Circle 10 parts kit with a US made barrel, receiver, pistol grip and fire control group.  The polymer stock is US made and the upper black handguard is marked US made.

Available in traditional wood furniture or black polymer. Comes with 1 Tapco Black AK74 magazine.  I do have a Black Circle 21 also available for an additional $20.

**AMMO NOTICE**
This rifle did not perform well with Red Army Standard 69gr 5.45x39mm.  If you read online you can see others are having issues with the same ammo. I would stay away from RAS 69gr.  Performed flawlessly with Wolf 60gr 5.45x39mm.

Took a couple different pics to show the stock with flash and without.  Armorers reading as shown in pics.  Comes with a CMP hard case, manual and one enbloc clip.  I am not an expert on Garands, but from what I know, this has the circle loop trigger guard, a P cartouche and appears to have a new Springfield Armory barrel, date code 2-65 on the barrel.  I do not know what year the receiver was made.  If you haven’t heard, CMP is running out of these legends and lead times are high, and prices just went up.

The 5.56 PDW Tactical Elite 7.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system. Because the piston chamber is the same size as the chamber on the rest of the Adams Arms gas lengths this 7.5"" upper now has the proper dwell time to get cyclic rate and bullet velocity needed to make this a viable short barreled option for any CQB scenarios. We've also added a 7"" Samson free floating Evolution forearm giving the shooter the ultimate tactical option in a personal defense weapon. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper.
