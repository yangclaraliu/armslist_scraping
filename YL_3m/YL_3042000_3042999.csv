     First is a handmade fighting knife made in Nepal by GK&Co. Kukris House ($100).

The knife has some light scratches on the side of the blade from sheath wear, but no other damage. The price new is $699 (Link: http://www.coldsteel.com/Product/35ATCJ/SAN_MAI_III_GURKHA_KUKRI.aspx) but, I am asking $350.

    The last piece is an increasingly rare item, a vintage Buck model 102— a small hunters knife with a fully-enclosed leather sheath.

Here is what HK has to say:

The HK45 was developed as a product improvement of the highly regarded USP45, first released in the 1995. The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.

Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.

An improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45 is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull."

 Certified CCH Instructor
 NRA Instructor

 By completing this class you will then be eligible to apply for your Kansas Carry Conceal License through the Attorney General's office.

 The class covers CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Self Defense, and Interaction with Law Enforcement. 

 There is a written exam along with a shooting test. You don't need to worry about either test as I give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course. 

 I have no minimums on my classes and will NOT cancel them because I don't have enough people for the class. One person is all it takes.

If you don't have a pistol yet I have a .22 Rugger that you may use. it is free to use my pistol If you bring ammo with you (it shoots .22 long rifle) or you may purchase ammo from me for an additional $5.

shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and

and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

Probably one of the best sporting guns in it's price range and easily on par with some of my personal favorites that are 3-5x the price, both in looks and shooting. Overall condition is very good with normal wear from the few times I was able to get out with it. There is a fracture in the walnut fore grip but it is not very noticeable and has no negative effect on the gun mechanically or otherwise. Comes with a hard case and 3 chokes. Superb beginner sporting shotgun or use as a reliable backup for the range. If you aren't familiar with this model I recommend you do some independent research online and you will see this gun has a very nice reputation all around.

Gen4 Glock 19 with custom milled slide for Trijicon RMR. Work done by Richard Klaus, a highly regarded gunsmith in Fort Wayne. Has lightly polished trigger assembly for slightly lighter pull and crisp, clean break. Test fired only to function test the RMR. 
Comes with all factory accessories, and 3 mags.

Due to the hardness of the Glock slide, there was some bluing that occurred as a result of heating up during the milling process. This does not affect functionality in any way, shape, or form. I can refer you to a reputable painter who does excellent cerakote work, or I can have the slide painted the color or your choice for an additional 80 dollars. Or just leave it as-is, and shoot the heck out of it!

    The UTS-15 Tactical Shotgun is the world’s best 12GA pump-action shotgun with two 7-round alternately feeding or selectable magazine tubes. The UTS-15 is constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer, making the UTS-15 weight 6.9 lbs. Easy to point and even easier to handle, the UTS-15 tactical shotgun is a must-own for any true firearm enthusiast. The top mounted picatinny rail of the UTS-15 allows for mounting a variety of compatible iron and optical sights, which coupled with useful Beretta-style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to virtually any situation. UTS-15 choke tube pictured is not included.

With bayonet and pouches and oil can. I'm figuring the numbers do not match. The original numbers are all replaced with etched numbers, in the steel. But the new etched numbers DO ALL MATCH on all components. I read on the Web that after the rifles were captured/surrendered, back in the war,  they were then disassembled then put back together (at a later date) in a random order and the newly assembled parts were re-numbered (via etching on the steel) after assembly.  This may or may not be true, but I read it in several different places. 
I bought several Mosins a while back- for some projects (Arch Angel and Blugrass thumbhole stocks, with scopes) and saved this one because the wood looked too nice to do the stock swap. I am done with my mosin projects and will not use this one. I paid $160.00 for it, I want $160.00 back. Or I will trade it for a 12 or 20 gauge or a .22 rifle or handgun. Maybe a HiPoint 9 or 40. I just want something back of near value or the 160.00 I spent on it.
I have never fired it, but everything works smoothly. The wood is not perfect, but it is a nice reddish color that looked a lot better than than the others that I bought. I couldn't bring myself to ""modify"" this one. The others had  junk wood so it was an easy decision. It has the Russian hammer stamp on it. 
I will post pics later when I get home and the year of the rifle."

485,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3042485,For Sale:  WaterBOB Emergency Drinking Water Storage (100 Gallons) Brand New,"Broomfield, North Denver, Denver, Colorado",$ 24,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 1, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"NEVER BE WITHOUT WATER
The waterBOB® is a water containment system that holds up to 100 gallons of fresh drinking water in any standard bathtub in the event of an emergency. Constructed of heavy duty food grade plastic, the waterBOB® keeps water fresh and clean for drinking, cooking, washing and flushing. Water stored in an open bathtub, with dirt, soap film and exposure to debris will spoil and become useless.

During a hurricane or tropical storm, water main breaks and storm surges can interrupt or even contaminate your water supply. It is during these conditions the waterBOB® may be used for temporary water storage. Constructed of heavy duty plastic that is FDA compliant for food storage, the waterBOB® keeps water fresh and clean for up to 16 weeks. 

The waterBOB® is very easy to use. Simply lay the liner in any standard bathtub, attach the fill sock to the faucet and fill the bladder to capacity, which takes approximately 20 minutes. A siphon pump is included to easily dispense the water into jugs or pitchers. Never wait in line again to buy expensive bottled water! Be prepared with the waterBOB®.

Fits most standard bathtubs; Holds 100 gallons of fresh drinking water; Made of heavy duty food grade material; Stays within USFDA guidelines; Have plenty of water for your entire family!

What is the waterBOB®?

The waterBOB® is the world’s greatest water containment system that turns any standard bathtub into an emergency water reserve.

How does it work?

It’s very easy to use. Simply lay the waterBOB® liner in your bathtub, hookup to the faucet and fill. We include a siphon pump to dispense the water into jugs or pitchers.

Why do I need the waterBOB®?

During a hurricane or tropical storm, water main breaks and storms surges can interrupt or even contaminate the public water supply. Without clean water it becomes life threatening.

How much water does the waterBOB® hold?

This depends on the size of your bathtub and how much you fill it, but it can hold as much as 100 gallons.

How long can I store water in the waterBOB®?

The water will stay fresh for up to 16 weeks, depending on humidity and temperature conditions.

How long does it takes to fill the waterBOB®?

This depends on your home’s water flow, but usually around 20 minutes.

How do I get the water out of the waterBOB®?

Included in the package is a siphon pump that easily dispenses the water into a pitcher or jug.

What is the waterBOB® made of?

The waterBOB® is constructed of heavy-duty 10 mil food grade Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) plastic. This material follows and stays within US FDA guidelines.

Why can’t I store water in the bathtub without the waterBOB®?

Most bathtubs have dirt and soap film that would contaminate the fresh water. In addition, debris and other items may fall into the water which would cause it to spoil and become useless.

In what emergencies would I use the waterBOB®?

Be prepared for any emergency with the waterBOB®. Every household should have several for temporary water storage during emergency situations and after disaster relief. The waterBOB® is needed for a hurricane, tropical or winter storm, tornado, earthquake or flood. Anytime there is a water main break or flood conditions, the public water supply may be contaminated and unsafe to use. Others uses for the waterBOB® include RVs and campers for storage and for homes and cabins in remote areas where it is hard to find fresh water.

Why is it called waterBOB®?

Water is what the liner holds; the BOB is short for “Bathtub Oblong Bladder”.



WATER BOB STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

STEP 1: Lay the waterBOB® bladder flat in the bathtub with the nozzles (white caps) facing up and near the faucet end of the tub.	

STEP 2: Unscrew the nozzle cap that is closest to the faucet and attach the fill sock by turning it clockwise until tight.

STEP 3: Slide the other end of the fill sock over the bathtub faucet and hold it firmly around the faucet with one hand while your other hand turns on the COLD WATER.	

STEP 4: Remove the filling sock with a white cap and tighten.

STEP 5: The full waterBOB®. Keep the caps sealed tight until you are ready for water.	

STEP 6: When you are ready for water, remove the center nozzle cap and thread on the siphon pump by turning in a clockwise motion.

STEP 7: To dispense the water, place a jug or pitcher below water level, insert the hose in the empty container and squeeze the bulb several times to begin the siphon effect.	

STEP 8: To stop the water flow, loosen the vent cap located on top of the pump, allowing all remaining water to flow out of the hose. Tighten the vent cap when you are finished."

These things are a blast to shoot!  

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.

Due to the unique locking action of the PMR-30 pistol and the lightweight slide and barrel, the use of a suppressor is not recommended as it will cause an increase in gas volume and pressure and the slide will likely unlock early. This will cause an increase in gases and residue that is ejected back towards the shooters face and could also cause a case rupture to occur. Any damage or injuries caused by the use of a suppressor or other heavy weight muzzle device attached to the PMR-30 pistol will not be covered by any Warranty. The thread pattern on the PMR-30 threaded barrel is 3/8” x 24.

In addition to the original package it comes with; Galco Ankle Lite (with the Ruger logo), Galco Tuck-N-Go (with the Ruger logo), Conceal City Pocket Grip, an Extra Magazine, and two Magazine Springs.

This gun makes an excellent conceal carry or backup weapon and can be hidden in various places on your person.  I have fired it approximately 400 to 450 times, but let’s say 500 to be on the safe side.  In speaking with a Ruger dealer about this weapon they said that it is actually good for about 1,300 rounds, and then replace the Guide Rod, Inner Recoil Spring and Outer Recoil Spring and keep going.  Without knowing that bit information I replaced all of them after about 350 to 400 rounds and kept the originals.

Every month, whether or not it has been fired, I take it apart, wipe everything down with an oily rag, and replace the Magazine Springs (I always let my magazine springs rest and relax for a month).  After a trip to the range it is thoroughly cleaned and lightly oiled.

With a flat trajectory and mild recoil, it is no wonder the .270 is a classic cartridge and was one of the favorites among many popular hunter/authors like Jack O'Connor. 
These early A-Bolts are great rifles.

""We at Outdoor Life take special pride in the ongoing success of the .270 because it was on these pages, through the romantic phrases and sound advice of Jack O'Connor, that the .270 became a hunting icon. Not before or since has any cartridge received such unstinting praise, and it was well deserved, for as O'Connor consistently reminded his readers, a good hunting cartridge is one you can hit with. The flat-shooting .270 reduces much of the guesswork associated with shots at often unknown distances and puts the bullet on target with a
potent package of energy.""

"".270 Winchester
What can I say about the .270 Winchester that was not said far more eloquently by Jack O’Connor, the greatest firearms writer of the 20th century? The most famous and by far the most successful full-length offspring of the .30-06 Springfield, the .270 had it all back in 1925 when it was introduced and still has it all today. Need a flat-shooting, mild-recoiling, super-accurate cartridge for shooting deer-size game at long range? The .270 loaded with a good 130-grain bullet fills the bill with room to spare. Heading out west for an elk or moose hunt? Don’t overlook the .270 loaded with a premium-grade bullet weighing 150 grains. Does your shoulder scream out in protest each time you squeeze the trigger on that new .409 Pooper-Scooper Magnum? If so, relief in the form of a .270-caliber rifle is no further away than your friendly gunshop.""

It has a short pull which is almost completely smooth, with only one minuscule spot of ‘grit’ before the perfectly crisp and predictable break. The pull measures an absolutely consistent 4.0 pounds, with only a modest amount of overtravel. It’s honestly better than many entry-level bolt action triggers.

Once you get up to speed (a pricey proposition if you don’t roll your own ammo) you’ll be sending aimed shots downrange like a latter-day Chuck Connors, with a cyclic rate of nearly 90 rpm. For residents of Stasi states like California or New York, a carbine like this might be the ultimate legal home-defense carbine. Rossi advertises an 8+1 round capacity, but I had no trouble loading and feeding 9+1 rounds. 10 rounds is the same as the rifle magazine limit in some states, and the loading gate is nearly as quick as a bullet button mag swap. At least you can top off your magazine without having to open the action or take the gun off-target.

""Stick"" is a good Olle Texan Benchrest Shooter, one of the best I've ever seen- and that's saying something growing up in a Marine Corp Family.

Anyway if you know anything about those rifles, you'll know that even a crap shot can keep a tight group if he's got a good scope and doesn't mess with the rifle too much.

Well this rifle was assembled to do just that- keep tight groups at long distances.

I'll include a pic of a target I shot from 200yds and put 2 shots through nearly the same hole- the gun shoots .25 MOA easy! I say ""the gun"" because I'm one of those ""crap shots.""

Here's what you get;
.300 WinMag 
Stiller Predator Long Action
Timney Adjustable Trigger
HS Precision Light weight Stock- with bottom metal
Kreiger Barrel- profiled and fluted with a competition muzzle break (that makes it recoil so lightly my 7 yr old god-daughter shot it and walked away giggling.) anyway; 
Harris Bipod
and
Talley Scope Rings

And you may have noticed there's a Nightforce Scope mounted on it right now- That's not included. BUT for a fair (additional) price I'll let it go.

This rifle is magic- The only reason I'm selling it is I'm going back to school and need extra money to pay for tuition. 

P.S. Don't feel too bad for me, ""Stick"" promised me he'd build another one for my graduation present…on my dime. Gotta love the humor in those Texas boys.

Check out the pics and email me- I'll answer any questions you have.

This is a Knights SR15 E3 Mod 1 Upper on a Noveske Chainsaw Gen 2 Lower. This lower was one of the first I ever built myself and has the idiot marks to show it. There are also a few blemishes on the URX4 from installing and removing the rail covers. I did not see any blems on the lower when I bought it, however, the upper and lower match up EXTREMELY snug. There is absolutely no wiggle or play between the upper and lower, which I see as a major plus, but I guess that might be the flaw in the lower. The gun has seen approximately 90-120 rounds through it, both suppressed and non. It shoots extremely smooth as expected out of an SR15 with the SSA trigger and muzzle brake and the URX4 feels great. This rifle is ready for any abuse you would want to through at it.

The Firearms Training Academy, located in Tyler Tx, is now offering pistol and rifle (AR platform) shooting courses. We are offering:

-Basic Pistol
-Intermediate Pistol
-Basic Rifle
-Intermediate Rifle
-Intermediate Rifle Extended Range
-And as always---Texas CHL classes

Basic pistol/ Basic rifle- To introduce new shooters to the safe handling, functioning and operation of pistols and rifles or anyone wanting to develop better marksmanship skills. The course includes range time to introduce and develop basic marksmanship skill. If you do not shoot often or just purchased a pistol, the Basic pistol course is a great course to take before you attend the CHL class. 50 round minimum, $60.00.

Intermediate pistol/ Intermediate rifle- ""Combat"" style shooting focused on self-defense. 100 round minimum, $115.00.

Rifle Intermediate Extended Range- Teaches and reinforces skills needed to engage targets out to 300 yards. This is geared to hunting situations. 60 round minimum, $115.00.

For the Extended Range course there are some sight/optic requirements. The rear sights should have windage and elevation adjustments. The carrying handle iron sights are fine and recommended, but any sight that has the ability to adjust for windage and elevation will work. Please contact us for our recommendations or with any questions. 

The minimum number of rounds is required to shoot the course of fire. If you want to bring and shoot more please do. Our goal is to keep training affordable, and we stress quality of instruction over quantity of rounds sent down range.

Advanced courses are coming soon.

Group lessons are available as well as one on one private lessons. Or if you would like we can discuss your goals and design a course of fire and instruction to meet your needs. We do not generally put out a class schedule with dates, we prefer to schedule around your time. Texas CHL classes are also offered.

To schedule your course or for more information please call the Paul Johnson at REDACTED. He handles all the scheduling. Our website is currently being updated, please be patient. Feel free to send me a message with questions and I will answer them as soon as I can. We look forward to helping you achieve your goals."
