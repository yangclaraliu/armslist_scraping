Felt pretty good at first, but once I shot a box through it, the size of it really showed its slimness. The E2 grips are great, just a little to small for me. I have more pictures if interested.

It has finely crafted walnut and an incredible internal mechanism. My father bought this shotgun right before he passed away in 2009 and only used it a few times. Since then it has just been sitting in its case in my closet and since I never use it I figured some body would want this beautiful shotgun. It barely shows any signs of use. This gun is from 2007 and is model 411-68xxx and originally sold for $1800. It has a 28"" barrel making it perfect for hunting or clays. It also has a 3"" chamber. Here are some of the features:

Automatic, two-position tang safety/ barrel selector provides instant visibility and accessibility. Finely polished, stainless steel receiver is corrosion-resistant and has no exposed pins or screws. Reliable, single mechanical trigger that allows for firing the second barrel without recocking. Sleek, compact locking system is considered to be among the strongest ever built for over-and-under shotguns. Precision matched, blued alloy steel, cold hammer-forged barrels made of high-strength chrome-molybdenum steel feature 2'' forcing cones and maximum back boring for superior recoil reduction and more uniform patterns. 1/4'' dovetailed, free-floating, ventilated rib with brass bead front sight is stress-relieved, contour-grounded, precisely fitted and silver-brazed (not soft-soldered) to the finished monoblock. Beautifully crafted, cut-checkered American Walnut stock features a traditional pistol grip, tapered, slim forend and a stainless steel latch release. A soft Pachmayr® buttpad is mounted on the 14.5'' length of pull stock, which features a 1.5'' drop at the comb and a 2.5'' drop at the heel.

A common problem with AR pistols is the blast from the muzzle, thats why i put the flaming pig flash suppressor on the end of the barrel and it works great. Throws all the flame and sound down range which makes for a very nice shooting experience. Also has a Nickel boron Bolt Carrier group made by Aim surplus. This gun is insanely light partially because of the carbon fiber hand guard. All around a fantastic little gun, never had a problem with this gun and i attribute that to using only the highest quality of parts i had available.

In my opinion the Viridian laser is light years over the crimson trace. Much brighter, two modes (solid and flicker), and best of all, it turns on when you remove it from the holster. Viridian also offers a complete line of other style holsters for the weapon/laser combo.

It's a newer Waffen Werks/DDI AK74 in 5.45x39mm.

Waffen Werks had problems in 2013 but DDI bought them out and rebuilt most of their rifles on in-spec receivers.  They are still honoring past warranties and so far all DDI rebuilds have been pretty top notch. This one was rebuilt by DDI.  It passes the bullet test and seems to be put together very well.  Straight sights, decent wood, etc.

This rifle is built on a Bulgarian Circle 10 parts kit with a US made barrel, receiver, pistol grip and fire control group. Comes with 1 Tapco Black AK74 magazine.

**AMMO NOTICE**
This rifle did not perform well with Red Army Standard 69gr 5.45x39mm.  If you read online you can see others are having issues with the same ammo. I would stay away from RAS 69gr.  Performed flawlessly with Wolf 60gr 5.45x39mm.

Did you advocate your position on 594 and 591?

This bill will essentially kill armslist and private sales.

YOU WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO BORROW A GUN FOR HUNTING, FOR THE RANGE OR WHATEVER WITHOUT AN GDP TRANSFERRING IT BOTH WAYS. YOU will pay fees AND SALES TAX to lend out a gun and you'll have to pay fees and sales tax again to get it back.

Judging by the  prices here, most of you have embraced the panic and hope to cash in before it all goes down.... on the bright side, your used gun will no longer be able to sell for more than the cost of a new one since you'll be competing with dealers....

I don't see any yard signs, I don't hear proponents on the radio or tv. Have  we thrown in the towel?

The whole country is quietly watching this, many states will follow our lead.

selling my 1996 Bronco XL, 4X4. EVERYTHING works, lights, heat/AC, rear power window. Includes towing gear. I've never towed with it, but imagine it would do fine. I've only put it in 4X4 Mode once and that was between AZ and here in a snow storm. It did GREAT!

AM/FM CD PLAYER with remote. Kicker Speakers. Great first car, great hunting rig.

It's been an AZ car its whole life until it moved here to Billings in April. I traded for it out of necessity not desire and I just want the money to put toward something else.

I'd put the paint and body at 80%. it's in good condition for the most part with some scratches and a little fading, but it's in good enough condition that it doesn't look like crap in town, but used enough to be great for crashing the boonies.

I'm looking to get $4500 but I'm open to negotiating. I am good with cash and or trade for the right deal. I like firearms and cash more than anything.

Feel free to email me and we can get some discussion going.

Manufactured by Ed Brown, this is a ""Special Forces"" .45 auto. Built simply with serious performance and reliability in mind, the Special Forces does not have a lot of fancy bells and whistles. There is no light rail, no full length guide rod, nor any front serrations...nothing you don't absolutely need. Slide to frame fit is excellent, of course. The trigger is excellent, of course. It features the ""Chainlink I"" treatment to the front strap and flat mainspring housing. An Ed Brown beavertail grip safety with memory groove is standard, as are the 3-hole long trigger, and skeletonized commander hammer. The ambidextrous tactical safety was a custom order extra. It is fitted with high visibility three dot tritium night sights (dated 2013) and is factory finished in the super durable Gen4 black coating which offers extremely good corrosion and wear resistance. Grips are diamond checkered laminated wood.
Condition is excellent, virtually brand new, and I'd grade this pistol at better than 99%. It appears that it has been test fired only. There is no external wear and looking at the breech face it would appear that very few rounds have been fired. Needless to say, the mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent. It comes in the Ed Brown black range bag with one Ed Brown 7-round stainless magazine with bumper. The owner's manual, safety lock, allen wrench and lube are included. Just a SUPER NICE that anyone would be proud to own!!"

Not very deep. The cylinder is pretty clean, normal signs of use and some scratches form setting it down. This gun is in great shape, works very well and is a great buy!

I'm selling a 6x12 Enclosed Trailer with a rear ramp door and a side door. This would be perfect for hunting as you can haul your atv/gear and also sleep in it. It isn't perfect cosmetically, but it tows great and doesn't leak. As you can see in the pics it has a dent in the front drivers side corner (from previous owner).  I never took the time to straighten it out, it would just take removing some plywood from the inside and pushing it out.
