Fired a total of 92 rounds through the rifle (55gr loaded to .223 specs / brass cased Tula under the ""Perfetca"" brand). Rifle functioned flawlessly during the course. Weather was clear, mid 50's and very strong fishtail winds with gusts of 20mph.

Best grouping was at 100m being at just over 3/4 inch (4 rounds center to center measure).

Worst grouping of the day was at 412 meters (laser ranged it) with 5 rounds in a 4.5"" grouping. Being that this was 55gr Commercial .223 and Tula ammo on top of that (equates to roughly a 2-3 MOA round) and the extremely variable wind we had, I am very pleased with the performance of the rifle and can be confident saying that if match or simply higher quality loads were fired through it, the barrel would consistently hold sub MOA.

What we have here is a Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal Browning 1903 pattern modified to the specifications of the Swedish military for adoption in 1907 as their primary service pistol as the M1907. These guns were made by FN and imported to Sweden until the FN factory was captured by Germans during the Great War. After that Husqvarna began production and eventually produced them for Columbia and other countries after the end of WW1.

This great little gun served with distinction up until the adoption of the Lahti in the 1940's. Once out of field use, they were still preferred by police and officers due to their compact dimensions and great handling. They were also used by several European, Middle Eastern and South American countries as well as the Russian and Ottoman Empires! If you like unusual guns with a storied history, this one is for you.

This gun is in great shape considering its age. Finish is very good at around 92-95%, bore is good and still shoots great. These are hugely overbuilt by todays standards for .380 so I would have no worries shooting +p or defensive ammo out of it. Best of all, you are probably the only person at the range with one! Needless to say these don't pop up every day so don't let this one pass you by.

Currently loaded with double 00 buck and you can have it that way - ok, we'll clear it so you can check the gun out.  I'll sell it a little cheaper so you feel good.  I paid $850ish with tax which I thought was a pretty good retail price.  I put 4 rounds through it so I knew it worked in case an unlucky intruder ventured into my home.  This IS NOT the Japanese made Browning.  This is Belgium made year and as also indicated on the original plastic butt plate.  Own legend, not new crap.  Not a gun to throw in the back of the pickup but a good gun to cherish and add to a collection."

The ELCAN DFOV14-C1 SpecterDR 1x/4x 5.56/223 Dual-Role Optical Rifle Scope represents a revolution in optical sight design. The world's first truly dual field of view combat optical sight, the SpecterDR switches instantly from a 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight with the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes. Includes ARMS QD Mount.

Selected by USSOCOM for elite SpecOps mission, the SpecterDR™ Dual-Role rifle sight by ELCAN is reliable, amazingly bright and deadly accurate. Whether the mission calls for clearing a building or open-terrain patrol, SpecterDR™ gives you both fast acquisition and long-range target identification.

The unique locking lever mechanism brings you accurately back on target every time. The remarkably bright, clear ELCAN optics extend your daylight operations. Why risk yourself and the mission with red dot or fixed telescopic sights that do only half the job? Carry the one and only combat sight that switches between CQB and precision ranged fire mode - in the blink of an eye.

Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a brilliant red dot in the center. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN's legendary crystal clear image. In CQB mode, the SpecterDR has by far the largest field of view in the industry. The 4x and CQB Reticles are plainly visible even in the case of loss of electrical power due to battery failure or EMP. The SpecterDR offers the best single solution for Long Range and CQB engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use.

465,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3652465,For Sale:  Vintage 1916 Colt 1911 4th year production,"West College, State College, Pennsylvania","$ 1,350","Listed On: Wednesday, October 29, 2014",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"For Sale I have a Vintage Colt 1911 manufactured in 1916. This pistol has a beautiful commercial frame that retains a conservative 85% of its beautiful Early Colt high polish bluing and is one of the nicest I've ever seen in my years of collecting 1911s. The Slide is a US Army Slide that is from the same timeframe as it has the Gothic lettering and rear prancing horse which was used in 1916 on the Army Models. My personal belief is this Firearm was bought as a private sidearm before WW1 then either brought to war by the person who bought it or shipped over by their family and while in service had a US Army slide put on it as the slide and frame match pretty well and seem to have been together for quite sometime. The slide does have more wear than the frame most likely from pulling it in and out of a holster with the most significant wear concentrated between the ejection port and the front sight. The slide is a mix of the Colt ""Fine Finish"" Bluing and a pleasant brown patina. This Old Colt is a great shooter and retains all of its original early pre WW1 parts including the milled cut thumb safety, milled cut slide stop, and double diamond wood grips. The barrel is a pre WW2 Springfield replacement with an excellent bore. Overall this is an excellent example of a vintage Colt. If someone could find a Commercial model slide to match the frame you would be looking at an extremely valuable $3000 plus 85-90% original Pre WW1 Colt 1911. Slides shouldn't be that hard to procure as they made the exact same Commercial slides from 1913-1920 with no changes. I will ship this firearm anywhere in the US with a copy of a valid FFL or C&R license. If this pistol isn't sold by this weekend it's going to be parted out and sold on gunbroker which would be a shame because this gun is a damn fine shooter. E-mail, call, or text REDACTED. Would consider partial trades for a small carry gun. Trade value must not be higher than $350 as I need at lease $1000 cash unless it's a really nice piece."

The Hydra, configured to shoot the .50 Beowulf® cartridge was designed to generate devastating stopping power at short to moderate ranges. Combining the modular, multi-caliber capability of the MARCK-15 Hydra weapon with a unique .500 inch projectile and cartridge, this semi-automatic weapon is ideal as a brush hunting weapon and is capable of knocking down virtually anything you may run across. For wild pig hunting, the rifle is without equal and is being used not only by hunters, but by game control agencies as well. Deer in close cover are easily taken with solid hits guaranteeing one shot kills and little or no tracking. The same reliable combination of heavy, large-diameter bullets and moderate velocities enable the .50 Beowulf® cartridge in the Hydra platform to tackle the largest game animals found in North America and it has been used against elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results.

Providing a semi-automatic, light-carbine with the performance of the venerable 45-70 rifle, MGI’s Hydra, shooting the .50 Beowulf® is also finding a wide acceptance with military and law enforcement agencies. The external ballistics of the .50 Beowulf® cartridge are well-suited to urban environments where the shorter range template allows for more flexible application and the large projectile energy delivered by the ammunition can disable both motor vehicles and assailants with body armor. Windscreen glass does not affect the trajectory of the bullet, nor do automotive body panels. With frangible projectiles, the .50 Beowulf® cartridge can be used on most training facilities without damage and, with the addition of a muzzle brake to provide a stand-off, can be used for building entry further making the Hydra platform the most versatile small arms weapons platform on the planet.

This configuration of the Hydra also includes, as a standard part, MGI's un-matched, Rate & Recoil Reducing Buffer. The combination of devastating stopping power and absolute reliability in a lightweight, familiar form factor, the Hydra by MGI shooting the .50 Beowulf® cartridge is simply without equal for a hard hitting, compact, and multipurpose package.

These guns were taken from dead or captured soviet troops. The soviet stocks were thrown away and newer higher quality wood was put on.  The front sights were switched to blade sights and the gun was issued to finnish troops or put up in the armory.  These 91/30s are NOT as easy to find as the soviet 91/30s, they are rare and magnificent shooting, hunting, and show guns.  This gun is EXTREMELY accurate.  The next gun is my Walther clone, the Romarms .380  this was issued to the Romanian military and police until they recently went to glocks.  Its accuracy and power is phenomenal.  This gun does favor a right handed shooter,  it has a raised platform on the left grip for the shooter to rest his thumb.  This raises the stability and control on the gun.  I can throw in around 40 rounds for the .380  I would like to trade them as a package but the only gun i would trade by itself would be the .380  Both guns are in great condition. Im not interested in selling just trading, i can send pics upon request.  The finnish 91/30 is going for $350 average and the Romarms is about $250, with the ammo i can throw in for the 91/30 i can make the trade value an easy $700. Im wanting to trade both for an ak or i would trade the pistol for a highpoint carbine."

The receiver is blue steel, the barrel bore is bright with no pits and the action is in excellent condition. There are no plastic or MIM parts used on this gun (unlike the Express model). It was built to last with an action smooth-as-silk. The 870 POLICE MAGNUM has these improved characteristics: An aluminum trigger group as opposed to the plastic one used in the Express models. An old style magazine retention system. A much smoother finish inside and out with minimal machine marks or burrs. The Police gun receives a higher level of inspection and finishing and is built in a special area of the plant from 100% inspected parts. It has a one piece barrel and the bore was polished. Heavy-duty trigger / sear spring. Heavy-duty shell lifter spring. The barrel is locked down with a ""ball detent"" system (as opposed to the lesser grade ""synthetic magazine spring retainer"" lock down used in the Express models). A milled extractor (as opposed to the MIM extractor used in the Express models). Remington builds these guns specifically for law enforcement and military use. They have to be 100% reliable and able to withstand the toughest of field conditions. For these reasons, the 870 POLICE MAGNUM was built to the highest standard for endurance and reliability.

I am asking $3500 FIRM or trade for a gun or guns of equal value. What the truck needs: Front hubs within the next few thousand miles and possibly a new steering gear box as there is play in the steering wheel... Also the bumper could use a can of paint but that doesn’t prevent it from driving so I haven’t done it myself. What’s been done : Ball Joints, New intake manifold and gaskets, water pump, spark plugs, all new coolant, new fuel injector O-rings, front brake rotors and pads, Mile Marker Manual Hubs, Gear oil front and rear as well as transfer case fluid, Oil change 1k miles ago with all synthetic, thermostat, serpentine belt, and alternator.

The gun has had less than 300 rounds through it.  It also has a grip reduction, which allows for a more complete and higher grip.  It has also been stippled which significantly increases the texture, meaning grip is vastly increased.  The stippling is mild and not at all coarse so it is still comfortable against bare skin if it is carried in waist band.  The only other modification is a polished feed ramp.  There have been NO internal modifications.  The gun handles, shoots, and recoils like a full size M&P.  It truly bridges the gap between full-size pistols and sub-compact pocket rockets. 

The gun comes in its original S&W hard case (matching serial number) with all of it's included trim (additional back straps, gun lock, paperwork, test bullet/case, etc).  The gun has the original three dot sights as well as the two stock 12 round magazines, one with a grip extension (also stippled) allowing for a full hand grip.  Additionally not shown in the photos are two X-Grips which make the gun compatible with full size, 17 round, M&P9 magazines. 

I am selling the gun to make room for other projects, but am in no rush.  Therefore, the price is $600.00 firm.  No low ball offers will be considered. The buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale (which will include their name and driver's license number).  I will not ship the gun.  I am willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet and complete the sale if necessary and am willing to go as far as Phoenix, but the price would increase to $650.00.
