Appreciate all the offers I've gotten.  Also appreciate the American entrepreneurial instincts to get the best deal in the world and offer me less than I am asking.  HOWEVER – I am not looking for either a profit or a loss.  $350 is an incredible price already.

Regarding the safety - I deliberately chose one without because of the flaw in S&W's Shield safety and because, as a carry gun, the way it is put together makes a safety unnecessary and counterproductive.

FROM S&W WEB SITE:   The M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. The 3.1-inch barrel contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately."

Plus P rated for duty use. This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications.

 Taurus Security System (TSS)
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

 Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

Personally, I would leave it as is.  Wood grips have some dents, but nothing really awful. Picture taken without grip screws in, since I was  cleaning it, and had the grips off to do a thorough job.  Bore looks good.  I doubt the prior owner ever cleaned it.   It's cleaned and range ready now..  Do you own due diligence, but I believe the Taurus/Rossi lifetime warranty follows the gun, so this would be a ""no worry"" purchase.

We were wrong. Here is a Glock that takes that now-famous accuracy up a couple notches, the 17C Compensated and Ported variant. This is a pistol you can shoot all day long and never tire of. Manufacturer is Glock Ges.m.b.H., of Deutsch-Wagram, Austria. Importer is Glock Inc. of Smyrna, Georgia. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts in a steel impregnated polymer frame. Type is double action only blowback action, striker fired semi-auto pistol. Caliber is 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Barrel is 6 groove, 1:9.84 twist 4.02 inch, with dual 3/8 inch ports positioned at 11 and 1 o’clock 1 1/4 inches back of the muzzle to eliminate barrel rise, dissipate heat, increase accuracy, and virtually eliminate felt recoil. Slide is ported as well, as the photos show. Sights are stake on white dot front and dovetailed U shaped white outline rear. Trigger is .400 smooth face combat type, but with Glock Trigger Safety that augments the firing pin and drop safeties. Glocks do NOT have magazine safeties; that is, they will fire single shot with no magazine. Trigger pull is a smooth consistent 5 pounds. Finish is black matte. Weight empty is 23 ounces. The Generation 3 frame has an integral single slot Picatinny accessory rail, textured interval finger groove front strap, stippled surface laterals, and checkered serration back strap surface. Sight radius is 6 1/4 inches; height is 5 3/8 inches from the top of the rear sight to the magazine floorplate, slide thickness is 1.05 with frame thickness of 1.17. Overall length is 7 3/8 inches from the muzzle to the top of the grip frame strut. Each specimen is new in its box with factory paperwork, fired brass case, cleaning rod and brush, total of two magazines, red cable lock, and magazine loading tool. We’re offering the Glock 17 in the photos, Factory Number PI1750203, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 469.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California or Massachusetts. 2% Discount if payment is with USPS Money Orders & no credit card.

The Ultragrip RX™ and Ultragrip DX™ represent the latest in grip technology. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes.

These rounds are less than three months old and have been kept in a dehumidified / climate-controlled home. I sold my .38 and no longer have use for these rounds. The two MTM cases are included. I didn't keep the original boxes, only the flap. Must be 21+ and able to pick up. Thanks for looking!


The new Buffalo Bore Heavy 38 SPL+p ammo will maximize the effectiveness of your 38 SPL revolver. The powders are flash suppressed so as to not hinder your vision should you be required to drop the hammer in low light.

Item 20A/20 is the terrific SOFT lead semi wad cutter hollow cavity bullet, however we've added a gas check to stop the leading that this load typically causes with other manufacturers version of this bullet.

Item 20B/20 uses the low velocity (LV) Jacketed Hollow Point bullet that is designed to expand at as little as 800 fps, so you will get expansion out of very short barrels.

Whether you prefer the very soft semi wadcutter lead bullet, or a very soft JHC, (jacketed hollow cavity) these HVY 38 SPL+p loads will turbo charge your 38 SPL revolver.

The tactical reload: Short (2 to 2.5 inch) barreled revolvers have short ejectors. Those short ejectors typically used on 2 inch to 2.5 inch barreled revolvers are not long enough to fully eject 357 magnum brass. So if you are forced into a situation where you need to reload your weapon under fire, you will find yourself picking your fired/empty 357 brass out of the cylinder one at a time - this is very bad. On the other hand, 38SPL brass is shorter than 357 brass and those short ejectors will often fully eject 38SPL brass. We have experimented a great deal with short barreled revolvers and have found that 38SPL brass normally offers an advantage if you need to reload your ""snub nose"" revolver, in a hurry.

Check out the below velocities that I fired from my personal revolvers. We believe that real world, stock, ""over the counter"" guns, give real world results, so we don't advertise velocities that are fired from long test barrels.

These 38SPL+P loads are generating low-end 357 magnum, ballistics. If you have an older or more fragile 38SPL, or if you are recoil sensitive, consider using our HVY Standard Pressure 38SPL ammunition. It is safe to be fired in any 38SPL revolver and it still packs much more punch than ordinary 38SPL ammo.

Item 20A: 158gr., very soft cast, semi wad cutter, (Keith) hollow cavity, with a gas check. This bullet will mushroom violently on impact and will penetrate roughly 14 inches in human flesh. Again, this bullet is gas checked and will not lead your barrel.

This pistol was made in Canada in August 2008.  I bought it used six months ago.  The finish is Para's Covert Black and is in average to above average condition with apparent holster wear.  It has a front Tritium night sight with good brightness.

Para is famous for their exclusive LDA (light double-action) trigger design.  It is as sweet as you will find.  The design allows you to carry more safely as the bobbed hammer rests in a half-cocked condition.  When the safeties are disengaged (grip safety and thumb safety) a light double-action pull completes cocking and fires the pistol.  The light trigger and match-grade bull barrel permit great accuracy and very tight groups.

The pistol feels good in the hand and recoil is minimal.  The size is excellent for concealed carry."

Read Their Fine Print!! This Listing is for One Factory Brand New in the Hard Case Kel-Tec PF-9 9mm Semi-Auto pistol with a tan frame and tan slide. Factory Part # PF9TanTan The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab. The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use. The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger Mini-14 rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with collapsible stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

Simple, Rugged-Garand Style Action with breechbolt locking system, a fixed-piston gas system and self-cleaning moving gas cylinder gives unparalled reliability under harsh operating conditions.

1. ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation.

2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR Conversion Kits for the GLOCK pistol.

3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm.

4. FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot."

Have the following for sale:

#1. EOTech XPS3-0 (Night vision compatible) with original box and papers. I purchased this new a few months ago and it just doesn't get used. Has only seen ~100 bench rested rounds while mounted on my M4, so absolutely nothing wrong with it. Just looking to free up some funds so I can buy other toys. $495 shipped 


#2. I also have a pair of LaRue Tactical LT110 QD mounts for EOTech weapon sights. More info here - http://www.laruetactical.com/larue-tactical-eotech-qd-mount-lt-110

One is in good condition with expected wear from use. There is what seems to me like some excessive wobble in the sliding locking mechanism on the QD lever, but the lever still works as it should and clamps on solid. The other mount is like-new. I purchased it new when I bought the EOTech. 

Asking $50 shipped for the more used mount and $95 shipped for the like-new mount, but will not sell the like-new mount until the EOTech sells as I want to offer it as an option to the buyer. 


#3. Surefire M600P Fury Scout Light (Flat Dark Earth). Brand new and came from FNH USA as part of their ""Power up your SCAR"" promotion going on right now - http://www.fnhusa.com/r/promotions/. I took it out of the packaging just to make sure it works (and it does), but don't really have a need for it on my SCAR 17S.
$275 shipped


Prefer PP gift, but USPS Money Order works too. Email REDACTED (remove ""SPAM"" first) or text 21nine.3zero8.6five52 for fastest response.

After moving to Colorado, I wanted to play again but with school and work, I never could find the time to do so. I have one more semester left and a little tight on cash, so here goes my getting out of the hobby sale. All prices are negotiable, make an offer. I need everything gone.

1. Stock Tokyo Marui Sig 552. I bought this from an old friend who bought it brand new at the hobby shop he worked at. I took it to 2 games and if worked flawlessly. Comes with the small NiCd battery I got with the gun (doesn't really hold a charge. it will shoot for about 1 and a half mag fulls before dying). Does not have the orange tip. I'm not sure if my friend removed it or if it never came with it (this does not have any of the markings scratched off so it may actually be that old). No box/paperwork, no charger, comes with 2 stock mid caps (43rd) and 1 hi cap magazine. These are going for $265 at redwolf. Asking $150

2. Stock Tokyo Marui M1A1 Thompson. Pretty much the same story as above except I never took this to a game. It does shoot very well. Only problem with this one is that semi auto works intermittently due to the cam being worn on the sector gear. No box/paperwork, no charger, comes with 1 mid cap (60rd) magazine and a large NiCd battery (same as above, doesn't really hold a charge but you can use it to check function). These are going for $375 at redwolf. Asking $225

3. Highly modified Echo1 P90 and another for parts. The normal looking one in the box is a highly modified, high speed P90. It shoots around 40 rounds per second at about 330 feet per second. Has an AWS mosfet installed with deans plug. Set up for a 3 cell lipo. Angle of engagement adjusted, sorbothane installed, short stroked SHS piston and gearset driven by a high speed motor. The other P90 with the long barrel was a high power project that I never finished. I have enough parts to put it back to stock form and get it working but just do not have the time. You could use it for parts or rebuild it. Comes with one box, 4 mid cap mags, 1 box mag with short M4 hi cap mag, factory charger (will not work though since both guns are wired to deans). Asking $350

4. Stock CYMA CM122 ""Sig P226"" AEP. You may laugh at these but in cold weather games, gas pistols just don't work well enough. The charger has been modified to be plugged into a hobby charger with deans plug. Comes with box/paperwork, bag of bbs, cleaning/unjamming rod, one mag, one battery, and charging adapter. Asking $30

5. bunch of parts. Please note the plastic bin in the picture will not be included. Lots of pistons, springs, o-rings, motor connectors, hop up buckings, nubs, shims, etc. A lot of the parts in here are for the Echo1 P90 so I would like to sell this with the P90s unless somebody just wants the parts. Asking $50 for all the parts other than P90 stock parts.

6. Not in the pictures, airsoft gear. I have a Pantech drop leg molle rig, drop leg universal holster, dump pouch, and a belt all in Pantech tan color (although to me it really looks somewhere in the middle between FDE and OD green). I also have a JT full mask with a small fan and push button switch mounted for defogging (the lens kept fogging up during indoor games. I did this mod before JT came out with their defogging unit). All sold except mask."

I also purchased an additional three brand new factory magazines, so there are five total.

I've put fewer than 100 rounds through the pistol and unfortunately the ergonomics and handling don't do it for me so I'm moving on to something else.  This is a fine quality .45 semi-automatic handgun (one of the better striker fired .45 available) and .45 caliber is a very popular choice for home defense.

Priced at $425 firm.  Keep in mind that Cabelas is selling the single magazine XD 45 ""essentials"" version for $450, and this does not include night sights, accessories, extra mags, etc.

Buyer required to pay transfer and BG check fees.  I would recommend doing this at Alpine Armory on Santa Fe as it's only a $25 USD fee (+ $10 Colorado BG fee) and they can do it while you wait.  Also very nice folks."

The KAC M5 RAS (Rail Adapter System) was developed for use on the US Armed Forces issued rifle, and with hundreds of thousands of rails issued to date, it is one of the most battle proven designs available for the officially issued rifle platform. This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine 1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M5 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle's barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories. Includes Knights Armament KAC 6 Rib Rail Panels. & Knights Armament Vertical Hand Grip!

Specifications: 
•Length: 12.0"" 
•Weight: 14.4 oz 
•Free Float: No 
•Material: Aluminum 
•Finish: Black Anodizing 

Rifle Requirements: The M5 RAS is a drop-in replacement part for standard, 2-piece polymer, A2-type handguards. The rifle must have a rifle length gas system, delta ring assembly, fixed front sight/gas block, and either a round or triangular handguard end cap. Lighter barrel profiles work best (Government contours). Heavier barrel contours may require modification to the inside of the rail. Installation instructions are included.
