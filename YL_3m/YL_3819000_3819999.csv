92A1: Legendary 92 Reliability with Ultra-Modern Tactical Features

The ""A1"" class is a specialized tactical branch of the most tested and trusted military and personal defense weapon in history: the 92FS. We started with the super-reliable 92, keeping the engineering characteristics that make it so accurate, safe and dependable; then, we added some features prized by today’s most demanding tactical shooters as well as by those wanting the absolute best for home defense or personal protection. The result is the 92A1, a pistol that is as reliable for its intended use as it is safe and user-friendly even for the novice.

Easy Accessorization and Maintenance

The most noticeable difference between the classic 92FS and the 92A1 is that this comes with an integral Picatinny rail situated in front of the trigger guard. The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit.

Impressive Firepower, Extra-Durable Magazines

Another feature that will impress you about the 92A1 is the type of magazine it comes with. This pistol comes with three 17-round stainless steel magazines designed to deliver remarkable firepower out of the box while being absolutely durable and corrosion resistant. Furthermore, the magazines on the 92A1 feature a “dirt rail” along their length, which helps collect dust and grit out of the magazine while keeping cartridges clear of the magazine walls. The result: enhanced feeding reliability and super-easy magazine maintenance. In addition, the magazine well is aggressively beveled, making it super-fast to change magazines without taking your eyes off the target.

Absolutely Reliable, Designed to Last

The base design of the 92A1 is the 92FS or M9, the pistol that has served the US military admirably throughout its campaigns in the world’s toughest environments. But even in this respect, Beretta never rests on its laurels. This pistol incorporates an innovative internal frame buffer that greatly reduces component stress under firing (yes, even with hot +P ammo), making it even more durable and smooth-shooting. The best of both worlds, the 92A1 offers discriminating shooters the classic overall look and feel of the 92 (including the more traditional rounded trigger-guard) with today’s most advanced tactical features.

Hello 

I have a 1988 Cadillac Coupe Deville, color is grey with chrome. The car has the big 4.5L V8. The engine has 127,000 miles and purrs wonderful. The engine is in great condition and runs just like it should with no hiccups. I st ay on top of my engines fluids, the car has fresh oil, new oil filter, new air filter and new spark plugs.

Now onto the rest of the car! I must say I LOVE Cadillac their is nothing like having luxury in a vehicle, even though it is a 1988. The interior is in crazy good condition, new 20% window tint all around very soft seats like a recliner, everything is electric from seats to windows. All the lighting works on the interior inside and outside of car! This car has been taking care of from engine to interior. The interior also has upgraded speakers, new double din with new viper alarm with two remotes/ keys and also has a pop trunk.

The body of the car is in overall great condition, all the lights work on the entire outside, no rips in soft top, chrome all around from windshield bezel to side body trim. The hood, roof and trunk have a few spots where paint has peeled which is very common in GM vehicles in this year plus of its age. Their is luckily none anywhere else on the car.

The trunk of the car is unmolested inside, still same new padding, new tire, new tool kit, still see glitter in paint inside trunk. Spotless clean, time capsule back to 1988 literally.

So their you have it, a nice older Cadillac that has great comfort and reliable older engine.This is the very rare and super reliable V8.

Has a birdcage style flash hider to stop the large muzzle flash this pistol would have without it. Does not have original box. Comes with one 30 round magazine. We'll be happy to ship this to your FFL.

I have installed Talon grip tape to the grip and a small piece on the slide that provides better handling, but that can easily be removed and leaves no residue whatsoever. That being said, most people prefer it with the grip anyway.

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth.

Our exclusive ArmorLokt™process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

The Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem™ Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail.

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

   As always, local, state-to-state only.


    Forgot to get your beloved a present? Nothing says 'I love you' quite like a battle rifle, especially one with such history. About once a year I open my safes and pull out the guns I don't want. All of these rifles were hand-selected for metal and bore quality, and while a few have some rougher stocks, the majority have beautiful stocks in addition to beautiful metal. They are from all different years, Tulas and Izzy's, hex and rounds, and all are fully-functioning, matched serial numbers. Some are fully cleaned, some are beautifully refinished, some are still slick with cosmoline, just waiting to be cleaned and fired. These were purchased direct from distributors with the following description as to what I was hunting for:

""Hello,
     Hand-selection requirements: Bore and metal are priority; stocks can be 'rough' but not damaged in any major way. Rare models are preferred. Must include bayonet and accessories. Any major damage/shot bores/rust/missing major parts is unacceptable. Thanks guys, you're awesome!""

-A word on the price; I have been having a lot of questions about this. Yes, the price is significantly higher than buying a Mosin from a wholesaler. The extra cost is from the hand-select fee the distributor charges. I sell these rifles for exactly what I paid; I'm not interested in money, I'm simply selling the rifles that don't make the cut.

   So without further preamble; the Mosins:


-14 standard 91/30's. I keep the prettiest ones for my personal collection, and the rest get sold for exactly what I paid(so I can go buy more Mosins, of course). That means you don't have to pull the luck-of-the-draw Mosins from shops like Bud's or Cole's; I've already taken that risk. And though these Mosins didn't make the cut into my collection, I have what some might call 'ridiculously' high standards for what does; about 1 in 20 Mosins make it into my safes for life, generally speaking. All of these are beautiful guns with full bright bores. Tula, Izzy, rough, nice, doesn't matter, the price is the same regardless.


Some of you more acute 'Listers may have noticed a rifle sitting up away from the collection in the photo; that is my Honor Guard rifle, and she's not actually part of this deal(just pulled her out of the safe to get to the others), however, if someone 'really' wanted a Stalin-era 'Honor Guard' Mosin, I would consider selling her. She is my prize possession though. Quite literally the prettiest Mosin I have ever seen, and I've been collecting Mosins almost exclusively for 10 years. Painted inlay on the numbers, zero damage to stock/bore/metal, and the crisp brass trim of an Honor Guard rifle, straight from the Kremlin itself. Not to mention super-rare, to boot. Only 100 or so were made, and only 70-ish still exist, to my knowledge. I've held two, and managed to keep one.


   Now, to prices:

-$600 for the sniper, -SOLD

-$230 for any Mosin 91/30 or Type 53, plus bayonet, sling, ammo pouches, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. Ammunition is $30 for 100 rounds. How it works: email me, we will set up a time to meet. I will lay out every rifle for sale, and you are free to inspect/play with each one until you find 'the one'. People really seem to love this system as opposed to me putting them up individually, and I can understand why. It lets you compare all the rifles at once, instead of settling for one you may or may not really like. As I said, I'm a collector, so I try to make it as friendly and fun as possible. I can also answer just about any question you have about Mosins; from cleaning to shooting, I know it by heart. These rifles are pretty, tough-as-Russian-winters, and simple to clean. Easily the lowest-maintenance rifle in existence.


   Now, in addition to the Mosins, I have some very interesting pieces for sale as well. All of these are brand-new, never fired;


-Pietta Stainless Steel 1858 Army Model, .44            -        SOLD
-Pietta Blued 1858 Army Model, .44                        -        SOLD
-Pietta 'Johnny Reb' Colt Navy, .44                          -        $250

I also have these two, both have been fired, but cleaned. Still in very nice condition;

-Jukar Percussion pistol, .45                                   -        $80
-Hawken Rifle(with hair-trigger), .54                       -         SOLD



   Finally, I have what most would consider the epitome of a black powder collection. In fact I've already had offers on it, but I chose to save it for Armslist. A 2-pounder field cannon, the same one you might have found accompanying trade ships into Indian country in the early 1800's(nothing says 'let's make a deal' like some heavy artillery...), mounted on a home-made(functional, albeit ugly) stand. Some slight surface rust has accumulated since I had to store it in the garage, but nothing a half-hour and steel wool can't fix. This little cannon is small, but packs a HUGE punch. Two shots felled a pine tree on our private range in Washington(probably the coolest shooting adventure I've had yet). It fires, nominally, 1-1/2"" round shot(weighing in just under 2lb), but we had plenty of fun loading it with metal BB's in a canister round(which absolutely shredded a piece of plywood, and a line of unfortunate pumpkin soldiers). The barrel was cast in 2011. It needs some TLC, that's for sure, but it is fully functional. Really the only issues as I see it are the surface rust and the rough weld-lines('rough' herein meaning 'ugly'). Doesn't actually affect the firing, but I'm a sucker for smooth symmetric barrels, so it bothers me. A cannon primer and the last of my fuse wire is also included. Unfortunately, I somewhat over-zealously shot all the rounds we had, so it does not include ammunition or powder. However, contact any ball-bearing factory and you'll be able to get them by the thousand.


-2lb field cannon, with cannon primer and fuse wire              -                 $220


  The low cost(as compared to other cannon) is because of the facts that it A) was homemade, as opposed to 'professionally' built, B) has some surface rust, C) has no ammunition/powder, D) I find the mount/weld lines to be ugly. However, it was made by a professional machine smith, just not in a professional setting. He has his own shop in his secondary garage, and has been making cannons for decades.



    Now, for those of you who might not have hard cash, I am always willing to take a look at trades. At the moment, I am looking specifically for the listed below, but feel free to show me anything. I love guns of all types. The only thing I will not consider are super-expensive, not very interesting('tacticool' AR15's being a classic example), and those newer muzzle-loading rifles, with the weird pellets and centerfire systems. I'm more of a traditionalist, in case you couldn't tell by all the Mosins. Wood and steel I love, plastic starts to lose my interest. But don't be discouraged; worst I can say is no.


-Finnish Mosin, any year, any condition, I really want one of these beauties. M39's preferred, but I'll look at any.

-Finnish Maxim(distinct from the Russian Maxim by the large water cap on the jacket for shoving in snow instead of water). It must be chambered 7.62x54R. I would prefer a cheap kit as opposed to a beautiful, Stalin-himself-fired-this-Maxim, as I enjoy project guns. Slight damage is ok, but must have all the parts, including barrel and hopefully receiver(semi-automatic, of course). The name of the game here is the cheapest functional, non-damaged Maxim. I will for a certainty be taking her out to shoot, so no brass Maxims, no perfect museum quality pieces, etc. I'm hoping to find someone who has one of the full kits from the 1990's. Finnish is preferred by I will take a look at any Maxim chambered for 7.62. This is the single gun I'm missing from my Soviet collection; if you have one, I will trade just about anything I own for it, and if I don't have what you want, I will damn well find what you want. Bonus points if it has the classic shield and carriage, as opposed to a tripod. Older years are preferred, but after a decade of searching, I'm not too picky. Huge bonus points if it is WWI/Bolshevik era Maxim. I should mention, I will not even consider 'scalper' prices on this; one gentleman wanted $8600 for just the rifle, no carriage or shield. Unequivocal, laughable no. That is 40 Mosins(or a car), to put that in perspective. I've waited a decade; I can wait another.

-Nagant revolver/Tokarev 9mm. I have essentially no pistols, having focused almost completely on rifles, so I'm looking around for some good-old-fashioned Soviet pistols. Bonus points if you happen to have extras.

-1911, .45ACP. Rock Island(Armscor) or Colt preferred.

    Well, a novel or two later and my hands are sore. Be quick to reply! Last year, my 'surplus' collection sold within 4 days; utter pandemonium. That's it for now Armslist, I look forward to a full inbox again.


Oh! I almost forgot to mention; if you're a more medieval-minded weapons collector, I have a Cold Steel Italian longsword, a Cold Steel gladius, a Civil War pattern saber(decorative, but pretty nonetheless), all for sale;

-Longsword:         $240
-Gladius:              $40
-Saber:                $20

If you're looking for a great compact gun to carry or for a loved one/wife/girlfriend to carry this is what you've been looking for plus you get a custom leather holster i paid $65 for and the most effective .380 Self Defense Ammo i could find after much research which is Federal Defense plus some Black Hills Gold Hollow Points .This gun has a Low Round Count and since i had not shot it for a few months, I just wanted to make sure everything is perfect so i took it to the range and fired 10 or 12  Full Clips of Ammo plus one round in the chamber esch time and it performed perfectly, and it is exceptionally accurate,  it shoots tight groups and the Professional Gunsmith Work really shows when you shoot it, it is so much smoother than it was originally and the trigger feels so much better,  this gun feels much,  much better than a new one plus i assure you it shoots perfectly and feeds both regular ammo and hollow points perfectly,  i trust this gun as much as any Glock, Springfield,  Kimber, S&W, Ruger or any other high quality pistol i have ever owned.  I wouldn't sell you something i would not trust my own life with.  A perfectly reliable micro-compact .380 that shoots this well is honestly harder to find than most people think,  lots of them have problems feeding ammunition and jam up, etc but this one is one of the best, it shoots perfectly fine with all types of fmj and hollow point ammo, i have tried at least 7 different brands of Ammo and all have performed great.

PLEASE SUBMIT OFFERS BY E-MAIL AND FEEL FREE TO INCLUDE PICTURES AND DETAILS IF POSSIBLE. 
I have over $500 Invested,  the gun itself cost $359.99 + Tax/Fees, i spent $120 on the Gunsmith Work which really made this gun stand out from the rest and waa worth every penny.  The Custom Leather Holster was $65, and the Ammunition waa not cheap but i wont count that, so you can see I have over $500 invested in this gun which I know seems like a lot for a .380 but that's just how much it cost. This gun functions perfectly and is very, very accurate and reliable.  I don't expect to get my money back on this one but the Gunsmith Work really made this gun shine, it is much better than it was when I bought it new and you can count on it hitting whatever you aim it at and it will go bang every time. I bought this with the intention of my wife carrying it but she refuses to and i already have a gun i have been carrying for years so i don't really need this gun, i spent the extra money on everything so it would be smoother to shoot and be as reliable as possible and it's honestly the best shooting gun of this size i have ever owned/fired, most of these guns in this size range have a pretty hard trigger to pull which really makes them harder to shoot accurately but this one is very smooth and is actually with no gritty feeling and is actually a lot of fun to shoot,  the trigger feels great and I'm sure that contributes to it's accuracy.  Thanks for looking and this will make a great everyday concealed carry gun for someone and it includes everything you need to start carrying comfortably and effectively.

I bought this with the intention of getting a stamp and cutting it down but never went through with it.

I searched for about 9 months before I found this beauty in LIKE NEW condition. I dare say you could look much longer & NEVER find one in such pristine condition. This is a 3rd Generation gun made somewhere in the mid 1990's (my best guess) & was favorite among cops & the public as a larger 9mm carry gun. This one shows no signs of having been holstered or carried & has probably had less than 60 rounds fired through it. Remarkably accurate with very mild recoil. Note the absence of exterior safety devices. This is pretty well a full sized 9mm. It comes with two 15 round magazines… Although it can take 10 round magazines also… The 15 round magazines run from $40 to $80 on the re-sale market… My magazines are original S&W with almost no signs of use or wear. Although they say 15 rounds…As with most magazines getting the last 2 rounds seated may be a struggle. A variety of magazines are out there for the 3rd generation S&Ws. 

Mechanically, the 5943 offers all of the same features as any of the other full size, original double column 9mm’s that were part of the 3rd Generation line except for their trigger mechanism and the components related to it. The main thing however is the actual operation of the trigger. As a gun sold by the factory as being “Double Action Only” it is obviously “Double Action” for every shot but its travel is much shorter than the first shot and its overall movement is not at all like the follow up Single Action shots on those guns either. You are much less likely to have an accidental discharge with this gun. The first shot is a very deliberate action… Does that make it bad? Of course not. And if you look at some of the threads on this Board here dealing with Pistols, you will see that a lot of people actually prefer it over the “Traditional” guns. It’s just “different” and you simply need to know that going in and make up your own mind in regard to whether or not you like it or if it is “right” for you.

From a S&W forum : ""I was issued a 5943 as a duty weapon in the early nineties (as were all patrol officers then) and at first I wasn't to crazy about the DAO, having owned several S/A-D/A pistols, but actually learned to appreciate it as time went on, due to the simplicity of it. I carried that pistol for more than a dozen years, and the only problem I ever had was a defective mag release (flew apart) when the gun was new and had only a hundred or so rounds through it. After that, it was only the occasional recoil spring replacement. I carried it with the above mentioned Uncle Mikes grips, and it was very comfortable for me. I enjoyed it so much that when we changed to the plastic pistols, I purchased it from the dept. for the more than fair sum of one hundred dollars, and still enjoy firing it to this day....night sights long since dead, but here it is, I keep it in the original box.""

""The 5943 is a great gun. The alloy frame makes it light enough to carry. I wish I still had mine.""

The 15 round magazines run from $40 to $80 on the re-sale market… My asking price includes the gun, 2 15 round magazines & what appears to be an original S&W plastic carry case. I say dare to compare this to other USED guns & you will be very pleased with this one. Detailed photos show what you will be looking at. The listed price is NOT an OBO price. If you are serious about this model, you know that the likelihood of finding another one in this condition is about slim & none… I know what I am selling & know what it is worth. Sure you can go out & buy a new Glock for this price. But if that's what you wanted you would not be looking at this ad. If you (or a relative) were in the PD during some time during the 90's… CHances are this could have been the piece you were (or they) were carrying :)

You could try refinishing the stock but its probably not worth it unless you care about the looks that much. In dismantling the gun down the cracks MIGHT worsen. Either leave it alone or replace the wood. Some superficial rust on barrel end and discoloration of the patina on metal allover. A few hours work with steel wool and oil over a few weeks will iron out any rust. It has been oiled every week that I've owned it. It still works so if you just want a functioning gun that you don't have to worry about banging up or hang on a wall to look 'rustic' this will do. I could say it has character but that's a stretch.
