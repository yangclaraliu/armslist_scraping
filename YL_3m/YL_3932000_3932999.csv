This unique holster design allows you to forget old-fashioned thumb breaks that slow your draw and complicate re-holstering.

The weapon can't accidentally leave the holster.
SERPA TECHNOLOGY FEATURES:
- Full firing grip for draw and immediate retention upon re-holster
- No thumb break or awkward middle finger release to slow down your draw
- Speed cut allows faster draw and easy re-holster

The factory description of this rifle is below.

Armalite M-15 A2 National Match Rifle

Description;

The Armalite M-15 A2 National Match Rifle is a semi-automatic rifle chambered in .223 Rem. or 5.56 NATO. It has a .223 WYLDE chamber. The M-15 A2 National Match Rifle is a variant of one of four rifles manufactured and sold by Armalite. Armalite recommends the gun for military shooting.

The M-15 A2 National Match Rifle features a National Match rear sight that does not exist on the M-15 A2 Service Model Rifle. The rear sight is adjustable .25 inches for windage and .5 inches for elevation. The gun also features a steel, chrome-lined barrel threaded for a flash suppressor, which reduces the visible signature of the burning gases
 that exit the muzzle. The M-15 A2 National Match Rifle has a two-stage trigger and aluminum-made upper and lower receiver. The first stage of the trigger pull checks in at
 3.5 lbs, the second stage is approximately 4.5 to 5 lbs. 

The M-15 A2 National Match Rifle has a synthetic stock finished in black or green, and weighs 9.1875 lbs. The gun is equipped with forged carry handle and A2 front sight. It has a rifling twist of 1 in 8 inches and is set at 1 MOA. 

Armalite is an influential firearms manufacturer whose small arm designs have evolved into weapons currently in use today, like the M16 and M4, by militaries around the
 world. The company is currently based out of Geneseo, Illinois.

The only trades that I would be interested in is: a converted Saiga 12 gauge, a Wilson, Ed Brown or a Les Bauer .45. I CAN ADD CASH FOR THE RIGHT FIREARM."

The optic allows for fast and accurate shots out to 50yrds. The 40S&W barrel allows for much cheaper trips to the range.

I love this gun and I paid just under $700 for it in late summer 2014, bought brand new. However, I would like to get rid of the safe queen and use the money to catch up on some bills. This is a wonderful pistol and very, very accurate. Fully loaded, it weighs a little less than a 1911 and feels like you're shooting a .22. I hate to sell this, but I use my Glocks more and it is more of a challenge to master those. With that being said, this pistol shoots better than I do! It is extremely accurate. I have done zero modifications to this gun except for getting another pair of grips. The finish is in excellent shape and I cleaned it after every range trip and every night after carrying (only carried this heavy thing for a month). I'm selling this thing extremely cheap. I hate to let it go, but I would rather it go to someone that will use it more. I'll eventually pick up another or just get a CZ-85. For just $500 FIRM this Czech masterpiece can be yours!

This pistol has night sights, factory lighter trigger, extended magazine release, and extended slide release. Perfect full frame carry gun that is also ready for competition shooting. Fast, accurate, and reliable. 

The Glock 35 lower is identical to, and interchangeable with, the Glock 22 upper.

As you will note in the picture, I have lots of magazines for this pistol. I believe the total is 10. They are available to anyone interested, at an additional price. On that note, if you are interested, I have no shortage of accessories for this pistol, from holsters to ammo and even including a LaserMax internal laser sight. If you are looking to get into a .40 S&W package, we could probably work out a deal on everything. However, the price listed is for the pistol only (along with the 2 factory mags that every Glock comes with).

Open to trades, too, especially if they involve Glocks and AR's.

These guns are based on the Walter Olympia, which in turn probably was based on the American Reising Target Pistol (with a fair number of modifications).

The M41 and Hammerli 208/212 both share this origin.  Unlike the Hammerli, the M41 does not offer an adjustable trigger, and generally is less accurate (even with custom barrels and the like).  However, it is an excellent gun for both target and general use.  Also unlike the Hammerli, the surface finish is beautiful, but the precision of some of the parts fitting is less than perfect.

FFL transfer ONLY.  NO exceptions on this gun, even if buyer has a FOID card or government department affiliation.  No shipping charge at THIS price.  Lower price offers can be considered, but shipping likely will be additional  Shipping IS available on this gun to a licensed FFL.

Please see my other listing for an A series gun that is not so perfect cosmetically (A series is Bangor Punta), but is somewhat more accurate.

The no-letter guns were among the best that S&W ever produced.

There is also railing/ribs on top of the slide. The barell is threaded so it can accept attachments and so forth. Sights are adjustable. It comes with 1 mag that holds 8.  The grips are made of a hard brown plastic with black streaks going through it, they look quite nice so I didnt have them replaced. Bluing is 95% and it was made in 1972 imported by stoeger. This gun is made of high quality pieces and guns made by Llama in the '60s-'70s were considered to be the best of Llama.  This would make a great carry pistol or a nice piece to a Spanish collection. It comes with 300 rounds of Remington Viper. Due to the fact these are hard to find the price is firm."

Century Arms Stabilizing Brace
No Tax Stamp Required! Innovation & Added Functionality! The SB47 stabilizing brace is an awesome invention that secures AK style pistols to the forearm of the shooter and assists in firing the pistol the way it is intended - with one hand. Using the SB47 in this way, recoil is reduced significantly, resulting in more accurate shooting without compromising safety, comfort or control. Designed and made by a U.S. Military veteran with help from a top V.A. prosthetic specialist, the intent and design of the stabilizing brace is to help America's wounded veterans enjoy large frame handgun shooting again. The concept was to invent and create a device that would act as an extension of one's own arm - so it is like a part of your body. Well the SB47 did that - and more! Not only did it help our wounded heroes regain their confidence and handgun skills, it was wicked fun for anyone to use! BATF approved for everybody, the SB47 does not require any special permits, doctors notes or SBR tax stamp! Will fit PAP M92 PV, PAP M85 PV, Draco and C39 Pistols.

I have three of these & also the longer model 91/30. I am as accurate with the T53 as I am with the 91/30s The rifling on the guns are perfect. Shiny with great grooves. Very accurate... I have heard the T53 is more accurate than the M44, but all I know is it shoots great and kicks like a mule.... lol 

In my opinion, a proper military restoration should keep the character of the gun, but bring out the beauty. These Guns have both. A 5 coats of satin finish. Every nick and ding has a story, so they were left visible. These guns were used in war, but they were built to last! I own a lot of guns, but cannot think of a more fun gun for under $200!!

Comes with two extra mags and has been fired less than 100 rds. Bought it for recreational shooting/fun and I just don't get out often enough to justify it. It is a great gun if you like to target practice with cheap ammo or like to hunt varmints. The quad rail allows for lasers/tactical grips/red dots/etc. which enhances the fun of target practicing. I have owned several AR's and like to shoot this much better because the ammo is so much cheaper."

I've had a lot of questions about this rifle so I did a google and am ready to answer everything. This info may or may not come from the moms against guns group website.
Q - what does psa stand for?
A - people shooting automatical
Q - what does ps-15 stand for?
A - people shooting - the 15 references how many people will be killed every time the trigger is pulled
Q - what is .223 / 5.56?
A - these numbers are complete gibberish, they mean nothing
Q - what is a quad rail forend?
A - it means the 4 ends on the gun are rails for additional killing power
Q - what is a railed gas block?
A - this blocks the gas from coming down the rails and killing the shooter, safety feature
Q - 5 mags?
A - these are the 30 clip round magazines we've all heard about, they are not round, the bullets are.
Q - 300 rounds? 
A - that is enough of the bullets to take over mexico
Q - what is an eotech clone?
A - after the first eotech was made scientists made clones, like with sheep.

The gun is unusual in that it is a bullpup, in which the breech and fire-control components lie behind the pistol grip and trigger. The main advantage of such a layout is that it can incorporate a comparatively long barrel in a relatively short overall package. In the Appeal, that equates to a 26 ¼ inches overall with an 18-inch barrel. In practical terms, that means the Appeal, ready to fire, is nearly as compact as some disassembled takedown rifles. Fully Reversible for Right or Left-Handed Shooters.

You can purchase this prized AR-15 for the very reasonable price of $2833.04. The comparables of this gun are all well into the $3000.00 range.  I am passing on my good fortune to you, but this price is firm, and I will not take trades.  This is a cash only private party sale (no checks, money orders or credit cards accepted).  This sale does not require and FFL. I may be willing to warranty parts for 90 days from date of purchase if you specify this as part of the sale, but will require the broken part (un-cleaned, as-is) to ensure no abuse which would void warranty (using low grade ammo or using .223 ammo also voids parts warranty) you will have to provide proof of caliber, type, lot# and manufacturer of ammo (plus one unused round) to invoke parts warranty.  I will perform powder analysis to ensure ammo stated is true.  All sales are final.

This is a real tack driver for a great price and is fun to shoot. If you like the metallic sound of silhouettes falling you’ll love this weapon.
It has a 24” crowned, bull barrel with 1:10 twist, free floating in a Michaels of Oregon stock. The trigger is match grade and breaks very nicely. 
The optics are a Springfield Armory Gen 2 Government scope with built in range finder, .308 Bullet drop compensator and internal bubble level to eliminate any canting of the system on those long shots. With this scope you don’t have to take your eye off the target to determine range and ensure there is no cant in your hold. When I took it out to the range the first day, I shot the groups you see below at 100 yards and I am not the best shot.
The weapon comes with a Harris bi-pod, Leupold scope mount and rings, Eagle shooting mat, Dewey cleaning rods and bore alignment tool to ensure you don’t scratch the barrel during cleaning.
The sale also comes with the original Savage stock in which the barrel is pillar mounted if you decide to go back to basics. I’ll also throw in the .50 cal ammo can to help organize your trip to the range.  I’ve put about 75 rounds through this system, which is just about enough to break it in.
