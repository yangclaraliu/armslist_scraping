With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.
The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional. LNIB with all factory papers, test casing, bushing wrench etc. serious inquiries only, no trades.

Not a scratch or spec of dust anywhere. I've lost interest and that is your gain! This round is still affordable to shoot all day. 
I scored a 50 with five rounds at 350 yards.   The scope is a 4-12x40. With the quick adjustment. . Cash sale would work but I'd really like to trade! .  Don't forget Remington model 700 or model 783 does not offer 223 anymore.  Which is crazy because the 223 is used as a sniper rifle by police and army's all over the world. Negotiable just looking for a fair trade for both parties I also have a crimson trace rail master, nice 22 magnum micro groove. 
This is a very new rifle it was built in Dec of 2012 by the stamping on the barrel."

I have not shot this pistol, being it a .50 cal, it is a caliber that I do not have any ball for. The ram rod is wood, and seems very light, I do not know if this was original to this pistol, or one that some one made up. This gun has an issue with the lock geometry, in one of the pictures the pistol seems to be on half cock, that is FULL COCK. The lock on this pistol is poorly made, and very crude inside, externally it looks very nice. I have parts of an old stripped CVA flintlock lock that I will let go with this so maybe the purchaser could change the sear and fix the problem IF they would fit, I don't know if they would. Worse case this pistol is going to need a new lock. Even with the stupidly short throw, it will make a small spark, so the frizzen is hard. The pistol is light, well balanced, and would be worth the investment of a new lock I think. It does have slight dings and bumps in the stock. $135 shipped."

In 1873, it is said that dime novelist Ned Buntline presented Colt revolvers with shoulder stocks to the most famous men of the Old West, including lawmen Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson. The Buntline revolver was one of the first reliable repeating rifles, battle-tested in the Mexican War as well as Indian Wars of the Southwest. This new Beretta Stampede Buntline revolver is a true working replica of the famous Buntline, featuring the same great performance and reliability as Beretta Stampede revolvers.  There are a few handling marks from taking it in and out of the safe as seen in the pictures. What is so special about this gun is it's finish, most were made with blue finishes. This particular one is a part of the first 50 produced. This one is Nickel. This fire arm came out of a collection.  Been in a safe since it's purchase ( approx 2006).  Not very much information could be found to back up the original purchaser.  We were told there was only 50 made with this special finish.  The gun is number 11 by the serial number.  Never been fired nor has the cylinder been rotated.  Has the factory box, wrapping and paperwork.

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.
The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional. LNIB with all factory papers, test casing, bushing wrench etc. serious inquiries only, no trades.

Includes both backstraps, Ruger's gi-normous factory lock and two keys, two Ruger 10-round mags (both with flat and pinky extension caps), sealed envelope with factory test-fire brass, factory box and paperwork that came from the factory. 

Prefer face-to-face in east Tennessee without having to deal with shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with valid TN driver’s license or carry permit (sorry, I’m not goin’ to jail  just to make a sale). 

Cash price is firm, although I’d prefer to trade for a small 9mm such as Kel-Tec PF-9, Ruger LC9, Glock G26, Sccy CPX-2, or Springfield XDS 9, all in black/blue (i.e., no stainless, pink or purple!). 

Sorry, but I’m also NOT interested in Xbox’s, bowling balls, crossbows or riding mowers.

Thanks for wading through all this and I think you’d enjoy owning this fine handgun!"

I'm looking to trade this for a high end optic (Aimpoint, Trijicon, NightForce, Leupold, US Optics, Swarovski, S&B).  I'd prefer a 1-4, 1-6, or 1-8.  I'd consider a 1x, but really depends what type.

I'd also consider any sort trade for a Knight's Armament SR15 (Mod 1, LPR, 14.5, SBR) or SR25.  Also, would consider LMT MWS .308 or LMT MRP 5.56 (prefer slick rails for either).

Used, but in good condition USP .40S&W Compact.  This gun served as a duty firearm in a previous life and has since been retired to nightstand duty.  Roughly 600 rounds down the pipe.  Gun has some mild holster wear, which may not appeal to some, but it truly adds character to this gun.

The CETME rifle was designed primarily by the German engineer Ludwig Vorgrimler, who based his design on the experimental German StG 45(M) and the French-made AME 49. The StG45 used a roller-delayed blowback mechanism somewhat similar to the roller-locking system patented by Edward Stecke in the 1930s in Poland and used in the MG42. The MG42 locking system actually locks completely and requires a short stroke barrel that travels backwards to unlock, compared to the StG45(M) system that never completely locks and does not require a moving barrel. The CETME design inherits the StG45(M)'s fixed-barrel. The first prototype rifles fired the same 7.92x33mm Kurz round as the StG45, and a variety of experimental 7.92 and 7.62mm cartridges were tested before settling on the 7.62×51mm CETME. This round was dimensionally identical to 7.62×51mm NATO, but with a lighter bullet and powder charge to reduce recoil, making fully automatic fire more controllable. Due to feedback from Heckler & Koch, the production rifle was chambered for the more powerful 7.62mm NATO. The Model B went on to be the foundation of the widely-deployed Heckler & Koch G3 battle rifle.

The CETME Model A began manufacture in Spain in 1957. The CETME series of battle rifles was manufactured in five models, the A, B, C, L, LC and LV models. The primary difference in the three first models is the absence of bipod and the lightweight C model, and the fact that the L, LC and LV models fire the smaller 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge."

My price is $2400 plus $25 shipping. 


The KAC SR-15 E3 is the premiere AR15 platform on the market, no other manufacturer can touch the proven out of the box performance and reliability of the KAC SR-15 E3. The KAC SR-15 E3 Carbine 14.5 DIMPLED Upper features some of the latest technology to come out of the Knight’s Armament facility, including the light weight, free float, KAC URX 3.1 Rifle Length 13.5in P/N: 30326 rail system, which extends the full length of the 5.56mm NATO 14.5” dimpled chrome lined Medium profile barrel, threaded 1/2x28.. The KAC SR-15 E3 Carbine 14.5 DIMPLED Upper is a 5.56 NATO/223 Rem upper featuring a Medium Profile Machine Gun 14.5in 1:7 Twist Hammer Forged, Chrome Lined, Dimpled (Ball mill lightened) barrel. It includes the URX3.1 13.5in rail system with KAC Micro Front and Micro 200-600m Rear BUIS. The KAC SR-15 E3 Carbine 14.5 DIMPLED Upper features the URX (upper receiver extending) free floating barrel system, Ball mill lightened barrel, E3 Multi-Lug Bolt, and KAC Proprietary Mid-Length Gas System. The E3 operating system is undeniably the most reliable platform in existence. It’s rounded lugs, increased internal mass, and dual ejector springs mitigate stress and failure points common to standard designs. KAC’s Proprietary Mid-Length Gas System is hands down the softest shooting recoil impulse system on the market, this provides the end-user with an unmatched flat trajectory and controllability. This combination of the Mid-length Gas System and the 14.5in 1:7 Twist Hammer Forged, Chrome Lined, Medium Profile Machine Gun Dimpled (Ball mill lightened) barrel make this arguably one of the finest 5.56 platforms in existence. The lightweight and battle ready KAC URX 3.1 Rifle Length 13.5in P/N: 30326 also offers 4 Quick Detachment (QD) mounting points on the rail system. The upper and will ship as pictured with the Knights Armament Panel Kit URX 3 & 3.1 P/N: 30408-BLK.

Look no further, this 5-shot revolver is exactly what you're looking for. Ruger's LCR (lightweight compact revolver) chambered in .38 special has a barrel length of less than 2"" (1.875"" actual) and weighs a mere 13.5 oz. You won't have a problem making this disappear no matter where you carry it on your waist. The best thing this snubnose revolver boasts is how crisp and clean the trigger pull is. It has the consensus best double action trigger pull currently available on the market. This firearm is also built to handle +P loads, which when fired with the included Hogue Tamer Monogrip makes it very comfortable in your hand and easy and fun to shoot. The front sight on this firearm has been upgraded to a XS tritium night sight which glows a bright green in the dark. This particular firearm is the Talo limited edition silver limited to just 1,500 made. Very hard to find! This firearm has only had 5 rounds fired through it and was cleaned immediately after, so it is almost brand new. I have many more pics available upon request. Let me know if interested.

 pt840 description from taurus:

 This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.
