Also includes Nikon M-223 xr mount.  $809 on Amazon and voted one of the best scopes under $1000.

Overview:
The 3-15x50 Tactical Riflescope (Matte Black) from Weaver has been specially engineered for tactical applications. It has been manufactured to the strictest tolerances in order to perform in the harshest environments. The 3-15x50 Tactical riflescope is waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. It has a 30mm, single piece tube construction. This riflescope is endowed with a Mil-Dot reticle and has fully multicoated lenses that contribute to the brightness and contrast of the optics. Locating the reticle in the first focal plane allows the size of the pattern to increase as the magnification is increased. This is preferred by many tactical groups for use as a point of aim and as a means of measurement. 

The side focus feature allows parallax adjustment to keep the reticle and target aligned regardless of the shooters head position. An extra-hard coating on the exterior lens surfaces protects the optics from the scratches and abrasions that all too often occur in the rough and tumble world of tactical endeavors. With a comfortable eye relief of approximately 4 inches and a ¼ MOA click value for the windage and elevation turret adjustments, this riflescope is provisioned with all the features required for serious tactical work. This is a serious glass for serious situations.

30 mm tube One-piece construction Argon purged to eliminate internal fogging Reset-to-zero turrets allow consistently accurate and precise target acquisition Waterproof, shockproof and fog proof provide rugged and durable protection to the scope Powerful 5 times magnification to move quickly from a wider to a more defined field of view Reticle located in the first focal plane allows the size of the pattern to increase as the magnification is increased Fully multicoated optics: multiple layers on all air to glass surfaces for a brighter, higher-contrast image with less eyestrain Side focus parallax adjustment provides compensation for the shooters head movement as it affects the apparent movement of the target relative to the reticle The Mil-Dot reticle is the standard reticle used by the US Army and Marine Corps that enables long range distance calculations. A series of dots on the cross hairs gives the shooter the ability to judge bullet drop and the proper hold over for accurate long range shot placement

I have a new Armalite Super SASS I am looking to sell. I purchased this gun with the intention of getting into long range shooting, but other hobbies have taken my time and I never got out to shoot this thing. It is all set up to tack drive. With this set up, you can shoot 1000+ yards. This is an armalite factory rifle, not a parts kit franken-gun put together in a garage...

I have spared no expense on the optics and mount, so this is a true long range precision rifle, ready to shoot sub MOA. Please note, the Atlas Bipod is not included in the sale price. Since purchasing this rifle several months ago, it has spent all of its life in a climate controlled safe. Never shot and never dry fired. Its ready for your break-in ritual...

Below is what I paid for the items
Armalite Super Sass	$2,767.94
ADM AD-RECON Mount	$179.00
Hogue Pistol Grip	$20.00
DMR Bushnell Tactical Elite 3.5-21x G2 Ret. FFP Scope	$1,299.00
Total	$4,265.94

I'm asking $4000, as I know I will not get 100% of what I have in it even though these rifles are VERY hard to find. I have personally never seen one locally...CCW Holders are preferred, but I will expect to see proof of Ohio residency if not a CCW Holder. As this is a higher end rifle, I prefer to do a transfer at a gun shop so this is a safe and hassle free transaction for both parties. I am a straight shooter, and I appreciate the same respect from you."

The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. 
The KEL-TEC P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 
The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters. 
From the very beginning of the design and development, computers have been used exclusively. All machined components are also made on modern high speed computerized equipment.

 The P-32 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, 
and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. 
The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from 
the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

Original owner, very, very few rounds shot. It just sits in the safe, one of my New Years resolutions is to try and clear out stuff I never use to free up for things that can be put to better use.
A quick search online will show how great this gun is.
I have the original box, and may include a little ammo with purchase.
Bass Pro has this same gun for $479 plus tax, which would put it around $520.
You can save money because this rifle has seen a few dozen rounds, was cleaned, and put away.
Asking $395.
Prefer cash, but may consider trading for a like new Gen 3 or 4 Glock 17 or 19."

(I take credit cards)

I just installed a new DTI Mil Spec BCG ($110.00) at no additional cost.

This is my fight-like-you-train rifle.

It’s a true Mil-Spec M4A1 SOPMOD Block 1 Clone, I’ve just gone over it with a fine comb, refurbished, repainted, and recoated everything that needed fixin’. It’s better than new.
I’m willing to part with it in one of three configurations (top to bottom on third picture):

1.	“Bare Bones” $700.00
•	Brand new plastic AR-15 handguards
•	Brand new 6 position standard stock

2.	“The Grunt”  $850.00
•	Brand new* Knights Armament Rail Adaptive System with rail covers ($120.00 value)
•	Brand new 6 position standard stock
•	Brand new* MaTech Mil-Spec BUIS ($60.00 Value)

3.	“The Clone” (SOPMOD Block I) $950.00 (!)
•	Brand new Knights Armament Rail Adaptive System 
•	Taupe (tan/FDEish) grips and rail covers 
•	Brand new* B5 Systems 6-Position enhanced SOPMOD stock ($95.00 value)
•	Brand New MaTech Mil-Spec BUIS
•	1 windowed* FDE P-Mag

SPECS:
The barrel is 14.5” and has a 1/7 Twist. It also has a .25”special spacer and A2 flash-hider attached to make it a legal 16” (so no need for BATFE-NFA forms or tax stamps.)

The spacer has a larger bore than the barrel, so the gas pressure in this weapon is as close as you can get to an actual M4, same goes for muzzle velocity (depending on ammo.) This means that it cycles and recoils (and rises) like the real deal. It also fixes the reliability issue 16” direct impingement AR carbines sometimes have.

""BARREL LENGTH STUDIES IN 5.56MM NATO WEAPONS""
(http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1093)

The trigger is Mil-Spec and single stage. It’s polished to perfection, it’s one of the smoothest, crispest Mil-Spec triggers you will ever encounter.

The front post is F marked, the upper has M4 feed ramps, and the buffer is Heavy (H marked.) The grips and rail covers are masterfully coated.

*New as of the day of this posting, I’m using the rifle in the SOPMOD conifg so some components may show signs of battle wear if you take too long making up your mind.

Purchased as a LEM V2 (Heavy 8-9lb trigger pull) and later converted to V1 (Light 4.5-5lb trigger pull) with authentic HK Firing pin block spring and Trigger return spring. I have the V2 springs if you would like to convert back at any time. LEM is different from your run of the mill DA trigger, I would suggest researching on google if you aren't familiar. 

I have roughly 100 rounds through it and it's a BC date code (2012). It was cleaned after each range trip.

Included are two 10 round mags with OEM thumb rest floor plates as well as two OEM flat floor plates which conceal a bit easier. User Manual, interchangeable backstrap, and serial-matched HK Hard Case is included along with factory fired casing.

I also have a Remora IWB holster that you can take or leave. I love it, but not all do.

The Tokarev-TTC was originally designed by the Russians as the Soviets standard service pistol for WWII. These Tokarev pistols were manufactured by Poland at the famous Radom plant during the Cold war. They share a similar design to John Browning’s 1911 and 1903 automatic pistols. These pistols are used but were rebuilt and reblued and are in excellent exterior condition.  The bores can be a little dark but are great shooters. ICN #1918 & 1674.

The rifle features a thumb hole stock which offers and excellent cheek weld and aesthetic for hunting or target use. Unlike some other rifles such as Saiga’s this rifle is in proper configuration. To convert this rifle to a “standard” form only requires taking out few screws and swapping the furniture.

The rifle has a Tapco G2 trigger installed which offers a much improved break and pull weight over the original trigger. The trigger components are all US made and act as three compliance parts making this rifle 992r ready.

The rifle was purchased directly from the original owner while still in the packing grease. The rifle has had exactly 40 rounds of Remington white box brassed cased 7.62x39 ammunition fired thru it and nothing more. Needless to say it is in excellent condition.

This shotgun is in like new condition with only four shells through it. If you are not familiar with this shotgun it is made in Turkey by the same factories that make the Canik CZ75 clones and TP9, Winchester SXP, and many other quality firearms. This is a 5+1 pump action that will chamber 3 inch shells. Has a built in recoil pad and pistol grip, as well as a nice set of fiber optic ghost ring sights, a receiver mounted picatinny rail, a removable breacher choke, and is VERY lightweight. This is a Benelli pattern shotgun and will accept extended benelli magazine tubes. Very similar to a Benelli M3 (sans the semi auto functionality) for a fraction of the cost.

In great shape but Ive had a few shotguns with pistol grips and ring sights and Ive found that I prefer a straight stock with a bead sight. This shotgun retails for $299, Id like to trade it for a similalrly priced 12 gauge shotgun with a straight stock, bead sight, and 18-20 inch cylinder bore barrel, such as a Remington 870, Mossberg 500/maverick 88, winchester sxp, or similar. Only looking for combat/hd style shotguns, absolutely not interested in field guns, sorry.
