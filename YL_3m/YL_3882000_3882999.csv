If you aren't familiar with these kits, they are an easy way to get a lighter crisper trigger without sacrificing Glock reliability or voiding warranty.  Each component plays a small part, and it adds up to a smooth crisp trigger. Easy to install, which i am happy to do for you if you like.  The kit includes:

-3.5lb Ghost Ultimate Connector
-6.0lb Ghost Ultimate Trigger Spring
-Reduced-power safety spring

I also have one 4.0lb reduced power striker spring, which further lightens the trigger pull, but may slightly reduce reliability if you shoot reloads or ammo with hard primers (I have never had any issues, but many says they have).

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W 500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.

This gun has been lightly used and cleaned after every use.  I still have original case and all original parts (sights, magazine disconnect, etc.). The magazine disconnect bushing is a aftermarket replacement part that let's the magazine fall freely from gun. Stock disconnects bind up the mag when released as well as make the disassembling process a pain. This replacement bushing fixes all that. The mags are also spring loaded for quicker. I paid 360 for the gun and have about 140 in the upgrades. Sights were $50, Magazine Bumpers $30, Disconnect Bushing $20, and the grips were each $20. This is a very accurate little pistol and it's a blast to shoot. Very clean! I am wanting $475 or best offer. Please email me if you have any questions. Must have permit or CC."

It is equipped with a 1"" Leupold VX-3 2.5-8x36mm with duplex reticle. The CZ527 has a tapered bull barrel and a 1:12 rate of twist designed for lighter .233 ammunition. The rifle has a single-set trigger with allows the shooter to remove all but 1lb from the trigger pull which makes it a highly accurate firearm. I built it as my coyote rifle after many months of research and found that most owners report sub-MOA out of the box to several hundred yards. I can't attest to this claim personally because I've never fired the rifle - my hunting buddy deployed to Afghanistan and now I have no use for it. 

Included in the sale are two snapcaps, 1 detachable 5-round magazine, 120 rounds of 40gr Hornady V-Max ammo (reportedly the most accurate ammo for this rifle), a custom bolt handle (the factory handle wouldn't clear the rear bell of a scope), the never-used aforementioned Leupold, and a pair of Warne rings. It's a perfect setup for any varmint hunter or someone just looking for an exceptionally accurate target rifle. 

The above items cost me over $1500, plus taxes. I'd like $1300 for it and am open to certain partial trades. Acceptable trades would be a blued Sig P232, Walther PPK in .32ACP, IZH-35M, or other interesting boutique firearms.

The Eclipse Gun Co name was owned (trademarked to) Henri Pieper of Belgium and guns were manufactured from as early as the 1880's to as late as the 1920's. Henri Pieper was associated with several different companies some of which bore his name and all of them made handguns and shotguns. The Eclipse Gun Co. models ranged from a low of $14 to a high of $60 in the 1907 era. Ithaca doubles of that era ranged from $17.50 to $112.50. The Eclipse Gun Co. models were good quality, dependable, field grade doubles. Many models were made with Damascus barrels as were many of the quality doubles of the era. The 1907 Iver Johnson catalog had two pages on Eclipse Gun Co. models (6 total). This catalog fully identifies these guns as being of Pieper manufacture. The Eclipse Gun Company was also the trade name for guns imported by E.C. Meacham and by The W.C. George companies and the guns were made by Anciens Establishments Pieper, the Belgium gun maker founded by Henri Pieper. The company survived until 1957. Located in Davison. No trades, cash only"

From WMD about NiB-X:
NiB-X is our proprietary formulation…and a remarkable technology that proves that not all nickel boron coatings are created equal. WMD was a pioneer in of nickel boron technology in the firearms industry, and not only is our coating formula unique; our application process is, as well. We’re confident that our NiB-X coating provides the optimal combination of hardness, wear resistance, lubricity, and corrosion resistance.  The coating has a Rc 70 and a coefficient of friction of .06.  NiB-X maintains its properties in high temperature applications and impervious to most chemicals (Nitric Acid notwithstanding).  It has the same material properties throughout the structure of the coating so integrity and properties are maintained throughout the thickness.  Coating can be duplexed with sublayers or topcoats to enhance specific properties customers may desire."

Its defining feature is the green/black tiger stripe pattern on the finish, which is quite rare.  I bought this firearm in 2011 and carried it in my truck.  I have not fired many rounds though it - I would guess somewhere between 50-100.  It has a five-round cylinder and a 2 1/2 inch barrel.

Included with the firearm is everything you see in the first picture: a Fobus paddle holster, two speed-loaders, speedloarder case, a full box of Winchester silver tip .44 special rounds, and carrying case.

I've looked around armslist and found many listings for the Bulldog with outrageous prices.  I intend to be fair - the whole lot (gun, ammo, and accessories) for $350.

I prefer a face to face transaction, where the buyer will sign a bill of sale.  Feel free to message me with any questions.  Thanks for looking!"

A French MAS MLE 1949-56 rifle in original 7.5 mm.  

The predecessor rifle was the French MAS-49; it was formally adopted by the French Army in July 1949. 

An improved version of the MAS-49 was the MAS-49/56; it was introduced in 1957 and incorporated lessons learned from service in Algeria, Indochina, and the Suez Crisis. The rifle was shortened and lightened to improve mobility for mechanized and airborne troops, and a knife bayonet was added. The MAS-49 built-in rifle grenade launcher was replaced by a combination compensator/rifle grenade launcher that fired NATO-standard 22mm rifle grenades. The rifle also incorporates an integral grenade launching sight that is attached to the front sight block and a gas cutoff that prevents gas from entering the gas tube from the gas port when firing grenade launching blank ammunition.

This rifle is chambered in the original 7.5 mm; many were re-chambered at import into .308 and are considered less desirable. 

This rifle is excellent overall condition. Tight bolt action, clean barrel, and nice rifling. The stock in very good condition (see pictures).

Love this round but just can't justify having ONE gun that shoots 40 caliber and about ten that are chambered in 9mm.  I've only shot about 400 rounds through this gun since I bought it about 9 months ago.  It has very little wear on it besides minor scratches and has only seen a holster about ten times.  Been stored in a plastic case most of the time and I've used Frog Lube when it was in storage.

This Springfield was built in July of 1941 with a serial number in the 297,xxx range. It then went through a re-arsenal in Dec. 1965 at the Letterkenny Arsenal Army Depot. Has appropriate LEAD mark on receiver and the arsenal stamp is still intact on the stock as well (Hard to find the stocks with correct re-arsenal stamp since it can rub off). The barrel they put on in the re-arsenal is marked 1956 and there are no import marks on this rifle. Unfortunately I don't have gauges to put a number on the throat wear and muzzle but judging by a 30-06 round in the muzzle it's no worse than 1.5 and probably closer to 1. Chamber looks good though and it shoots fine so I can't imagine there is any excessive throat wear. 

Included with the rifle is a 1942 bayonet and a bandolier with surplus ammo on enblocs. (7 clips w/8 rounds each for 56 rounds total)

The sling pictured is actually an M1 carbine sling but was on the rifle when I received it in trade and I never got around to swapping it out. It will be included with the rifle. I don't have a photo of the bayonet but it is a model 1905E1 which is basically a 1942 bayonet that was cut down during the war to a 10"" length from it's original 16"" length. Comes with scabbard."

All ammo is factory fresh and never been loaded into a gun.  I bought a Sig P229 for a carry weapon and it was too darn heavy so I never touched the personal protection ammo and I've only shot about 300-400 rounds through the gun and this is what I have left.  

My loss is your gain.  I can't ship this so I am doing a local pickup or meet only.

Product Information
The CMMG AR-15 Sierra .22 Caliber A3 Upper is a complete dedicated rimfire AR-15 conversion upper that maintains compatibility with all the same parts and accessories that fit your full caliber AR's. The 22 Long Rifle conversion bolt, along with the barrel's true 22 LR chamber and proper 1/16"" twist rate, make for a truly accurate rimfire AR-15 for inexpensive practice, small game hunting, and introducing young or new shooters to the AR-15 platform. 

CMMG's Sierra rimfire uppers feature many significant improvements over previous designs, enhancing functionality, reliability, and ease of use. Prominent among these improvements are an Anti-Jam Charging Handle, Live Round Extraction ability, and Gas Deflector. CMMG's durable Weapons Armament Surface Protection (WASP) Melonite treatment has been applied to the barrel and surface-hardens the steel, extending barrel service life by reducing friction in the bore and lessening bore surface wear. 

The Sierra upper is ready to drop on to any standard mil-spec lower receiver, all that's needed are a compatible magazine and a pile of 22 LR ammunition to start enjoying some inexpensive and fun time at the range! Compatible with Black Dog Machine and CMMG rimfire AR-15 magazines (not included). CMMG recommends the use of Plated 40 grain High Velocity 22 LR ammunition for optimal functioning.

Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic 12841Designed with input from a distinguished group of current and former professionals, the Patrol Rifle Optic incorporates many never before seen features to maximize this sight's performance within the challenging conditions faced by modern law enforcement. A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches and fingerprints."

LoneWolf 40 to 9 Conversion Threaded Barrel w/Protector For Glock 23 and a 50 rd drum:

Bought but never used barrel; I paid $145 for the barrel and the protector (after shipping) but decided I didn't need it since I was able to get a threaded barrel for my 92A1

The Drum is one of the Korean Drums with box; I paid $100 for it. It has an easy loading assist lever built in so you don't need to stress out your fingers or break out the Glock Assisted Loading Tool. I have put 25 rds through it for the novelty in a friend's G19 but never used it with the conversion barrel so it's basically new and like I said, I still have the box.

Price is slightly negotiable if you meet me at a time and location of my convenience.

What I have here is a Nice Taurus 992 22lr/22mag 9 shot revolver. Its been shot very little and is very accurate and a great shooter. It is very easy to change cylinders, just push a button and pull out and put the other one in. It will come in the factory box with factory warranty card and key and rear sight cover. It will also come with a Full bulk pack of Winchester .22lr .36 gr and 2 50 rd boxes of Winchester 40 gr .22 wmr. I also have to add to the package some extra .22lr and wmr ammo. Available to the buyer of the revolver first. I will not accept low offers or trades for farm equipment, unless its a brush hog. I will listen to ""reasonable"" REASONABLE offers. I WILL NOT separate the ammo. Post in the comments as I dont check my ""other"" folder much and if we arent fb friends your message will go there. Price for this package is $475 obo For the extra ammo it will be $275 more. Trades id look at. Gen 4 G30s, Remington 1187 12 that takes up to 3.5"" Other auto shotguns, no cheap brands, I can add cash or more ammo for the right trade. If you have a bow it needs to be a smoking deal for me. Or bumpers for 79 jeep cj7 or 97 4 runner. Thats really all I can think of at the moment. I wont waste my time replying to lowballs or low trades. I know what this is all worth.

I'll include the original receipt/invoice with the bag for warranty concerns. I'm told WM has great customer service.

If you're considering a WM bag, you know how amazing they are so I'll be brief with the specs and benefits. 

One thing I discovered when shopping for a WM bag is that they NEVER go on sale by mandate of the manufacturer, which is a bummer when purchasing, but this helps their bags retain value. The Versalite has actually appreciated by $60 dollars in retail price since last spring.

You can read reviews of the Versalite in several places. You'll notice that every site gives it 5 stars.
