Vintage Manufacturing Date of 1975 

This is a very shiny and desirable vintage 1975 Colt MK IV, Series 70 Government Model .45 auto, finished in Colt’s beautiful Bright Nickel. The pistol has polished slide flats, and matte slide top and undercarriage. The pistol has factory checkered wooden grips with gold-colored Colt medallions that look really nice against the Bright Nickel finish. The grips have black grain running through the brown. The stainless factory magazines are Colt-marked. The pistol has some small but noticeable marks primarily on the slide. Otherwise, the gun is in very nice condition with a shiny bore and a very smooth trigger pull – overall condition is around 90%. Series 70 Colt 1911’s keep going up in value, and the nickel finished guns are quite desirable."

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition., ** This is a special order item and IS NOT STOCKED IN OUR STORE.

AAC's MODEL-7 rifle is chambered in the new 300 AAC BLACKOUT cartridge which offers an accurate, light weight, and compact package for hunting or target shooting. The action is made by Remington to AAC's specifications. It has all the features and safety you come to expect from a Model-7 action (a shorter version of the Model-700), A 20 MOA scope rail is mounted to the receiver using M24 type 8-40 screws. The X-Mark Pro™ trigger is factory set for 3.5 lbs and provides the feel needed for precision shooting. The barrel is a 5R 1:7 twist and threaded 5/8-24. A thread protector is included. The nitride surface of the barrel, bore, and chamber provide maximum service life and durability - longer than even hard-chrome but with the accuracy potential of a stainless barrel. Corrosion and wear resistance of the bore is extreme."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition., This is a special order item and IS NOT STOCKED IN OUR STORE.

The standard 5.56 bullet will travel over 3,000FPS and the barrel is capable to shoot 1/4 groups or better. The charging handle is a badger ordnance ambidextrous. It is over $100 by itself. The BCG is a Colt and never used that go for $170. They are pretty much as good as BCG can get. These uppers without a BCG or charging handle go for over $750. I paid almost $1000 after shipping for everything.  I'll let my NEVER fired upper go for $825. I need to pay for up coming classes....

I do not know the total round count but, since getting it, I have put 200 rounds through it without a hiccup.  It is an excellent piece, but it simply does not suit my purposes.  This is a big heavy gun, made of solid steel, that will shoot forever.   

The price is $850.  This includes shipping to an FFL and 3% paypal fee.  I will consider trades–either a 1911 Combat Commander (70’s-series preferred) or a SIG 1911 Fastback or Compact.  I will only trade for another all-steel gun.

Here are some of the new upgrades: 

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1). 

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design. 

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it. 

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant. 

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail. 

* It has a lightweight, quick detach bipod with modular feet. 

* It has a monopod as standard equipment instead of having to pay additional and add as an accessory; this is a big help so you do not have to support the weight of the rear of the rifle with your own strength. It also allows you to dial the elevation of where your aiming up or down with the monopod with even more accuracy so even if you don't want to upgrade you may want to ask about adding a monopod. 

*The case it comes with from the factory is an upgrade from a Pelican case to a nicer Storm case. The Storm case is much easier to open and close, and you don’t bust your knuckles on it, and the case features padding inside instead of bare plastic.

Constructed of 100% stainless steel and 360 degree circumferentially welded the Turbodyne produces less noise than a .22LR. The bullet impact can be heard and is the primary source of sound while the lack of concussion allows for hours of comfortable shooting.

The Turbodyne X can be fitted to most semi-auto and bolt action .50 BMG rifles, mounting directly to the current muzzle break threads without modification to the gun.

BARRETT M107A1 !!

The Barrett M107A1 .50 BMG semi-automatic rifle is an exceptional firearm! Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail.

* It has a lightweight, quick detach bipod with modular feet.

* It has a monopod as standard equipment instead of having to pay additional and add as an accessory; this is a big help so you do not have to support the weight of the rear of the rifle with your own strength. It also allows you to dial the elevation of where your aiming up or down with the monopod with even more accuracy so even if you don't want to upgrade you may want to ask about adding a monopod.

*The case it comes with from the factory is an upgrade from a Pelican case to a nicer Storm case. The Storm case is much easier to open and close, and you don’t bust your knuckles on it, and the case features padding inside instead of bare plastic."

 Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. 

 The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.

Price together will be lower than individual, however please note I’m not looking to sell individual items if at all possible. I would, however sell each glock and it's respective gear separate.

•	Gen 3 Glock 22 – barely used, comes with XS big dot night sights (front and rear), ghost 3.5lb trigger bar connector (stock bar comes with it too if you wish), wolf grip plug, three .40 mags, Lone Wolf .40-9 barrel (and glock 17 mags for the 9mm), and ammo listed below. This is a great gun and has been a safe/dresser queen. I’d be shocked if you found any wear marks anywhere. It has been fired, if I had to guess maybe 500 times.

•	Gen 3 Glock 27 – Great condition although you can see minor holster wear on the slide lock lever (cheap and easy to replace), this is strictly cosmetic as the gun has been flawless. I bought this several years ago maybe 2011 and it was my EDC. I took great care of it and it did the same to me. By no means is it heavily used (only a few 100 down the pipe). This too has the xs big dot night sights (front and rear), ghost 3.5lb trigger bar connector (stock comes with this too if you wish), wolf grip plug, three .40 mags, and ammo listed below.

This is a custom bult FTR rifle built on a virgin Savage model 12 dual port target action.  All smithing done by David Corbin in KY.  The Barrel is s 30"" Krieger HV contour 1-11 twist with less than 1000 rnds through it.  Freebore is 0.1065 and is plenty long enough to keep the bearing surface of 185gr Bergers above the neck shoulder junction.  Barrel is setup on a shoulder instead of using the barrel nut.  Barrel cleans very easily with essentially no copper fouling even after a full two day match.  Stock is of unknown make and was purchased used.  It is flawlessly bedded with devcon.  The stock is black laminate with a 1"" thick composite piece running vertically through the entire stock and is nice and solid.  I made the adjustable cheek rest out of kydex and attached it using two threaded inserts and two machine screws in the right side of the stock.  I also made the bag rider out of a piece of wood (oak or maple i dont remember).  It is attached with two screws through the bottom of the stock and can be removed easily..  I also refinished the stock, by stripping the old finish off and re-lacquered it using a spray on lacquer and added the black tip to the forend.   There are two old inserts on the forend where someone had mounted their bipod stud, but they were off center, so I drilled a new hole and used a wood screw type bipod stud in it.  Rifle shoots amazing with 155gr SMK Palma bullets and Varget.  The scope base is an EGW extended 20MOA base and is included with the rifle.  ***BIPOD AND OPTIC AND RINGS ARE NOT INCLUDED UNLESS A DEAL IS MADE WITH THE BUYER***.  I DO have a spare barrel available to the buyer.  It is an unfired Criterion 30"" 1-10 twist, varmint contour (Just slightly lighter than the krieger that is on the rifle now.  Also the buyer has the option to purchase approx. 300 pieces of brass that have all been shot through this rifle.  Brass is anywhere from 2-4 times fired and was annealed after every firing.  This is a great setup for anyone looking to get into FTR.  Please feel free to ask any questions.
