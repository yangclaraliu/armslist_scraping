U.S. RIFLE-MUSKET MODEL 1861 CONTRACT (HOARD) PERCUSSION .58 CAL.
Manufactured by Charles B. Hoard, Watertown, N.Y. in 1863 - Standard Model 1861 single-shot muzzle loading rifle-musket. Three bands, spring fastened. Iron furniture, finished patina. Double leaf rear sight. Weapon weighs approximately 9 lbs. Charles Hoard manufactured about 12,800 contracts.

Markings:
Lock: 1863 behind hammer. Eagle. U.S./WATERTOWN forward of hammer. 
Barrel: 1863. V/P/Eaglehead.  
Bands: U.
Hammer: B.
Triggerguard: B.
Buttplate: US.

Notes: Charles B. Hoard of Watertown, New York had been the manufacturer of steam engines before the Civil War, and owned and operated a modern, well-equipped factory in that city.
On December 24, 1861, Hoard received his first of two contracts for Model 1861 rifle-muskets, calling for 50,000 at $20.00 each. This was followed on December 1, 1863 with the second contract specifying 20,000 stands at $19.00 each.
Under the first of these, Hoard was able to produce only 1,500 arms, these being delivered between September 17 and November 30, 1863. By August 2, 1865, an additional 11,300, produced under the second contract, had been delivered, bringing the total to 12,800. All were typical Model 1861 rifle-muskets....
With the exception of a few parts purchased elsewhere early in production, the entire arm was fabricated and assembled in the Hoard Armory at Watertown. It was also at this location that the small number of .44 caliber Freeman Army revolvers were turned out."" - Reilly

""...In support of the price of the guns, $20, upon which he calculated to make less than his usual 10% profit on steam engines, Hoard offered an unusual calculation of the cost of the Government made article. This cost basis is the one any private enterprise must go by, figuring in all overhead before deriving a total cost of the gun. But the Springfield accountants work on the governmental philosophy that if you have a government, you gotta have an armory also. Their computations of the cost of a musket therefore leave out entirely the enormous capital investment at the National Armory, and figure a lot of bare costs without full overhead put in. The calculation Hoard's way was rather stiff: 'Supposed cost of Springfield Armory buildings and machinery: 2,000,000. Annual average production, 14,000 arms. Upon this data, as a basis, and I believe it is very near the truth, it would appear that the annual interest at 6% on the cost is: $120,000.
Assuming that the machinery cost one-half of the outlay, which is not far from the fact, and that the natural wear and loss of machinery is ten percent, and when work is prosecuted only during the day, and this is the rate usually calculated upon by manufacturers, and double that when night and day work is performed, the loss on one million of dollars annually is $100,000.
The cost for present production of a musket is $14 each, which would be for 140,000 muskets. The total here is $196,000.
Showing the actual cost to the government, upon this calculation, believe to be even below the truth, to be $29.17.'
But Hoard's senatorial friends, his calculations to show the economy of doing business with Hoard's Armory, his letters, even personally laying the matter before Abraham Lincoln, availed him nothing but the conclusions above cited."" - Edwards

Brief history....the first 100 barrett rifles were made basically as test weapons. the next 200 (200-399) were made as a first run military only type production. The first ""consumer"" run SN# started at 400 back in 1982 or 1983...somewhere in there. This weapon...is #426. making it the 26th gun off the line for purchase in the M82A1 market.

Scope: (as per Barrett because they were unmarked when made) Swarovski straight 10 power Christmas tree crosshair.

Note the round muzzle break

They also stated they were 11rd mags...not 10. I have two (2). To be honest I never loaded 11 in them when shooting...don't know why...just never thought aeatbout it but I'm sure I could pull one out and load it up to check.

Case. Gun has all original parts and case (olive drab green) including a complete parts kit.

Gun shoots great. Last time shooting was 6 months ago. shooting 790yrds and we were consistently hiting a 30 inch round plate. I'm no trained sniper but I hit the plate 3 out of 7. (I'm blaming it on the wind that day ...lol...cause I didn't miss it by much.

Gun has just come back from Barrett for service and cleaning. 2 rubber bushings (barrel bushings) have been changed and Barrett suggested changing the bolt so they did. (still have old bolt)

Gun is 32/33yrs old and still original down to the case. Pics provided are stock pics...if you would like pics please include your cell phone number and I will text you all the pics you want.

Description

DSF-870
Featuring two levels of tactical illumination, ambidextrous switching, a slender ergonomic design, and legendary SureFire reliability and durability, the DSF-870 is the ultimate WeaponLight for Remington 870 combat shotguns. 

This compact, lightweight system replaces the weapon’s original factory forend and features a recoil-proof LED that generates 600 lumens of blinding white light at maximum output, or 200 lumens with twice the runtime on its high setting. The LED’s light is focused by a precision reflector to create a smooth, wide beam perfect for closer-range shotgun applications typical in law enforcement and home defense—with enough reach and surround light to properly identify threats and maintain situational awareness. 

The DSF-870 features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switches on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. Selecting the LED’s output is achieved by activating the light in constant-on mode and then pressing the output-mode selector switch until the desired output level (600 or 200 lumens) is set. The selected output can then be left in constant-on mode or switched to momentary activation, and it stays at that output level until reset. Every DSF-Series WeaponLight also features an integrated system-disable switch to prevent accidental activation during transport, storage, or stealth operations. 

A lightweight but strong aluminum module protects the optics, LED, and sophisticated electronics, minimizing length with side-by-side placement of the two lithium batteries that power the system. The module has a Mil-Spec hard anodized finish to protect against scratches, abrasion, and corrosion, while O-ring and gasket seals keep out moisture, dust, and debris. The slender forend body is made from extremely tough polymer and is textured for a secure hold and features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switching on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. 

The DSF-870 provides unmatched power, versatility, and control, making it a must-have on Remington 870 shotguns used in combat, law enforcement, or home defense. NOTE: To see our other DSF shotgun forend models, click here.

Nothing wrong with it at all, it's really a good shooter and despite being a 454, the weight of the gun makes recoil not that big of a deal. Basically, I just don't need it.

BFR's are great values really, they've got a free spinning cylinder, recessed chambers, an oversized and locking base pin and the barrels come hand lapped from the factory. Accuracy is really top notch on these guns and the quality is apparent. It also comes from the factory drilled and tapped for scope use. Comes with a green fiber optic front sight and includes the plain black factory one was well.

The revolver is in pristine condition and is a high quality gun in every aspect.

These MSRP for over $1000, and I'm will to ship (via FFL) to you for an extra $25.

Factory correct 20 inch carbine barrel with integral front sight ramp, bore is sharp and mirror bright. The barrell and magazine retain 95% original blue. The receiver is mechanically fine, feeds, fires and ejects smoothly. Headspace is perfect. Receiver has the typical mottled finish from this era, the carbona blue just never held that well on the nickle steel Winchester used in the receivers. It has the Lyman 56 receiver sight which was a factory option. The wood is solid and tight, nicely grained black walnut that has a few very minor handling marks but no chips, cracks, extra holes or bad dents. This is a fine vintage Winchester that has that ""slick as glass"" feel when you cycle the bolt. A rare model 64 factory carbine from an era of fine craftmanship we will probably never see again."

I am letting it go for a lower price than what I put into it, I am willing to take a hit because I don't have a dremel anymore to fit the stock. This is a custom 45-70 Mauser with full upgrades.

I started this off with a saimese Mauser for 500$ Bought a stainless shilen heavy barrel for almost 200$ Had a gunsmith remove the old barrel, install the new, check headspace, etc as well as test fire for 300$+ also had him drill , tap and install base mounts for 40$ I then had it duracoated snakeskin camo for 200$ with brush colors to match our landscape. This is an all weather finish and is ready for heavy duty use. I also have an upgraded and adjustable trigger for this gun for you to drop in and set it how you like it . A 2 stage trigger is currently installed. 

A ramline stock comes included and came with the gun. Someone tried removing material to fit the gun and got really close. I tried to fit it and it only needs a little material removed for the gun to be complete. This is 5-10 minutes of work. Fit it in this stock, or an aftermarket Mauser stock of your choice. I will also include rings and a scope.

I have a ton of time and money put into this,  over 1200 invested."

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

12.0 inch free-floating handguard with LaRue Locking System.

Perfect balance with 16""-18"" barrels, this rail covers mid-length gas blocks and provide true free-float. Our two-pin proprietary barrel nut system with its locking anti-slip plate, sets LaRue handguards apart from the competition. Once properly installed, there is no chance of movement whatsoever. The side and bottom rails are tucked closer to the barrel, keeping the profile narrower and more streamlined. LaRue handguards also include integral QD sling-swivel sockets at the base of each side for convenient mounting 2-point slings. Additionally, our Free-float Rail system provides an excellent heat-sinking feature that pulls throat-damaging heat away from the chamber area. Another heat-sinking benefit is the elimination of pressure-spikes, which some feel is the cause of a large part of pre-mature bolt failures.



LaRue Tactical A-PEG™
Initially designed with the precision shooter in mind, the folks at LaRue Tactical queried trusted individuals in the precision shooting community what they would prefer in a grip. The result is the LaRue A-PEG™. The project grew into an accessory that featured ambidextrous geometry that can be used by all shooters, enchaining control of AR15-type weapons. The A-PEG™ is available in two sizes; Regular (for 5.56 receivers) 
Inspired by the human hand, the unique “flats” on the front and back fall more naturally onto the geometry of the hand’s structure. The flat front also provides indexing to help level and square the firearm to the target. A sculptured palm swell on either side fits nicely into the hollows of the palm. A gentle taper helps seat the hand towards the firearm, and helps to keep the hand from sliding. The generous texture added to the sides gives just the right amount of traction in slippery conditions. 

Having an A2 footprint, the A-PEG™ will attach to almost any firearm that has an AR15-type grip interface. Comes complete with mounting hardware.

So I am putting up my trusted 520 4 inch barrel for sale. This was a rare model made by Smith and Wesson, and was arguably discontinued due to it's expense to build. They used a Titanium cylinder which gave the ability to tighten the tolerance between cylinder chambers so as to achieve the 7th round without increasing the size or mass of the cylinder. They also utilized a two piece barrel construction with the steel outer sleeve housing a stainless screw in barrel insert. This was pioneered by Dan Wesson revolvers and is renown for controlling the tolerance between the cylinder face and the barrel forcing cone. This gives the ability to true the barrel face to the cylinder face and contributes to less gas loss during the firing cycle increasing velocity and accuracy. It has a fiber optic front sight with a fully adjustable V-notch rear sight. Single and double action are smooth as one would expect of a Smith. I always clean my guns, and I just cleaned and also removed the cheek plate and lubed all the trigger and revolver mechanisms. I have both the original Hogue monogrip, as well as a very nice set of cocobolo presentation grips for it. It has one speed loader included, as well as original case, papers, lock and keys for the guns integral lock. Overall this gun has been shot very little and is in very good shape. There are a couple very minor wear areas on high points from a little time in the holster. This wear is very minor but I want to make sure and disclose everything I can as I hate going into a deal only to find that the product wasn't described accurately. Overall this gun is near new condition, it shoots incredibly well, gives you 7 rounds of the renown .357 Magnum, and is a Smith... enough said. Again this is a rare gun, it is a show piece, as well as a fantastic shooter. Very well balanced, and light for it's size and caliber. Mostly interested in cash but shoot me a trade offer and I'll consider it. I don't play the price high and haggle game so what I am asking is the lowest I will take. Let me know if interested and thanks for the read. REDACTED"

Buffalo Bore Ammo - .45 Super Ammo - 200 gr. J.H.P.(1,200fps/M.E.639 ft.lbs.) - 50 Round Box


45 Super is externally/dimensionally identical to 45 acp or 45 acp+P and is designed to be used in 45 acp semi auto pistols that have been fitted with stronger than normal recoil springs and a shock buffer, plus a couple other modifications. While you can shoot 45 SUPER out of some stock 45 acp+P pistols such as the Glock 21, HK USP or the full sized all steel 1911, you will batter your pistol if you do not have them modified to handle the extra pressure and slide velocity of the 45 Super.


To learn about the modifications your 45 acp pistol needs to reliably and safely fire 45 SUPER, contact Garey Hindman at REDACTED. Garey is the foremost authority on 45 Super modifications/conversions for your 45 acp and Garey performs such conversions for a living.


The below velocities were fired from my Colt Gold Cup Govt. Model (5 inch) that was converted by Garey.

1. Item # 45S185-----------1330 fps (185gr. Jhp)
2. Item # 45S200-----------1235 fps (200gr. Jhp)
3. Item # 45S230-----------1131 fps (230gr. Jhp)
4. Item # 45S230FMJ----1133 fps (230gr. FMJ-FLAT NOSE) 
5. Item # 45S255-----------1090 fps  (HARD CAST-FLAT NOSE)

 As always with Buffalo Bore Ammunition, we use real world firearms to give you real world data and results.

All our 45 Super ammunition is loaded with flash suppressed powders so that if you have to fire in low light (when the criminal element is out) you will not be blinded by your own gun fire at the worst possible moment.


All three of the JHP loads were designed for anti-personel use and for hunting small big game like deer. The two solid bullet loads were designed for breaking large bones like a bears shoulders or skull, but will work for anti-personel use as well if you need to shoot through cover like car doors or stick frame walls."

Same design as the Winchester 1200 and will interchange parts. I've put countless rounds through it and it's been a blast. It's 2 3/4 chamber, with 5+1 capacity, unless using roll crimped shells, then just 4 in the tube. I have the tube plug for hunting as well, just not installed. Nice recoil pad, dual sight beads on the vent rib and adjustable choke barrel. Small nicks and scratches on the gun, but it was used on the trail for many years. Shoots great and looks good doing it. Comes with 75 shells of #8 shot and a soft case.

I have attached one photo showing how a Colt Single Action fits (the pistol shown is for sale but not included with the holster).

The Firestar Plus pistols, also known as models M-243, M40 and M-45, were designed and are still being manufactured by the Spanish company Star Bonifacio Echeverria SA. These pistols were announced early in 1990s and are sold worldwide for civilian market.
All Firestars are compact, steel-framed semi-automatic pistols. Firestar pistols are recoil operated, with Browning cam locking and short barrel recoil. Barrel muzzle is externally cone-shaped to achieve the best fit into the slide for improved accuracy. 9mm Firestar Plus M-243 is a hammer fired, single action pistol with frame mounted, ambidextrous safety lever. .40sw M-40 and .45acp M-45, unlike their 9mm brother, are double action pistols with similar frame mounted ambidextrous safety that allows for ""cocked and locked"" carry (hammer is cocked and safey is applied). All Firestars featured automated firing pin safey and magazine disconnect safety. Single column magazine holds 7 rounds in 9mm M-43 pistols or 6 rounds in .40sw M-40 and .45acp M-45 pistols. Also, extended 8 rounds capacity magazines available for 9mm M-43 guns.
Firestar pistols are claimed to be ones of the smallest guns in their respective calibers, but, obviously not the lightest ones. The solid steel construction makes these guns extremely sturdy and reliable, and additional weight greatly improves recoil control and makes the shooting quite comfortable, despite the powerful ammunition and small size of the guns. Cash or USPS money order only and must see WSDL to close deal.
(prefer FTF in Blaine Washington, but will drive to meet on your dime.)
This pistol is perfect for concealed carry.

I have a range of Ontario OKC3S Bayonets from new to issued in excellent condition that I need gone! The new bayonets have some handling marks on the grip from military handling, but have never been used to issued! The issued bayonets are in EXCELLENT shape, but some have their platoon markings on them (can be taken off if requested)

These knives are made of 1095 high carbon steel, and have a parkerized finish. The blade is 8"" long, and .2"" thick with a partially serrated blade, and a sharpened swedge (double sided blade at tip). The handle is a special polymer that is soft and grippy to the touch. (feels like rubber) These bayonets are designed to fit onto any US mil spec bayonet attaching lug, so they will work on your ar15 or Mossberg 590 if from the factory they are designed with a bayonet lug.
The sheath for this knife is very high quality, very secure, has molle attachments, and even has a built in ceramic rod for light duty knife sharpening!

Christmas is coming, and if you want to treat someone (or yourself) to the best bayonet on the market, or one of the coolest knives a person or collector can have, this is, without a doubt, it.

We’ve built the industry’s finest rifled slug guns for years, but our new 12-gauge Model 870™ SPS™ ShurShot™ Synthetic Super Slug advances deer-leveling technology to farther reaches and smaller group sizes than ever before possible. Even more so when paired with high-performance ammunition like our Premier AccuTip sabot slugs.

Because barrel stability is key to extended-range accuracy, this shotgun’s barrel is of extra-heavy, 1"" diameter configuration and measures a full 25 1/2"". It’s also pinned to the receiver to control vibration for rifle-like, shot-to-shot consistency. Five longitudinal flutes keep weight and heat buildup to a minimum while bolstering barrel rigidity. Six Parabolic Ultragon™ rifling grooves with a 1-in-35"" twist optimize slug flight. But much more than just the ultimate accuracy-enhancing barrel design, this shotgun provides the rock-steady aim and outstanding pointability of our ambidextrous ShurShot pistol-grip synthetic stock. Rubberized overmolding at the pistol grip and extended fore-end offer a sure hold in adverse conditions. For unmatched shooting comfort, we added the SuperCell™ recoil pad. The receiver is drilled and tapped, and the included Weaver rail makes adding optics a cinch. Sling swivel studs are built in."

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself."
