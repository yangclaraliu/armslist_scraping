Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor – there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today’s scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.


RUG 5816 Mini-14 Ranch Rifle – Chambered in the popular and proven .223 Rem. cartridge. Integral sling swivels. Simple, rugged Garand style breechbolt locking system with a fixed piston gas system and self cleaning, moving gas cylinder. Improved receiver with rounded contours. Blade front sight. Rugged, adjustable Ghost Ring aperture rear sight. Includes a compact, hammer forged barrel.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of Brand New, Factory Fresh Inter Ordnance Hellhound AK-47 Rifles.

It is a 6+ on the mosin rarity scale. Also before you message me to ask why the bolt isn't bent here you go... at some point in the rifle's life it was sent in to the factory for refurbishment which is evident by the square with the line through it above the date. during the refurbishment process the scope was removed and the holes were filled in which you can see in the 3rd picture posted. they removed the original stock and replaced it with a really nice laminate stock and last but not least, they removed the turn down bolt and replaced it with a straight bolt that they stamped to match the rest of the numbers on the rifle(not electro penciled or crossed out) and that is why it is considered an 'ex-sniper' and not a 'sniper' rifle. the rifling looks great and has not been counter bored. It is a very clean gun inside and out. if you have any doubts or questions you can find all the answers you need at 7.62x54r dot net.

The G41 Gen4 is a practical-tactical .45 caliber pistol designed to maximize sight radius while improving weight distribution and balance. It is built with a G34 slide width on a G21 Gen4 frame and is 1.5 ounces lighter than the G21 Gen4. The longer barrel and slide on the G41 Gen4 help to reduce muzzle flip and felt recoil, while the longer sight radius makes it more accurate for competition or duty use. The G41 Gen4 comes with all the standard features of the Glock Generation 4 pistol group, including the modular backstrap design, Gen4 rough textured frame surface and dual recoil spring assembly.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.

The PMAG 40 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.

In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

NiB-X: The secret formula for reliability. LIFETIME WARRANTY against flaking, chipping, and wear! The way we figure it, your trigger finger’s gonna wear out long before your NiB-X components! Key components of your new firearm have been coated with a remarkable nickel boron formulation from WMD called NiB-X. In addition to adding a distinctive (and amazingly hard) finish to metal surfaces,NiB-X also provides: Xtreme resistance to corrosion and pitting, Xtreme lubricity, for an incredibly smooth action, and Xtreme reliability in all environments. You’ll also find that powder residue and fingerprints wipe right off of surfaces coated with NiB-X. So you can spend less time cleaning, and more time shooting.
The GLOCK 19 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that has found worldwide acclaim with security services both private and public. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G19 Gen4 9x19mm retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments."

It is exactly like a colt 1911 that has been shrunk down to less than 5"" in length. These were only manufactured for 2 years, 1970 & 1971. There were other 22 and 25 models that were made in other years, they were called vest pistols, pocket pistols, etc., many of those were not actually built by Colt, but did bare their name. This one was manufactured by COLT, and you can definitely tell . To hold this in your hand the first thing that surprises you is the weight, it's heavier than you would think and that's because of the way it is built. It's construction is heavy and perfect. This is not a toy like every other small hand gun, this is the real thing. This is like the Rolex of the small hand guns. It's in fabulous shape for it's age, with the blueing still in perfect condition on 95% of the Colt. The slide mechanism is precise and smooth. The trigger hammer can be pulled back to fire that way and it also clicks into position like the day it was new and everything about this gun knocks the socks off of just about all current hand guns that are manufactured today. This is a very collectable hand gun and it will be extremely hard to find another one in this condition and impossible to find at this price. Now this will make a great carry pistol, you can put it anywhere."

Before I order one from a online distributor and pay a transfer fee, I thought I would check to see if anyone had one that they are willing to sell.  

I have cash and valid permit to carry and driver's license.  

I can order one with two magazines for $399.99.  Add $20 for shipping and $10 for transfer and that brings it to $430.  These are available from J&G Sales or Centerfire Systems for that price if people doubt my veracity. 

If new in the box, I would pay $430.   
Used in very good condition I would go $400. 

Of course if more magazines, ammo, SB47 Arm Brace, Krinkov muzzle break are included I would add cash accordingly.  However will not pay more than fair price for those accessories. 
I would go $560 for the pistol, SB47 Brace and the Krinkov Muzzle Break.  (Also offered by J&G Sales for $529.99)

I didn't saw it down but I bought it that way at a LEGAL 18 1/4 inch barrel length with about 40"" overall (I measured it but it's way over legal limit so I don't recall) As of currently it's having a little problem where the extractor will allow a shell to fall past it, making it impossible to close or remove the shell. All it would take to fix is a punch set and some time but I have neither right now and with my 870 project mostly done I could use the cash to get my receiver drilled and tapped. When I bought this gun it had no finish left and started to rust so I sanded everything down and sandblasted it and gave it a solid paintjob that has kept the rust at bay and gives it a rather cool look. Also the front hand guard is loose so it has to be held on with tape during firing, this isn't a safety issue it's just how the shotgun breaks down for storage (doesn't have a screw like the newer models). Because of these issues I'm only asking 80 dollars for it to the first person willing to take it off my hands. It's a lot of fun, operationally solid with a strong hammer and firing pin, and the ejector THROWS shells out. MUST have an Ohio drivers license and a CHL is a huge perk.

This is a great gun.  I have a couple hundred rounds through it and it shoots great.  I am averaging .75"" groups with some barely developed reloads and just over .75"" with super cheap remington umc 50 gr at 100 yards.  With a bit more work developing loads this gun should be even more accurate.  The gun is in like new condition other than a thick kydex cheekrest I made for it which really helps align your eye with the scope.  The rifle is a savage 11 varmint with the target accutrigger and a detachable magazine.  It has a vortex crossfire II 4-12 x 50 adjustable objective scope on it mounted in burris zee signature rings with the offset insert kit.  It also has a wheeler engineering scope level on it.  The scope is leveled to the reciever.  This gun was broken in right.  1 shot, clean, repeat for ten shots then 3 shots, clean, repeat for 30 shots.  The bore looks great.  I would rather sell, but if you happen to have something I am interested in I might be willing to trade.  I am currently interested in a light weight big game hunting rifle, 45-70 or 30-30 lever rifel (I would also consider other 7mm or larger lever rifles), 44 mag or larger caliber revolver, new or like new long range range finder.  I am also currently looking for a nice backpackable tipi or tarp with stove.  I would have to be really interested to add money, but it would be possible for the right trade.  However, I am willing to entertain trade plus cash on your end.

here is the rundown of what everything cost:
savage 11 varmint .223: $600
Vortex crossfire II scope 4-14 BDC scope: $220 plus shipping
Zee signature rings with offset alignment kit: $55 plus shipping
wheeler scope level $35 plus shipping

Barrel is 19 11/16 "" barrel..Has a Leupold 4X Rimfire scope on it. Proofmarks look to be
IA which makes no sence..Single trigger..Surprise; the gun is a tack driver..I only used it to shoot things; not paper.It has been a closet Queen for long periods..Nice Wood, 2 marks on top of stock you can see in picture. 1 magazine. It does NOT say Savage or Cile on it..The full Anschutz name along with ""MADE IN WEST GERMANY"" is on left side of barrel. I one of few guys that will admit I don't know what it is worth. I know I paid $469.00 for it; divorce lawyer thought it was unreasonable for a ""22"". I would like
some cash and a handgun or ?.
Also have about 1962 pre Garcia Browning Safari Grade .338 Win Mag, bought new in box about same time.Bought it out of collection. Long extractor.2.5-8 Vari X III that will have a separate ad soon..Son is quite sick..need money; not advise..Obamacare not working!"

Really wanting something like a Remington model 770 for the price you would pay for a Remington 700 Sendero. Would also like to pick up some 22 lr ammo for 10 times the price you can buy it for at Wally world. Also interested in a WASR 10 in the 12-1500 dollar range. Would also pay extra if it comes with a mag or some ammo. while I'm in the buying mood I am also looking for a BAD A$$ pistol something like a Hi point. Could afford to spend close to a grand on it if it has less than a few thousand down the pipe. Maybe interested in your Remmy 870 ""TACTICAL"" and because it has the cheap powder coat finish and the SPS black stock that it came with from Wally world brand new for $239 brand new, I would shell out $800 or more if you throw in the five 00 Buck shells you have with it and the hogue tamer pistol grip you bought for 40 bucks, but only because it's ""TACTICOOL"". I understand it is a free market and you can post your junk for what ever price you want, but seriously. I am also sure that the idiots that are posting the ridiculously priced guns on here are the same ones that are offended by my listing and will flag it right away. But shouldn't I also be able to post a wanted ad asking for you to sell them to me. It's not dumb to post it for sale right?"

This is THE ORIGINAL piston driven ar rifle. One of the best gas piston ARs in my opinion.  THIS IN NOT ONE OF THE FOREIGN MADE ONES THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH POOR FIT AND FINISH.  THIS FINE FLAWLESS FIREARM WAS BUILT IN THE ARMALITE FACTORY IN THE USA.  NOT ONE FAILURE EVERYWHERE ON THIS GUN.
Comes with 2 magazines and a case. This gun (unlike many armalite gas piston rifles) accepts ALL ar15 pattern magazines.  This is a steal.
And the craftsmanship is flawless.
This thing is accurate as hell and is vastly more reliable than an ar15.
this awesome rifle is the best of an ar15 and an ak47 mixed into one fantastic gun.  
go ahead and try to find a piston driven ar rifle for less than $2000 that weighs 6.5lbs empty and still boast a 20"" barrel.  It's like an AK that's as accurate as an ar15 and weighs much less than an ak. (AKS can easily weight 9 lbs empty)
 and its probably only around 8 lbs with scope and magazine. 
Has about 19"" of medium profile barrel.
Not to mention this gun is a piece of history.  Armalite doesn't make these any more. 
stormwerks makes a lot of parts and mounts and rail systems for these guns at very good prices. You could make this gun a tactical piston AR for half the price of a new one from a less reputable company than armalite. 
This gun eats any ammo you dump into it hungrily. Seems to like 55g runs the best for me
And again its very accurate. 
Armalite is a good company with good customer service and they make a Damn fine weapon.
I really don't want to sell this gun... i really dont.  
But I need money for bills and debts.
So... $850 

This gun is as light or lighter than a similarly equipped (all metal/~18.5"" barrel)  ar15, as accurate and much much MUCH more reliable.
Comes with 2 magazines and a carry case.
What's there not to love?
Contact me if you are interested!
CASH is king but we can talk about other payment options. I'd prefer a face to face in AZ.

If you have an offer or trade or partial trade please feel free to shoot it at me.
worst I can say is no.
Keep in mind that this is a GAS PISTON AR RIFLE and nowhere can you find a piston driven AR for even double my price.  And this gun design is time proven and takes the most common rifle round and magazine in the world.
This rifle is unstoppable and accurate.

Sig Sauer P938 9mm mini 1911-style handgun in the hard-to-find BLACKOUT version.  The entire gun is finished in no-nonsense black, from the slide to the frame right down to the Hogue rubber grips, embedded with the Sig Sauer logo. This is not the same as the regular BRG version on Sig's website; this version has several upgrades including the slide serrations at the front. The single action only is a trigger pull far preferable to the competitors' DAO pistols of similar size.

This full package is ready for summer as your new carry weapon, and includes everything you’ll need all in one:

- Sig P938 Blackout (MSRP $836)
- HBE Leatherworks Pro TL (thin line) tuckable custom leather IWB holster ($115)
- Multiholsters custom IWB Kydex holster ($82.95)
- Galco Ankle Lite ankle holster ($78.95)
- THREE magazines: two extended, 7-rd mags and one flush 6 rounder (MSRP $46 each)
- Sig Sauer PX38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser (MSRP $189)


In total with taxes and fees, I have well over $1400 into this package. The gun is in excellent condition with precisely 280 rounds down the pipe (I’m meticulous and keep the boxes). It has been very well maintained and consistently cleaned. Also comes with original box. Additionally, I don't smoke and no pets... gun still looks brand new.

The HBE Leatherworks holster is the ultimate in craftsmanship. The top grain leather custom Pro TL (which stands for thin-line) is a tuckable, inside the waistband holster specifically made and molded for the P938. His genius design of setting the belt hook off to one side allows for a very thin profile on your waist that simply will not print. His work is fantastic; google some reviews or check out his site. I highly recommend.

The Kydex IWB holster from Multiholsters.com is also very comfortable, and while not as thin as the Pro TL, it is thin (made from a solid sheet of .08 Kydex) and allows for two distinct advantages: a much quicker draw and re-holster, thanks to the Kydex, and I paid extra to have the mold made for the gun with the laser fitted, so you have both options. Again, the Kydex holster is molded for the P938 WITH the laser attached (though it works flawlessly without, as well). Plus you can sweat all over and not worry about the expensive leather!

Then of course, Sig Sauer’s own Trigger Guard Laser assembly is quick to install and remove and allows for some excellent practice at the range, or assurance as you carry.

My new favorite carry method is the Galco Ankle Lite. The sheepskin on the inside feels great, and the pocket fits the pistol perfectly so it’s not banging and flopping around. If it’s cold enough to wear jeans, my HBE holster goes in the drawer and I always carry in the ankle holster—and forget that I’m wearing it!

Lastly, three mags, including two of the coveted pinky-extender floorplate 7 rounders.

All in all, this is the ideal, complete, and most excellent carry package you can find. I love the feel of this gun and I’ve never had a single FTF or FTE with any of the ammo I’ve run through it. Only reason I’m selling is I couldn’t convince my wife to step up from her .380 P238 and match mine, so I’m considering acquiescing (as long as she’s willing to carry!) and downsizing to a P238. 

No trades. FTF in VA only. Will not ship. Must be 21, have valid photo ID, be willing to sign a simple bill of sale and be legally able to purchase a pistol.

I will consider trades or deals but ONLY in the following: ammunition (9mm, .357 magnum, .380 auto, .223/5.56, .40, .22 LR), a Sig P238 SAS, a Springfield 1911 TRP, a S&W 360 PD, or a Kimber Micro CDP (or possibly another Kimber)."
