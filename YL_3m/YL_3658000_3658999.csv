All the the internals have been meticulously polished, the trigger bar nub has been carefully removed and polished to bring it in line with previous generations of Glock and to smooth out the slide on the frame, and the trigger is somewhere between 2-3lbs.  This weapon is definitely my baby and is ready for competition with the simple addition of a mag well.  I am looking for a change, however, so parting with it to move to a 1911 makes sense to me at this point.

127,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3658127,"For Sale:  Airforce Condor .25  24""  from Tony- with extras Talon Tunes","Birmingham AL, Birmingham, Alabama","$ 1,200","Listed On: Friday, October 31, 2014",Air,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I just decided to sell my Condor that I bought from Tony(Talon Tunes)a few months ago. I got into Field Target, and I want a nice FT rifle. I don't like to sell my guns at all, specially after putting quite a bit money on her, but I literally shot the Condor twice since I got her. She has to go. 
 This rifle is a true LNIB. Has been shot twice, so I'd say, maybe 250 pellets through the barrel. It has been kept in a hard case, no scratches, marks , nothing... I still have original box, paperwork, CD, everything that came with her. I also have a paper target test that Tony included, some pellets that Tony used for the accuracy/chrony test and a Chrony print out with 10 shots. 
 First I want say that this rifle is for someone wanting a Condor from Tony with most the mods he offers. But, you will have it in a few days. I ordered this rifle from Tony with all the Mods listed bellow, and I had to wait more then 4 four months for it. 

 Mods from Talon Tunes: 
 - Talon Shroud............$215 
 - Talon Tank Adapter......$165 
 - Quick change Top Hat....$75 
 - Talon Hammer 95gr.......$95 
 - Tuning..................$225 

 tot: $775 
 I also have 500 6 rings slugs (.251) 62gn, from Jerry that I never shot. They are still in the original packing Jerry sent to me. 
 It's late night and I don't have pictures to attach. I'll be taking and updating the add. 

 How the rifle shoot? 
 She is tuned for JSB's 25gn shooting at 950 fps (I may be off a little, last time I shot her were months ago. I think Tony's chrony paper says 935-940, sorry, don't remember, but you'll see on the pictures I'll post. 
 She's very accurate, the little shooting I did was at least 50 yards. The groups were about .5"" to 1"". And I shot a bunch of soda cans at 125 yards, once I figured the hold over, the cans were been hit shot after shot... Tony worked the trigger, but I think my groups were not making justice to the rifle. I never got chance to learn how to shoot her. You kind have to get used to the design and everything. The Tank Adapter makes the rifle a lot more comfortable to shoulder. No needs for higher rigs. 

 I'm asking $1,200 (+ paypal fees if you don't want send money as ""gift"") for everything (rifle, mods and slugs). 

 so, here it is... email or txt me if you have questions.

Pick up an XD® and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how natural it feels. Whether you reach for a Full Size, a Compact or a Sub-Compact, the first thing you’ll notice is how it nestles perfectly in your hand. Next, discover the ease with which you can acquire your target. Because it uses the same perfect grip angle as John Moses Browning’s proven 1911, the XD® points effortlessly and naturally.

XD®’s come loaded with features that set them apart from the competition. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator give the shooter instant tactile and visual feedback about the condition of the pistol. This means you can know at a glance – or at a touch – if there is a chambered round and if the striker is cocked. Three separate safeties guard against accidental discharges and provide extra peace of mind. The Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ prevents unintentional rearward movement of the trigger. The grip safety keeps the pistol from firing unless the shooter has a firm grasp on it. And an internal firing pin block goes the extra mile to bring you a pistol fully designed with safety in mind.

The accessory rail that comes standard on every XD® gives you the flexibility to mount a light, laser or other accessory on your pistol. An ambidextrous magazine release means the XD® doesn’t care whether or not you’re a lefty. The fully supported ramped barrel and rugged Melonite® or stainless steel finish will keep your XD® running round after round. And the high polish stainless steel magazines drop free with refreshing eagerness.

Whether you’re a new shooter or a seasoned pro, you’ll find that the XD® series stands out from the competition. Get your hands on an XD® today, and experience what a polymer pistol should be."

Here's the short version: NO SHIPPING! Thank you.

I would like to reward a CZ75B or 85B owner with 2 brand new, never used magazines. I ended up trading mine for a ""need"". The CZ75 when I had it was simply a want. I enjoyed it greatly when I had it and am somewhat regretting that I traded it. Not totally as I did get something great in return. Anyway, I'm looking to reward a CZ owner, who could use these mags, for holding on to the best pistol (stock-wise) that I've ever shot: just $30 for both mags!

$30 and these mags are yours. These are the CZ factory mags, not MecGar or anything like that. Remember these will not fit the pre-B models. 

Only catch to the low price is that you'll have to meet me in Navarre or Gulf Breeze and be a Florida resident with a valid ID; always feel better doing business with a CCW holder but DL is fine. No shipping, no trades, no offers for less than $30.

Price is very fair, this gun is hard to find, like new and the price isn't inflated so don't bother asking me to negotiate. 

I may be interested in trading for Noveske rifles, LWRC rifles, Knights armament rifles, high end 1911's, a Elcan specter DR, VCOG, Legion lower, Umbrella lower, HK VP9 or HK .45 Tactical. If it's not on this list I probably won't be interested in trading for it but you can let me know what you have and I'll consider it. I can add cash to these trades to even it out, of course. 

I can meet in the Florence/Muscle shoals area. I can deliver it to the surrounding area within 60 miles but will require a driving fee, price depending on location.

I am a cpl holder and am looking for a carry pistol. Don't care too much about the caliber and would rather have a semi auto but for a Good deal a revolver would be ok. I only have $400 cash to spend. Looking for something small but again anything really.
At the top of my list would be:
Glock 
Xd
m&p
1911
Need something very reliable and not full size looking for mid size, compact, or sub compact. Again I have exactly $400 so I don't care so much about looks as long as it's in good shooting shape and no rust.

It's not been fired since I've purchased it, and it's spent most of its time locked up in a container or in the leather holster I'm including with it.

As a standard Gen 4 it comes with 3 magazines along with four backstraps (two regular, two beavertail).  The recoil spring reflects its recent production as it's one of the '4-stamped' springs designed to alleviate issues seen with the initial release of the Gen 4 line.

In addition to the firearm and its stock accessories, I will be including a dual-use leather holster ($40 value) that can be used for OWB or IWB carry (right handed).  I will also be including two additional magazines (for a total of 5) and 50 rounds of FMJ 9mm ammunition.  The extra two mags are Gen 3 mags but will work fine with the Gen 4 firearm assuming you keep the magazine release installed for a right-handed configuration.  All 5 magazines are the standard 15-round capacity and manufactured by Glock (up to $80 value depending on where you shop, mags go for between 20-40 bucks these days).

I am asking the MSRP for the Glock 19 as it comes from the factory ($550), and am including the holster, extra mags, and ammo as an incentive.  I'm a self-supporting college student on hard times and simply need the money, and am trying to sweeten the deal.  I hate to part with my only carry piece, but alas, rent takes priority over the gun right now.

This is a great handgun in wonderful condition, and with the accessories makes for a great ""starter-carry"" kit!  I will certainly be buying another one in the future when my financial situation allows for it!  I cannot say enough good things about Glock pistols!

If you are interested PLEASE have a pistol-purchase permit or a concealed-carry permit valid in this state, as well as some form of ID to confirm with."

Interesting information about the K-Frame models:
""Retired Assistant Chief Patrol Inspector of the U.S. Border Patrol, famous gunfighter, and noted firearms and shooting skills writer Bill Jordan consulted with Smith & Wesson on the design and characteristics of the Model 19. Jordan's idea for a ""peace officer's dream"" sidearm was a heavy-barreled four-inch K-Frame .357 Magnum with a shrouded barrel like the big N-frame .357 and adjustable sights. After a year of experimentation with improved-strength steels and special heat-treating processes, the result was the .357 Combat Magnum (later designated Model 19), with the first serial-number gun (K260,000) presented to Jordan on November 15, 1955. The Model 19 was produced in blued carbon steel or nickel-plated steel with wood or rubber combat grips, 
an adjustable rear sight, semi-target hammer, serrated combat-type trigger, and was available in 2.5"" (3"": Model 66—rare), 4"", or 6-inch barrel lengths. The weights are 30.5 ounces, 36 ounces, and 39 ounces, respectively. The 2.5- and 3-inch barrel versions had a round butts, while the others had square butts.

Interesting information about the K-Frame models:
""The Smith & Wesson Model 13 (Military & Police Magnum) is a .357 Magnum revolver designed for military and police use. It is based on S&W's K-frame platform—specifically, it is a .357 Magnum version of the heavy-barrel variant of the .38 Special Model 10 (originally called the Military & Police). The Model 13 was manufactured from 1974 to Present. The Model 65 was manufactured from 1972 to 2004. The original Model 13 used no designation (generation numbers) and was simply known as the Air Crewman Model 13. Alternate generations of the model 13 are as follows: 1st Gen. -1974- Introduced, 2nd Gen. -1977- Change back to gas ring on cylinder, 3rd Gen. -1982- Eliminate cylinder counterbore.""

The mainspring housing is flat and includes the Springfield Armory® I.L.S.™ The pistol has a Lightweight Delta™ hammer and a beavertail grip safety, which features a raised memory pad for positive engagement. The extended ambidextrous thumb safety and long aluminum match-grade trigger are upgraded features that are standard to the Loaded Series. The fixed combat 3-Dot sights feature tritium inserts. The ejection port is lowered and flared, and the pistol is fitted with a standard guide rod. The MC Operator® comes with wraparound Pachmayr® grips held in place with Torx™ head grip screws.

The rimfire shooters in America and elsewhere absolutely ate these things up! The basic ones came with a blond beechwood stock and only fair fit and finish. However, they had a very good hammer-forged barrel and a fully-adjustable trigger (something rarely seen on American rifles anymore due to liability scares). Before the Russian imports stopped, the top of the line in the TOZ 78’s was the 78-05, which arrived during the late spring/early summer of 2007. This rifle had a much nicer beechwood stock, with a little figure in the wood, cut in a Bavarian Stalker style with cut checkering and a nice dark stain and oil finish. The 78-05 also had a medium-heavy hammer-forged target barrel, no factory sights, and dovetails cut to European specs (just under 11mm). This rifle was only available from the importers for a limited time, as Winchester licensed the TOZ 78 as the Winchester Wildcat, and the 78-05 as the Wildcat II Varmint, all announced in American Rifleman in September 2008. This original TOZ 78-05 stock has the “drooping” style buttstock typical of European stalking and hunting rifles, a slim contrasting wood buttplate, a small pancake cheeckpiece, a slim tapered forend with a Schnable tip (small and bulb shaped). This is one pretty rimfire rifle!

OK, enough history! I bought a couple of these rifles back in June of 2007, right after this variation was imported. I used one for a magazine review and shot the heck out of it before I sold it. The other was for a family member who decided they didn’t want it, so I stuck it in my “project” safe and there it has remained. A recent cleanout turned her up and now I am offering her to you.

Brand new, unfired except for factory testing (probably?), packed in a hard case with 4 magazines (2 – 5rd, 2 – 10rd) and a set of correct Euro-spec 1” rings to mount your favorite scope, its ready to go. This will make a fine squirrel or target rifle for NRA Sporter class. Nice enough to make a great Christmas present too! It’s been very hard to establish a value for this thing because there are exactly zero out there that I can find available, except for one in Australia for silly money. You can get pretty close using the Blue Book and adding features because they don’t have this specific rifle listed, although they do have the heavy barrel and the fancy stock as separate options. Based on their value, and one in a European price guide, the value should be around $420-450.

I am asking $400 for this one. If you have better documentation for a lower price, please contact me and I’ll consider what you have. Can do FTF in the Ft. Worth area of Tejas, or can have my FFL ship to yours for a flat $70 insured in CONUS. Funds need to be cash if FTF or USPS money order if we’re shipping. No trade offers please! It’s not that I’m not interested in other guns, I need the cash.

I’m also putting this up with a brick (500 rounds) of .22lr so you’ll be sure to have something to shoot when you buy it.

It’s a very nice rifle, but I need the cash right now, so this is one item that needs to go.

• (1) Ruger BX-10 10-round magazine
• (500) Rounds of Remington Thunderbolt .22lr ammo, new, unopened brick

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.


Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAMMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.

Ready to follow your every move, the MRAD adapts to a variety of user needs without sacrificing performance. With unfailing accuracy, this bolt-action system continues to define a whole new class of long-range precision rifles.
The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity. The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits.
The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld.
Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions.
The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended.
Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button.
From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color that blends into any environment - every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own."

I am unsure the exact age, but it is old enough that it does not have a serial number so that would be pre-1968. I have not fired this gun, I inherited it and I am selling it in the condition in which I received it. It comes apart fine, the hammer cocks back and releases when you pull the trigger, you can see the firing pin move forward when the hammer hits it, but the trigger seems to be lacking a return spring. I looked it up and the spring can be purchased for $2.90 at Numrich Gun parts (I will include the parts diagram and part number for the spring). It also has an ejector for the shell. Bead front sight. 28"" barrel. Everything appears to be original. Bore is bright and shiny, no pitting or rust inside the barrel.
