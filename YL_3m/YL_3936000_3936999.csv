This is just the upper and does NOT include the BCG or charging handle. Only reason I am selling is to fund another project. This thing is awesome to shoot. The redirect helps to minimize concussion felt by shooter and anyone to the left or right of shooter. This is a pistol length upper, so all laws regarding pistol length ARs applies.

The Sig Sauer P250 is the one gun that changes everything, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. The P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned Sig Sauer quality, performance, accuracy, and reliability into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. It has the ability to be configured in everything from full-sized range pistol to a deep concealment weapon, in any of four calibers and, the selection of grip modules, coupled with a standard or short trigger, means it can be fitted to a wide range of hand sizes. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality Sig Sauer pistol that perfectly meets your needs, you have the foundation for building a new Sig Sauer pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance. The double-action-only P250 Subcompact features a 3.6"" barrel with a black Nitron finish."

Each year at banquets across America, Friends of NRA chapters raise funds by auctioning or raffling firearms off.
Generally each year has its own set of firearms available through the program, usually specially embellished by an outside engraving firm.
But back in 1991 – the program was in its developing years and the firearms were ordered directly from Winchester, who did the embellishing itself.

You may be able to obtain further details on these rifles by contacting Winchester directly.
There was also a great deal of individual initiative by certain Friends of NRA chapters to get guns that were ever so slightly different in caliber or engraving.
Please note that we can provide no valuation figures on these arms as they were offered by auction and the winning bids varied greatly from auction to auction.

Good condition Franchi SPAS 12 Semi-Auto / Pump with the desirable folding stock option, serial number indicates a 1982 production model with all other factory stamps as well. 

I am the second owner of the shotgun, the first being a gentleman & son combo who purchased the gun new and kept it over the years. 

I installed a new buffer upon purchasing the gun (original one was virtually gone); this new buffer should last the rest of the gun's life. There are no known mechanical or firing issues with this firearm, it is working order with minimal wear and no major defects or rust. 

Takes a real man (or woman) to handle this one; it's heavy, it's loud, but it cycles beautifully and has never given me any troubles. Anything from home defense to clay shooting the SPAS can handle, good all-purpose, rugged combat shotgun - yes, I shoot clays with it. 

Face to face sales with cash only, I will not ship this gun, even to an FFL. Located in the Grand Forks, North Dakota area, but I may be willing to travel to the surrounding area (one hour or less) depending on the circumstances.

Up for sale is my Remington 870 shotgun, with the Knoxx pistol grip stock. It makes shooting significantly more comfortable, as the spring loaded stock does a very good job of absorbing recoil. It came with a forend too, just never got around to installing it...but it will come with the gun.

I had a side saddle installed on this, and upon removal, it left some discoloring on the receiver, see picture. But, this isn't meant to be a safe queen, it's a duty shotgun that wants to be used. I had it in my closet for use as a home defense shotgun, and recently picked up a different shotgun to use.

This has the magazine extension which puts capacity at 6+1.

Cash is king, but I'm not opposed to trades. NO JUNK! No offense, but I don't own crap now, and I'm not planning on it in the future. Only interested in pistols in 9mm or 45ACP, or rifles in 5.56/223 or 7.62x39. Would consider a sweet hunting rifle though.

From Kimber:

The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.

With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.

Solo is designed to function optimally using premium hollow-point self-defense factory ammunition with bullet weights of 124 or 147 grains."

I have been shopping around online and locally visiting different shops. I'll probably stop in at a few gun shows as well but I'm thinking about adding another rifle to my collection if the price is right. I am getting my new full time job soon and wanted to pick up a rifle as a little reward to myself (I love an excuse to buy a new rifle). Anyways, I have decided that I want a .233 in my collection as I don't have one yet. I have narrowed it down to the following rifles in the order of interest:

AUG
Beretta ARX
SCAR 16
ACR
Tavor
Colt LE

I have my state ID, police ID, CCW and all of that good stuff and can pay shipping if you live out of state or are an out of state dealer. I can meet you if you live locally. I have cash and some items for trade as well. I have a bulletproof vest valued at 300 that is stab and spike proof as well but trade value would be more reasonable at around 200. If you have a rifle that is a safe queen or are looking for more than a gun shop would give you for your rifle, I'd be happy to pay you a REASONABLE price for it. Looking to fix your car? Pay some bills? Fund your summer/spring break? I'm your guy. If you're looking to make 2k off of your used rifle I am not interested. I'm not expecting to get any of these besides the AR for less than 800 so don't think I'm unrealistic either. Just sticking my feelers out there on my rifle search."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is Beretta Nanosimple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The removable sub-chassis of the Nano allows easy swapping of the standard frame with optional colored frames or different frame systems, including designs with incorporated lights or lasers. A carry pouch is offered standard with every Nano. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

The gun was hardly shot because he had arthritis and was unable to shoot .45, hence why I have it. Seriously, this dude was old and frail with a walker, not sure why he had it..... From what he told me it has set in a case and in his safe. The only thing that makes this gun not in PRISTINE condition is, I guess his arthritis gave him issues when putting the gun together because there is an idiot scratch from the slide stop. It is not a deep scratch where it has damaged the metal. Just rubbed off the coating. Unless you are looking, you wont even see it. I went to the range and put two boxes of shells through it. Its is a colt, its a tight fitted frame/slide, provided great groups, and is reliable enough to eat ANY type of ammo.

The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols.

This has a new barrel (not cut down, I think he uses the SOCOM barrel) and a BM59 flash suppressor. It uses the standard en-block clips (10 included). There are plenty of YouTube videos out there on the Mini-G also. Tim builds the ""Cadillac"" of the tanker Garand (actually, any Garand). If you want quality and dependability, this is it. If not, that's cool too.  I have over $1,800 in this rifle. I don't expect to get it all back, but please consider this when making an offer. Thanks for looking."

When the chips are down and stress is high, a quality laser can make all the difference in making it back home in one piece. Let's face it; bad things usually happen at night in dimly lit areas. When it is happening is not the time to think about the proper sight aids for night time encounters. With LaserLyte Lasers on your side you have the tool necessary to get your hits on target when it matters the most. Grab a LaserLyte and see what you have been missing. 

The Affordable, Holsterable, User Friendly Laser from LaserLyte now for the popular Concealed Carry Ruger LC9 LaserLyte builds on the success of the LaserLyte Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser (CK-AMF), made available earlier this year, by introducing the CK-AMF9 for the Ruger LC9. Made just as streamlined and programmable as the CK-AMF version, yet slightly larger, the CK-AMF9 design fits not only the Ruger LC9 but the Kel-Tec PF9 pistol, as well. 

It is easy to mount on the gun by simply pushing out and replacing the stock frame pins with the new threaded pins (included). Mount the CK-AMF9 to these pins with the included screw. Then push the ergonomic activation button with the index finger and the laser is on target. The programmable laser features a pulse or constant on mode and also has an auto-off function to prevent an unwanted battery drain. An added benefit to the Laserlyte CK-AMF9 is that the laser actually helps to provide safer trigger control by acting as a finger guide without blocking the laser beam. The smooth, no-snag design of the laser allows the pistol to easily holster in any available nylon or leather pocket holster on the market.

Power Output: Class IIIA, 5mw

The shotguns feature .410-ga. barrels with the chambers which accept the ammo equipped with either shot or slugs, including ""Magnum"" with 65, 70, 73 and 76 mm cartridge case.

The receiver features a rail to accommodate an optical-sight mount. The butt and fore end may be made of wood (beech, birch and walnut) or polymer (extra-strong polyamide). For the purpose of diversifying operational capabilities, the barrels may be equipped with the muzzle adapters of different chokes and adapter ""Paradox"" as well.

The front sight, found on the barrel end, improves accuracy of slug firing. The iron sight allows to deliver fire with the optical sight in place.

It was officially adopted as a United States military bolt-action rifle on June 19, 1903, and saw service in World War I. It was officially replaced as the standard infantry rifle by the faster-firing semi-automatic 8 round M1 Garand starting in 1937. However, the M1903 Springfield remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during World War II, since the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm all troops. It also remained in service as a sniper rifle during World War II, the Korean War, and even in the early stages of the Vietnam War. It remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector's piece, and as a military drill rifle.

These rifles have been sporterized for over a century by gun smiths and prestigious firms such as Griffin & Howe and RF Sedgley. Who is to say who's carried this particular rifle in battle or where in the world it's been...if only it could tell its tales.

 Browning Auto 5 Light Twelve, 12ga, old and beautiful. Gold trigger. Hate to see it go, but I can't trust myself to own something this pretty, essentially since I have a hard-on to find a boogered one and SBS it Clyde Barrow style. $650+S&H

 Winchester Model 94 .30-30 Golden Spike Commemorative Edition, 1969 shipped to your FFL for $750.

 Bushnell Banner 3-8x, 1"" tube on rings, perfect for a vintage rifle project. Old, but clear as day. $200+shipping

 Remington 742. I have one in .30-06 and one in .243, both in great condition, functional, and with vintage scopes on see-through mounts. Aught-six has a Redfield 3-9x and the .243 has a Weaver K4-1. Beautiful set perfect for a couple or father/mother and son/daughter, but I'll be willing to split the pair. $850 together or $450 each. Would recommend remounting the scopes, as the original owner had them on cockeyed.

 Other HiPoint carbine, late model 9mm, railed stock, two functional mags and one nonfunctional. $300+shipping

 BAR .30-06 with Redfield 3-9x on see-through mounts. Beautiful rifle, manufactured in early 1970. Some pitting on the bolt keeps this from being a thousand-dollar rifle. No engraving, so don't be afraid to take this out after your favorite megafauna. Some bluing rubbed away from the muzzle from traveling in a soft-case. $799 OBO.

 10-22. Yeah that 10-22. Wood, blued, one mag. $200. Also near the bottom is the optional Muzzlelite stock. $120 for the stock, $310 for all of it, plus shipping.

 Not pictured yet because I'm a dumbass and deleted the pictures is a gorgeous Weatherby Mk V in 7mm Wby Magnum. There's some wear at the muzzle from traveling in a case, but the bolt throws like a dream and the glass on top is clear as day. Zip-over protective case has kept the wood pristine, and the trigger breaks like glass. mm is a bit hot for my scrawny ass or I'd have thought long and hard about keeping it. Asking $999 for the rifle with scope [pics will be at the bottom of the gallery ASAP]. Also have several boxes of factory ammo for it at the reasonable rate of $2/rd.

 Have assorted ammo for most everything listed, but shipping ammo sucks so it's your call. As always, all laws apply, anything outside IL will require an FFL, anything in-state requires a FOID, waiting period.

It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system.

The appearance of the Model 10 BA from Savage is as radical as the extreme accuracy it delivers.
The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting
from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods
and more.

The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy.
The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features
a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like
no Savage we’ve ever made.

The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team.Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum.

Standard features in this series include:

    Oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots
    Crisp clean AccuTrigger™ allows the user to easily adjust trigger pull weight from approximately 1.5 – 6 pounds

and.... i think that's it....

I built the rifle because they are fun to build and I wanted to have an AR that was a bit different than others out there.  It runs flawlessly, I've put just under 500rds through it.   The carbine length gas system has proven reliability in a 16"" barrel with this caliber.  The rifle length sight picture makes it look really neat, but also helps with accuracy.  in a previous 7.62x39 AR build, i had ASC magazines and they were garbage. the CProducts ones are amazing.  I've not had a single failure with this rifle, but i would like to get into .308.  

Keep in mind this is a legal caliber for hunting deer.

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

The appearance of the Model 10 BA from Savage is as radical as the extreme accuracy it delivers.
The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting
from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods
and more.

The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy.
The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features
a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like
no Savage we’ve ever made.

The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team.Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum.

Standard features in this series include:

    Oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots

The appearance of the Model 10 BA from Savage is as radical as the extreme accuracy it delivers.
The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting
from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods
and more.

The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy.
The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features
a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like
no Savage we’ve ever made.

The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team.Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum.

Standard features in this series include:

    Oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots
    Crisp clean AccuTrigger™ allows the user to easily adjust trigger pull weight from approximately 1.5 – 6 pounds

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

May trade for other rifles in 30-06 caliber. 
Nice clean bore, and I have always stringently cleaned it after shooting. Has the attached folding bayonet, and original stock. It has a rubber recoil pad, and the round ball handle of the bolt has been coated in rubber for better gripping. Safety lever now has a round ring for ease of grip, and also has a rubberized section for gripping. Has a new firing pin spring, and I also have an extra that is brand new that will go with it. I also have the factory cleaning rod tools, and some stripper clips. I have two boxes of Tul-Ammo, and some spam can ammo.
Here is a list of what comes with the rifle:
- Rifle
- Carry strap
- Cleaning rod supplies and tool
- Stripper clips
- Upgraded bolt accessories (rubber coatings, and safety lever addition)
- Extra firing pin spring
- Two boxes of Tul-Ammo 7.62x54R
- Some spam can ammo (not sure how many rounds of this I have, will check)

In the gun itself, I have about $300 in it, or a little over. $25 in Tulammo.
