You were running late to meet up with your friends and ended up parking a lot further than anticipated. Now it's after 0200 a.m. and you find yourself walking along a dark, isolated street…and now your situation is about to get hairy. This is a scenario that plays itself out more than ever with financial times as tough as they have been in decades. Like countless military, law enforcement, and concealed carry aficionados I carry a GLOCK for just such an occasion. GLOCK is used by law enforcement and security personal world wide as well as here in the USA because of their rugged dependability and combat reliability. In fact when it comes to iconic firearms GLOCK is at the top of any list because of their innovation and quality components that GLOCK is world famous for. No other firearm is relied on more than a GLOCK for defense and duty use. Pick up a GLOCK 17, 21, 22, 31 for duty use; GLOCK 19, 23, 32, 30 for duty and carry, or GLOCK 26, 27, 33, 36 for deep concealment. 

Superior versatility is available with this high-performance, 10mm Auto pistol. With reduced dimensions compared to the standard size GLOCK 20, the subcompact GLOCK 29 is also suitable for concealed carry. In addition to the use as a backup weapon for hunting, more and more security personnel on patrol appreciate the comfortable firing characteristics and the grip ergonomics of the G29 10mm with its standard 10 round magazine.

This muzzleloader has been very well maintained and it shoots like a dream. There are too many “goodies” to list, but they are all present in the picture(s). Some of the bullets, powder charges and primers have been used, so the packages are not all entirely full. However, very few have been shot from each container of bullets and the powder charges have about 30 left in each tub. I can get you exact counts of everything if you desire (just give me time to dig them all out and count each one). 

I am down-sizing my collection, which is why I am selling. Buyer must be willing to sign a Bill of Sale (keeps everyone out of trouble) which is not reported, only retained for record keeping. Call or text REDACTED, or just comment below. More pictures are available, you just have to ask and I will e-mail them to you. Thanks!"

But he flaked. So please! Serious traders only!!!

here is a genuine once in a lifetime opportunity to snag a gem out of my private collection... It needs to be appreciated. 

This is my ATEi customs m&p .40, and it has had over 1000.00 of work put into it. (That if course, does include shipping and FFL fees.) This m&p went off to ATEi Customs in Michigan for the FULL defensive carry package. This package includes the following-

full serration, top
full serration, sides (press check)
catalyst mag release 
full frame stipple (sweaty, muddy, bloody does this)
Full trigger undercut (also SMB)
flared mag well (SMB)
in-house trigger job. This has to be felt to be believed. 
Night sights
trigger reset modification
refinish with salt nitro carburizing bath... Just like melonite. 

To clarify, this is the best m&p outside of a salient that you will touch. 

Essentially, the work took six MONTHS to complete. The pistol has been gone longer than it's been back. It has only seen 200 flawless rounds, all before the work, and is immaculate. I will value the pistol at a fair 1100.00 in trade, or if you really will offer the cash, 1000 in sale, FIRM. Of course, I am willing to negotiate for the right offer.

800.00 TONIGHT ONLY!

I am am moving out of .40, so testing the waters in no hurry at all. This means that I have plenty of ammo to send with the weapon!

I love HK, Sig, and colt or springer 1911s, but I think we will have to discuss trades together. No rifles or shotguns, maybe a higher end AR."

The pistol is in amazing shape and i have the original box and paperwork , 50 Rounds FMJs , 17 rounds Z-Max JHPs , I originally bought this for my wife to carry but she no longer has interest in it , 

The Benchmade I have owned for a few years now but has been collecting more dust then anything , I will trade items separately only if its exactly what I am looking for , the reason why I posted the knife as well to hopefully increase my chances of finding what I am looking for , its a 200-250 dollar knife , 

I'm looking for mostly TRADES for something a bit bigger frame wise like an M&P 9 or 40 ,  something along the lines of that , I'm open to all offers just don't try to offer me crap ...

It was originally a 7.92 Argentine mauser, that was refitted and rechambered in .308 with a new Remington barrel.  The action is the only holdover from the original rifle, and it functions flawlessly.  This has been my deer gun for over 25 years, and yet I have only put @75 rounds though it in all that time.  Wicked accurate, and it's taken @15 deer, without giving me any trouble.  Just inherited a beautiful replacement in 7mm, so it is time to pass this along to someone who will keep her active.  4 shot internal magazine +1 I bought this rifle just after it was refitted, and the only rounds down the barrel have been shot by me...so the round count is honest and accurate.

The free-floating barrel is made of match-grade Cr-Mo steel, and manufactured by a precision cold-hammer forging process by Sako craftsmen. The action and the barrel surfaces are Manganese-phosphatized for lasting protection against the elements and wear. The barrel features protected muzzle threading, providing attachment for optional Sako muzzle brake or suppressor assembly.

The modern bolt has two front locking lugs and a spring-loaded reliable operation. The Teflon coating on the bolt ensures a non-reflecting surface and a smooth bolt throw. The 2-way safety behind the bolt handle locks both the bolt and the trigger. The trigger unit is adjustable with a hand-honed sear/trigger - without creep. A single set trigger is optional.

The Picatinny rail on top of the action takes any Weaver or U.S. Mil.Std 1913 compatible mounts. New phospatized Tikka Optilock bases and rings are recommended for maximum accuracy and ease of use.

The detachable straight-feeding single column magazine is silent, durable and non-rusting. The standard 5-round magazines are tailored to each caliber for ultimate reliability and performance.

The stock is made of fiberglass reinforced copolymer polypropylene and features an ambidextrous palm swell. The wide fore-end has a swivel stud to take a bipod. The three sides of the stock are fitted with inserts which allow the use of heavy duty hook-type sling swivels. The recoil pad is of black rubber and the length of pull may be adjusted with spacers. The cheek piece is adjustable at 5 mm intervals, up to 25 mm (1”).

Scope, scope mounts, bipod, muzzle brake and extra large bolt handles are optional, as well as are adjustable open sights and fore- and rear-stock fastened military type heavy duty sling studs for hook-type swivels.

This is the most comfortable plate carrier I have ever tried on (and I have owned them all....seriously, all of them!) Paraclete Armor & Equipment is a top-notch gear maker. Used by Navy Seals, Rangers, and other Tier One Operators because of their quality, durability, and features not found with other companies. Holds up to Large (10x12) SAPI/ESAPI Plates with room for plate backers when needed. The included plates in this ad fit perfectly and wear comfortably.
Level IV (4) 7.62mm Armor Piercing (APM2) Protection, front and back Plates.
Also included is an IFAK complete with medic supplies, as issued to Soldiers with Israeli bandage, compressed gauze, nitrile gloves, nasopharyngeal airway, and med tape, all in a folding insert. Insert fits into the Quik Clot brand IFAK pouch (rare pouch). I will included a Quik Clot Combat Gauze to the person that buys this entire kit from me for FREE!
Also included in this setup are three (x3) Tactical Tailor Magna Pistol Mag Pouches. These are my favorite style of pouch because they have a magnet (powerful earth element) that keeps your magazine retained while in action without the need for the flap, although it does have a velco flap for extra security when needed.
I may slightly negotiate on price (i wont drop hundreds of dollars off the price, so dont ask). Will entertain trades of equal or greater value, but I need the money so it will need to be very interesting.
Buyer will pay shipping costs. Payment via Paypal.

This very early vintage Bianchi X15 with ""PATENT PEND"" embossing is a timeless piece of American handgun holster history from one of the premier holster designers of our time. That it is still in production and supported by Bianchi today is a true testament to John's original and innovative design.  

After years of service for both Smiths and Colts, this Vietnam era example was retired to a climate-controlled environment for the last 35 years. It is in very good to excellent condition with near perfect stitching, retainer strap (replaced by Bianchi) and original supple leather shoulder strap and harness.

Sturdy and rigid at the holster cradle and supple and soft at the shoulder, this prime example requires no break in and is perfect for the collector or a discriminating individual who appreciates the value of owning a high quality, true vintage holster of historical significance.

874,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3378874,For Sale:  Rare Special Colt SAA - .45 - 4 ¾ “ Barrel,"Concord, California, United States","$ 2,800","Listed On: Tuesday, August 12, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Quite rare Colt SAA,  C & R eligible.

FIRST OF ALL, I am not a Colt SAA expert. I know just enough to research Colt books and get confused.

Over a collecting lifetime, have acquired several pistols as “common”, which later turned out
to have serious collector interest. Dumb luck.

This SAA may fit into this category.

A serious SAA collector may determine this to be a Colt “error” and make a serious offer.
Alternately, a serious collector may determine this SAA to not be an error. In that case
will grab a box of GOEX black powder ammunition and head for the range.

For starters: Colt SAA, serial number 347XXX, .45, 4 ¾” barrel, about 25% blue mostly around
extractor housing, matching serial number on frame and right side of back strap and trigger guard strap.
Last 2 digits on cylinder face. “F” in hammer slot. Trigger guard proof mark and inspector 3.
There are a small number of pockmarks visible. It has aftermarket stag grips.

There is a Colt Archive letter saying serial # 347XXX, .45/c, 4 ¾”, Blue, was shipped to St. Louis in 1925.

Of interest, the 4 ¾“ barrel has a single line barrel address.
Also, the barrel address has the Broken “O” in “Hartford”.

Referencing Keith Cochran’s COLT PEACEMAKER ENCYCLOPEDIA, Errors Pg 144-145.
Also page 17, Barrel Address Lettering, “These errors are very rare.”

Now the conflicts. The encyclopedia, page 75, identifies the barrel’s caliber marking being used 1929 – 1940.
The Broken “O” is identified as occurring about 1926 – 1936.

Final consideration, an ampersand is stamped on right rear trigger guard indicating a visit back to the factory,
Colt Archives does not maintain records of repairs. It is common knowledge that Colt never threw out anything usable.
Did Colt put a mis-stamped barrel on this SAA during a factory visit ?

This is as far as I can take it. If anyone can offer positive information or questions,
please email me. I do not live on the computer, but will get back to you as soon as possible.

I am a private collector, slowly liquidating a personal collection. Old age and that sort of stuff.

C&R or FFL. If C&R, direct from Seller to Buyer. If no C&R, Colt must be shipped to FFL. If shipped to FFL,
buyer must select FFL that will receive shipments from C&R. Payment by Postal Money Order or personal check.
Shipped in a PLANO hard case. Seller will pay shipping and insurance.  If shipping to Alaska or Hawaii, please email for a quote. Personal checks held 10 business days before shipping.

FINE PRINT: Shipping limited to the 50 United States, or at least those States that recognize the Second Amendment. Checking local gun laws is buyer’s responsibility. 
This item will be legally shipped by private owner to your C&R or your FFL. Buyers are responsible
