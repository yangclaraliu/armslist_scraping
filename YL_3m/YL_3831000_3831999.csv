223,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3831223,For Sale:  Own your own shooting range,"North Fort Collins, Fort Collins, Colorado","$ 1,000","Listed On: Saturday, December 20, 2014",Events,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This posting is to test the waters to see if there would be any interest.

I have a friend who is selling his acreage north of Fort Collins. For years he has let us (his friends) shoot on his property where he has a nice shooting pit.

The property will be up for sale soon and I just hate to lose such a great place to shoot.
I can't afford to buy it myself and my wife isn't interested in moving there because it's too far from town. So I've been trying to come up a with a plan to buy the place and keep it in the family, so to speak. The final purchase price will be near $350,000 for 80 acres and a house.

One of my ideas is to form a Landowner's Consortium. We form a group of like minded folks that can buy a share or shares as part of the purchase cost. For example, a share would cost $1000. You could buy a single share, 5 shares, 10 shares or 20 shares.

As you're reading this I can hear the wheels turning. You're probably asking who has control? How do we make decisions? What about safety? What if I want out? If I have more shares do I have a bigger say?

Absolutely! All very good questions. 

Be assured that all those concerns and more would be included in a legally binding set of By Laws and Rules that we all would agree to. There would be a board of directors and democratic system for approving proposals and making decisions.

There is a nice house on this property and it would be feasible to have the house rented thereby generating income. As a consortium we would decide how best to use the funds for improving the property in the interests of the co-owners.

I've never done anything like this and there are many details that would have to be hammered out. But again, this posting is to find out how much interest there might be.

So, if owning a piece of land 20 minutes from downtown Fort Collins, where you can shoot whenever you want, is something you might be willing to put $1000 into, send me an email. If the results are overwhelming I'll take the next step and talk to a lawyer about what it would take to put this together.

My name is Michael. For now I'll retain some anonymity until this idea is cultivated to the next level. Thanks for reading and I'm exited to see what happens next."

This is their M&P T, which is their tactical model. It is not the cheap M&P Sport or M&P Optics Ready version.  This has the free floating hand rail (Troy Industries I believe), and I have upgraded it so it has a Magpul grip and Magpul ASAP sling end plate for your sling.  

This is in very good condition.  If you are looking for a cheap $700 AR, this is not the one.  There are plenty of those out there to choose from if that is all you are looking for.

It was installed on my AR, then taken back off since I switched stocks.  It works great, especially for those using optics.  From LaRue:

Finally, a cheek riser that moves back with the charging handle when using collapsible stocks.
It's a fact that some AR's need a cheek riser to get proper cheekweld for raised scopes or rifles with raised rails. It's another fact that standard AR charging handles require a lot of travel, making it impossible to charge a rifle without moving a collapsible stock all the way to the rear. The LaRue RISR solves these problems.

Made in Texas, USA, out of glass-reinforced polymer, the RISR is spring-loaded, and travels to the rear as the charging handle is moved to the rear. When the charging handle is released, the RISR snaps forward. Designed to fit the excellent Magpul CTR butt stock without modification, the RISR only takes a few minutes to install with a phillips-head screwdriver. The RISR does not work on commercial sized furniture and only works wtih Mil-Spec stocks.

The RISR comes complete with all mounting hardware."

Gun is absolutely stunning. It is still in 99% condition. It is absolutely the nicest Model 12 I have ever laid hands on! The wood is so beautiful that is unreal! The cool thing is that it comes just like it left the factory with the box, hang tag and all paperwork. Box as you can see is in fantastic condition. The only things that I can find on the gun is a very faint slide mark under the barrel from takedown and a very faint mark at the receiver from takedown. This gun isn't perfect and I'm sure if you look hard you'll find some faint mark somewhere but you are going to have to look hard. No primer ring and no marks in the barrel."

The rail system is UTG and is one-piece that comes off easily and is made for a mini, as itslides rigth over the front of the barrel/stock.

The serial numbers start with 186-630xxx indicating that this is the model run from 1991-1999 I believe and this gun was made in 97/98.

Take off the stock and the true ""mini"" is in incredible shape. The last two pics show the internal front and back of the chamber and I couldn't get my camera to take a decent pic of the inside of the barrel but it is bright, shiny and the rifling is great. The gun shoots perfectly. The action is smooth and crisp. The magazine go in tight and crisp and snaps right into place, where I've had other minis that you fought with the darn thing to get it in there.

The barrel and top of the gun are very very clean and the only blemishes on the thing are a couple nicks on the suppressor and the stock has use marks.

This would be a perfect gun to throw an optic on and use as it is or to take off the stock and rails, sell them, and build whatever you want. I'd put a tactical folding stock on it from tapco or some other brand and just use a regular scope mount with a 3-9x30 myself. Or one could just put a nice red dot on the upper rail of this setup and go.

Anyhow, I hope this better explains the gun. I wish I had the original stock for it, but I don't. The nice thing about these mini's is that there are hundreds of cheap things that can be done to customize them on ebay, amazon and all over. Or if someone wanted a cheap really light mini, take off the rails in about 5 minutes and use the peep sights and go spray some lead at the coyotes.

$490 and thanks for looking.

4"" Barrel.

Extra features include:
Wolff spring kit for hammer and trigger return. Installed properly with minimal amount of light sanding using 3000 grit paper to smooth burrs on internals.

Trigger, Hammer and Hammer Dog shim kits also installed. Meticulous care was taken to size to minimum tolerances without binding. (New shims were ordered after the first round to bring this to gun-specific perfect tolerance. Took a lot of time and care to do right.)

Trigger pull is now very very smooth with an extremely nice double action break. (Hammer also does not rub the frame at all since shims installed. Makes a huge difference.)

Hogue grips installed but original perfect condition grips with wood inlay are also included.

Original springs are also included. Everything is labeled. The notes from the smith work with tolerances are also included. Also included are endshake shims with measurement notes. Did not get around to doing that work but they are the correct size. (Endshake was not bad at all but right at high end of tolerance see notes.)

Has original case and paperwork and I think an unfired case though I did not open the envelope.

Rear sight is in alignment but not really adjustable. It had some sort of problem with the adjustment screw so got it in place and left it there. This will most likely need to be replaced if you want to adjust for windage though it is in alignment for zero wind conditions now.

American Derringer went out of business years ago but back in the early 2000s when this gun was made, they retailed for over $800. The finish is basically a mirror finish with no scratches whatsoever. This has been my concealed carry gun for the past 2 years and has served its purpose well. I am selling it  to move to something a little more practical. The gun comes with a custom IWB holster that I had hand made for the gun which is absolutely beautiful. For all of those out there looking for a concealed carry gun, you will indeed have the biggest and baddest carry gun there is if you own this little derringer.

In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever(installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a new sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.

This has been my primary training rifle for the past 3 years.  I don't have a round count, but I would guess it's around ~2.5K.
This rifle has also been my home defense choice.  This one was chosen for that role after taking a class (~400 rds in 1 day) and inspecting to prove it works well.  The only issue i had with this rifle is the castle nut backing out and the buffer detent popping up at around the 200 round mark (well before the 1st class).  The problem was the castle nut was not staked.  A competent armorer investigated the issue, staked the castle nut, and tested himself to ensure the issue was fixed.  After a number of classes (I try to be hard on my gear, just to ensure it'll handle abuse), I have not had that issue.
I've taken this rifle through a couple classes, and have had no issues.  Other than the one mentioned above, I had a couple type 1 failures because I didn’t properly seat the magazine.  It has been Zeroed for 50 yards, and I've been able to ring steel at 250 yards, iron sights.  Typically shoots ~2.5-3 MOA hot or cold.  Even though it is zeroed now, I will be changing the handguards back to the original bushmaster, so the POI may shift.  Please zero and confirm yourself.
I don't put too much crap on my rifle, but I did add the daniel defense lower receiver end plate with a single point sling attachment, tangoedown grip and an extended charging handle latch.  These did not make me a better shooter, but solved some problems and made manipulation easier.
This rifle begs to be shot and abused.  It’s an excellent shooter.  It’s not a tack driver, but it runs very well.  The entire bolt assembly is the original, I have not had any cracking or chipping.  Barrel and chamber are chrome lined.  I typically run either federal XM193 or wolf gold (all brass, no steel case).  It also handles federal XM855 well.  Both magpul and USGI aluminum mags work well with the rifle.  I lubricate bearing surfaces with lithium grease, and keep some CLP on hand in case she starts to bind up.
NC buyers only please, preferably concealed carry permit holders, so please have yours ready.  I reserve the right to refuse to sell the item to anyone.
Included in the sale is the rifle, with the modifications mentioned above.  No ammo nor magazines.  No trades please, cash only.  I can suggest some training facilities, and if you can prove that you’ve signed up for a class I’ll give you a discount.
My suggestions:
Add a sling and a light (preferable Surefire brand).  If you can afford it, an aimpoint is nice but not necessary.
I trust my life to this rifle (ONLY after I’ve shot ~800 rounds).  I just don’t have the need for this particular rifle anymore, so I figured someone could use it to protect their life or their family’s lives.  

Stay Sharp."

The S&W 5906 was and still is one of the most popular law enforcement handguns ever produced. They are full of saftey features, use high capacity magazines and are super accurate and dependable. If you are looking for an all steel gun made in the USA this is a great option. Minimal recoil and smooth action. 

This gun had a complete teardown, beadblast, polished/brushed slide-frame and NEW grips. Smooth action, nice shooter. A great investment and they are on the rise. Extended trigger guard early edition, stainless trigger and hammer. Comes with 1 15 round magazine. Ready to use. Super clean. Not your typical cop trade in.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! READ READ READ READ BELOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I prefer to sell this locally, in my town. You WILL need a current CWP CCW permit to by direct from me. If not we can do a FFL transfer at my local dealer which requires a 3 day hold. NO other way. If you want it shipped I will ship to your FFL and you pay all costs involved, pre paid by US Postal Service money order only. No checks or credit cards. No magazine included to states that do not allow 15 rds. It is a fair deal for such a nice 5906. If you are not able to get along with ALL the terms above then do not contact me and waste time.

SEND A NAME AND PHONE NUMBER that you answer to arrange meeting up for this sale. I do not reply to ANY emails due to scammers looking for contact info. I will call you fast though.

$485 cash.  No offers please.

I would ONLY local trade towards a Remington 870 Marine, Ruger, S&W or Colt AR15 only. NO other gun or trades..
