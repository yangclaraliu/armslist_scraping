Vey nice rifle. This rifle is extremely accurate, which put it in the same league like Anschutz and Walther in silhouette competition. Discontinued in 1999 so no more to buy. It was topped with cheap CenterPoint 4-16x40 scope from Walmart but I took it off because it didn't look right with this type or rifle. 

The targets was shot at 50 distance no more no less (the scope has AO, so I'm positive to say that). Wind was about 5MPH (Weather Channel app in my Ipad said so). I shot it with variation of 22s but the gun liked Geco SV the best, almost five shot went through the same hole. The others were ok, but they all can be covered with a dime or penny. Pics ain't never lied. None of them were considered MATCH AMMO OR ANYTHING, but the results were very respectable for a 22lr cartridge. I think if I try with Match ammo like Wolf, Lapua or Eley, I can shoot a walnut off the tree (@ 75-100 yards, maybe?) with this gun. It's just an amazing rifle 

The winner's ammo list: (higher to lower)

1st: Geco Subsonic 1050 fps 
2nd: Fiocchi SV 1070 fps
3rd: Federal Gold Medal HV Match 1200 fps
4th: Blazer HV 1235 fps
5th: Norma USA Tac 22 1100 fps


 If you want this beauty, you better be quick to grab it. Shoots all 22s: S,L and LR. Engraved receiver. Adjustable trigger. And the trigger breaks like glass at  17oz. It can go even lower, but not recommended as for safety reason

If you can't meet in person to pick it up, I can ship it to your FFL for $40 insured. If you want my FFL to ship it, then add $20 more for their fee. Need more pictures? Just ask.

These SLR-96's are amazing rifles, this is the MB model which has a muzzle brake installed from the factory which cuts flash and felt recoil. Another thing to note is that these milled SLR-95's have a steyr hammer forged chrome lined barrel which makes this rifle easily the most accurate AK I have ever laid my hands on - 1.5in groups are not uncommon with cheap steel cased Wolf or Tula. Also I have installed a trijicon front tritium night sight and a Krebs rear peep sight.

UltiMAK M1A M14 Forward Optic Mount (optic ready)

Buffer Technologies M1A M14 Recoil Buffer

Sadlak Industries M1A M14 National Match Spring Guide

Sadlak Industries M1A M14 Tactical Magazine Release Latch

So basically this rifle is better than a new one with less cost. I'll even thrown 5 extra 10-round magazines and 4 boxes of factory .308 ammo ($100 value just for the ammo). FFL transfer via Bain and Davis in San Gabriel or Turner's Pasadena. Rifle will come in a Flambeau hardcase. No lowball offers or trades. Buyer pays fees. Only selling because of my wedding.

The gun is less than 6 months old and I've put less than 500 rounds through it. All of which functioned flawlessly. I put granulated talon grips on (can easily be removed) and also purchased a horsehide crossbreed holster for it. Never been abused or thrashed around... always babied, like all my guns. I like the gun but bought it on a whim and would prefer the M&P9c. Gun was about $420 out the door, $20 on the grips, and $100 on the holster. Not looking to make a killing, just get into a 9c. Willing to trade for an M&P9c or Glock 19. Will throw in cash for a Glock 19. I will file an EFA-10 and do the transfer preferably at my ranges clubhouse. Thanks!"

Feel free to send me a reasonable cash offer or a trade offer. I am interested in guns, quads, Reds game used stuff, PS4 or XBOX 1, a smaller TV for my bedroom or anything else fun. I am open to a lot. I am in no way trying to get what I paid for it but I will not just give it away.

The only problem that it had was when I was watching TV and lightning hit by my house and it shut off. It took a bit for it to get restarted and it was pixaly. It would randomly shut off and kick back on. I just had a TV repair guy come out and look at it. He tuned it up and and took care of the voltage problem. The TV seems to be back to normal and in good working order. I bought a new TV so I no longer need this one. It would make for a nice TV for someone or you can use it for parts to fix your Samsung. You can test it out if you would like or we can meet in public. I can send a pic of if working if you need or a video. I know some people dont like to meet at other peoples houses so I am willing to help you see it work."

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...). You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. Taurus also makes a small caliber tip barrel design, but has a much heavier trigger (due to being double action). The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $155 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00.

I will include 32 additional questionable rounds for free. The questionable rounds were accidentally left in the garage for a few years, and include stripper clips. The 370 rounds have been stored well. It shoots great. Very accurate and powerful gun. A Real bushwhacker. Rounds give deeper penetration than a 357 Magnum. Penetrates some older model armored vests. I'm not sure if I have the cleaning rod. I always used a bore-snake, and religiously cleaned immediately after shooting. The ammo box isn't included. Reduced to $280.00 for the gun and $160 for the ammo. Take the whole package for $430.00. Private sale which must take place at my Palm Harbor office.

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...). You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. Taurus also makes a small caliber tip barrel design, but has a much heavier trigger (due to being double action). The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $155 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven."

This is a 20 inch barrel model with 7+1 capacity, heat shield, shell side saddle on the receiver, red dot scope and rail, and pro mag tri rail forend and adjustable AR style stock. Barrel and magazine tube have been duracoated black, heat shield and receiver red.

Works well, but I'm interested in trying something different. I'd like to trade it for a different HD/Tactical style shotgun. Primarily looking for a Benelli Nova Tactical or a Winchester SXP Extreme Defender, but would consider other similar weapons. I already have a nice field gun so I am not interested in hunting shotguns.
Would consider less expensive model shotguns as well+cash, such as a base model Winchester SXP, any of the ASI shotguns on the market now, the IAC Hawk Remington 870 clones, and others.

While I'm primarily interested in another shotgun I would also consider a mid or full sized handgun in 9mm or .40, particularly one of those police trade in Glock 22's that are flooding the market right now, or some sort of a .38 special snub revolver. Not interested in rifles at this time.

Would prefer to trade but I'll also sell for $350 firm if you're not wanting to trade.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

770,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3556770,For Sale:  Glock 27 Gen 3 With Extras,"North Hills, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",$ 425,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 7, 2014",Handguns,Glock                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"I am selling a Glock 27 .40 caliber handgun in good working condition, only minor cosmetic flaws from normal wear and tear.  Great carry weapon in a powerful caliber.  If you are not used to shooting larger caliber handguns I do not recommend this gun.  It has never failed to go ""bang"" when I pull the trigger, as is expected with Glock firearms.  The only reason I am selling is to offset the purchase of a new Sig.

Included with purchase of Glock 27:
1) Original Glock hard case
2) 9 round magazines with pinky extensions
1) 9 round flush bottom magazine
1) IWB (Inside Waist Band) holster, kydex with clasp belt loops
2) Boxes of 20 hollow point defensive rounds

I also have plenty of target ammunition available (950+ rounds) that I would be willing to sell for $15/bx or ALL 950+ rounds for $250 which saves you $35 from box price (19 boxes plus a partial).  Currently you will not find it cheaper than $22/bx in stores.  Mix of factory loads from various manufacturers and Freedom Munitions re-manufactured rounds which are reloaded with factory presses and work just as well if not better than new loads from Remington, Federal, etc.  Glocks are not picky on ammo in the slightest.

Long story short:  You can have a Glock 27 in a case with 3 mags, a holster, 40 hollow points, and over 950 rounds of ammo for $675 plus transfer fee.  More than a fair deal any day of the week.

Price is non-negotiable.  No trades.  Cash only.  Buyer pays transfer fee.  Transfer must be done face to face with current FFL holder in Pittsburgh area.  I WILL NOT SHIP TO FFL.  I recommend using Guns of Our Fathers in Upper St. Clair as they will transfer for $25 and are open on Saturdays from 10-4.  However, since buyer pays, I will agree to use other FFL holders provided they are within reasonable driving distance of the North Hills, and have a website I can view beforehand."
