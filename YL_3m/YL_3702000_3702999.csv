This is a really nice rifle.  I have another Palmetto AR-10 that shoots MOA easily with Match Ammo.  Fit and finish are very good.  These rifles are the same pattern as the DPMS rifles, and so are compatible with PMAGS (one is included) and DPMS Mags.  It has never been shot, except for the test shots at the factory.  It comes complete with box.

I was planning on converting it to a dragunov stock but when I started taking a better look at the gun when the stock arrived I realized that there were no import marks that I could see even after I disassembled the gun. Before I go ahead and convert it I thought I would see if anyone would like it in this form since I don't need a collectible to make the gun I want.

I've had this rifle for a little over a year now, having bought it upon returning from Afghanistan when I was stationed in Washington.I was told I am the 3rd owner, having bought it from a gentleman who needed money for new tires for his truck. He bought it from the original owner, his friend who got tired of it and needed money himself. I don't know how many rounds exactly have been fired through it, bore is still nice and shiny. I have personally fired around 300-400 rounds through it. Got out the Army, and haven't shot it once since and would rather have the cash than the rifle for an upcoming move.

It's a pre-E-series ""billboard"" 1911 that was refinished by S&W. JRD serial prefixes were the first run of S&W 1911 from around 2002-2003, with JRD being the initials of the engineer who designed them. During the first run S&W's Performance Center assisted the production line during assembly, so they are better fitted than later models.

Please, do research about the gun before sending me inquiries! I will be upfront about anything and everything I know about this gun but I will appreciate it if you do a little research yourself. Google ""JRD prefix Smith and Wesson"", ""JRD 1911"" or anything with those keywords and you will find forums of info. Thank you in advance! :-)

JRDxxxx serial numbered pistols were put together at the Performance Center  just before they started calling it Performance Center. It is not considered an E line or anything to that nature because it predates this. What Smith and Wesson had done was custom hand fit frame and slide and use high and quality aftermarket parts (Les Baer, Wilson Combat, etc.) in the build of the pistol and that's what developed into the Smith & Wesson Performance Center.

-Romanian Wire side folding stock (has been wrapped in black 550 paracord)

Also included in the sale is around 800 rounds of 7.62x39 (mixture of Tula, Herters, and Red Army) in 20 rnd boxes and then around 100-120 rounds loose, 4 steel Romanian magazines, and a BullDog rifle case (capable of holding 4 magazines on the side). Plus the original handguards, pistol grip, and muzzle brake are included.

I've had this rifle for a little over a year now, having bought it upon returning from Afghanistan when I was stationed in Washington.I was told I am the 3rd owner, having bought it from a gentleman who needed money for new tires for his truck. He bought it from the original owner, his friend who got tired of it and needed money himself. I don't know how many rounds exactly have been fired through it, bore is still nice and shiny. I have personally fired around 300-400 rounds through it. Got out the Army, and haven't shot it once since and would rather have the cash than the rifle for an upcoming move. 

I'm asking $750 OBO for the whole package. Please see below for trades and no shipping at this time. Buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale and show ID to verify they are of least 18 years of age and legal to own firearms within NC. I can best be reached by phone (text preferred) at REDACTED.

I recently saw this at a gun show and purchased it after finding out the amazing innovative thought that went behind the invention of the holster. I think we can all agree that the purpose of any concealable holster is to carry a weapon / pistol we feel comfortable carrying just in case we need to use it for protection, but leave it behind at times because of the outfit / occasion / time of year (climate). This innovative holster is unlike any you have seen and will most likely take the place of your current concealable holster. At a glance you would think it’s a cell phone case when in reality it is a holster capable of concealing any number of handguns. I do not work for this company or do not get any benefit from this post. I just think once you view this and understand the concept of portability plus conceal ability the item will sell itself.

I recently saw this at a gun show and purchased it after finding out the amazing innovative thought that went behind the invention of the holster. I think we can all agree that the purpose of any concealable holster is to carry a weapon / pistol we feel comfortable carrying just in case we need to use it for protection, but leave it behind at times because of the outfit / occasion / time of year (climate). This innovative holster is unlike any you have seen and will most likely take the place of your current concealable holster. At a glance you would think it’s a cell phone case when in reality it is a holster capable of concealing any number of handguns. I do not work for this company or do not get any benefit from this post. I just think once you view this and understand the concept of portability plus conceal ability the item will sell itself.

This of course was test fired at the factory, but I've not been able to get out and shoot it yet... that said, you will have to follow the break-in procedure AND, if this is going to be assembled as an SBR, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for filing and obtaining your ATF Form 1. I will include a copy for you to file, but that is where my responsibility ends.

One photo below shows this assembled on my New Frontier pistol lower with a Magpul 20rnd magazine for a size reference only and those items are NOT included in the sale. The lower can be bought for an additional $180.00 as it contains an Anderson Lower Parts Kit and Pistol Buffer Tube. I also have the SIGTAC SB15 Arm Brace that I could part with for another $135.00. Buying all the parts separately would be $740.00 plus shipping, FFL Fees/Transfer and tax, but I could let it all go for $700.00.

I can meet you within 50 miles of Cape Coral, in a public place, during daylight hours only. NOTE: If you're interested in the complete pistol, I ask that you bring a photo ID [Concealed Carry Permit preferred] and I'll provide a bill of sale for the benefit of both parties.

The Lights Out's performance starts with Bear's patented compression molded Flare Quad limbs. This special limb design provides durability, smooth energy release, and equal stress distribution to efficiently and quietly deliver superior energy to the arrow, where it belongs. Noise and vibration are further reduced by the improved string suppressor and aluminum pivoting limb cups. The two-piece synthetic grip reduces vibration even further and provides the warmest grip available for cold weather hunting. The 8.75'' brace height and minimum reflex machined aluminum riser deliver superior forgiveness and accuracy. The Lights Out delivers great arrow speed of 296-300 fps thanks to its Perimeter-Weighted Modular Single Cam system. Designed for a smooth, quiet draw and powerful release, the cam rotates quietly on a sealed stainless steel bearing and reduces cable friction with its asymmetric power track for better performance and longer cable life.

Product Description
Armasight Spark is a rugged lightweight Multi-Purpose Night Vision Monocular that can be Hand Held, Camera Adaptable, Head/Helmet Mounted or Weapon Mounted. Armasight Spark is based on “single tube/single eyepiece” concept where independent use of each eye maximizes the ability of the user to operate under a wide range of low light conditions while reducing the risk of temporary night blindness typically associated with night vision goggles. A built-in Illuminator allows you to see clearly even in total darkness. Spark can be used as a long range Night Vision Spotter in conjunction with state of the art 3x A-focal lens. Armasight Spark is everything outdoorsman, fisherman, tactical shooter, or hunter could ask for."

Comes with the factory box. I also installed MOE MAGPUL furniture (i.e., collapsible stock, pistol grip, enhanced trigger guard) on the gun, which didn’t come from the factory like that. This gun also has a new GG&G tactical quad rail forearm installed on it. It has a Magpul BUS (back up sight) folding rear sight, and a tactical front grip. Factory furnitures that were originally on the gun (i.e., collapsible stock, pistol grip, handguards, trigger guard) also included. In addition, the gun comes with an extra front grip and sling. All the parts/accessories are brand new (except the scope, which is like new). I like this gun a lot. But I want something else. You must be at least 18 years old, or older and a Kentucky resident with proper ID to buy/trade this gun. Local sale/trade only. Will not travel outside Lexington/Fayette County for the price. No shipping. Thanks for looking.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.
