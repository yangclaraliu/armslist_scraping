Sizing/Depriming Die - The sizing/depriming die is full-length, to minimum tolerances, sizing cases down to function in semi- and full-automatic firearms. We strongly suggest that a headspace case gage be used to correctly adjust the size die.

The depriming assembly includes a carbide expander ball for ""squeak-free,"" effortless neck expansion. This expander ball is located in the middle of the depriming stem to take advantage of superior initial leverage for easier extraction. In the event of a stuck case, the design of the depriming assembly allows it to function as a stuck case remover.

Bullet Seating Die - Our bullet seating die is internally designed to keep the bullet straight throughout the seating process. Once properly adjusted, the only measurable runout will be that which is inherent in the bullet.

Taper Crimp Die - The taper crimp die is also specially configured to center both the case neck and the case body, thereby aligning the entire cartridge for a more uniform crimp. Dillon Rifle Dies are designed to meet the more rigid requirements for both accuracy and precision demanded by today's marksman. A taper crimp die is preferred for loading ammunition intended to be used in semiautomatic firearms with detachable box magazines, and in lever-action firearms with tubular magazines.

These are lightly used, less than 500 rounds.

Description: http://www.huldraarms.com/rifles/product_914ffd5b2cff/
The Huldra Mark IV Tactical Elite’s patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer free float forearm (with anti-rotational tabs) and extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you a longer, more ergonomic grip, as well as a longer sight radius between the front and rear sights for quicker acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome. The 4.5 pound JP Trigger (a $259.95 value) gives you a perfectly crisp, precise break and extremely short reset. The complete absence of take-up and over-travel provides the best combination of speed and precision on the market. The ambidextrous safety allows you to flip off the safety on either side of the weapon. The rugged Mil-Spec Vltor IMod Stock has an extremely comfortable superior cheek weld with a non-slip removable butt pad. Each side compartment of The Vltor IMod can hold two AA or three lithium CR123 3-volt batteries and accepts a push-button, quick detachable sling swivel. The Ergo Grip is solid and comfortable. Its superior texture reduces slippage, even while wearing gloves and is virtually impervious to oils and solvents."

I had an armorer build this from scratch. It has only been test fired. Gas system.  It's designed specifically to mimic the appearance of the SBR AAC Honey Badger without the legal complications of having to buy two tax stamps. 

Selling because I received a very nice Christmas present and since I only have two hands, this rifle is yours to buy.

Obviously, this is an early and rare Swiss rifle. If you're not familiar with them, the K-11 was the predecessor to the Swiss K-31. They both fire the GP-11 Swiss (non-corrosive) surplus ammo that is quite common. They also utilize a very unique and QUICK straight bolt action, and are known for their superior accuracy. These early K-11s were made from earlier rifles converted with a new receiver and barrel to accept the new ammo. Only about 25,000 out of the 250,000+ made went through this process. The serial number dates this rifle to 1914, and it's gorgeous for being 100 years old.
