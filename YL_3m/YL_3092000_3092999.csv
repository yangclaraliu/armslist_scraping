There are 127 pistons with out rods, 47 rods with out pistons, 18 rod/piston combos, a cylinder head signed by John Force, 17 blower belts, 5 head gaskets, 13 valves, 6 piston sleeves, 2 magneto caps, spark plugs, a rocker arm, clutch disc, a piece of a body that blew up, a blower front cover, 2 bust panels, a blower pulley and guard, along with some other random pieces such as a bottle of patron signed by Alexis dejoria. All parts are signed, even if you can't see the signature in the pics. The 2 pics of all the rods are different from each other. All parts are marked with a tag that tells what diver signed it. Some tell which race they came from. I have a lot of parts that have multiple signatures. Like driver and crew chief or team mates. It took me years to collect all this. I know somebody that knows somebody that worked at the races in Pomona, and Las Vegas, so that's where most of the parts came from. Some came from the US nationals in Indy when I went up there a few years in a row. The Connie kaletta piston marked 11 of 50 sold for $100 alone at the races. I have all the big names in drag racing from 2008-2013 and a lot of the old legends too. I have a few nascar pistons, a jack roush, tony Stewart, dinnis anderson of grave digger, and a few Indy drivers, Danica Patrick and a couple others.Probably about 240-250 pieces total. I'm not sure a value on the collection, I would like to sell it all together. Probably looking at around $4500 trade value.

It has a micro-adjustable fiber optic rear sight and fiber optic front sight. Unlike most guns in this price range, the Sierra Pro has a two-stage adjustable trigger.

Pictures are of the actual weapon, comes with all chokes, shims and manual. 
No offers, the price is firm, no shipping.
This Stoeger boasts an attractive and practical Realtree  camouflage finish. Versatility, value and solid reliability make the M3500 the perfect choice for waterfowl, wild turkey or upland game birds. The M3500 handles a full range of loads, from 2-1/4-inch up to the potent 3-1/2-inch Magnum without adjustment. For reliability and performance, no other 3-1/2-inch semi-auto in its price range compares.

At the heart of the Stoeger M3500 is the proven Inertia Driven operating system; simple and efficient with only three moving parts in the bolt for lightning-fast, reliable operation. Unlike older gas-system guns, the M3500’s Inertia Driven action is contained primarily within the receiver; giving the Stoeger M3500 a better more centered balance and swing. With no propellant gas venting into the action, the M3500 stays cleaner longer.

This Stoeger M3500's 28"" barrel is fitted with a ventilated, stepped rib and fiber-optic front sight for quick target acquisition, even under low-light hunting conditions. The alloy receiver is drilled and tapped and includes a Weaver-style scope base. All M3500’s come supplied with four choke tubes (Extra-full turkey, Full, Modified, and Improved-Cylinder), shim kit for drop and cast adjustment, and a threaded steel recoil reducer that can be installed in the buttstock to help manage felt recoil from heavy Magnum loads.

A bone stock used CETME will cost you around $750 in the OEM wood furniture. The HK sliding stock cost me $260, another $75 for the tri-rail, $60 for the wood pistol grip, $60 for the steel 30 round CETME mag, $30 each for the CETME steel mags and five bucks each for the HK aluminum mags. 

I'm into this rifle for $1325. 

FIRST $800 CASH THAT CAN MEET ME THE FASTEST IN SOUTH HILL GETS IT! That's a whammer of a deal!

I will trade at $1000 for something interesting. Let me know what you have"

- Savage Stainless steel trigger guard ($20)
- McGowen 26"" Stainless steel match Bull barrel (1:8 twist) ($300)

- SWFA 12x Scope ($260)

The barrel, recoil lug, and barrel nut were installed by a professional gunsmith, along with having the barrel and tang free floated as well as the action and recoil lug bedded. Rifle has seen only about a box and a half of ammo (30 rounds) through it. After sighting it in at 200, I was making less than 3 inch groups at 500 yards. With the factory rifle itself costing $450, I have around $1650 (not including gunsmith costs) invested into this bolt action. With some new medical emergencies coming up recently, I must part with this rifle. Asking $1,300 as this is barely even used. Sorry for the crappy cell phone pic, I can send better ones on request."

594,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3092594,For Sale:  270 bullets,"50 miles south of Topeka, Topeka, Kansas",$ 100,"Listed On: Sunday, July 13, 2014",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"These are mostly vintage and from an OLD collection-- some are slightly tarnished by age, but none have any corrosion or any issues that would effect performance.  These are dating back into the 70's and so here is the list:

34 130 grain Nosler BTSP (early 80s)
88 Herters 130 grain ""semi-points"" (early 70s and probably made by Sierra back then)
16 Winchester 130 grain HP (mid 70s)
71 Remington 130 grain mushroom corelokt HPs. (mid 80s)
105 Hornady ""interlock"" spire points (Mid 80s)
100 Sierra ""Game King"" 150 grain (boat tails from mid 2000s)

409 total and all are premium bullets in the two ""darling"" hunting (larger) weights for the .270 (130 gr and 150 gr).

Most are in the original boxes that have been taped (clear taped) to keep them from falling apart over the years.  They are clearly older, but there is very little oxidation on even the Herters (which look pretty good for their 40 or so years of age).  The Noslers and Sierra Game Kings are wrapped in clear plastic bags with ID tags in the bags.  

I live out of KC but come to town often and a meeting on a weekend would work.  Price and effort reflects a full lot purchase here at an agreed to date and time ON A WEEKEND somewhere in eastern Kansas OR a local pick-up in and around Emporia, KS.  I also have some .224 and some 7mm bullets I'd throw in for an additional, fair cost... but this lot needs to sell together please (cleaning out the closet here).  If someone wanted them shipped, a flat rate $10 box gets these to them.

For another $25 I'll also toss in a bag of 100 MORE Gamekings 150gr. bullets... which is costing way more than this lately-- no pics, sorry.

Send and email and be patient, I'll reply to all sincere emails.  Thank you."

I picked this AK up not too long ago to turn into a lightweight recon/trunk gun and only got so far before realizing that I need another AR... One just isn't cutting it and want to go another direction. 

This WASR is your typical century build, it shoots straight and is sighted in but the parkerized finish isn't the best. But, it is built correctly and all the rivets are up to par and it functions like an AK should - even feeds soft point rounds which some AK's don't like. All the numbers match except for the bayonet. Front sight is barely canted but was easily sighted in, everything else is very reasonably straight for a WASR... Don't expect a KREBS or Waffen Werks. The mag well has no problems with any magazine that I have on hand from steel to magpul PMAGS even the chunky US palm mags. 

To shave some weight I added a saiga gas tube which doesn't have the extra sheet metal for the gas tube hand guard and I also have the original with a matching lower wood handguard I have both set ups pictured. 

Underfolders are hard to find right now, so I won't be giving this away - I will let it go for the best reasonable cash offer or, preferably I would like to trade this for a Nice upper level AR and I am willing to throw in a decent amount of cash ontop. 

So, please no low-ball offers, you will be ignored. I want an upper level AR, especially a piston version. I will throw in a few hundred bucks on top for your AR some of which I will list below. Cash wise, let's just say I would like to see more than $700 for the rifle."

Make yours worth more or just have an extra to port or use on a G30 to thread/compensate/supress. I also have the competition rail which was cnc aluminum billet that floats above your pistol by attaching to an accessory rail below for a red dot optic that does'nt reciporocate or bang around the optic itself. Enables you to still have visible sights incase your red dot goes dead or breaks.
This OEM barrel replacement would be around 120.00 and the rail cost me 79.99. I used the rail until I learned a different shooting style that I prefer. Still in excellent shape.

The Walther PPS, short for Police Pistol Slim, is a semi-automatic pistol developed by Walther of Germany for concealed carry for civilians and plainclothes law enforcement personnel. A self-defense handgun does no good if it is miles away when you need it. The PPS is a concealed carry firearm that is slim, light and comfortable to wear all day long. Yet it is fast to bring into action, pleasant to fire, and easy to shoot accurately. The Walther PPS is short recoil-operated locked breech and uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the venerable Hi-Power pistol. The PPS has a lightweight glass fiber-reinforced polymer frame with integrated steel slide rails. The frame also has an integrated Picatinny rail for attachment of tactical lights or lasers.The slide is steel with a resilient Tenifer nitride treatment, offering extreme resistance to wear, impact, and corrosion. Low profile three dot combat sights make rapid target acquisition easy and the rear sight is windage-adjustable. Two magazines are included, and this pistol ships in a Walther branded padded hard case.

BERETTA 

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. 

. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged. 

. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 

. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer. 

. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. 

. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol. 

. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. 

. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy. 

. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released. 

. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop. 

. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

BERETTA 

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. 

. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged. 

. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 

. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer. 

. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. 

. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol. 

. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. 

. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy. 

. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released. 

. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop. 

. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

There is no better made, no more rugged and reliable, no more trusted security shotgun then the Remington 870 Wingmaster. This is a gem of a shotgun was formerly part of an armored transport arsenal so it has seen a lot of cycling without a lot of wear on the barrel. The armorer installed rifle sights on the 18” smooth cylinder bore barrel which makes it the shortest barrel I have seen that will put a slug right where you want it (and maybe the only shotgun of its kind for sale anywhere in the country). This shotgun shows handling but is in fantastic mechanical condition. Most of the furniture shown also shows use except for the black synthetic Remington set which is like new. I am looking for $450 for a basic setup +$ depending on whether you want the Mesa Tactical 8rd side saddle and/or Surefire M951 weapon light with infrared filter and remote switch on vertical grip (will provide extra set of CR123 batteries in the grip). Sorry for the forward grip and Surefire remote switch not being shown with the Knoxx Spec Ops setup, it is currently off playing with friends, you will have to use your imagination. If you don’t want to be limited to a single set of furniture I highly encourage buying her a 2’nd or 3’rd pair of cloths (we can work out a deal for additional stocks and fore ends). The wood stock for instance has a high cheek rise specifically for these sights which makes for natural and intuitive aiming though it would need the fore end trimmed if you want to use a side saddle. If you wanted to invest in a Cerakote job this could be your ultimate shotgun, or if you like a workhorse that shows its grit then it’s perfect for you now."

SIG SAUER P 226 NITRON 9 MM, ACCESSORY RAIL, NIGHT SIGHTS AND 2 MAGAZINES 


The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

SIG SAUER P 226 NITRON 9 MM, ACCESSORY RAIL, NIGHT SIGHTS AND 2 MAGAZINES 


The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

I took a general pic of all the glocks together, if you want to see something specific then let me know.

that shitty plywood), end plate (which makes it safe to shoot without
any buttstock), new Classic flash hider on the threaded barrel,
original AK sights with flip up front and rear built on, gas shut off

grenade launcher sights. I paid 1200 for the rifle (with reciept), and another 60 for the new chrome fast fire
piston, and 18 for the new flash hider
AT THIS POINT your probably wondering why I paid 1200 for this ak.
BECAUSE this AK has a certificate of authentication for being signed by General Makhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov himself in june of 2013 before his death in december 2013
also have more pics

It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. 

The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. 

The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. 

To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox comes equipped with an accessory rail.

You can easily switch back to the original FN lower if you'd rather use the OEM mags. I prefer the metal one though. It also comes with a Timney trigger installed on the Handl lower(which is the best you can buy). You also get the real (non-knock-off) Grip Pod seen in pics. It comes with the extended and much better charging handle. You also get the Hi-Desert Dog modified Hogue grip with battery storage built in. It comes with a Vltor flashlight mount AND the 500 lumen Surefire Hellfire light (when holding the grip pod your thumb is right there ready to hit the light). Don't forget, you also get the AAC flash hider (of course the original SCAR muzzle is included too). You get 5 FN factory 20rd mags and 1 10rd Magpul SR-25 mag.

MORE POWER PER SQUARE INCH

It’s a .45ACP that holds 10+1 rounds — but you’d hardly know it from the thinness of the grip. 

Take hold of this high-power, high-capacity pistol and you’ll see first-hand how we’ve stacked the odds in your favor. 


- Full-size and carry lengths 
- Fits most holsters designed for P220R and P226R 
- .45 ACP Double stack magazines 
- 14 Round extended magazine available 
- Double-action/Single-action 
- Integral accessory rail 

The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. 

The P227® Equinox is a .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER® Custom Shop master gunsmiths. 

It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. 

The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. 

The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. 

To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox comes equipped with an accessory rail.

I have only put about 200 rounds through it, a variety of FMJ and JHP without any issues. It is in excellent condition comes with 3 10rd mags and 3 16 round sets of repair parts for law enforcement or out of state shipment (where legal).

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand.

SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

THE 1911 LOOKS IN A SMALL CALIBER .22LR 

The 1911 in .22 caliber connects original design with an innovating concept. On one hand we stuck to existing design and measurements, this means a development with “Mil-Spec” specifications in inches. On the other hand we added additionally the magazine safety, drop safety and firing pin safety to meet present safety standard. Sport shooting without any compromises is assured.

You can easily switch back to the original FN lower if you'd rather use the OEM mags. I prefer the metal one though. It also comes with a Timney trigger installed on the Handl lower(which is the best you can buy). You also get the real (non-knock-off) Grip Pod seen in pics. It comes with the extended and much better charging handle. You also get the Hi-Desert Dog modified Hogue grip with battery storage built in. It comes with a Vltor flashlight mount AND the 500 lumen Surefire Hellfire light (when holding the grip pod your thumb is right there ready to hit the light). Don't forget, you also get the AAC flash hider (of course the original SCAR muzzle is included too). You get 5 FN factory 20rd mags and 1 10rd Magpul SR-25 mag. I'm also including all of the rail covers to protect your new gun."
