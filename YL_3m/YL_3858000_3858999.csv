* Blackhawk QD sling attachment mount.
* Red Star Arms Adjustable trigger group which I have configured the travel and reset to be about 1/8th travel and the break is about 3 pounds 11 ounces. Amazing trigger for an ak..

* 1000 Rounds of WOLF steel case  123gr hollow points in a unopened case.

This rifle was put together with love, It is one of the highest quality aks that have come to market and every accessory that it's coming with is top notch. I hate to sell this bad boy but I'm at a point in life where ownership of something this over the top is becoming more of a dust collector than a hard use tool. This rifle I'm asking CASH only. I am pricing this rifle at $2500, So considering I have roughly $3100+ in it, I'm saving you over $600 if you were to buy all of this new. this is a really good deal on a not very used rifle that Blackwater PMC love to be running..."

So I baught this gun from my dad and did a few upgrades to it.
And I know it's a jennings and I knew that they are usually only worth a few hundred bucks if they are in great condition.  From what I reserched.  This is like the 3rd generation.  But other than that
Shoots very well.  Allison and carry did a full tune up.
Put in brand new trigger assembly.
Brand new spring and firing pin
Brand new match grade barrel. (Ejection port was pollished)
Pollished barrel
Allison and carry shaved and pollished the slide. So it slides and chambers a round faster.  Comes with one mag with ammo.  I have a black hawk holster for it as well.

Like I said before. I did my reserch on these guns.  They are not expensive and have had issues.
(I fixed all the issues) put in 367.00 and some change into this hand gun. So I made it RELIABLE..AND SAFE. So you can carry it as well as have it rdy in you night stand.
It is a full stainless steel gun.  Has a little weight to it.  But after all the work and money into it.  It's actually a pretty cool little 9mm.

The result is a stunning, deep relief scroll and ribbon, full coverage engraved action that is enhanced by an upgraded extra deluxe grade of Turkish walnut. The Maxum Trap excels on the trap line too. The Dynamic Tuning System, featuring an adjustable rib and comb system, allows any shooter to customize the gun to their shooting style. As with all of our trap models, the Maxum can be ordered with a factory release trigger and left hand stock as an option.NOT INTERESTED IN TRADE"

In minutes, without tools, it will go from 5.56mm to 6.8mm to 6.5mm by swapping the bolt head, barrel and magazine. With an exchange of stocks, barrels and accessories, it transforms from a close quarters weapon to a designated marksman platform. Simply put, the Bushmaster ACR is the highest evolution of modular rifle utility. This rifle is built specifically for law enforcement and tactical applications - with Bushmaster's unrivaled standards for durability and precision. They've nearly doubled barrel life and reduced maintenance with the addition of an innovative protective coating. This is also featured on action components for dramatically reduced wear and enhanced operation. For the ultimate blend of strength and reduced weight, they used rugged, high density composite for the hand guard, lower receiver and stock. The heart of the ACR is their gas piston operating system. It's torture tested and proven reliable in the most brutal conditions on the planet. From the magazine release and fire selector to the non reciprocating charging handle, ambidextrous controls optimize user effectiveness. Add Bushmaster's hallmark commitment to quality down to the slightest ingredient, and you have a platform that's a natural fit for any operator and every mission.

I have for trade a brand new Custom gaming computer. Freshly built with windows 7.9 Pro. This thing rates 7.9 out of 7.9 on the computer speed test by microsoft. It will run any game on max graphics. I realized shortly after building it it was way too much for what I use a computer for. Here are a list of parts. I have the boxes for all the parts as well as a receipt showing when I purchased it. 

27"" 2560x1440 HD monitor
AMD goldx3 Space Edition
GA-990FX Motherboard
HIS IceQ X² Turbo Boost Clock H270XQMT2G2 Radeon R9 270X 2GB Graphics Card

AMD Fx-8350 Black edition 8 Core Processor
G.Skill Sniper 16gb DDR3 Ram
Kingston 120gb SSD
Western Digital 1 TB HDD

I will also include a brand new Microsoft sidewider gaming keyboard and a gaming mouse with a mouse pad. 

All of this stuff is brand new and if you do the parts list you will come out around $1000 just in internal parts. The monitor was around $500, $100 microsoft keyboard plus corsair case and opperating system. You will see to build this machine it would cost around $1700 all said and done without labor. The monitor alone is around $500.
Here are some screenshots of tests ran on http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ It has over the recommended specs for running games even as intense as Crysis 3!!!!

SF models have a smaller area where your thumb hooks around the grip making it much more comfortable than the average glock. This frame is also interchangeable with slides from other glocks from the compact family. So if you have one but want to shoot your smaller and cheaper calibers and have a sf model for carrying it's a neat system

I have read about and watched people shoot 40 cal ammo from a glock 20(10mm), I never have though.

It still has the factory gold grease on the slide. The rear site has a small blemish as seen in the pics below.  The night sites are Trijicon brand and are at about 50% brightness, but still work great at night.  The gun comes with two 13 round law enforcement marked magazines and the tupperware style Glock box with all the factory supplied goodies.  The only modifications that have been done to this gun are the trigger return spring was changed from the NY1 spring (8lb trigger pull) to a standard trigger return spring (5.5lb pull).  I will gladly return it to the original configuration if you wish and I will definitely include the original spring in the trade.  

I'm looking to trade because this gun is really too big for my hands.  I'm not interested in selling at this time and if the right trade doesn't come along, I will keep it.  I have my CCW permit and I expect any trade partners to have a CCW permit or pistol purchase permit, as required by law."

All LWRCI carbine systems feature their short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of LWRCI's rifles, the bolt carrier group of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts"

This shotgun is in like new condition with only four shells through it.  If you are not familiar with this shotgun it is made in Turkey by the same factories that make the Canik CZ75 clones and TP9, Winchester SXP, and many other quality firearms.  This is a 5+1 pump action that will chamber 3 inch shells.  Has a built in recoil pad and pistol grip, as well as a nice set of fiber optic ghost ring sights, a receiver mounted picatinny rail, a removable breacher choke, and is VERY lightweight.  This is a Benelli pattern shotgun and will accept extended benelli magazine tubes.  Very similar to a Benelli M3 (sans the semi auto functionality) for a fraction of the cost.

In great shape but Ive had a few shotguns with pistol grips and ring sights and Ive found that I prefer a straight stock with a bead sight.  This shotgun retails for $299, Id like to trade it for a similalrly priced 12 gauge shotgun with a straight stock, bead sight, and 18-20 inch cylinder bore barrel, such as a Remington 870, Mossberg 500/maverick 88, winchester sxp, or similar.  Only looking for combat/hd style shotguns, absolutely not interested in field guns, sorry.

This gun was reworked probably in 1943 at the Inglestodt arms depot and reissued with the HZAJT20 stamp. At that time the breech would have been switched out with the current DWM toggle and the German Imperial Navy breech. The breech itself is very rare and sought after. All numbers match except firing pin and left grip which has an S/42 stamp. Original barrel with original strike marks and 655 acceptance stamp. The clips are non numbers matching, one is FXO P.08 with straight-wing 37 acceptance marks. The other is a WW1 clip with wooden base. The takedown tool is droop wing marked with I believe a 63 number. Holster is stamped 1915  H. Muller & Co, Offenbach a.M. and is in very good shape. You can tell this pistol has spent many years in this holster. The belt is in almost perfect shape with RZM 119 buckle markings signifying manufacture in Pforzheim by Eugen Schmiedhausler. Belt was not worn very long, the number 277 was inked stamped and still very visible along with hand inscriptions in German that I can make out but can't read and appear to be the owner's unit. I've researched this pistol through experts and these are the facts as I understand them. Please don't email just to tell me I'm wrong about any research, only contact me if you are interested in buying the gun. Lugers had many different variations and I don't claim to know everything. My photo files are too big to load so only one picture will be in the ad. Please ask and I will send you pics, I have a lot of them. Will take $1600 cash no trades or BS please."

I am looking at trading my Glock 23 for a Sub-Compact pistol. I like my 23, but plan on carrying soon and would like something smaller. I'd like to trade for anything of lesser value and you can put money on top. So Kel-Tecs + cash, etc. Or If you have a nice Kahr, S&W Shield, SR9, LC9 or any other sub-compact in that class I will do even trade depending on the value. Will entertain 17hrm rifles plus cash or 223 bolt plus cash.

The Truth with ClearShot technology provides instantaneous feedback on your shot clearance. This advanced laser technology takes the guess work out of archery shots, even allowing hunters the ability to no longer worry about clipping branches or hitting other obstructions, and with a simple three-step process, you can calibrate the rangefinder to correspond with the speed of the bow through the sight system. When done and a target is ranged, a dot is displayed to show the max height your arrow will travel. The Truth with ClearShot ranges out of 850 yards with a ""shoots like"" distance of 200 yards, and it even shows the angle of your shot in the process. All that, combined with our exclusive Angle Range Compensation (ARC), make this the ultimate rangefinder for bow hunters. 3-Volt CR123 battery included.

I don't have exact count, but have probably put between 20 -30 rounds through it (3 or 4 or so each deer season for last 6 years). The gun speaks for itself, and if you are shopping for this quality of firearm there probably isn't much I can tell you that you don't already know. That said, happy to answer any questions or send additional pics if needed. 

In my opinion I would call the condition nearly perfect with just a few minor ""scrapes /scuffs"" with branches when walking through woods.
