I bought the gun new a couple years back & used it for deer hunting in shotgun territory, but now that I can use a rifle everywhere I just don't have a need for it anymore.  The gun has MAYBE 200 rounds through it, and is in 95% or better condition.  It's very, very accurate.  with 158gr factory loads it will put rounds on top of one another at 15 yards, and I've sighted it in out to 50yds with the Hornady FXTs I used for hunting.  I'll throw in a full set of reloading dies & whatever brass I have around too.

As I mentioned, I would prefer to do a trade as I am always interested in seeing what's out there. If you've got something to trade, even if it is worth more than the revolver, make an offer! I am willing to do cash+the gun if you've got something I want.  I will take $500 cash FIRM for it, but again would prefer to trade.

Shoot me an email if you are interested, the worst I can do is say no. WI drivers license required for the deal, CCW license would be ideal."

Due to me buying to many guns lately, I am going to but one of my 1911's up for sale to replenish the gun money. This is a very nice SA ""loaded"" 1911. It is used, and I bought it used so I am not sure of the round count. It doesn't look like much though. The guy I bought this off of said he had it sent back to Springfield for their custom fit/reliability package. I do not have the paperwork for the work though. It does shoot awesome, and the slide to frame fit is very tight. It has night sights that are still nice and bright. It will come with an older style blue case and 1 SA 7rd mag.

The only reason I'm doing this right now is to pay for repairs on a vehicle that was in an accident mid last week, so I'm not going to be able to entertain any trade requests or drop the price as I'm already losing almost $300 to sell it quickly. First things first, here are the specs on the 1911 from the factory:

Caliber: .45 Auto
Magazine: 7+1
Barrel: Stainless
Twist: 1-16 LH
Overall Length: 8.5""
Overall Height: 5.5""
Trigger Pull: 3.5 - 5 lbs.
Finish: Satin Black Oxide
Grips: Double Diamond Walnut
Avg. Wt. (oz.): 38.5
MSRP: $729.00

With that said and done I'll tell you that a lot of time and energy has gone in to this weapon since I received it a month ago in trade, including a trigger job. The feed ramp has been polished, the barrel has been polished and throated. The base of the firing pin stop has been polished. The trigger bow has been polished and the trigger channel deburred. The sear and disconnector have been deburred and polished on the surfaces that required it. The sear spring has been polished and adjusted slightly.

With all the smithing out of the way on to the Wilson Combat parts that were fitted and installed: hammer, wide competition thumb safety, competition match trigger, beavertail. It comes with Pearce Grip rubber side panel grips. This firearm also has a match grade barrel installed in it. All in all what I have in to this weapon is nearly $950 when all things are said and done, not including what you'd normally spend on a gunsmith to do a trigger job and polish all the internals. which can easily be $75-150 depending on who you use. The only flaw is a small scratch next to the magazine release from the previous owner, but I had eventually planned to cerakote the frame in FDE and toss desert digital grips on it, so it didn't bother me. It has just about 200rds through it and it can run everything I put in to it. It's run Federal aluminum, TulAmmo steel, Winchester white box, and Remington gold saber without a single hiccup. This weapon is a super reliable tack driver now and would be great for home defense or EDC. I'm former law enforcement and do some firearm instruction and I would trust the lives of my family to it, it's that reliable.

I'm asking $650 out the door for this weapon and it will come with all the original stock parts, hard plastic Remington case, and two 7rd magazines. I will also require a valid FL driver's license and a bill of sale to be signed to protect both parties. If you have any questions or would like to see more pictures, please contact me. If you're going to offer less than I'm asking or to trade, please don't waste either of our time, this is a heck of a deal and it makes me sick to sell my project gun, but need outweighs toys.

Have a good one!"

This loading features a flash suppressed powder, so if you need to shoot in low light, you won't be blinded by your own gun fire and this is a useful tactical advantage since around 95% of all civilian shootings in the US happen in low light while the criminal element is out and about.  Our use of a hard cast bullet, with a flat nose, can best be understood if you'll read our technical article on ""The Use of Expanding Bullets in Small Defensive Cartridges,"" posted under the ""Technical Articles"" category on our home page.

Further, please note that the use of hard cast bullets (not lead but, Hard Cast) does NOT cause lead fouling in the polygonal rifling's used in all 9X18 Makarov pistols.  For more information, please see our technical articles entitled ""Hard Cast Bullets in Polygonal Barrels"" and ""Dangers of Pure Lead Cowboy Bullets"". We found no appreciable leading in any of our Makarov test guns. It should also be noted that all of our test guns functioned and fed flawlessly with this load. We also experienced very good to excellent accuracy in all test guns.

Please note the real world velocities listed below from real world 9X18 Makarov pistols. At Buffalo Bore we always use real, ‘over-the-counter’ firearms for our published velocities, as we feel the use of laboratory test barrels that give false, high velocities does the customer a disservice as each customer needs to know what their carry ammo will really do on-the-street in a real world situation.

For sale is the cleanest Gen 4 Glock 19 9mm available here on Armslist. See description below of modifications made and extras included.

My estimate is about 400 rounds down range, barely broken in and ready for a new home.

Gen 4 Glock 19 9mm

Custom extended Slide Stop Release
See attached pic for the retail price I paid for all of this.

I also have a Veridian C5L Green Dot Laser with Tactical Light that came with custom holster that I paid $329 for. I don't need to sell the laser, it is a universal compact so I can attach it to one of my others but I thought I would add it to the posting in case anyone is interested. If you want the laser too add $175 to the price.

Also, if you need 9mm ammo, I will sell it to you for $13 a box.

This weapon has been well thought out for all your home defense needs as well as varmint eradication and small game take down. 
I will throw in four 30 round magazines, approximately 300 rounds and an ammo case. This is not a weapon you can run out and buy. It has been put together by knowledgable and caring hands. 
Since this is not an auction site I will start by asking $1500.00 and we will see where it ends. 

As is always the case with anything I have offered for sale I must say, ""NO TRADES"". 
I do not want your grandmothers long lost secret recipe for peanut brittle wrapped inside Marilyn Monroe's bra strap which happened to be found inside JFK's wallet when he so tragically died. 
First come first serve. Married men needing permission from your wife should ALWAYS remember, ""It is easier to get forgiveness than it is to get permission."" If you never get either? At least you'll have a great firearm to guide you to your deer stand deep in the woods far away from the nagging and It's far better than the dog house in my opinion. 
As I said before I am starting the asking price at $1500.00 and will take any serious offer but please understand I want to end it as close to the asking price as possible. This may or may not happen but we can always wish for the impossible and hope for the best. That being said I do understand how this goes, ask for the highest price and go down from there. So a little wiggle room was thought of when thinking of this price.  Don't be afraid to throw me a price, all I can do is say no right? Last time I looked my Go-Go Gadget Bit$h Slapping Arm was deemed in-operable at extreme long distances so you're good as long as your bid isn't TOO outrageous. 
This weapon is in excellent to fair condition and has been used to eliminate numerous terrorist threats. By terrorist threats I mean to say I have hundreds of Usama Targets and I am the man that shot him and not just three times either. Where's MY medal? 
Yes you can own the very weapon that was used to eradicate terror and bring security to our great nation. Okay so the last paragraph is nothing but BS but you took the time to read it so I must have your attention by now. 
This weapon is awesome and I really don't want to sell it but necessity trumps everything.

ArmaLite is known for its history of innovation.  Its Special Purpose Rifle (SPR)
has proved it for years.  Now, the introduction of the ArmaLite SPR Mod 1 proves
it once more, in spectacular fashion.  The SPR Mod 1 is forged, one-piece upper
receiver/rail system with exclusive detachable side and bottom rails.
In true ArmaLite fashion, the SPR Mod 1 is like no other on the market.  With other one-piece systems, you're stuck forever with the rails you get at purchase, and stuck with their limits.

But ArmaLite knows you and your firearm often have more than one mission, and you want options.  ArmaLite gives you just that.  The SPR Mod 1's three o'clock, six o'clock, and nine o'clock rails are detachable.  That's right, you can change your 1913 rails to fit your changing needs for sights... lights...lasers...grips...or swivels.

ArmaLite takes that versatility even further.  Each SPR Mod 1 comes with three extra rails standard, at no extra cost.  We give you a 1913 rail with quick detchable sling swivel hole.  Each rifle comes with a low insert for when you need a bare rail with a low profile.  There's also a plain insert with a quick detach sling swivel hole.  Changing your rails...your add-ons...and your SPR Mod 1... is as easy as turning a torque wrench.

Ingenious versatility isn't the only reason you'll want an SPR Mod 1.  Its one-piece construction offers you a continuous optic platform (COP).  There's no gap to bridge between receiver and upper rail when you're installing your scope or sights.  This one-piece construction also gives the sighting platform extra rigidity.  It's a good, strong backbone.  That means your sights will stay zeroed in the most trying conditions.

The SPR Mod 1 typifies the ""ArmaLite Standard of Excellence.""  With us, quality comes standard.  There's no extra charge for: the SPR Mod 1's chrome lined, chrome moly vanadium steel barrel; its two-stage tactical trigger; the patented, extra strength steel bolt assembly; or the hard coated finish.  These are all things that the other companies consider options at an added cost.

The introduction of the new ArmaLite SPR Mod 1 is truly a new chapter in our history of innovation and our dedication to the quality you deserve.

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 14 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

The SIG SAUER® P232® is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 Stainless is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 23oz in the stainless version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today.

P232 stainless with SIGLITE® Night Sights comes with Hogue finger groove rubber grips. The stainless model with contrast sights come with polymer factory grips.

The Beretta Model 1934 is a compact, semi-automatic pistol which was issued as a standard service firearm to the Italian armed forces beginning in 1934. It is chambered for the 9 mm Corto, more commonly known as the .380 ACP.

Fitted with the characteristic Beretta open slide, the M1934 has a very reliable feeding and extraction cycle; the elongated slot in the top of the slide acts as the ejection port. It is made with relatively few parts and very simple to maintain. The M1934 is very robust in construction with a long service life if properly maintained.

The magazine capacity is only 7 rounds. When the empty magazine is removed it no longer holds the slide back. The slide will come forward and close the gun unless it is held open by application of the safety, a separate operation, and this slows down the reloading of the pisto"
