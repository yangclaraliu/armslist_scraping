The Franchi SPAS12 is a combat shotgun manufactured by Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000. Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the United States. The SPAS12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS12 was sold to military and police users worldwide,[1] on the civilian market, and has been featured in many movies, TV shows and video games.
The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS12 initially led to its ""Military"" designation as a Combat Shotgun. The SPAS12 was designed from the ground up as a rugged military shotgun and it was named the (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun). In 1990 Franchi renamed the shotgun to the (Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun), this allowed continued sales to the U.S. as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban, imports of SPAS12 shotguns were stopped into the United States. In September 2004 the ban had expired, but Franchi had ended production in 2000."

The following bills are scheduled to be heard in the House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee at 1:30 P.M. in Room 271 in the State Capitol Building:

House Bill 1009, introduced by state Representative Steve Humphrey (R-48), would repeal the rights-infringing legislation passed into law during the 2013 legislative session that arbitrarily limits the number of rounds of ammunition you can use to protect yourself and your family to 15.

House Bill 1049, introduced by state Representative Justin Everett (R-22), would extend the protection and right to self-defense you currently have in your home, to your place of business.

House Bill 1050, introduced by state Representative Janik Joshi (R-16), would repeal the ineffective and onerous private transfer background check law that passed during the 2013 legislative session.

House Bill 1086, introduced by state Representative Patrick Neville (R-45), would mandate the timely transfers of certain lawful firearms by chief law enforcement officers to individuals once they have passed a background check.

House Bill 1127, introduced by state Representative Gordon Klingenschmitt (R-15), would admonish business owners who permit lawful concealed carry on their premise from any civil liability if an action were to take place.

The following bills are scheduled to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee at 1:30 P.M in Senate Committee Room 356:

Senate Bill 32, introduced by state Senator Vicki Marble (R-23), would allow all law-abiding Colorado residents to legally carry concealed without having to possess a concealed carry permit.  This bill would also keep in place the current permitting system so that people who obtain a permit would still enjoy reciprocity in states around the country when legally carrying concealed.

Senate Bill 86, introduced by state Senator Kent Lambert (R-9), would repeal the egregious legislation passed in 2013 that requires a background check for the private transfer of a firearm between law-abiding citizens.

It is critical that you call and email the members of these two key committees and respectfully voice your support for these bills TODAY.  Please ask these legislators to vote YES to these bills and send them to the floor of their respective chamber.

Cleaned after every range trip and oiled regularly. Comes with original box, single 7 rd mag, two 8 rd mags, and a hybrid horsehide/kydex holster from Ozark Holster Company.

Ideal for law enforcement, home defense, or concealed carry, the Kimber Pro Carry II Pistol combines Kimber quality with a lightweight aluminum frame and full-length grip for maximum control while shooting. A lightweight pistol ideal for carrying 24/7, this 1911-style handgun is built around a lightweight aluminum frame machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. The Pro Carry II's steel slide and match grade steel 4'' bushingless bull barrel aids concealability while still delivering Kimber accuracy. Full-length guide rod. Fixed low profile sights. Green textured synthentic grips. Extended thumb safety and beavertail grip safety for fast positive action.

This Kimber has been my daily carry for 1.5 years and shows some light wear as a result. Still in very nice condition. Does NOT come with the holster shown in the pics."

I bought this a couple weeks ago (used), ran 50 rounds through it, and decided I'm not manly enough.  :(

However, if you're a red meat eating, hairy chested, dually driving brute, then this is the rig for you! Guaranteed to impress your friends on Facebook and send everyone else on the firing line cringing for cover and holding their ears after the first shot.

Comes with 4 mags and about 110 rounds of Hornaday 300gr jacketed hollow points, plus about 50 rounds of brass. I also have the holster for it. I'm not sure how to ship the ammo, so you gotta bear with me on that one.

Shoots awesome groups when you can keep from flinching. Condition is pretty good. These black models are prone to surface rust, but this one has survived pretty well so far. Shows some light holster wear and use. Nothing offensive, just trying to give full disclosure for no rude surprises. 

payment via PP gift or USPS MO only 

Price is $1200 local preferred. I will ship on your dime, payment in advance. I have lots of + feedback on ar15.com and theakforum.net username mustangduckk. Feel free to look it up."

The bluing is starting to turn a nice patina has a small amount of bluing wear at the tip of the muzzle.. The Bolt is bright and clean and the sights are original. The bore and rifling look great and the stock is rock solid with not gouges or cracks. The butt pad is original and undamaged. It has the correct walnut stock for this short barreled gun. The firing mechanism is 100% reliable and you can try it before you buy it. No missing or broken parts. This is a great opportunity to make a nice collectible and will make a perfect rifle for a young kid learning to shoot. I am not a dealer"

SpecterDR represents a revolution in optical sight design. The world's first truly dual field of view combat optical sight that combines the best of close and precision fire ranged combat features. SpecterDR switches instantly from 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight at the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes. Depending on the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a 1.5 MoA dot in the center. In 1x mode, the SpecterDR has by far the largest field of view in the industry. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN's legendary crystal clear image. Situational awareness in both magnifications is improved with ultra-wide viewing angles and unmatched viewing in low light conditions. SpecterDR is half the weight and twice the capability of carrying two scopes, without compromise to mission effectiveness or reliability. The SpecterDR offers the best single solution for both CQB and Long Range engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use."

Dillon Precision is famous for their high quality equipment and incredible NO BS lifetime warranty. Right from their website, ..... they don't care if you are the 1st owner or the seventeenth owner.... the equipment has a lifetime warranty that will go with the equipment where ever it goes. I can't think of any other company that stands behind their products and customers like this. They don't want serial numbers or registration cards.... they want to make it right, and right now. I have personally dealt with their customer care department and was very pleased and impressed. We discussed the issue, the customer care operator worked with me to troubleshoot an issue, two days later I had a brand new replacement part on my doorstep without paying a dime (for the part or for the shipping). I didn't even need to send back the old part. Needless to say, I can't say enough about their warranty policy. Second to none!

Reliable, revolvers don't jam.

Low recoil but packs a big punch, which is perfect for anyone sensitive to snappy recoil or who have a hard time pulling back (racking) a semi-auto's slide.

Shoots the .32 H&R Magnum, which is the ballistic equivalent to a .38 Special.

Guns that shoot the .32 H&R magnum can also shoot the shorter .32 S&W, .32 S&W Long and .32 Auto.

Pin type cylinder. This means, you have to pull the pin out to remove the cylinder.

Great for truck, garage, bed stand or toilet. You never want to be caught naked (without protection).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cleMs8xmqc

The SD series is a re-designed and re-engineered SW (Sigma). Fixed several problems. No more proprietary rail system, now has an industry standard Picatinny. No more long, gritty trigger pull, now smoother, less pull weight, less pull distance, faster reset. Simplified extractor system, now a bulletproof ""Rocker beam"" extractor. Better grip design. Better slide design (SD's fit any M&P holster). Better sights (and as I understand it, now both front AND rear sights are metal and M&P compatible, too!).

Included are all original parts, 2 - 16 rd magazines, manual, lock, and a mag loader.  Never had an issue with it, just selling it to finance another gun..."

Professional Grade Weaponry, by BCM®



Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. 



As a note: BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistent with these quality control procedures.



Cold Hammer Forged Barrels  
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFH™ series of barrels are made right here in the USA! (Just like all the BCM products.)



M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension  
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver  
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels. 



T-Marked Upper Receiver  
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 



USGI 1/7 Twist Rate 
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 



Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)  
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures. 



Chrome Bore and Chamber  
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a worldwide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 



Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish  
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 



5.56 NATO Chambers  
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 



Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases 
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 



Government Barrel Profiles  
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems. 



HPT / MP Inspected Barrels  
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as 



As a note: BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistent with these quality control procedures."

Flagged as ""very overpriced"". 
#1 I never put a price tag on it folks. I simple stated what I have in it ($1500.00) as for sale or trade......& all reasonable offers or trades considered. Translation.... I will consider less than what I have in it for a reasonable/fair trade...........Reading comprehension......if you don't understand, ask someone for help. 
#2 Do your research fellas. It's a quality rifle & I challenge you to duplicate it as it sits for less than what I had it listed for.....Oh wait I did not put a price tag on it, only what I have invested. 
#3 Don't get me wrong. I do appreciate the multiple cash offers of $650.00 or less from the white trash community, but that simply does not cover the cost or the upper.
#4 if you are looking to offer $650.00 for an AR don't look at this rifle. It's not for you. You need to be looking at an Olympic arms, del-ton or a core 15. I'm sure all fine products, but in my humble opinion not Spikes or BCM. 
#5 Ask you wife to hit the spell check before you send your ridiculous offers.
Appreciate your time.

Do you want to be able to hit a green peper at 600? This is the gun to make those dreams come true. I am selling this as a turn key 1000+ yard sniper rifle. this thing shoots like a lazer.

This beauty started life as a Remington 700 sps tactical .308, and has had a lot of money thrown at it to make everything about it way more accurate. I have shot this gun out to 1130yards on a 10 inch gong, it shoots great. My reason for selling it is getting out a bit further, as such I may trade for a quality 260 remington or a 6.5 creedmore.
This rifle spent a lot of time in sturgus being worked over by long rifle inc. They trued the action, fluted the bold, added the badger bolt ****, trued the bolt and firing pin, and as it shot good and i ran out of money re installed the factory bull barrel (varmint contour) I had them install it with break free to make my future barrel upgrade simpler.
Rifle specs are as follows:
.308 sps
polished chamber
trued action
bolt work
bell and carillon tactical medalist stock

comes with 110 rounds of custom tuned hand-loads made for this rifle, and a reloading recipe, but will shoot fggm 168gr into .5-.75in groups if you don’t hand load yet.

Will Sell for $200 as is with mil-spec trigger (6-8 lbs) or I will sell with a brand new, never fired, still in bag Rock River Arms National Match 2-stage trigger (3-4 lbs) for $275. I can install it prior to the sale or sell with it still in the bag for you to install if you wish to do it yourself, ensure that it is done right. RRA trigger is a simple install, push in two pins, disconnector is one piece so no annoying having to line up three holes like you do with a mil-spec trigger. The RRA trigger will replace the mil-spec trigger. So thats a brand spankin new $120 dollar match trigger for $75. The trigger is also for sale individually, I have it listed here for $100, I am only going to $75 on this to encourage a sale. You may buy the trigger separately, without the complete lower, for $100.

It is in very good condition with very minor wear on the barrel hood, and the left thumb safety. It has on SigLite night sights in addition to beautiful rosewood grips. It will also come with an OWB factory holster and hard case. In addition to the factory 6rd mag I have added a 7rd extended mag (which was $40) with pinky rest which makes it much more comfortable at the range. This is a great pistol I have only put 150rds of 115g fmj and 40rds of Speer gold dot 147g jhp down the pipe. This pistol has been well maintained and has had zero non-staged malfunctions so 100% reliable thus far. Its a very nice compact pistol with a great single action trigger which makes it extremely accurate for such a small package. The only reason I'm letting it go is its a bit small for what I like.

I am asking $585 cash or $620 trade value for the package with a meet in the Hendersonville area, I do also get to the Asheville area about one to two time a week if that helps. The only trade I am currently interested in is a new or like new Crimson Trace Lightguard for a Glock + cash of course. I will put the specs from Sig's website for this pistol below.

Tutorials

 Tutorials serve many purposes. It aims to help students needing additional help as well as those who seek to expedite their academic advancement through challenging materials focused on addressing certain academic areas. Tutorials are for everyone.  A common misconception we Filipinos have with regards to tutoring is (that) only students who are “weak” academically need tutorials.  While some students do seek tutorials because of “need”, even students who are already doing well in school can benefit from tutorials.  What must be realized is that there are several factors that contribute to a student’s inability to understand lessons inside the classroom or for a student not to perform well in spite of obvious intellectual capabilities.  Our Tutorials are meant to pinpoint those “cracks” in a school’s system by individualized programs that are tailored to specifically address concerns that are difficult, even impossible, to address in a classroom setting.
Times have changed. Technology enabled advancement in almost every field of learning. These changes are evident in curricula followed by schools around the world. Eureka, as one of the centers providing advance tutorials for some of the most rigorous programs in the world, including the International Baccalaureate Program, the Advance Placement Programs, and the IGCSE, belongs to an elite group of tutoring centers that offer higher level of instruction necessary to push the Philippines further and make it at par with the rest of the world. As evidence of this reputation, many of Eureka’s students are well known for their academic excellence.  Valedictorians, Salutatorians and honor students from well reputable international schools as well as elite local schools have trained and studied in Eureka in order to challenge themselves. Likewise, Eureka has witnessed remarkable transformations from students who used to be failing in school but have improved their grades significantly. These transformations have and continue to inspire us to continue our goals.
Eureka is one of the best tutorials centers in Paranaque and Metro Manila. This audacious claim is an assertion that we at Eureka can back with results. For years, Eureka Tutorial has consistently produced students who are matriculated to the best universities in the country and all over the world.

It is a phenomenally gorgeous rifle and a blast to shoot and I regret needing to sell it. I will be the first to say that this rifle is not for everyone, though! It is obviously not a genuine 1903A4 and that is precisely why I started with a 1903A3 so as to not ruin a rare piece of history that is every genuine 1903A4. You might be wondering why this rifle is priced as much/or more than an original then. The answer is simple: you get what you pay for.

Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

785,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3975785,For Sale/Trade:  RARE Colt M1911 A1 National Match Pistol,"Broken Arrow/Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma","$ 2,750","Listed On: Friday, January 30, 2015",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"RARE Colt M1911 A1 national match pistol. This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1943 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped to Springfield Armory in February of 1943. It was Issued to an enlisted serviceman at the time. (Trying to find out who it was issued to now through different channels.) There are specific clues on the gun that tell you who it MIGHT have gone to.. There is AA inscribed (Not stamped) on the ivory grips and on the frame Next to GHD. GHD is significant because Col. Guy H. Drewry inspected ordnance from June 17, 1942 to July 15, 1945 For COLT.

After having multiple collectors and Colt dealers at the gun show look at it. ""AA"" is believed to stand for ""All American"" 82nd Airborne. Which would match the dates the gun was issued, and the eagle carved on the Ivory grips. 82 Airborne was the first Airborne division in US Army history and had three major drops, made their first drop in July of 1943 to invade Sicily. Second was Salerno on 13 September 1943. The third was the invasion of Normandy Jun 1944.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by a gunsmith. At some point it was re-blued, and fixtures were 24k gold plated and Ivory grips added. It has been determined the gold was added many many years ago as some has worn off in spots. Bluing and finish is still very nice... Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. I have put 100 rounds through it and drives tacks. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

Its an original 1943 Remington-Rand M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (Only a few blood spots) According to the serial number this gun was shipped in April of 1943. It is stamped with  ""FJA"" inspector's mark.  FJA are the initials of Frank J. Atwood, inspector of ordnance.  The ""P"" proof mark is located near the magazine release and on top of the slide, in front of the rear sight. Cross cannons ordnance mark on the right rear of the frame, to the right of the hammer pin. ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY"" over the serial number with ""M1911A1 U.S. ARMY"" to the right of the slide stop pin. Also has the G marking on top of the frame next to the disconnector and P proof mark on top of the slide, in front of the rear sight. HS marked barrel.  HS is the marking of High Standard.

This gun is all original, and a wartime piece, as you can tell by the blood spots on the slide and grip. It also comes with original U.S. marked Military issued Holster. This gun still functions perfect, and feeds regular hard ball ammo without fail. A great collector piece for any WWII collection.
