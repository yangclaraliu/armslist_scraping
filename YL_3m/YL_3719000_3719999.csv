M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)

M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver

In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver

The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate

The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel

BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish

Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers

The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases

Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles

Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels

Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

>History_of_the_M1917_Revolver
>>>>>>>
The Colt M1917 Revolver was a New Service model with a cylinder bored to take the .45 ACP cartridge (like the M1911) and the half or full moon clips to hold the rimless cartridges in position. This model will also accept the .45 Long Colt cartridge. 

During its lifetime, the Colt New Service was the most popular revolver made by Colt. After World War I, the revolver gained a strong following among civilian shooters.

The Model 1917 was created to supplement insufficient stocks of M1911 pistols during World War I and was dropped from production in 1941"

The chrome lined barrel has a Century designed V-shaped Chevron muzzle brake, to dampen felt recoil, and at just over eight pounds (granted it is a milled receiver), the round isn’t going to push you around.  Instead of adjusting for windage from the front sight like other similar rifles, the rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation.  Other features include a buttstock that is 1 inch longer than military style stocks, for better comfort and handling.  The upper and lower handguard have four Picatinny rails which can be used to accessorize with red dot sights, scopes, lights, lasers and a fore grip.  Comes with three TAPCO 30 rd. mag’s (two fully loaded) and tactical case.

Function?  It’s an AK, which means it shot everything I had to feed it, shot to the sights, shot as well as you’d expect surplus ammo to shoot, and it never failed.

If sold ill need 500 cash no questions asked. This is a new gun only had 150 rds through the pipe. Its had stipple work done to it. It comes with trijicon hd night sigjts which are 2 weeks old. 2 mags original box and papers. Paid 580 for gun. Trijicon hds were 130 bucks so you do the math... this is the single stack 45 glock. Its a awesome ccw gun. Plain and simply I want a glock 23, I have the 22 and dont want 3 handguns. So same ammo would fit me better then 40 and 45. Anyways if ypu want some pics shoot me a text at 770 seven10 9174 and we can touch base. I dont require a bill of sale but I will need to run your serial number to make sure you have a clean gun and its not hot. Ive been tricked onxe so never again will I let that happen.

This is superb craftsmanship but I need to liquidate some of my assets to pay bills. Frankly, this is one of the best pistols I have ever laid my eyes on... and I consider it to be very unique with the striking two tone appearance. 

The original build date is 10/14/13 and I purchased the pistol brand new from my local dealer on January 8, 2014. This beauty comes with two test fire sheets (I had nighthawk install new front sights on 2/6/14 and they test fired it then) and the original night sight. 

So comes with all original paperwork, two brand new mags - never used - and extra front sight (that had a month of use)... and of course the original bag.

Again really hate to part ways with her...but have to raise the cash quickly to pay for bills. I guess my loss in your gain. PLEASE NO TRADES...Once again trying to raise funds. 

Price is $3050 shipped to your FFL. 

Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you so much for looking at the pistol. I hope she can find a good home with someone that can run her like she is meant to...."

There are a couple of small stains and one abraided hole (not projectile) in the rear panel which I've pictured. This vest was issued or procured by a U.S. defense contractor who was directed to remove all the military labeling which was apparently accomplished using a small blade which also cut the Kevlar pouch material in some places which I've also pictured. This does not affect the ballistic qualities and is largely a cosmetic defect that is not viewable when the vest is assembled and worn. Not all tags were removed and the remaining ones indicate the vest was manufactured 8/07 by Specialty Defense. Approximate weight is 14 pounds."

Comes with everything from the factory except the junk zero retention focus ripoff holster. Gave it to my brother for his xd 40 when he didn't have a holster. All three backstraps, small through large, small installed in an attempt to make the grip manageable for my wife. Turns out, the grip is still too big for her and the recoil doesn't agree with her. Double mag holder, mag loader, and some obligatory stuff - safety lock and bore brush. I have an extra rear site with built in laser that actually work pretty well. If you just use the gun for home defense or ""target practice"", it would be worth installing. I took it off for work because it snags on my uniform and could potentially ruin your draw and potentially end your life (if you're in a gun fight). I Have Two holsters, A Blackhawk Serpa and a Crossbreed super tuck. I use the serpa at work, private security,  and I use the crossbreed for concealed carry. If you don't know what crossbreed is, it's the original leather and kydex inside the waistband holster, adjustable ride depth, lifetime warranty. The pistol has been carried 40 hours a week on the job in a serpa holster for a year and a half so there is some wear on the slide's finish. It's not brand new or ""like new in box"" - which is a term idiots use to try and make people think there gun is worth more than it really is. I've put a couple hundred rounds through it and have never had an issue with any ammo from Speer gold dot to tulammo. Speaking of which, I have 60 or so target rounds and 39 hollow points for it.  

I would definitely like to get cash for this xdm. I get a discount at vances on glocks and s&w, so I could get a new g17 with three mags for $400 or m&p 9. That would leave me enough cash to purchase a holster and duty ammo. I wouldn't hesitate to do a trade if it is for one of the models I ask for below and three mags + serpa holster or cash to purchase what I need. I could have asked for more cash for this pistol but I'm not trying to make money - just switch from 45ACP to 9mm so my wife can safely operate all of the firearms in our home."

This rifle is in great shape. The wood has a great shine and no patchwork is present. All original stamped #s match, no line outs. The bluing is in fantastic shape for a rifle of this age. The original bolt comes with it plus the modified sniper bolt. The rifle is fitted with a special scope mount so you can use the fixed sights. Included is a cleaning kit and a NC Star 2-6x28 Scope with a scope cover. I threaded the barrel 1/2x28 and mounted a M14 Flash Hinder and Cerakoted it black. The trigger pull measures 4 1/2 pounds. this rifle looks well cared for and is rare..find. This is the only mosin made in low quantities and is not made for a bayonet attachment. he history of these rifles are a bit of mystery. The thought is that the 91/59 is a modified 91/30 made for Guards and Police. this is definitely a pluss for a mosin collection or an excellent hunters rifle. Hate to part with it.
