From the Manufacturer
Gunvault pistol safes are truly premium products that set the standard for the rest of the industry. Our patented No-Eyes Keypad and Biometeric pad provide lighting-quick access, even in the dark. Choose the Micro, Mini, Multi or Bio Vault when you need quick access storage for your handgun. We know that security and reliability are prevaling priorities when you need our products, and that's why gunVault pistol safes have the features you want: Improved high strength lock mechanism. Precise fittings virtually impossible to pry open with hand tools. Over 12 million user selectable access codes available. Audio feedback instantly confirms correct keypad entries. Audio disable feature allows ""stealth"" mode operation. Battery power for maximum security and easy portability. Tamper indicator notes invalid entry attempts. Built in computer blocks access after repeated invalid keypad entries. GunVault Biometric Technology: GunVault Bio uses biometrics, specifically fingerprint recognition, to access the safe contents. A high-performance algorithm is used to achieve speedy identification of enrolled fingerprints; and at the same time has a very low False Reject rate (FRR) for a given False Accept Rate (FAR). This self-learning algorithm of the GunVault Bio adds new minutiae to the fingerprint templates each time a user touches the finger print sensor, which decreases the likelihood of FRR, updates slight changes that might occur over time to an enrolled fingerprint, as well as to help distinguish variations. System can handle a maximum of thirty fingerprint templates between the enrolled fingerprint.

I have the override key, power cable, and a backup battery installed. You will just need to register your fingerprint. I do not have the original box, but will supply programming instructions. Feel free to ask any questions."

This already Custom Shop 1911 has been carefully customized further to make it a top-notch carry pistol.
It has been well-treated and maintained but does show some wear from carry and use.
The Series I CDP has very aggressive dehorning and a Series 70 fire control system.
Every 1911 is an individual and this one has proven to be extremely reliable and accurate.
The Rimfire Conversion Kit is incredibly accurate and functions very well.
Wilson Combat 1911 mags are the most reliable available.
The El Paso Saddlery carry gear allows this pistol and two ten-round mags to hide easily and carry comfortably.

I spent considerable time, effort and money to put this package together and hate to see it go but am looking to build another gun project. 
I am not desperate for money or looking for trades so, please, serious questions and buyers only."

It has an upgraded Ace SOCOM collapsible stock which is extremely burly. The MagPul sling mount and MS3 sling are included. The trigger is a WMD nickel-boron group, the selector has been upgraded with a Noveske 60 degree selector, the charging handle is a BCM Gunfighter and there's an oversized mag release button. This carbine lists for $1725 in stock configuration, the stock costs $225 alone and the sling, mount, selector, oversized mag release and BCM charging handle, trigger group, etc. are probably worth another $200. I'll also include a new $55 Blackhawk! Sportster rifle case and 2 new black PMags rather than the one aluminum mag shown in the photos. You're really gonna like how comfortable the smooth handguard is!

 Now for the extras, available but not included in the quoted price is a new EOTech XPS2-0 with GG&G flip-up covers mounted on a LaRue Tactical ECOS-C quick release mount that places the YHM back-up sights in the lower third of the lens. Mounted up front is an also Streamlight TLR-1SHP white/strobe light with remote activation. If you want the EOTech, mount and covers add $550 to the price (the street price of the EOTech alone is $500 or more, the mount cost $135 and the lens cover was $42). If you want the tactical light plan on another $150. The YHM flash hider/suppressor mount is not included but will be replaced with a birdcage flash hider.

I can ship. You must pay for shipping.

I bought this 2 weeks ago but realized I want to get a real one. 
This is an amazing clone of the 1911A1 and most agree to be one of the best. 

This one is a brand new manufacture (made in September 2014) which is hard to find. 

I put 3 mags through it, thoroughly cleaned it, and it went back in it's box. Original Kahr mag has never been used. All paperwork, lock, etc. included. One year warranty (I believe it is transferrable). 

Just an awesome gun. 

Has trigger play, which is 100% normal for these (even confirmed this with Kahr directly). 
And straight from the factory it had a couple light marks/scratches near the front of the slide. I have tried to really rub these off. 
(see pics). I'm guessing some oil would work.

I stripped this mount apart and had it professionally cerakoted graphite black. It's a really nice mount and comparable to a Burris P.E.P.R mount just a little less weight and bulk. When I sent it out to get coated I ended up picking up another non-qd mount that I am perfectly happy with that I have all mounted and sighted in so I just decided to sell this mount and keep the other. The roll pins in the mount were replaced w/ a barrel/screw type normally used in custom knives (way smoother and stronger than the crappy roll pins that were previously in the mount....). The mount can be disassembled w/ hand tools. These mounts sell for $50-$80 on eBay and mine is way better due to the Cerakote and new pins. I'm asking just the cost I have in it for the cerakote. If you local come pick it up if you not let know your zip code and I can get a shipping quote (shipping should be no more than $6 to anywhere in the US).

Gun is brand new, never been shot. Just bought this gun for my wife, paid about $415 after tax, give or take some change. I carry the full-size G2 as my EDC and absolutely love it. My wife liked the feel in store, but after carrying it around the house all week, decided she wants something else, go figure. As the saying goes, my loss... your gain. Located in Evansville, East Side. Will ship at buyer's expense if needed, but would prefer face-to-face. Buyer must have valid Indiana License, sign Bill of Sale, and would prefer if he/she has an LTCH.

Less than 100,000 of the M44 were made in Tula and production of this model only took place in the year 1944. Even less of the Tula made M44s were issued to the military, however this rifle has markings indicating that it was issued as military ordinance. Tula is well known for being an arsenal that produces high quality arms, reports state that the machinery used was of higher quality and that the workers were more precise when constructing arms. If you are a Mosin Nagant enthusiast, this is a rare gem and, at the risk of sounding like too much of a commercial salesman, a must have. Athough the stock could use a refinish, this is nevertheless a very high quality and rare Mosin Nagant. I've loved this rifle since I first held it, however it may be worth trading for a semi automatic just due to preference. Other than that, I would never part with this rifle. I will also throw in 20 stripper clips, 400 rounds of steel core ammunition, 20 rounds of lead tipped ammunition, and an ammo box. This should all come out to be worth at least $420 value, $300 for the rifle and $120 for the ammunition, ammo box is free! I am open to negotiation among the trade as, shoot me an email and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. I will send pictures... Had too much trouble with armslist posting them."

I purchased it new and have one too many pumps.  Need to free up cash for some other needs. Comes with original box and paperwork.

This gun operates great.  From what I gather, it is either a copy of, or made by the same manufacturer that makes the Winchester pumps.  The safety, slide release, rotating AR style bolt, etc., appears to be the same.  This is a bargain.


MAKE OFFER. I'll throw in 10 rounds of 00 buck and a box of slugs for asking price.  I don't mind asking about trades...worst I can say is no.
