Was purchased back in June 2014 and is in good condition with extremely bright night sights. It was never used as a primary carry gun, however, holstering/reholstering with the kydex holster at the range has left some marks on the slide. Approximate round count is around 1000 or so with absolutely zero issues. I do enjoy this gun, unfortunately, just need funds for other ""needs"" and daily necessities.

It is a fantastic shooter, and I thoroughly enjoy owning this gun.  In fact, I poked one large hole in my target when I got my concealed carry permit.  I'm considering moving to a different platform, however, and I'm just curious to see if anyone is looking for a set-up of this kind.  If I'm going to part with the handgun, I'd like to part with everything. 

What I have is a stock Glock 17 Gen 2.  I've put a ""clip-draw"" clip on it but I have the tools that came with it for removal if you don't like the clip.  I value the Glock at $400.  I have 5 standard capacity magazines for it (17 rounds) and two Glock 18 magazines that hold 33 rounds.  I value all of the magazines at $150.

I have three cases that I'd like to go with it as well.  First is a 4 gun case from wal mart.  I've got the keys for it and it definitely floats on water, I tried it.  I have cut out one layer of foam to fit all of the magazines (including the 33 rounders).  There is still another layer of foam that will take other guns, more magazines, or even large ammo boxes. (it will 100% fit a sub 2000).  It is great for lugging everything around.  I also have a pelican case with the foam cut out to accept the Glock and 3 17 round magazines.  This case comes with two TSA approved locks.  I also have the original case.  I value all of the cases at $100.  

Overall, I'm asking $650 for the gun and all of its accessories.  I'm not really looking to negotiate much on this number.  At a minimum I'll sell the glock and the cases for $550 with one magazine.  I highly urge someone who is looking for this specific weapons system to pick it all up.  Thank you for looking"

It's been carried a few times and maybe opened a letter or 3. The pics show all defects, most of the small stuff is just specs of dust, but there are a few small specks of missing anodizing. The blade still has the factory edge and is good and sharp, again hasn't cut enough of anything to remotely dull it. No scratches or scuffs on the blade of any kind. It's a nice snappy auto...if I weren't looking to fund other toys I'd keep it. It's never failed to turn a head when it snaps open...it will jump out of your hands if you're not careful and don't have a good grip. 

It is a used knife, it's got some marks on it, but it hasn't been used to death or abused in any way. The tip is still pristine, the blade is centered and the lock up is nice and tight. Tolerances haven't slipped at all on this knife, no blade play, and the button isn't in any way gritty. Another bonus of this knife is it takes standard auto springs which means you can replace them yourself with replacement springs from knifekits.com instead of having to deal with BM and their special rules about autos just to get a broken spring replaced.   This one hasn't been played with THAT much as I didn't want to prematurely wear the spring out.

I bought these for my Sig Sauer P290RS about a year ago and had them installed and then had them taken out so I could sell the gun and part out the aftermarket internals. I decided not to sell the gun but I would rather not have these lightweight internals in my personal carry gun. They are very light and feel great. They only had about 40 or 50 rounds put through them and thats the honest truth only because I hardly ever have time to shoot. The trigger alone was $55.00, the performance spring set was $20.00, and the lighter 22LB recoil spring was $15.00 and I am letting them all for $65 which is fair.

#1 FRAME, HIGH FACTORY CONDITION, NICE 

General Specs: Parker, Year 1921, 12 Gauge, 6lbs 15oz, Side by Side 

Serial Number: 196302 

Parker VH Grade 12 gauge guns are not rare, as they made over 50,000 of them. However, finding nice, untouched original VH Grades with 75% factory case color, 98% factory blue and wood finish, excellent screws and checkering, and perfect wood to metal fit is becoming exceedingly difficult. VH Grade guns were field guns and saw lots of use. There are few guns remaining that have not been worn thin, or restored in one way or another. This gun, sn196302 shipped in 1921 IS EXCEPTIONAL IN SEVERAL WAYS. First, it has the high factory original condition as noted above, and second, IT IS MADE ON A #1 FRAME, USUALLY RESERVED FOR 16 GAUGE GUNS. Most all 12ga. Parkers are made on a #1 1/2 or #2 frame and weigh considerably more than this 6lb. 13oz. gun that balances just 3/16"" ahead of the hinge pin. Dynamic in hand with 14 3/8"" LOP to the factory dogshead butt plate and high comb at 2 1/2"" x 1 7/16"" and neutral cast, sporting 28"" M/F barrels with mirror bores, this gun is the upland gunners perfect late season shotgun. Great gun for sporting clays and with RST Shotshells ""spreader"" loads, will work for all seasons and games. As more of these fine Parkers get their stocks cut, barrels hot blued, etc. the ones remaining in high factory condition, like this one, will continue to increase in value and desirability, especially on a #1 FRAME.

Serial Number: 196302 

Parker VH Grade 12 gauge guns are not rare, as they made over 50,000 of them. However, finding nice, untouched original VH Grades with 75% factory case color, 98% factory blue and wood finish, excellent screws and checkering, and perfect wood to metal fit is becoming exceedingly difficult. VH Grade guns were field guns and saw lots of use. There are few guns remaining that have not been worn thin, or restored in one way or another. This gun, sn196302 shipped in 1921 IS EXCEPTIONAL IN SEVERAL WAYS. First, it has the high factory original condition as noted above, and second, IT IS MADE ON A #1 FRAME, USUALLY RESERVED FOR 16 GAUGE GUNS. Most all 12ga. Parkers are made on a #1 1/2 or #2 frame and weigh considerably more than this 6lb. 13oz. gun that balances just 3/16"" ahead of the hinge pin. Dynamic in hand with 14 3/8"" LOP to the factory dogshead butt plate and high comb at 2 1/2"" x 1 7/16"" and neutral cast, sporting 28"" M/F barrels with mirror bores, this gun is the upland gunners perfect late season shotgun. Great gun for sporting clays and with RST Shotshells ""spreader"" loads, will work for all seasons and games. As more of these fine Parkers get their stocks cut, barrels hot blued, etc. the ones remaining in high factory condition, like this one, will continue to increase in value and desirability, especially on a #1 FRAME.

This is a Savage AXIS XP 270. 22"" barrel, 44"" overall with 3+1 capacity in a detachable box magazine. It has a black polymer stock with swivel studs and rubber shock absorber on the butt stock. Chambered in .270, this is a very clean and accurate rifle. 270 is a hard hitting round with a very flat trajectory. The case dwarfs a .308 and can knock just about anything on it's ass. I can easily make <1"" groups @ 300 yrds with this rifle and scope setup. The glass is the Nikon Buckmasters BDC 4.5-14x40. This is an amazing scope and comes with online software that allows you to zero once and never have to adjust for range again (bullet drop compensator) for that ammo. It looks as good as a high end Leupold and crystal clear. You have to look through it to fully appreciate the clarity at range. Unbelievable. This rifle is in like new condition. I've only fired it 16 times. It's been well kept and lubricated, and lived in a humidity controlled safe inside a rife bag. I'll throw in the nice padded Bone Collector rifle bag and a few boxes of ammo to get you started. I've already discounted it well below retail, not to mention all the extras I'm including, so I'm pretty firm on the price. Thanks for looking!

Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

If you aren't familiar with the Cougar design it is the precursor to the Beretta PX4 and uses a rotating barrel action to improve accuracy and lower recoil. Identical to the Beretta Cougar aside from the name on the slide; Beretta transferred the tooling and manufacturing equipment to Stoeger, Stoeger being a subdivision of Benelli, which is in turn owned by Beretta. Has the same manual of arms as a Beretta 92/M9, so its a great choice if you're looking for a more compact version for carry.

Has some light holster wear from being carried but overall is in good shape, bought new about two months ago and only has about 200 rounds through it. Will come with two 13 round magazines. Depending on what you have I can also include an extra 15 round magazine (modified Beretta 92 mag) and some 9mm ammo.

Just picked up a different compact carry gun, so I'd like to swap this for a bigger 9mm. Looking for a mid or full sized 9mm. First choice would be a Springfield XD9 or Ruger SR9, but would consider similar 9mm's in this size range. Only looking for 9mm's though, and no Taurus or Kel Tecs please, with the one possible exception being a PT92.  Might add some $ to a deal depending on what you have.

If not interested in trading I will sell it with the three mags and 50 rounds of 9mm for $350 FIRM.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested, texts preferred.

I bought it new from the Silencer Shop last year for $730 and had it shipped to my class III dealer. It's sat in his safe ever since. I just don't have any use for it so I'll let you pick it up for a great deal. It is .45 ACP caliber, but you can use it for 9mm as well, and get two cans for the price of one. Comes with a molle pouch. The Osprey has the unique slide shape that you see on most semi-automatic pistols today, so as not to impede your sight picture. You can run it dry or wet, and has an extremely simple 3 piece dis-assembly for cleaning. It's built extremely well and comes with a lifetime warranty. 1.3""W × 1.75""H Length 8.0625"".

 Here is the info about this scope and what it sells for, also I will post a link with reviews, GREAT ALL AROUND SCOPE:

 Product Description

 The Speed Shot 1-4×24 features include a 30 millimeter tube, larger target style capped turrets with 1/2 moa click adjustments, 3.5 of eye relief, fast-focus eye-piece, wide-angle field-of-view and illuminated 4moa dot reticle with 11 brightness settings. The new Speed Shot utilizes a illumination system that allows the illumination to be seen during normal daylight conditions, without causing any excessive tube glow. This new illumination system, combined with the dot reticle is ideal for many different applications that may require speed shots, including but not limited to CQB, hog hunting and bear hunting. We also feel it would be ideal for turkey hunting, closer range varmint hunting such as squirrel hunting. All of these features at a price that can't be matched.
 Price new is $229,95. The one I have is in PERFECT like NEW CONDITION and almost at half the price. Is for sale because I sold the rifle

NOTE:
Chuck Hawkins posted a very negative review of this rifle, because Browning bought Winchester and re-modeled the SXR after their style (European), similar to the FN, Benelli rifles. He gave his OPINION without shooting the SXR. Please research the SXR series and ignore his one-sided opinion. I too am disappointed Winchester was purchased by Browning...however, they are both incredible leaders in the industry of firearms.

All documentation is included, including the numbers-matching target, manual, and fired case.  The carrying case is original to the gun and the original lock is included.  This gun is NOT drilled and tapped for scope mounts and none are included.

Gun is used, but lovingly cared for.  Bore and muzzle are shiny and ding-free (I used a bore snake exclusively for cleaning) and the pistol is 95% all around. There is a small scratch (1/8"") on the left side under the rear sight, and a scratch (1/4"") next to the ""Government Target"" roll mark.  The finish shows very light scuffs from a no-drill scope mount and minor handling. 

I am including a 3"" blued 22/45 upper receiver with 3-dot sights that has been fitted to the lower.  This also includes the fired case, as shown.  

I am also including an Uncle Mike's holster and a set of Hogue thumbrest grips (right handed).
