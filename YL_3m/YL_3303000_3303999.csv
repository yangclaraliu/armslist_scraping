This listing is for One holster; buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-holster price, and with no additional shipping charges. Here is a very nice Replica of the U.S. Army issued holsters for John Moses Browning’s 1911A1 pistol that went into service in World War I, and has now continued to protect and serve our country for more than a century. Photo specimens and their identical mates are some we found in an old Appalachian Warehouse recently. Marking on the back base of the flap section reads Cathey Enterprisers 7791466. This is period correct marking for one of the principal World War II Contractors, but this is a relatively recent production replica, Not an Original. We’ve seen a few of these being offered for originals by people who evidently don’t believe there is a place called Hell, as we believe there is. Nowhere are the holsters themselves marked as to their actual manufacturer; their container bags, however, had Made in India stickers on them. This holster will fit any 1911 type pistol whose barrel measures 5 inches or shorter; and that includes everything from Armscors to Colts to Umarex .22 copies to Wilson Combat pistols. Our Cousin Ernest from Mississippi even carries his Ruger 22/45 in one of the old originals. Like any new, real leather holster, the first two weeks will be a very tight fit. If that weren’t the case, leather holsters would get too loose too quickly. Construction is .155 thick tanned and black dyed Moroccan style genuine cow leather, just like the originals. ALICE retaining plate on the reverse side is secured by copper tabs, not as slickly finished as the brass tabs were on the original Boyts, but good enough. Flap stud, instead of being brass like the originals, is glossy black anodized aluminum alloy, and it’s good enough, too. Dimensions are exactly like the originals, from the top of the US marked flat to the blue steel eyelet that holds its genuine leather leg string strap. The 1911 Nickel Government and its Grip Frame that shows in some of our photos is not included and not for sale; it was a tribute to our late proprietor who also, by the way, was made in 1911; and who did very well until his death shortly after his 98th Birthday. We’re offering these excellent Replica holsters, the ones in the photos or their identical mates, each for only $ 45.00>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

Probably the most effective & classic hunting rifle of all time!  This example has excellent metal condition, showing no rust or bluing loss.  There is some honest wear from use, but this is very low-round gun.  There is a scuff on the trigger guard, which can be easily restored.   It has a Bushnell Banner 3-9x40 scope with passive backlighting, and an adjustable object.  Rings are heavy duty, 4-screw tactical type.   The original iron sights and screws are included.  Their mounting holes are cleanly filled with threaded plugs. 

There are (2) stocks: First, an 'as new' synthetic factory unit with the buttstock filled with silicone to better balance the rifle.  This dampens vibration as well...works perectly.  Also included is the original walnut stock.  The checkering is about perfect.  There are handling marlks consistant with hunting, but no bad damage, splits, cracks, repairs, etc.  It's in fantastic shape for her age!

If you are looking for an AK for fun or for personal defense, than this is the deal you are looking for! 
Everything you need to get started with an AK is right here. Why not get it all at once?

I purchased this gun new a few years ago. I paid about $550 for it at the time. It has always been clean and stored in a case in a low moisture room. I believe I actually fired it twice for a total of about 350 rounds fired. 

She is all sighted in, but she's barely broken in, this AK is ready to rumble. 

Everything you need to get started with an AK. Even the ammo Ak ammo usually retails for about $.25 per round plus freight. So there is $135. Worth of value just in the ammo!

 Like the hard shell case and the ammo cam,.... Both added value.

It eats ANYTHING. And I mean ""it eats 120 rounds of Federal bulk ammo you found in a moving box from 12 years ago without malfunctioning once.""

This listing is for a Waffen Werks AK-74 style rifle with 2 Tapco Magazines and a East German Sling. 

It has a Bulgarian Polymer furniture, the gun was inspected and installed by a professional gun-smith.
It has a Tapco G2 Trigger which has a very nice light pull.

Matching Front Trunion, Bolt and Bolt Carrier. The sights are not canted.

It's been taken care of well, and it's well oiled, and shot less than 500 rounds.
This had 0 failure to fire, and 0 failure to feed / eject. Only time it gave me trouble were the some times when the round was tilted in the magazine and it just didn't feed correctly (not a gun problem, works well with more expensive bulgarian magazines and tap the mag on your noggin to line up the rounds)

I gave the shotgun to my dad for kind of a Father's Day present he had been looking for one for along time. When I got home from the trade I started loading the shotgun to show him how. When I went to rack them all out to make sure it cycled good it didn't cycle at all. I didn't want to call wolf so told my dad when he got around to it to take it shooting and see if he still had the same problem. He hand fed one into the chamber and loaded the rest. It fired the one and wouldn't cycle the rest. I contacted the guy and he offered to buy it back for a lot lower then it was worth in our original deal. I was only asking what it was said to equal as a trade value. Anyways I'm going to pay a blacksmith to fix it unless anyone has ideas and can let me know them, but a friendly warning I wouldn't do business with this guy. He said he never had problems with it and put 50 rounds throw it before I bought it, but 15 minutes after we meet it wouldnt hand cycle. So I don't know what happened since he says it was in good condition. So just a friendly warning to you all... Love armslist do a lot of trading around and this is the first bad deal I have had. I have attached a picture of this guys ad. He is trying to resell the vz2008. I traded him. I will say the  vz2008 iS in great shape if anyone wants to buy from him, but he has owned it since I did so that's your alls risk. I am just trying to be fair on both sides even though I'm stuck with the bill. If he sees this ad and has a change of heart. I will remove this ad and put another up telling how he made it right. I want this environment to remain friendly and fun. We can keep it honest people. I hate doing this but I didn't want anyone else getting dealt like this. Have a great day..."

All for only 999.00!
Kimber Solo CDP Rosewood LaserGrips, 9mm, Carry Melt, From the Kimber Custom Shop
Features:• Crimson Trace Lasergrips in rosewood i nish.• Tritium night sights.• 30 lines-per-inch checkering on front and rear of grip.• Carry Melt treatment for rounded and blended edges.• Stainless steel slide and barrel.• 7075-T7 aluminum frame with black KimPro II® finish.

The Kimber® legacy of offering the finest firearms available continues with the Solo,® a pistol platform that puts the power of the 9mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shooting regardless of hand size.

In every respect, Solo pistols are in a class by themselves. Weighing just 17 ounces and with a barrel length of only 2.7 inches, they are easy to carry and conceal. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button promote safe and intuitive operation and the smooth, single action strikeri red trigger sets a new standard for small pistols.

Built in the Custom Shop, the CDP (LG) is the most refined Solo model ever offered.

Unique features include Crimson Trace Lasergrips, 30 lines-per-inch checkering on the front and rear of the grip and a 'Carry Melt' treatment that rounds and blends edges to prevent snagging on clothing or holsters. Magazine capacity is 6 rounds, with an optional 8-round extended magazine.

No other pistol delivers the features and performance of the Solo CDP (LG). 
Comes with everything seen in pictures.  Must have valid Wi. I.D. or concealed carry license.  If interested you can call Chris @ REDACTED"

878,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3303878,For Sale:  Huntertown Guardian 9mm Suppressor $349!,"Ellisville, Hattiesburg, Mississippi",$ 349,"Listed On: Thursday, July 20, 2017",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Incredible price point. Great suppression.

The Guardian 9 is an addition to our popular Guardian lineup of affordable suppressors. As with the Guardian 22, from The Guardian 9's earliest inception the goal was simple - create a great quality, affordable suppressor with best-in-class suppression. You could spend hundreds more for another 9mm suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, multi-caliber usage, upgradability, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Guardian 9 has it all.

Suppression

The Guardian 9 compares favorably to suppressors costing more than twice as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible at the most affordable price. The Guardian utilizes K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest suppressors available.

Maintenance

Just because you can take a suppressor apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable suppressors, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted an extra $50.

Even if the tool worked, you can't get the suppressor apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired.

And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.

Longevity

There are several features designed into the Guardian 9 to ensure safe and enjoyable use beyond a lifetime.

Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. Our end caps are made of softer aluminum so that if there is an end cap strike, the end cap will give way causing minimal if any damage to the rest of your suppressor. The affected end cap, and any damaged baffles can be easily replaced without having to replace the entire core.

Multi-caliber

What's your caliber of choice? 9mm? Subsonic 300 Blackout? 22LR? 22 WMR? 17HMR? Whatever it is, rest easy knowing your Guardian 9 was designed to handle the pressures generated.
