MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

Features a Centurion Arms C4 rail. For details and picture use this copy and paste this link : http://www.bravocompanyusa.com/BCM-BFH-16-Mid-Length-LIGHT-WEIGHT-Centurion-p/bcm-urg-midlw-16-bfh-c4-12.htm      ***********************************************************************************************                                                                                           Professional Grade Weaponry, by BCM®
Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired.
As a note: BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistant with these quality control procedures.
Cold Hammer Forged Barrels
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFH series of barrels are made right here in the USA! (Just like all the BCM products.)
M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.
T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.
USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.
Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.
Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.
Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.
5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.
Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.
Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.
HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

Gun itself 400.00 from Cabelas
Surefire Muzzlebreak - 50 Dollars  (This is Surefire Suppressor Ready)
Let's say 400 rounds of Ammo - 150 dollars
Scope Rings - CTD has them for 25.00 (I think I paid 40.00

1911 Compact RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS comes from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a two-tone or Nitron® (shown) finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom rosewood grips. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols feature a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance."

This is as close as you can get to brand new. I am very obsessive abut cleaning and care, its hardly been fired, and not fired since it was coated. The coating job was absolute factory perfection (easily an $80.00 job), and this barrel is $140.00 https://www.lonewolfdist.com/Detail.aspx?PROD=970

The pistol offered has a very, very low round count.  It is in “like new” condition and features a custom ghost ring rear sight and a rubber sleeve on the grip.  Also included are four H&K 10-round .40 caliber magazines and 400-rounds of ammunition.
This is a Heckler and Koch Universal Self-loading Pistol. It is a semi-automatic large-frame pistol chambered in .40 S&W.   The USP was introduced in the late 80s and HK designed it specifically for law enforcement and military use. Later on down the line USSOCOM picked it up as well as other allied forces. 
The USP stems from the Model 1911 pistol, a popular and dependable design from the 20th century. Where the USP differs is the polymer grip instead of metal, which makes it lightweight at around 1.5 pounds. Shooters can pull the slide back to set the trigger for single-action or de-cock it with the safety and set it for double-action. It has an ambidextrous magazine release and safety. On the front of the lower receiver is a universal rail, so lights or lasers can be attached."

I will update the ad as more items are added and of course when items are gone.  I have other firearms listed as well for a bigger deal.  

1.)  Hornady Critical Duty 9mm FlexLock 135gr +P JHP 50rd. boxes.  The more common 25rd. boxes go for $20-$25 online and the 50rd. boxes for usually $35-$40 plus any tax and/or shipping when you can find them in stock.  Description and specs:  http://www.luckygunner.com/9mm-135-gr-jhp-flexlock-hornady-critical-duty-50-rounds  

$300 FIRM per case, 10-50rd. boxes(500rds.) or trade for 1,000rds. of Federal or equal M855, XM193.  Out of 100+ sites on AmmoSeek, the cheapest is $0.68 per round not including any shipping and/or taxes, I am selling for $0.60 per round, if you want cheap ammo, this is not for you, I will not respond to lowball offers.  Not interested in selling a box or two at a time, but will if really close to me at $35 per box.

2.)  AK-74 Mags:

2 - 40rd. ProMag  mags, $25 for both

1 - 30rd. Polish Radom mag, $30 (pictured with the two plum mags)

2 - 30rd. Izhmash Plum mags, the one in the center looks like a speckled plum, but I've only seen this on Tula mags before.  $80 for both

$120 for the remaining 5 mags or $130 shipped.

3.)  D&L Sports 1911 Single Stack Quad Magazine Pouch/Holster, like new.  $65 shipped.  http://www.dlsports.com/kydex_1911_single_stack_quad_magazine_pouch.html 

Prefer cash, but will consider trades if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested.  If wanting to trade, please be specific on what you are offering, straight trade, trade +/- cash and how much, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I have other items listed for a bigger deal on something.  

Trades considered:

A few items I can think of right now, AR-10(or nice upper / lower), Sig 556R 7.62x39 Gen 2 only, maybe the new converted U.S. Saiga AK-47 since they are $750 new.  I could use a quality stripped AR-10 lower, quality 1"" AR one piece scope mount with pic rails on the rings and 1-2 GG&G Ruger Mini 14/30 scope mounts.  Clean Ruger GP100 SS 6"" .357 mag and SA XDS 9mm(post recall), the ""essentials"" package would be fine, since they are less than $400 new.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

About melonite treating:

""Meloniting (nitro-carburizing) is a heat treat process for barrels that hardens the barrel to apx. 70 Rockwell so they last longer, are more corrosion resistant inside and out, and also decreases friction in the barrel which can increase velocity. Chrome lined barrels can decrease accuracy, as it is a built-up layer of material inside the barrel. Nitro-carburizing changes the structure of the metal itself without building a layer in the bore, therefore increasing performance but not decreasing accuracy. Melonite treated barrels have proven to last 30% longer than chromelined barrels, and are more accurate.""

The Franchi SPAS12 is a combat shotgun manufactured by Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000. Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the United States. The SPAS12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS12 was sold to military and police users worldwide,[1] on the civilian market, and has been featured in many movies, TV shows and video games.

The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS12 initially led to its ""Military"" designation as a Combat Shotgun. The SPAS12 was designed from the ground up as a rugged military shotgun and it was named the (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun). In 1990 Franchi renamed the shotgun to the (Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun), this allowed continued sales to the U.S. as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban, imports of SPAS12 shotguns were stopped into the United States. In September 2004 the ban had expired, but Franchi had ended production in 2000 of the SPAS12 to focus on the manufacturing of the Franchi SPAS15 model. The SPAS12's retail price in its final year of 2000 was $1500.00 USD averaged for final sales outside the U.S. to non-restricted countries. Franchi S.p.A. Italy.[2]"

The Franchi SPAS12 is a combat shotgun manufactured by Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000. Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the United States. The SPAS12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS12 was sold to military and police users worldwide,[1] on the civilian market, and has been featured in many movies, TV shows and video games.

The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS12 initially led to its ""Military"" designation as a Combat Shotgun. The SPAS12 was designed from the ground up as a rugged military shotgun and it was named the (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun). In 1990 Franchi renamed the shotgun to the (Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun), this allowed continued sales to the U.S. as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban, imports of SPAS12 shotguns were stopped into the United States. In September 2004 the ban had expired, but Franchi had ended production in 2000 of the SPAS12 to focus on the manufacturing of the Franchi SPAS15 model. The SPAS12's retail price in its final year of 2000 was $1500.00 USD averaged for final sales outside the U.S. to non-restricted countries. Franchi S.p.A. Italy.[2]"

-- Asking $900 cash, or $950 in trade

With a 10.5"" HBAR barrel, it's perfect for close quarters work but will also accurately reach out - it's not too short, not too long. I've set this up with the best quality/value parts; Seekins MCSR KeyMod rail, MagTactical magnesium lower, CMMG LPK, Sig SB15 Arm Brace, ASC Mags (4 total NIB)... it's ready to run! And boy does it run! We've function tested it at the range and it runs!! Iron sights to 50 yards, not even sighted in yet returned 3-4"" groups - not MOA but when you consider this was the first time out with it, standing WITHOUT supports and using iron sights that hadn't been zero'd - NOT BAD AT ALL and easily MOBG (Minute Of Bad-guy).. all day long!! And it's a blast to shoot.

The 7.62x39 round is an incredible performer, in both accuracy and kinetic energy - when used in a platform like this. More kinetic energy than the 5.56/.223, less expensive than the 300BLK cartridge.. and readily available ammo. This pistol will run reliably on premium, standard or steel cased ammo.. built to run it all. 

The only reason I'm considering selling this firearm is that, ironically, the wife doesn't really like it :( go figure. Like to keep as my personal build,.. but, would prefer to get something that she's comfortable with - larger semi-auto (rifle or shotgun). Bottom line is that even though it doesn't kick hard, it's a bit intimidating - big bark! We've fired approx. 60 rounds through it and no problems.

NOTE: Sights were not installed during the pic taking, but they ARE INCLUDED! Also, the magazine shown in the pic is for 5.56 - new 7.62 mags had not arrived when I snapped the pic, but (4) NEW ASC mags are included.
