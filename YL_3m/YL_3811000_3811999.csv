I'm selling/trading off my Spike 9"" 37mm side loading launcher. The launcher is used, I've shot 5 rounds through it. Cool little toy. Looking to sell or trade. Let me know what you got. I'm not hard up for cash, so please no low ball offers. Launcher mounts to the standard 7"" railing sections. 

A little info from Spike Tactical's Website:

The ST 9"" Side Loading Flare Launcher features the latest in design and manufacturing technology. Parts are CAD designed and CNC machined from solid billet material rather than the typical stamped and welded construction of other launchers. The 6061 and 7075 Aircraft grade aluminum components are anodized in Type III Hardcoat black for maximum durability and ease of maintenance. 

Additional components are built from 1018 cold rolled steel and plated with a Mil-spec black oxide finish. The proprietary STZ push button cylindrical breech lock design is 3 times stronger than existing lever lock systems. The Havoc is designed to mount on any Mil-Spec rail system. Installation simply requires sliding the launcher onto the bottom rail of the handguard and tightening two set screws which are included. 

Features:

Side-swivel Breach Loading Design
Push-button Breach Lock
One-piece Tube & Grip
Supports 5 3/4"" USCG Munitions
Compatible with 7"" and longer rail systems"

you cannot find this gun for sale anymore.  there are a coupe fake auction sites out there that say they have sold these for 366.00 but that is 100% not true and they say that about everygun to lure you to the site.  please base prices off of gunbroker.com  that is the only acurate site if you must base off of an auction site.  these sold for $600+ when they were in stores.

the reason they are not sold anymore... gas operated shotguns will cycle through any shell clean.  most semi auto shotguns are inertia based and will only cycle through when enough inertia is made from the load.  gas ones cost too much to make when people didnt know the difference between gas and inertia.  so they decided to make 12g models that werent gas and discontinued the gas ones.  still easy to find parts for online, not that you'll need them.

Roughly 1000 of these Swiss made ASAI One Pro .45's were imported by Magnum Research in either .45 ACP or .400 Corbon which makes them extreme;y rare to find, let alone in LNIB condition. Firearm is in excellent 98%+ condition (serial #022XX). Both of the original 10 round magazines are included in addition to a third. Aimed initially at meeting the demanding requirements of Special Operations Command units, the One Pro 45 pistol will no doubt find favor with civilian fans of “big-bore” double action semi-automatic pistols. The One Pro 45 combines proven short-recoil operation, all-steel construction and large caliber with a modern single-action/double action trigger, a frame mounted decocking lever and a patented, automatic firing pin safety. Accuracy and service life are enhanced by the full length rails—interior on the frame and exterior on the slide—and the slide and frame of chromium nickel- molybdenum steel. Out of the box, the One Pro 45 offers one of the best trigger pulls for a factory pistol. Single-action pulls are light and crisp with very little slack or creep. Double-action pulls are of moderate weight with linear loading and a predictable, crisp let-off. No doubt accuracy is greatly enhanced by the excellent qualities of the trigger. ASAI claims that the One Pro 45 will find favor among shooters with small hands. Despite the double-column magazine, the girth of the grip frame remains comfortable for the small handed. Shooting comfort is enhanced by a slight recurve at the bottom of the grip frame and recurved magazine floorplate extensions. Stocks are two-piece molded, black polymer with a lightly marbled outer surface. Caliber: .45 ACP/AUTO Capacity: (3) 10 Round Magazines Sights: 3- Contrast Barrel Length: 3 6/8"" Weight: 2.55 Lbs Shipping to lower 48 only, Shipping $30.00 For more detailed information on the One Pro see the following link to a 1998 NRA review: http://www.nramuseum.org/media/364163/June%2098.pdf. With only about 1,000 imported to the US, this is indeed a rare find (serial #022XX) in what appears to be 98% condition."

As previously stated, the case of the watch is solid 14k gold, and it is stamped correctly. These tend to sell between $400 to $600+ according to the condition.

Hey everyone, I have up for grabs a really cool (and very old) Spanish Ruby 32 acp pistol. This one is a 1915 Star 32 used by the French in WW1. This feels very stout and handles great. It shoots very accurate for being so old. The only issue is that it doesn't like to eject reliably. Sometimes it ejects and feeds perfect. Sometimes the shell doesn't extract at all for mags straight. It could be as simple needing the extractor spring or extractor tweaked, or even some grunge under the extractor. I Bought to add to my collection, but have since found another project I want to grab instead. I do have a pretty decent amount of ammo that I could add for trade value or sell additionally at cost. This also comes with a decent little holster for it and one mag. 

As far as trades go, I'm mainly interested in tokarev pistols, 12 gauge pump shoguns (mossberg preferred), even some rifles. Honestly, just shoot me a text or message on your trade offer in pretty open when it comes to guns and rifles (as long as not 22lr haha).  Ya never know, I may be interested! Just shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on it

The legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic SWAT is a semi automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. 

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor."

Description
The “E” is for “Extreme.” The EXPS3 offers true 2-eyes-open shooting and a 7 mm raised base that still allows for iron sight access. It features easy-to-adjust side buttons and an adjustable, locking, quick-detach lever for easy attachment and removal.

EXPS3 was chosen by the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) as their primary optic for close-quarter engagements.

It is also the optic of choice for the technologically advanced modern rifle hunter. Its night vision-compatibility makes it a versatile choice for day or night hunting.

 Aim point pro
A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic

• Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. 
No need to fumble with switches prior to use.
• 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.
• In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking 
and maintenance easy.
• Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared 
to iron sights and magnified scopes.
• Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with 
Aimpoint 3X Magnifier and Concealed Engagement unit.
• Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world 
conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.
• Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).
• Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.
• Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with 
both covers closed in an emergency.
• Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces.
• Modular mount set up for use on flat-top AR15, M4 Carbine and M16 rifles.

Burris Fast fire ii

Extremely compact and lightweight, yet rugged, red dot sight provides fast, accurate, both-eyes-open sighting on handguns, rifles, and tactical shotguns. Stainless steel and aluminum housing built to handle the recoil of magnum shotgun loads and installed weight under 2 ounces allow mounting on a semi-auto pistol slide. The FastFire II adds to the original FastFire’s platform a gasket bottom plate that seals it 100% against water; sight will continue to function even after being submerged. The FastFire system’s panoramic field of view and unlimited eye relief simplify shooting with an unobstructed view of the area around the target for fast target acquisition and precise shot placement. Won’t interfere with peripheral vision, so the operator can maintain better situational awareness. A high-intensity LED projects a 4 MOA red sighting dot on the heads-up display, while a light sensor and integrated control circuitry adjust the dot’s brightness to match the light around the target. Coated, dual-layer, optic-quality lens resists scratches and scuffs and is parallax-free to 50 yards. Mild, 1.07x magnification aids in acquiring long-range targets, without compromising close-in effectiveness. Set the point-of-impact with two flush-mounted screws that provide 3° (190"" at 100 yards) windage and elevation adjustments using the included scale disc and adjustment tool. Low-profile control switch conveniently positioned on the left side, resists accidental activation and has positive clicks for on/off positions. Powered by one 3-volt CR 2032 lithium battery, included; up to 5-year battery life when used in Battery Saver mode. Comes with a mount that fits MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny and Weaver-style rails. For other installations, sight is available separately and is compatible with all mounts that accept the original FastFire sight. FastFire Kits available for Glock, XD, 1911 Standard, 1911 Novak & 1911 Kimber/Bo-Mar."

I purchased this rifle about two months ago and have only taken it to the range once.  It functioned flawlessly right out of the box and is zeroed.  This is a Colt manufactured AR, not a bushmaster, DPMS, or spikes everyone on here is passing off as milspec.

This is a great shooter and when you pick it up you'll realize how convenient the weight is and why a lot of police officers use this as their patrol rifle.

My price is firm as I am just trying to get exactly what I put into it.  This is a practically new rifle as you can see by the pictures.

I will accept cash or USPS money order.  I prefer to meet in the Southern Pines area, but I am flexible.  

This is a great rifle.

The updated price of $800 is the lowest I'll go.  If it doesn't sell I'll keep it.

Although some claim that the pistol is based on the Japanese ""Baby Nambu,"" I haven't seen that verified but I wouldn't argue the point.  What I do know is that the method of using stamped steel pieces to create the lower receiver was a relatively inexpensive, and the pistols themselves are reliable and accurate.
This particular pistol is in excellent shape: the bluing is perfect, the bore is mirror bright, and even the takedown lever unmarked (usually people use a screwdriver to start the takedown process, I highly recommend lopping a piece of floss instead).  22LR ammunition is hard to find, so I can include a couple boxes of copper plated rounds."
