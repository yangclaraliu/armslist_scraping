Engraved Firearms
Smith & Wesson firearms have been renowned for their performance and function for over 150 years. Now, they can also become timeless works of art. Any new revolver, pistol or classic firearm from Smith & Wesson which you already own, can be custom engraved to create a personal masterpiece. The application of precious metals, and the art of embellishment, results in a one-of-a-kind piece that reflects not only the skill and vision of the master engraver, but also the artistic expression of the owner. Only Smith & Wesson can provide the added value of authenticity direct from the manufacturer.

The only changes I have made are I have installed [url=http://shop.powderriverprecision.net/product.sc?productId=17&categoryId=14]Powder River Precision X-Treme Grips[/url] in grey rubber.    The second change is I replaced the stock striker retainer pin with a heavy-duty coiled pin from [url=http://www.pistolgear.com/proddetail.php?prod=00PG060]PistolGear.com[/url].  Finally I have added a Pearce Grip to the 9-round magazine

Unfired, new, never stripped down, racked etc.  (Since so many folks have inquired by asking if the gun is ""new and unfired"" I will repeat the fact that yes -- THE GUN IS NEW and UNFIRED!!).  Private sale means no sales tax or FFL fees, etc.  Selling as I have another P227 as well as the new HK45.  For transfers in Illinois, I must subscribe to the 3-day wait (from the time a declaration of intent is made to buy) and ISP FOID verification, not because I want to per se, but that it is the law.  (It's moot for out of state and I can ship FFL/FFL anywhere in CONUS for $40 insured right away).  I AM ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY NOT INTERESTED IN A TRADE.  Thanks"

I have shot about 5 or 6 full Magazines through this gun since I have owned it, so to say that it has only had about 100 rounds through it would be accurate. There is nothing wrong with the gun at all, I just don't have a need for it anymore. I was planning on shooting competition with it, but I just don't have the time for traveling and as much practice as I would like. I am the original owner of the gun and it has been cleaned properly after each use, like all of my guns.

There is one small blemish on the right side of the slide, and will be shown in pictures.

The price is 100% FIRM. I will not go any lower than $600. NO TRADES.

I have only put 240 rounds this particular upper. It functions great and has very low recoil - as that's what a dissy upper is all about. Selling because I actually have two dissys and only want one. They are admittedly a little heavy but are great for introducing a new, timid shooter to the AR world. In case you're not familiar, the dissipator is a 16"" barrel with rifle length gas tube and handguards. Allows for longer sight radius and less felt recoil. 1 in 9"" twist.

I am no expert for sure about this gun but looked up SN and it falls in that range. It does not show any wear at all. Really cannot tell its ever been fired. Sure it has but it looks new.  Just seeing what Smith guys are looking to trade for it. Not interested in selling at this point unless it's a crazy number.

682,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3103682,For Sale:  Set of Brownell's Barrel Finishing Tools,"Conyers, Covington, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 55,"Listed On: Monday, May 26, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I've got a 3/4"" diameter 90-degree Facing tool, a .303 brass pilot (for7.62x54R, .303 Brit, 7.7mm Jap, etc), and a drill/press adapter that I no longer need. I purchased them from Brownell's, and used them on one barrel.  The facing tool doesn't seem to show any wear at all, the drill chuck adapter looks brand new, and the pilot has some scratches from use, but mics out to a perfect .303"" (just like it did new).
I'm no expert in grading these things, but I took really good care of them, and used them exactly like the directions said to. They gave me a perfectly true crown.
Total ""new"" price is $98.00 plus shipping.  I only used them once, and am asking $55.00, shipped. Method of payment is PayPal. Thanks!

Facts:
*The facing tool is meant to be used after you cut the barrel.  You can use a crowning tool after facing the barrel, or you can go with the 90-degree target crown that is formed by use of the facing tool alone.  You have to face before you crown, though.
*Pilots are available from Brownell's for any size barrel you need to face, for around $25.00 each.
*Pilots and adapter work for all Brownell facing and crowning tools; everything's interchangeable."

Why would you pay them same price for a car with miles that you can go somewhere and get one brand new? That is insane. Also just because it says ""New"" or ""LNIB"" doesn't mean anything.

These were made from 1909 to 1941 and this is absolutely the nicest one I have ever seen. Bluing is in 98%+ condition and mechanically excellent as well. This is definitely a collectors model in my opinion. Book lists it at $260 for one in 80% condition and this well exceeds 80%. I am willing to let it go for $250.

I bought this carbine new awhile back simply because I've always wanted one, its a blast to shoot; really quiet and very light recoil. It's had exactly 20 rnds through it for a simple test fire, that's all. Cleaned and well maintained, this thing's like an AR, very easy to disassemble. I've had it for awhile and it just sits in the gun room, so looking to possibly trade for something different.

This kit is complete and isn't missing anything. Includes the slide, barrel, recoil spring, 15 rd magazine, the box, papers/manual and factory issued lubricant. It is recommended that the shooter only uses high velocity ammo. I bought this kit new for my Glock 17, I used it with some Federal auto-match rnds and it worked flawlessly, its had exactly 45 rds through it, cleaned and well maintained. has no wear or anything on the exterior, it does have some slight wear on the top corner of the chamber where it has been fired, the barrel and slide make a tight fit so the friction caused a little bit of wear there. This is a well built, reliable kit, I was very pleased with it but I don't use it anymore so looking to sell or possibly trade.
