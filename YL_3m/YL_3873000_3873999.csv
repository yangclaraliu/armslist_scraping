 Serious inquires only, I do not want to trade for your Hi-point and $300 nor do I need a boat or anything else. Trades may be considered depending on the item, yet I would need at least half in cash. That said, yes this is lower than you can buy online New and this is new (I consider it used however due to being first owner as do all weapons) 

 FNX Tactical (includes Shipping fees and transfer fees) $1,257.00 
 Bladetech Padddle $81.00

 TLR-1 HL (630 lumen w/strobe) unopened box $121.00

 That's a complete set up with holsters and Tac-Light for $272.00 off. Additionally these prices are at what I got them for which is discounted 10-15% (MIL/LEO) so I'd say savings is just over $380-$400 total."

I bought this rifle new about 3 years ago, brought it home and fired 8 shots to confirm proper function, then I cleaned the bore and put it in a gunsock and into my climatically controlled vault where it has sat untouched. The recoil pad has a couple points of slight wear but every Remington rifle with a R3 type Softcell recoil pad that I own has similar 'wear' from standing on the carpet in my vault. I am selling some of the nice guns I own and never use as I approach retirement and moving south, this is one of them. Buyer must be able to legally purchase and possess firearms and must be legal Maryland citizen and/or active duty military stationed in MD on current/valid orders. Will meet buyer during daylight hours in a public setting for a FTF cash and carry, legally compliant transaction. I am in Southern MD, will travel as far as Upper Marlboro to meet buyer. Not interested in trades or lesser offers, I'm not desperate to sell, just downsizing.  The scope and rings are not included with the rifle, but if you like them I will leave them in place for an additional $300; This is a Nikon Titanium 5.5-16.5x44 scope with A/O and it is Like New Condition; it was Nikon's top of the line scope when I purchased it. The rings and mounts are Burris Signature Series, and its all properly mounted."

The body kit is an Archangel Ruger 10/22 setup and I modified it to fit the 715T and it looks much better than having one of those goofy banana .22 magazines curling out the bottom like the others.

The internal barrel, firing mechanism, trigger, etc are all Mossberg 715T and are a single unit, so the only thing that's different is the outer body kit, making this just as legal as a 10/22 with this outer kit installed. The best part is you can take the kit apart and clean the inner Mossberg internals and I've cut out a window on the side to reveal the Mossberg 715T serial number.

I've added other upgrades including the red dot scope, harris style bipod with spring assisted drop outs and metal side picatinny rails.  I painted this setup and the stock folds and locks into place.

You will never find another .22 like this and it gets a lot of attention at the range.

I have owned this gun for a little over 2 years and bought it brand new (paid $580). I am choosing to sell it because I am wanting a full sized pistol instead. I have only put around 100 rounds through it (take a look at the photos showing the barrel). I simply don't have the time and/or places to shoot it. I installed a set of Truglo TFO  tritium night/fiber optic sights ($90) on it last December so they have plenty of life left in them. It comes with all the original box materials and accessories. Also note that I used a white crayon to paint the Glock indentions white. This can be removed with a little bit of effort if so desired. The only issue (which is purely cosmetic and only visible using no backstops) is a small portion of the grip is a little married because of my portable gun safe (see photo). It does not affect the feel of the gun whatsoever and like I said is BARELY visible. Almost perfect condition with very little signs of use. If you have any questions please feel free to email me and ask. PRICED TO SELL!

1 Issue, I have adjusted the IAC Idle Air Control Valve to a higher RPM when idling, there seems to be a drain when parked in D that makes the car stumble to a stall at times, more often in the winter. What we simply do is slap the transmission into N when coming to a stop and there is absolutely no issue. No cracks in windows, clean title and ready for a new home! 1 tire is slightly larger than the other 3 and I have since moved it to the rear to save the CV from excessive wear at highway speeds.

Well, mostly it is.  What we have here is a genuine Redhead beauty from the Russian Glory Days.  A 1941 Tula Original-Built Sniper SVT-40!  

When I bought the rifle a while back I had no idea SVT sniper's existed until I posted it to the GunBoards.  They inform ed me quickly and confirmed that it is a Factory-Made 1941 Tula SVT-40 Sniper and I better treat her with care, and so I did!  I vigorously searched high and low to return her to her glory days, but after seeing that an original mount fetches $2,000 in U.S.A. and that there are more fakes that genuine examples here, I bought a reproduction mount for her.  Next on the list was a true scope, no repro would suffice here.  I got in contact with a nice fella from Ukraine, where he found me an all Original FED-built SVT-40 1941 Scope!  This setup is how she sits now, as an extremely rare and fine example of Russian, WWII, Sniper, and Semi-Auto History.

This example underwent the typical Russian refurbishment and received the accidental plum bolt, electro-pencil matched everything, and a special extra as far as the stock goes.  Mostly all SVT-40's when coming out of refurbishment were placed into a new AVT-40 stock, which had thicker and stronger wood design do to the Automatic 54r nature of the AVT.  The example I got was an even more limited number of NAVAL AVT-40 stocks, stamped to match the serial and with a rear Mosin-Dog colar escutcheon!  The trigger is that of the original assembly and is struck serial and wider, not the newer-make thinner and electro-pencil versions.

All of the internals match serial, and the rifle comes with an original sling and 2 (TWO) 10rd Box Magazines, original not crappy reproduction! 

The internals are immaculate with no corrosion, including the piston and cup.  I have an SVT-40 tool that will go with the rifle and she performs flawlessly at 1.3 right now.  The bore is a 7 out of 10.

I am selling to buy my fiance' a vehicle asap, my priorities have been changed.  I am open to reasonable offers, but know the true value of this rifle and have priced it as such.

Thank you for reading and give me a TXT or reply. I have not included an image of the ""notch"" as to discern potential harm-doers from learning the dimensions and forging fake SVT Sniper's which is a real issue.  You may ask me for an image of the notch, but the ""C"" stamp on the receiver is more than enough proof you'll need.

We haven't built these to be super small, super light weight or super invisible. We built these to be super quiet, strong and amazingly effective.

Leaving them in the raw, the end user has all sorts of options on finishing them to suite their needs. Why would we assume to know what you want or need?  You can finish them with Cerakote, Duracoat, clear coat them as they are, or even just rattle can them black, FDE or pink with purple polka dots, if that's your thing.

Being made of 6061 aluminum, these suppressors are very tough and can handle a serious beating. We've tried them out on other calibers with decent results, but they are only warranted against defects in materials or workmanship for the above calibers. They are, however, rated for full auto .22 LR use. We shoot our .22 LR machine guns with these cans on them, why not you guys too!

These suppressors weigh in at 6 ounces, are 7.5"" long and have a 1.125"" diameter, using a modified K baffle design. Like we said above, we aren't trying to be, nor do we want to be, the smallest or lightest. We are after quiet and strength, while being at an amazingly low price point. These are the quietest thread on .22 suppressors that we've heard, and many industry professionals agree. Try one, we know you'll love it as much as we do.

These suppressors are on form 3's and ready to transfer. All NFA rules apply, meaning there is paperwork that needs to be done and a waiting period for the ATF to approve the transfer. Arkansas residents are subject to sales tax.

Bailey Signature Firearms in Russellville is a stocking dealer for our cans. If you're in the area, you can check them out."

The Glock 23 has exactly 393 flawless rounds through it and the CCU has exactly 50 rounds through it and is in perfect working/cosmetic condition.  The Glock 23 includes all factory parts and case, however, I have installed:  extended mag release, extended slide catch, Ameriglo night sights, and 'Superman' slide cover.  I will include three (3) 14-round magazines (they all have the +1/+2 finger extensions) and three (3) 22-round magazines. Here are more details:

Mech Tech CCU:  base unit, muzzle decoration, M4 collapsible stock, quad-rail system, sling loop, MBUS flip-up sights, magnetic Glock Block (needed to attach the G23), folding vertical foregrip, bipod with adjustable legs, UTG Scope 3-9x32 (red/green crosshairs), and a hard shell case with cut-out foam.

This is A LOT of stuff and everything (gun and CCU with accessories) is valued at over 1600.00!

I am asking for 1200.00 OBO.

I would also be willing to entertain other prices by excluding some of the extras listed above.  I would be willing to sell the CCU without the Glock for 650.00 OBO, but not the Glock by itself (because the CCU would do me no good without the G23:))

The Colt letter on the conversion unit came back that it was sold July 30, 1938 at the post exchange Maxwell Field, Alabama. So I assume that the soldier was stationed there before the war.
