If you've never heard of these, check out Hickock45's review on YouTube. This 1911 has been an absolute blast to shoot. Its mil-spec, so great for a build gun. It eats any ammo you feed it flat nose or round nose. These are in the same bracket as RIA, and I've never had a problem in some 200+ rounds. Comes with one 8+1 mag (any 1911 mags fit this weapon) and 30 rounds or so of fmj. Nice crisp trigger pull with no slack at all. They sell for 400+tax, and this firearm is well worth every penny of that. Really wanting to trade because I can't afford to buy .45 ammo anymore for fun lol! Will like to see ID for age purposes, not recording any info."

Typically ships within 2 business days when a valid FFL is received

Made in the Slovak Republic by Grand Power, the K100 Mk7 is a modern, fully ambidextrous 9mm semi automatic pistol that features an external hammer and interchangeable grip panels. The frame is made from steel reinforced GF-30 polymer which reduces the overall weight of the gun without compromising strength, function or reliability. Grand Power pistols are all made on 4140 steel reinforced polymer frames with a significant design emphasis on ergonomics and ease of function. Each pistol has an integral Picatinny rail in the frame and comes with four interchangeable backstraps.

Each pistol is fully ambidextrous, the slide lock, mag. release and safety are fully functional on both sides of the frame. All of the barrels are high quality stainless steel and use a patented rotating lock, rather than tilting, during cycling for super smooth work at the range. The trigger has a very short reset, so accurate and fast follow up shots are a breeze. The slide and the steel reinforcing in the frame is finished by nitrocarburizing.

Glass is a Nightforce NXS 8-32x56 with ZeroStop turret and MOARF2 reticle, mounted via Nightforce Ultralite (ti/aluminum) rings with integrated angle-indicator and level. 

Glass won't sell before the rifle, and I'd be willing to offer a slightly better price if you'd like the package.  If you don't need the Harris and sling/QDs, there can be a further reduction in price (though it won't be major).

Only fair offers (GA will charge you around $4500+ to build the rifle  and glass is another ~$2100).  I'll only ship at this point if you have rep through other channels.  ABSOLUTELY NO TRADES, unless you happen to have a S&W 386 or 396 Nightguard (L-frame .357 or .44Spl).  Nothing else!  

If you're a Nigerian prince or a tire-kicker, don't even bother with the email.  Bullshit offers will be ignored.  If you're holding your breath and hoping it's going to be $1500, save yourself the trouble.  I've had two questions so far about GA's ""guaranteed accuracy,"" which is either 3/8"" MOA and no more than 1/2"" MOA.  If you're asking about this, we'll sum it up by saying that it shoots better groups than you, particularly with the $60-a-box S&B ammo you plan on running through her.

The Charter Arms Undercover is a gun whose owners come hungry for self-defense, and leave satisfied that their attacker ate lead. Whatever else you can—or cannot—say about this mid-priced revolver, it’s one accurate gun of a son.

But a recent experience with the Charter Arms Target Mag Pug left me wondering if a reasonably competent shooter equipped with any of Charter’s products could hit the broadside of a barn. I’m pleased to report that the Undercover is one of the most accurate .38s I’ve ever fired. The collection of dots in the target’s center (at twenty feet) was so well-gathered that Adam at American Firearms School challenged me to repeat the feat using double action. Only I’d already punched the paper in double action mode.

Thank You for Looking

The DPMS Panther Mini SASS rifle is a smaller .223/5.56x45mm version of the full size Panther LRT-SASS (.308 Win./7.62x51mm). The original DPMS SASS rifle was designed to meet the needs of snipers who needed a single, high capacity rifle that is just as effective and useful for long range shots as it is for CQB scenarios.

This rifle is extremely accurate and capable of sub-moa groupings with commercial match grade ammo, although produces 1-1.25 moa consistently with 55 grain tula if you just like to plink on the cheap. The 1/8 twist 18"" barrel stabilizes grain weights 40-77 well, so if you so desire you can take full advantage of the improved external terminal ballistics of the 69-77 grain rounds for hunting purposes. I have added the Magpul B.A.D. lever to this rifle, as I believe it to be a simple modification that increases the ergonomics of the AR-15 platform considerably. Rifle will be priced competitively, to sell. I will send more/specific pictures or information to serious buyers upon request.

This sidearm has been the official standard issue sidearm of the Turkish Army for decades.  IMHO, it's one of the best imports for a .45 ACP you can find anywhere, and they have been holding their value for a long time.

Very few Double-Stack .45's are manufactured in this price-range and this one is a blast to shoot and has never jammed on me.  This is partly due to the excellent highly-polish feed-ramp, deep enough to feed any factory round including Flat-Nose Hollow Points.

This looks, functions and field-strips like the traditional 1911's and has the added advantage of 15 rounds.  This sidearm features an extended beaver tail, fore and aft frame serrations, removable dove tailed front sight and upper and lower barrel lock up.

What amazed me is that it's an accurate shooter at 50+ yards.

The added bonus is the Hogue Grip which makes it even more comfortable and very easy to handle, especially with the light-weight alloy frame and low recoil... noticeably lower than the Colt 1911's.

This sidearm has all the attributes of a Military-Grade Tactical Pistol.  It has the Large Trigger Guard (with serrations) for when you wear gloves.  Other Tactical features includes the Full-Length Chrome-Molly Guide Rod, Double-Action firing, an Accessory Rail for your Laser/Torch, Adjustable Rear Sight, Locked and Cocked Carry System (with Firing Pin Block).  

All of these features put together with the extra Magazine and Holster in a powerful, light-weight .45 ACP makes this an excellent grab-and-go side-arm.

I am the original owner.  I purchased this brand-new through an FFL a little over a year ago and have put about 500 rounds through it.  It is always thoroughly cleaned and lube'd after every range visit.

Selling rifle + one 9 round magazine+ magazine holder. And everything else it came with.
Rifle = $330 price anywhere in town. Even the gun shows.
Mag holder =$17 ebay.
Total = $347  Plus 8% tax paid = $374   what I paid for it a few weeks ago.
Will let go for $280 for quick sale.
These rifles have a bad reputation, only because they are ugly as hell, but most owners will tell you that they never jam, with the right mag.  Most rifles that cost 3 or 4 times as much can't say that. Iv'e seen and had rifles $1200 on up that jammed and double fed rounds sometimes. Hi-point rifles are known for reliable cheap shooting.
Buyers with CCW much appreciated. All buyers will be required to sign a sales receipt, stating that you are not a felon, and are legal to buy and own firearms.
No trades.     Thanks

 This handgun has exactly 45 rounds through it. It shoots like a dream (It’s a Sig). I purchased this handgun unfired a couple of months ago. It’s a very nice gun. I enjoy it very much.

 The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.The slide is Nitron coated, and the frame hard anodized black. All external and internal parts are “phosphate” coated, for resistance to salt water etc. It also has SIG Night sights.

 I have owned and do own, several Sig Sauer handguns. This Pistol is beautiful and would make a dependable, accurate sidearm. My only reason for offering in trade is that it is the last 9mm I own at this point. I am making the jump to complete .45, as those are the only other calibers I own. If I can’t find a suitable trade for this MK25, I will happily keep it and leave it in the safe. This is arguably one of the best 9mm a person could own. 

 Because this is the last 9mm I own, I have lots of extras to add to this package for the right deal.

 (1) Sig P226 9mm MK25, case, certification paperwork etc.

 (19) 15 round 226 magazines! Some are Sig, some are Mecgear some Promag, a few have no name. All work.

 (1) Set of Hogue replacement grips for P226

 (3) left handed holsters

 (1) Ambi shoulder universal holster

 Around 1000 in 9mm ammunition. Ranges from brass, to Aluminum, lead to home defense rounds. Blazer, UMC, PMC, Remington, Horniday Critical defense, Winchester etc

 This really is a complete package. Its worth quite a bit when you do the math. That being said, it is not for sale. I am only interested in giving this up for the right trade.

EDIT: Since I've had so many people requesting a sale price, The sale price is 1500 FIRM for everything. I'm not willing to negotiate sorry."

Introducing the new SIG SAUER Classic centerfire pistols in .22LR Rimfire models. The same Classic pistols that have been used by civilian, law enforcement, and military personnel the world over, can now have these same models factory built in .22LR. The SIG SAUER® Classic .22’s are built on the same frame as their centerfire counterparts. All Classic .22’s feature the same SIG SAUER Four-Point safety system which employs a decocking lever, a patented automatic firing pin safety block, a safety intercept notch, and a trigger bar disconector. The new machined slides also feature a front sight adjustable for drift and a rear sight adjustable for both windage and elevation.

With the purchase of a new SIG SAUER Classic .22 shooters can now enjoy hours of serious training at the range for a fraction of what they would pay practicing with full recoil centerfire rounds. SIG SAUER Classic .22’s are shipped in a lockable case with one 10-round magazine."

   One of the services we offer our clients is the ability to sell their guns through our shop. This provides several benefits over private sales or simply selling straight out to a gun store.



    - Money! On a good day, the average gun store might offer you 50-60% of market value for your weapon. They're making an investment by purchasing your gun, to be viable, they must maintain a generous profit margin. Our consignment service costs 10% of the sale price, and we don't get paid till your gun sells. You pay NOTHING out of pocket.


    - Safety. We don't fear-monger here, most private sales go smoothly. But the notion of meeting somebody in a parking lot to swap gun for cash... Certainly leaves something to be desired.


    - Quick sale. Truth is, a huge portion of the used-gun purchases made, are by first-time gun buyers. These are the people who are NOT likely to feel comfortable meeting a seller in a parking lot. By selling through us, you have vastly expanded the range of people who will be looking at buying YOUR gun, not to mention our ability to sell and ship your weapon nation-wide.


    - Convenience. No more phone calls, emails, or texts to answer. No lowballers, or idiots wanting to trade a refrigerator for your gun. You send or bring the gun in, we handle it from there. When it sells, you get your money. Easy peasy.



Consignments can be applied for any use you'd like!



    - Good old Cash!

    - Special-Order or in-stock Firearms!

    - Bulk Ammo!

    - For clients starting the build of an Hour13 Carbine or 1911, you have the option to apply your consignments directly to your new build. For these sales, the 10% consignment fee is reduced to 5%! We have had many of our clients fund complete custom builds just with their consignment items!"

Used Hoyt Reflex Extreme Compound Bow, will need your own hardware (except for rest). You can pick up a sight and quiver dirt cheap at Walmart. 

Draw weight is around 60lbs, 29 inches. Very quiet bow for age, just picked up a Matthews so no need anymore. 

NOTHING is wrong with this bow! Had it checked out last year by the guys at Cabelas when I picked up new arrows....they said it was good to go. The fellas at the shop where I picked up my new bow this week said this bow still had plenty of life, no cracks....still good to go. Bow string has been waxed, and has a few more seasons left.

Inside; good shiny bore, great rifling.  Outside shows its age; the receiver is supposed to be white, the rest of the metal is about 50% bluing.  The wood is solid but scuffed and engraved with ""trench art"".  Numbers are not all matching but, bolt number does match receiver.  
Storage grease has been cleaned off and everything has been lightly oiled.  Shoots very well, quite accurate, recoil is mild.  
7 mm mauser is a great deer/pronghorn cartridge, especially for younger shooters, this mauser has a shorter LOP than a K98 or Yugo.
For local pick up, I can include 20 rounds of ammo.  If you need it shipped, I can ship in state (preferably to a CPL holder) or out of state to a C&R holder.
Shipping and/or ammo is included in price, I'll accept offers but, the ammo and shipping will be negotiated separately in that case.

Chambered in 9x18mm Makarov, which is similar to 380 acp but balistically superior. This is a solid milled steel, military grade firearm with a chrome lined barrel. Cosmetically similar to the Walther PPK, it will fit in holsters designed for the PPK. DA/SA with a decocker and loaded chamber indicator.
This is a 1968 model with a rounded hammer for snagless drawing. The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is very hard wearing. I have also added custom walnut grips that give a more ergonomic fit than the originals. Comes with two magazines, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I have ground down the finger rest on the non matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady xtp defense rounds and the original grips.
With the gun, refinishing service, and grips, I have just over $500 into this pistol and that is the basis I will use for any trades or sale.
Looking to trade for a Sig P938 plus cash on my end. Offering an additional $100 for a basic model, more for a higher end model (SAS, Blackwood, Equinox) and/or additional mags.

This is our 10.5"" barrel that has been Melonite treated for extreme durability. Done in the QPQ (quench polish quench) form of Melonite which gives a more durable, deeper finish and is the best type of Melonite treatment. We are one of the few companies who assure that our Melonite barrels are done the correct way. Barrels and extensions are treated separately, threads cleaned, and then the extensions are torqued and gas port drilled. This assures that there is no ‘salt bleed’ into the threads, as well as eliminates the potential for the extension to actually work loose from heavy fire. If a company does not specify the way they treat their barrels, then assume it is done the quicker/incorrect way. Melonite has shown to last longer than chrome lining, and can also be more accurate since it is not an added layer. It is indeed a better option for a gun barrel. Please see our FAQ section for more info.

You can take the holster and ammo pouch off of the straps and attach it to the paddle for belt wear, all of that is included. The only thing youll have to buy, if you have a handgun, other than listed above, is a Fobus Roto Holster. Can get one for like 30 bucks.
