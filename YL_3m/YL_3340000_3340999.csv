The standard tac sol ar 22 sbx comes with  a hogue free floated hand guard with out rails. And that cost $550.I purchased the Troy ind 7. 2  inch bravo rail and had them build the upper with that. Once the sbx upper is built you cant change the hand guard. The barrel is pinned in place. I paid $140 for the rail, shipped it to tac sol to have them build this custom upper. They charge $80 for a custom build fee. With all the shipping charges i have nearly $800 invested. The upper comes with a black dog 25 rd mag. The SBX barrel is 12.5"" with a pinned 4"" shroud that a suppressor can fit into an thread onto. This gives you the ability to suppress the rifle without adding much length to the riffle. And with the barrel being 16.5"" no tax stamp is required. I am FIRM at $550. Not really locking to trade. Unless you have a tactical solutions x ring reciever or rifle.

I'm looking for a possible trade worthy of my 2011 Honda Ruckus.  This scooter is highly desirable and if you're looking you know how hard it is to find one let alone a stock one which has been unmolested.  It has 2,600 gently used miles and is in excellent shape.  All maintenance has been proactively done since purchased including a 300 miles break-in oil change, filter screen cleaned every oil change and coolant, gear grease changed twice since purchase.  It comes with a matte black Hawk helmet with bluetooth (for phone/music), Turtle LED brake light with integrated signals and MNNTHBX seat lowering bracket (neither have been installed just purchased however are nice mods).  Tires, belts, fairings, seat - all items in excellent condition on this scoot.

I really enjoy it and saves me a ton in gas around the city (gets roughly 80mpg) however I'm meagerly looking for a new addition to my collection.  I really need a nice tactical shotgun, and AR as my Spikes is lonely...  however am interested in higher end handguns as well.  I'll take a trade plus cash or all trade.  Whatever adds up and I'm interested in.  I don't have a set price in mind however please keep it real.  The Ruckus is pretty highly sought after and last forever.  Nothing has changed much since their inception and it is one of the lowest costs for transportation imaginable.  Send over any trade offers as the worst either one of us can say is no right?

I have for sale a new never fired Diamondback 380. I bought this gun a while back just as a carry and have never fired it. It's incredibly easy to conceal which is great for this time of the year with thin clothing. It comes with hallow point Hornady ammo. Also included is an extra magazine with a finger extension which adds amazing control and comfort. And a Remora holster. It is an IWB (In waist band) holster. It's specially designed to not require a clip that would normally attach to you pants.

The ultimate backup and concealed carry handgun has arrived, bringing revolvers into the twenty first century. When you need a light weight carry revolver, you turn to Smith & Wesson's Small Frame Airweight Series. They are the original aluminum, small frame revolvers chambered in .38 S&W Special +P. They are available in the ""Centennial"" frame with fully enclosed hammer with one idea, perfect personal protection.

I've had this revolver for a little less than two years but it has been a safe queen. It's fired at most 50 rounds and is spotless and in perfect condition. Comes with a pink Hogue rubber grip, Bulldog case and Remington ear protection. Also comes with a Wolff reduced power spring pack, the reduced power trigger return spring and stock hammer springs are installed (the original is included).

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)

M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver

In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels. 

T-Marked Upper Receiver 

The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate 

The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel 

BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber 

One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish 

Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 

5.56 NATO Chambers 

The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases 

Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 

Government Barrel Profiles 

Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems. 

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels 

Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7SF. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its unique right-side folding tubular buttstock to its 24x1.5mm muzzle threads with muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7SF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7SF rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7SF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

I've never fired the rifle since its been mounted in this stock, but have decided I don't care for the look and am going back to the wood stock. $130

I also have a JMECK See-Thru mount up for grabs with the rings included (1"" $25). As previously stated these are both on a Hex receiver, so the JMECK mount will likely have to go on another Hex since its bent for one already, but feel free to try a round receiver. $70

Both are being offered AS-IS. If you buy both, I'll cut you a deal at $175 and meet within reasonable distance. I'm located near Nashville, IL. trade value at $200, but would like cash to fund another gun project.  Will ship as a set plus shipping anywhere in the lower 48.

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the new addition to the SAM7 family – the SAM7UF rifle. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features expected in the SAM7 Family. From its reinforced under-folding buttstock to its 14x1mm left hand muzzle threads with muzzle nut, every component of the SAM7UF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7UF rifle is bound to become a sought-after and collectible firearm.

The New Reinforced Under-Folding Stock
The SAM7UF utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, which locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle.  In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7UF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.

SAM7UF-85 | SAM7UF model 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14x1mm muzzle left-hand threads, muzzle nut, bayonet / accessory lug, reinforced under-folding buttstock, black polymer pistol grip and handguards, stainless steel heat shield, cleaning rod, one 10-round magazine (accepts any mil. spec. magazine), sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

For those wanting to use their 375’s in the lower 48 for animals up to 800 lbs, this load is superior. At over 3,000 fps, this deep penetrating Barnes bullet will give ample penetration for animals up to 800 lbs. If I were going to use my 375’s for deer, black bear, interior grizzly, caribou and elk, this load would be my first choice. It is very fast and flat shooting and the long-for-weight all copper homogenous bullet penetrates far deeper than the typical premium jacketed partition type of bullet that weighs 260gr. to 270gr. I shot a big bull elk with this load at 450 yards.

As usual, Buffalo Bore refuses to get involved in the industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory test barrels that generate false high velocities, which can never be achieved with real firearms, in the real world. Note our actual velocities fired from actual real world firearms.

Beautiful rifle and more than adequate to take down large game in Tennessee.
