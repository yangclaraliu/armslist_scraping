Seven Powerful Benefits of Having a CCW Permit and Fully Consider that Your Knowledge of the Law is Your Liability Insurance!
#1 Know The Law ! • Knowledge is POWER and your full knowledge of the law gives YOU the advantage over the criminal and the peace of mind every responsible firearms owner desires.
#2 Legally Carry into Bars & Restaurants that Serve Alcohol! • Since the passage of the No Permit Required to CCW, many think they can carry into establishments that serve alcohol for consumption! This is NOT True! If you do NOT have a valid CCW, you can NOT carry into any establishment that serves alcohol for consumption on the premises. • Do you know ALL the NEW Guidelines in order to carry into bars?
#3 Carry concealed in 34 states! • Your Arizona CCW Permit is your passport to carry in over 2/3's of the United States.
#4 Bypass the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) check when purchasing a gun! • If you do NOT have a valid CCW, the FBI has the right to put a 3-day delay on your right to purchase a firearm ! That means if you wanted to purchase a gun on Monday they could force you to wait 3 full business days and you wouldn't be able to pick up your gun until Friday. Avoid government red tape and get your CCW.
#5 Some State & City Parks are NOW Posting • ""No Firearms"" ... Unless you have a CCW • Once again your CCW is your passport to exercise your 2nd Amendment Rights and have the ability to protect yourself.
#6 Traffic Stops Made Easier ! • Many Law Enforcement Officers have shared with us that they appreciate good citizens that have taken to time to get educated in safe gun handling and the laws. Because of this they personally have a ""NO Hassles"" policy on traffic stops for those that possess a valid CCW
#7 Peace of Mind ! • The knowledge your will gain by attending our Arizona CCW course will give you the Peace of Mind and Comfort in responsible firearms ownership and concealed carry privileges.

CCW applicants must: • be a resident of this state or a United States citizen; • be twenty-one years of age or older; • not be under indictment for a felony offense; • not be convicted of a felony offense, unless the conviction has been expunged, set aside, vacated or pardoned, or the individuals right to possess firearms has be restored AND the individual must not be a prohibited possessor under state or federal law. • not suffer from mental illness and been adjudicated mentally incompetent or committed to a mental institution; • not be unlawfully present in the United States; • complete a firearms safety training program pursuant to ARS §13-3112.N"

Dropping this kit into your S&W M&P will set the trigger break point farther forward than the factory trigger assembly as well as significantly reduce the uptake and over travel (varies).  It produces a trigger pull as close to a 1911 trigger as possible in a polymer frame pistol.  The Forward Set Trigger body is machined from aircraft grade aluminum and black hard anodized to last a lifetime. The flat faced trigger comes assembled with a center pivoting safety. The Forward Set Sear & Trigger Kit boasts a smooth trigger pull throughout the break.  The kit comes with 2 trigger return springs; one designed to produce a 4lb trigger pull, and one to produce a 5.5lb trigger pull.  These two options give the end user the ability to customize their trigger pull for their specific needs.

I just noticed I accidentally listed my gun for $12,000 instead of $1100!!! It's been corrected and I would hope you find the new price a bit more reasonable! This is a 1944 Ithaca M 1911 US Army .45. It has all of the proper stamps and marks to identify it as an original military firearm. There are no rebuild Arsenal stamps so it appears the gun was not rebuilt. It has a Colt barrel in it which is common since these guns were serviced and repaired while in the care of the military and the manufacturers used interchangeable parts. I'm not a gun expert of any kind but the markings on the various parts make this an undeniable wartime Ithaca  military firearm with all age appropriate parts.  I have plenty of photos on request. The gun has holster wear and a few scratches but I just fired it last week and had no issues running four mags of ball ammo through it. It comes with two magazines and a black stamped military issue leather double mag holder. This was from my grandfathers collection and it's time for someone who's more interested in vintage weapons than I am  to enjoy it. Also it makes for a very reliable .45 for self-defense or shooting targets. F2f preferred  thanks."

FN Special Police Rifles of all iterations are noted for being both very accurate (.5 MOA or somewhat less is not uncommon) and very low maintenance, featuring Parkerized metal finish, synthetic stocks, and a chrome lined bore in the barrel. A chrome lined bore offers a more durable, more corrosion resistant, and easier to clean barrel for the end user to maintain and is rarely found on precision bolt action sniper rifles.

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs (weight before custom build) and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gauge 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of thirteen 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the rear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. It is new and comes with sling, optics rail and manual. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward. However, when you take a look at this beauty you will see it is a whole lot more as it has been morphed into an all around versatile firearm… Tactical, Home defense and/or hunting this one does it all now!

It's absolutely a fantastic firearm as well as an elusive piece to many collectors due to its price point and discontinued production.

The mark 23 is a civilian production of the infamous MK23 USSOCOM that serve as the primary offensive weapon for the navy seals and special ops. (Also known to many metal gear solid fans and movie buffs familiar with Tears of the sun)

Skipping the history lesson now, feel free to read up on Google if you'd like, let's get to the good stuff ;)

I'm looking more so to Trade this beast for something a little more carry friendly, and while this was a very fun and comfortable range toy, its just too D*** big to tote around on a daily basis. 
Bottom line, throw me some offers if you've got something in reliable condition, between calibers of 9mm and .45 and a holster to match you should be talking to me.

Also, if its cash you're looking to spend I'll negotiate with reasonable cash offers. I promise to still be the cheapest you'll find this particular firearm in the us. (But the better deal is just a flat trade) I'm not looking to capitalize on this, its just not practical for what I need.

Comes with one factory magazine with 12rd capacity
Operators manual and a locking sentry box
Level II safariland kydex holster converted for OWB use
Can even toss in the remaining Winchester jhp rounds if you wanna make a quick victory stop at the range on the way home.

Extreamly clean and in the few years I've owned this beauty, I've only put two mags through the handgun and the rest of the time its been sleeping in the nightstand or locked up in the hall closet. I want to start carrying and the two times I've took it on errands its just not felt right. I'm a lanky guy so it stands out like a colostomy bag on spring break, and prints like a horrible shoplifting attempt. CC is not happening with this gun to say the least.

Usual stuff here, no felons, must be 21+ and able to show an I'd with proof of Arizona residency. I'm not the federal govt and am happy to arm a legal us citizen but there's these little.things called rules and laws.
