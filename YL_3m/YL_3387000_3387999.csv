Taurus PT809 Compact 9MM Review:
The Taurus PT809 Compact 9mm makes for a great conceal carry firearm and fits nicely in the shooters hand. The finger grooves molded into the polymer frame make gripping the firearm very easy and comfortable. The 13-round magazine has a finger extended floor plate on it which also also for more comfort while shooting.

Along with the 13-round magazine, the PT809 also comes with an extended 17-round magazine with the extended floor plate and magazine adapter to fill the gap between the frame and floor plate made by the longer magazine.

The Taurus features and external manual safety, slide lock/release, and shrouded hammer.

WHAT COMES WITH THE TAURUS PT809?

The PT809 comes in a large carrying case and included in the case is the firearm, both the standard and extended magazine, magazine loader,the Taurus safety lock keys, owners manual, registration information, and a child safety lock. All around I find the Taurus PT809 Compact to be a great carry firearm.

The 9mm cartridge is a great round to carry on your person because it does allow for the framework of the firearm to be smaller compared to a .40S&W, or .45ACP.

The gun fits nicely in your hand and with the finger extended floor plates on the magazines, you don't ever have to worry about having your last finger not being on the grip of the gun. The manual safety is a large obvious feature that is easy to activate and deactivate.

One feature that is not so obvious is the shrouded hammer, it can still be pulled back for single action use but it fits snugly up into the slide of the gun to avoid any possible snags.

Along with being about to be fired using single action, the PT809 Compact is also a double action pistol. I would recommend this firearm as a conceal carry gun, because it is very comfortable for the user and with the extended magazine is great for anyone with large hands.

The shrouded hammer and Glock style take down bar make the gun slim, and good for unholstering without snags. Taurus made this firearm to be user friendly and is great for a wide variety of people."

It is comprised of a sporter stock in good condition that is inletted  for a k-98 type contoured barrel.  It has a few small dings here and there, and one @1"" long gouge on left side of the butt stock.  The bolt is jeweled, the barrel and floor plate have Mauser serial numbers, waffenampts, etc.  The barrel has sporter sights and the receiver was demilled by a communist at some time.  Looks like many of the serial numbers match, for whatever that is worth on a sporterized rifle.   There is just a little bit of pitting under the wood line on the receiver that has been blued over.  Receiver is drilled and tapped, trigger assembly is included.
     The other half of the package is a barreled receiver that is stamped Santa Fe Model 1946, Golden State Arms Corp.  I do not know what caliber, have assumed it was 30-06, but you would need to have a gunsmith cast it.  Must have a ccw or purchase permit.  Thanks"

Tactical Flexibility was the innovative force behind the development of the AR-10A4 Special Purpose Rifle line.  Whether the rifle application dictates the need for iron sights, red dot or magnified scope, the SPR line is the efficient platform for all sighting options without sacrificing durability or accuracy. And accuracy is the point, isn't it?  At ArmaLite, we believe it is, so we build all our A4 and A2 rifles with nothing less than a double-lapped barrel for accuracy and chrome line it for corrosion resistance.  In the Era of AR Innovation, we will not be outdone.

Below is a description from the Springfield website. 

http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/xd-s-3-3-45-acp/

Can a pistol small enough to carry every day have all the features, performance and power you would find in a full size handgun? Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?

The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first and only single-stack XD® from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it, and pretty soon you’ll forget it’s even there.

The XD-S® Single Stack consistently astonishes and delights shooters on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The trigger on the XD-S® Single Stack feels more like it belongs on a target pistol than a carry piece. Shooters who are used to difficult, heavy triggers on deep concealment pistols will be astounded at the smooth, crisp XD-S® Single Stack trigger.

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™."

Must sign and agree to our ""Body Armor Terms & Conditions"" agreement for purchase of body armor. No sales to Minors. No sales to Felons. No sales to Residents of CT. No sales for illegal or amoral usage. No sales for export. No sales to non-US persons. No international or APO shipping. 7% Discount does not apply to soft armor, package deals, lvl II or lvl IIIa armor, carriers, vests, helmets, or any other products.

No body armor is 100% bullet proof.  Being stuck by a bullet carriers significant chance of serious injury or death. Do not get shot. Do not sue us. Do not shoot yourself, Do not get the wife to shoot you, this is very dumb and constitutes First Degree Assault. Please do not ""joke"" about getting the wife to shoot you. This makes us nervous and not want to sell to you. Do not test your body armor. All body armor sold AS IS with no warranties, guarantees, or claims. All body armor sells final.

Regular FAQ:
Can civilians buy body armor: YES! 100% Legal for non-felons to purchases, possess, and use.
Is Soft Armor Knife resistant: No. Soft armor will not meet the NIJ Bladed Weapons threat testing protocols. It is not knife resistant.
What does getting shot feel like?: Most LE Officers that have been involved in a shooting with a handgun describe it as ""Being hit with a hammer"" But It will suck, and you still might die.  Getting shot with a rifle or shotgun round will suck even more.
Do you offer LE or Agency Discounts: Yes, please contact me for an exact quote.
Will a bullet-proof vest make me bullet-proof?: No.  Even if a bullet strikes the vest there is still a chance of serious injury or death. Also, nothing is 100% ""Bullet Proof"", high velocity threats, special ""armor piercing"" threats, or other abnormal rounds may penetrate.
Do you ship Armor: Yes. As long is it is legal for you to own in your state/municipality. No shipping to CT or internationally.
Remember: If a bullet impacts your vest, THERE IS STILL AN A-HOLE TRYING TO SHOOT YOU! So you should probably do something about that.

Stupid FAQ:
Wonder if I get shot it the face?: You might die, sorry.
Wonder if I get shot in the nuts: Sorry, it sucks to be you. Also you might die, sorry.
Does it stop a .50 BMG?: No. Pro-Tip: do not get shot by a .50 BMG.
Wonder if I get shot more than 6 times?: Pro-Tip, stop getting shot.

"" I have this LNIB glock 19 that I want to sell for $750 or trade value of $1000, would like to get a M2 Browning in trade""

Thats how almost all of you label your guns. Yes, pistols are and can be expensive, but your glock WILL NEVER be worth $750. I dont care if YOU polished it, all those fancy mags will go great with the package, but youre not going to get what you paid for them either.

""Ill add 100 rounds of ammo for $80 more"" Oh well thank fuck, cause I was having a super hard time finding blazer 9MM ammo. 

Something else. You guys treat 1911s like they are the end all be all of pistols. Get real. Theyre antiquated. The only reason people buy them is cause they are a 1911. Can they look nice? Yes. Can they be expensive, yes. But your walmart special 1911 isnt worth 700. It isnt worth 600, or 500. Its worth MAYBE 350, its used, get over it.

If it doesnt say SIG or Kimber on it, its pretty much junk with maybe a few other exceptions. These 22LR 1911s are even worse, I mean 22s are useless as it is, but then you put it on a staple like the 1911. Thanks.

Youre chinese weapons are shit. Period. End of story. Ive fired numerous chinese makes and they are all easily broken, easily jammed pieces of shit. 

I also loved the sudden price increase on the saigas. One guy here had one for 450 and had it listed for about 2-3 months then all the sudden he went to 650, then back down to 550 and maybe he sold it IDK. Point is, they dont sell. Saigas chambered in BOTH 12ga and 7.62 are trashy redneck hoosier weapons that people only buy because they have the AK frame. 

Someone on here wants something like 1600 for his saiga 12GA piece of shit. Let me tell you, I can spend 1200 on a FNH 12GA SLP and itll be more accurate, more reliable and better looking than your drum fed piece of shit made in russia. 

Now onto the hack jobs. I love looking at these people who have modified there guns and tell us how great it works, but dont say who did it work. If it wasnt done in a professional shop, you cant charge a professional premium or assume were going to take your word that you even know what youre doing. Your polished XDM isnt fancy, it isnt unique, it isnt something I couldnt do on my own. So, no, it isnt worth 300 more. Get real.

Magazines and your no name POS scopes do not add value at an exponential rate. If you are selling an AR15 with 10 PMags and are adding 100 in value because of the magazines, FUCK YOU. I can get them all day long at 9.95. I have no idea how well you treat your mags, maybe you drop them every reload to try and be delta force dan at the range. I have no idea, but youre not getting even 8 dollars per. They add maybe 3-4 dollars each to the value. 

You fucking tool bag trailer trash idiots need to realize youre selling USED hardware privately. If I wanted to pay close to retail, why wouldnt I just pony up 200 more and buy it ACTUALLY nib at the store and know how its been handled.

In short, Glock is NOT the ""king"" of pistols. Theyre entry level/mid level range AT BEST. I can outshoot any glock, any day with my Five SeveN or my FNS - 40, or the FNX - 45. Any day, any time, any ammo.

Glocks are great at what they are, cheap polymer pistols that anyone with above minimum wage can afford and take to the range. Nothing more. Sure, they can be used in competition and Im sure they have been, but YOUR glock hasnt been, and isnt going to be. 

Start listing quality stuff on here at the right price, and list the junk at the price it belongs. Glocks shouldnt be on here for more than 400, period. Just about anyone who works for the government can get one at LE price for like 375-450 NEW. I can go buy a 22 RIGHT NOW for 420, brand new, in FDE with 3 mags. 

And when you DO have something of quality, stop thinking its worth thousands. Seriously. There is/was a PS90 on here for like 1500. GET FUCKING REAL DUDE. It had 2 shitty 10 round mags, no one cares about that garbage.

Edit. For example, check out this jackass selling an ""AR15 pistol"" 


Hardened arms upper, SAA lower, 30rd magazine. Built this from gunbroker auction parts, all new at the time of purchase. Very fun to shoot.

Comes with sig brace.

Spelling errors and referring to this as ""ak pistol"" will be ignored. I only sell to educated gun owners who I know can be responsible. Sorry,

Get over yourself dude. That thing is worth maybe 350, assuming you even pieced it together properly. Second, its a fucking mini AK. It might be an AR15 platform, but its shooting an AK round. 7.62x39, if it was 7.62x51, id say differently. Also you say you only sell to ""educated"" gun owners. Well lets be honest, an educated man wont buy a pieced together hodgepodge from some guy on armslist. Ill go buy the real deal at the store that has a clean SN and comes with a warranty."

At the heart of Golden Saber JHP is a high-performance hollow point bullet with a jacket made entirely of cartridge brass - not copper gilding metal. Thicker and stiffer than other bullet jackets, Golden Saber HPJ releases energy over a longer distance. And, unlike conventional hollow point bullets, the jacket is nose cut completely through, promoting controlled expansion to well over 1.5 times the bullet's original diameter. The nose cuts, configured in a new, patented spiral pattern, produce larger petals and reduce the nose cavity for optimized mush performance.

From the Sig Sauer site:
The all-stainless construction of the P220® Elite Stainless provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long. As the next generation P220, the Elite builds on the exceptional reputation of out-of-the-box accuracy with the addition of SIG’s new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The SRT provides you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable short reset for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. No production pistol is more closely identified with superior performance than the P220 and the new P220 Elite offers shooters new features that enhance the pistol’s performance. These features include an ergonomic beavertail grip which allows you to obtain a confident grip from the holster even under stressful conditions. The beavertail also permits shooters to grip the pistol as high as possible without worrying about slide bite. Front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITE® Night Sights and custom wood grips complete the P220 Elite.

The rifle will come with a Plinker-Tactical 35 round magazine as well as the factory S&W 25 round mag, also will come with a Truglo Optics fully adjustable 3 intensity Red/Green/Blue-dot scope that does have the option for a pressure - grip as well as the factory iron sights. It does have a fully adjustable 5 position butt-stock.

I just don't have the time to get it to the range as much as I'd like, as stated bbefore I'd like to trade for a Glock in specific a Glock26 but will consider all offers may l just let me know what you got? I'd also throw in a few hundred rounds of .22 if the deals right. I'm located close to the Gwood mall on the southside of Indy best reached by text at REDACTED my names Robert, thanks for looking.

Original Wood grips in very good condition, I would score the grips at 80%+, this is a very nice Smith & Wesson Revolver with a very tight action.

I purchased it new in March and have put around 300 rounds down the barrel with FLAWLESS performance. 

I've installed a Magpul rail section, Magpul RVG, and a Bushnell TRS-25 red dot which sits on a UTG mid-length riser and allows for an absolute co-witness with the folding iron sights. Also includes a Sig Sauer single point sling and the original box/manual.

The charging handle is reversible, all the controls are ambidextrous, and the Swiss style stock (which features a removable cheek riser) folds up nicely for a very compact package. The bolt is piston driven and the internals will be familiar to anyone who has ever broken down an AK or an AR. Its really a great mix of the best features of both rifles.

Here's a link to Sig Sauer's webpage which features a great video with more info on the insane modularity of this new design. With a new barrel and bolt face, you can switch over to 7.62x39 using stanag AK mags.
