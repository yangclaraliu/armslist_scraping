5,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3961005,For Sale/Trade:  Colt M1911 A1 (1943) National Match,"Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma","$ 4,500","Listed On: Monday, January 26, 2015",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"RARE Colt M1911 A1 early model national match pistol. This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1943 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped to Springfield Armory in February of 1943. It was Issued to an enlisted serviceman at the time. (Trying to find out who it was issued to now through different channels.) There are specific clues on the gun that tell you who it MIGHT have gone to.. There is AA inscribed (Not stamped) on the ivory grips and on the frame Next to GHD. GHD is significant because Col. Guy H. Drewry inspected ordnance from June 17, 1942 to July 15, 1945 For COLT.  

After having multiple collectors and Colt dealers at the gun show look at it. ""AA"" is believed to stand for ""All American"" 82nd Airborne Screaming eagles. Which would match the dates the gun was issued, and the eagle carved on the Ivory grips. 82 Airborne was the first Airborne division in US Army history and had three major drops, made their first drop in July of 1943 to invade Sicily. Second was Salerno on 13 September 1943. The third was the invasion of Normandy Jun 1944. 

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. BUT NOT ALL PISTOLS BACK THEN WERE STAMPED WITH ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for Military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted National match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by a gunsmith. At some point it was re-blued, and fixtures were 24k gold plated and Ivory grips added. It has been determined the gold was added many many years ago as some has worn off in spots. Bluing and finish is still very nice...  Bore is excellent and looks shinning. 

This pistol is a shooter. I have put 100 rounds through it and drives tacks. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection. 

I have many pictures if you want more. FTF in tulsa area only.. 4,500$ cash obo.. All reasonable offers considered. Email if interested. Will trade multiple guns.. Please list your offer and values of guns."

$500 FIRM. I WILL NOT TAKE LESS. I would rather TRADE.

I have a S&W Bodyguard .38+P. It was originally bought from Bass Pro by the previous owner. She shot one round and decided she wanted a smaller caliber. I have shot about 15 rounds through it. I am really a single action guy, not a revolver guy. I did dress this one up to keep however because it is so light and easy to carry, but I would consider selling/trading it to get something else. 

I have installed a XS Trijicon Night Sight (big dot) that really improves accuracy and target acquisition. It is new and glows bright. I have also installed a Hogue Tamer grip made for the Bodyguard that allows for a full hand grip but it still is light and can fit in the front pocket of my jeans no problem. It had a huge impact on accuracy because the factory grip would twist in my hand, this one does not. I do not use the laser, but it is sighted in at 15 yards perfectly. This is a great, lightweight, dependable, and accurate self defense CC gun.

New Desantis pocket holster
XS Big dot Night Sight

Pistol is a black slide on a black polymer frame. Trigger is DAO and has a consistent and very smooth pull, not too heavy. Because it’s DAO, this pistols allows a double-strike capability should a cartridge fail to fire the first time. This pistol also comes equipped with SigLite Night Sights, in good condition. Slide and frame are very clean with really no signs of wear (see photos). Barrel does show some wear to the finish due to use. Overall I would classify this pistol as used, very good to excellent condition. This is a Gen2 P250.

If you’re not familiar with the Sig Sauer P250, this pistol features a removable FCU (fire control unit) that allows you to move the trigger/hammer assembly to another frame – which allows you to purchase other frames/slides and to have one serial number, but multiple pistols/calibers. Sig has options for kits that are sub-compact, compact (this model) and full size in 9mm, .40S&W, .45acp and .357Sig. All you need is one FCU (included with this gun) and the other kits and you’ve got a very versatile firearm.

You get:
•	Sig Sauer P250 9mm Compact Pistol with SigLite Night Sights
•	(1) 15-round Sig Sauer Magazine
•	(1) Hard Case

***SOLD***

Asking $400, cash only. I’m not looking for any trades for this gun at this time.

The rifle sports a period Redfield receiver sight. The action is as smooth as silk. The bore is bright and shinny. The receiver still has a deep blue mirror finish. The bluing on the barrel is very good. There is some bluing loss on the left side of the forearm cap. The checkering is perfect. The forearm has a couple of light handling marks. The right side of the stock has a light crease and a number of small handling marks about 1 inch in from the pad in the center of the stock. I purchased the rifle in 1988 from the original owner in Klamath Falls, Oregon. I had a gunsmith replace the old pad with a high quality London Guns recoil pad. LOP 13 1/4"". I bought the rifle to take an elk with. Just something I wanted to do. I hunted with it, off and on, for several years. In the Fall 1992 I had a big 6 x 6 bull coming down off of a timbered ridge towards me. At about 80 yards I touched off a 250 grain Barnes Original bullet. The bull dropped like it had been hit by a ton of bricks. The rifle has been stored in my gun safe ever since. I will turn 65 this month. I told my wife that the time has come for someone else to enjoy this wonderful rifle. I know these rifles are very collectible and that most of the gunsmiths who built them are gone. But they made them to hunt with. At close range with heavy bullets the .348 Win will dispatch any animal in North America, and dispatch them with ease"

Serial number 18385 was made in 1941 and is a DELUXE Pre-War short tang rifle. The change over from long tang to short tang took place gradually around the 17000 serial range. As not very many Model 71's were made after 1942, it is quite difficult to find a Pre-War short tang Deluxe Model 71. The ORIGINAL condition of this rifle is outstanding. Excellent stock and fore end with the Pre-War checkering at 20 lines per inch. Nearly ALL of the original varnish and blue remain with some very light high edge wear and handling marks. Original butt plate, original sights and front sight hood. There are NO extra holes or other non-factory alterations. This 71 was produced just before Winchester started drilling all Model 71's for the side receiver sight. The bore and all mechanics are excellent. It would be a challenge to find another all original Pre-War short tang Deluxe that is better than this one. Includes its original Winchester Deluxe swivels and period leather sling. This is a great Winchester collector and investment rifle. Offered at NO RESERVE. Please look at all the pictures and email any questions or for more pictures"

It has all new springs in it, less than 6 months old. It's a great shooter, very accurate. The most reliable 45 ever made, it will feed all kinds of ammo, it will even chamber empty brass! Not even a Glock will do that.  Never had a malfunction of any kind with this one.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

The SAS model stands for Sig Anti Snag.  The SAS's are custom shop guns and have been treated to a dehorning ""carry melt"" treatment on the slide to reduce the blockiness and to aid in concealment.

I am the original owner and pistol has about 1000rds through it.  I have standardized on 9mm so have reluctantly decided to let this go. Gun is in extremely good shape and was only carried 2 or 3 times. 

Finish is excellent with no scratches or nicks I could find.  The only place where there is any finish wear is on the barrel where it contacts the slide.

729,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3961729,"For Sale:  45 COLT +P DEER GRENADE 260 gr. MEDIUM CAST HP-GC (1,500 fps) - 20 Round Box","Azusa, California, United States",$ 32,"Listed On: Monday, January 26, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=338







45 COLT +P DEER GRENADE 260 gr. MEDIUM CAST HP-GC (1,500 fps) - 20 Round Box 










BUFFALO BORES DEER GRENADE 45 COLT +P is a 260gr. massive hollow nosed, 12 BHN cast bullet with a gas check, traveling at the below velocities out of stock real world, over-the-counter firearms. Because this bullet is gas checked and properly lubed, it will NOT lead foul barrels.

We do not use the industry wide duplicitous practice of obtaining our advertised velocities out of extra long laboratory barrels, which give super high velocities the customer will never realize in the real world, where it actually matters.

1890 fps -- Marlin 1894, 20 inch
1526 fps -- Ruger Vaquero LARGE FRAME PRE 2006, 5.5 inch
1539 fps -- Freedom Arms mod. 97, 5.25 inch
1449 fps -- Ruger Redhawk, 4 inch

You’ll notice in one instance that a shorter barrel gave higher velocities than a longer barrel. This is not a typo.

This load is designed as the world’s premier deer load for the 45 Colt +P. The cast bullet is not considered hard, but neither is it soft. It is essentially a “medium” cast hardness with a BHN (Brinell Hardness Number) of 12. Pure lead is 4 and most hard cast bullets range from 15 to 25. It performs as follows:

At an impact velocity of 1,100 fps it will mushroom to about 80 cal. and should push right through any deer with a broadside shot.

At an impact velocity of 1,500 fps it will mushroom and some of the mushroom will fragment off and send bullet particles flying through the deer, but much of the mushroom and shank will remain intact and should push through any deer hit broadside.

At an impact velocity of 1,900 fps the entire mushroom will turn to shrapnel and send bullet particles all throughout the deer. The shank will remain intact, but will re-mushroom and do horrific damage inside the deer and will probably push through any deer hit broadside.

Of course, results will vary depending on how much bone, if any, is hit, etc... This load was designed specifically to do horrific damage to deer sized animals such as average black bear and hogs. It will make an incredible anti-personnel load if you can handle the recoil. It is flash suppressed and will not blind the shooter if used in low light when the criminal element and wild animals are most active.

The cartridge OAL is 1.585 inch and as such will chamber in any 45 colt firearm such as the Colt SAA or its clones, but firing this +P load in any firearm not designed for it would be disastrous, and could injure the shooter or bystanders. Please be responsible and use this load only in firearms designed to handle the pressure of +P ammunition. Use only in the following firearms:

All Ruger large frame revolvers chambered in 45 colt or 454 Casull. (never use +P ammo in the small frame New Model Vaquero—these revolvers were made from late 2006 and on—do not use in the New Model small frame Flat Top Ruger or ANY small frame Ruger)
All 1892 Winchesters and all copies of such made after 1920.
All Winchester and Marlin 1894 models.
Any break open action such as the T/C or Handi Rifle.
Any falling block action such as the Sharps or Winchester 1895.
Any Freedom Arms model 83 or 97.

If you are not responsible in using +P ammunition only in guns designed for use with +P ammunition, you potentially ruin it for all the responsible shooters that may eventually have +P 45 Colt ammunition removed from the market because of irresponsible use by a few. Please be thoughtful and careful in your firearm selection when using +P 45 colt ammunition."

box and what came with it


 The Millennium action is striker-fired 
 and operates in double-action-only (DAO) mode,
 meaning that it fires only by a consistent
 and repeatable long pull on the trigger. 
 And, much to my applause, 
 the Millennium action requires no pre-loading
 of the firing mechanism. In other words, 
 the Millennium pistol does not require any 
 rearward movement of the slide to pre-set 
 the striker springs or sear. Thus the PT145
 has repeat-strike capability, allowing a second trigger pull
 against any misfire without having to manually 
 cycle the slide to reset the trigger action."

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

The SIG516 16"" upper allow operators to upgrade their current AR-15/M16/M4-type rifles from direct gas impingement systems to the SIG SAUER advanced short-stroke pushrod system. This advanced operating system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched. A standard 5.56mm NATO chrome-lined chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded ½x28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts. All upper assemblies are shipped with a recoil buffer and action spring. These components must be installed to ensure proper function of the SIG516 upper assembly on your AR-type lower receiver.
