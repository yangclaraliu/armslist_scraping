The innovative BN 7x50 DC, MINOX has created a new generation of water sports binoculars allowing for trend-setting advantages as opposed to the presently available navigational binoculars containing conventional compass technologies. Thanks to its new technology, the BN 7x50 DC is fitted with a digital compass integrated right into the body of the binoculars. The analogue compasses fitted into conventional water sports binoculars typically protrude out of the body and greatly impair the handling of the binoculars. An advantage making the BN 7x50 DC a uniquely comfortable companion where ergonomics and functionality are concerned. At the simple push of a button, 360° all round information – all important information for the skipper are located right in the middle of the field of view. With the MINOX BN 7x50 DC you will never lose sight of essential data. All information is visible at the touch of a button – in the fraction of a second. With the digital compass display in the center of the field of view, you will never lose sight of the most important details. Outstanding optics are calculated and constructed at the highest of precision, MINOX optics from the Nautic Line offer maximum brilliance and clarity, brightness, contrast and resolution right down to the last detail as well as natural color rendition The MINOX Nautic Line binoculars are filled with nitrogen gas making them water tight and anti-fogging. Robust and non-slip rubber armouring: The MINOX Nautic Line binoculars are all covered in a particularly robust non-slip rubber armoring, ideal for rough use on water. With or without eyeglasses or sunglasses – the quickly adjustable eyecups of MINOX’s Nautic Line are comfortable for all usersWith the single ocular setting, MINOX Nautic Line binoculars remain sharp from 20 meters to infinity."

Everything was installed with care and the gun itself has been well maintained. In extra parts alone your looking at  around 700-800 dollars. Add in cost of the rifle, you're looking at 1300+ dollars. My asking price is 1,100 for the lot, optic included. Trade wise I'm not too interested in pistols/shotguns unless you've got a Saiga 12 or VEPR 12. Rifle wise I'm looking at other battle rifles, CETME, FAL, PTR91, VEPR's in .308 or 54r, etc. But cash is preferred.

As you can see in the pictures it can be bought as a package or the gun only.
Included in the package is a Streamlight TLR-1 HL 630 lumen light. I bought it a few weeks after I bought my 19. To my knowledge it is the brightest pistol light on the market. It is plenty bright enough for outside or in the house. I paid 140 or so for the light after shipping.
The box and all original papers will also come with it, along with 3 magazines. I also have a limbsaver grip sleeve on it right now you can have. It was around 10 bucks.
Last but not least it will come with a Crossbreed Supertuck holster. It has only been used a few times and is super comfortable. It takes weeks if you order from crossbreed to get one. They go for around 80 when bought from crossbreed and over 120 when bought on ebay.

O.C.G.A. § 16-11-132
Possession of a handgun by a person under the age of 18 years

Georgia law only covers possession of handguns by those 
""Under"" the age of 18 with varying circumstances, as well as those 21+. That means a person 18-20 can legally ""posses"" a handgun.


O.C.G.A. § 16-11-101.1
Furnishing pistol or revolver to person under the age of 18 years

This law relates to the sale of handguns in Georgia through a private party (you and I) sale. Once again, it only refers to those ""under"" the age of 18. The rest of the laws that apply to the sale of handguns and handgun ammunition in Georgia are federal laws which only apply to an FFL or manufacturer.

Having or carrying handguns, long guns, or other weapons; license requirement; exceptions for homes, motor vehicles, and other locations and conditions; penalties for violations

A person of age 18-20 is treated as an adult who does not have a Georgia Weapons Carry License, and must abide by those same rules. Those rules, in short, mean that the handgun may not leave the confines of my home (property of said home included), motor vehicle, and/or place of business"

The action was purchased along with a collection of small parts to assemble it.  I believe, but do not know or guarantee all the parts are present.  It is a rimfire breech block.  The half-octagon barrel is from a Husqvarna shotgun as is the stock and forearm.  The barrel was shortened to 20"".  Included in the sale is a barrel I am told is a Green Mountain .45 colt barrel blank.

For the discerning female shooter who appreciates Italian design and craftsmanship. The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use.

The new WITNESS PAVONA is beautifully designed, elegantly packaged and sparkles when you hold it; a sophisticated pistol for the woman that desires everything.

--Just because your AR-15 has optics and an after-market grip does not make it a ""custom"" rifle.
--Most of us know one Generation of Glock from another, but as a courtesy go ahead and provide that info.
--Most buyers need and want more than just ""Winchester 30-30"" in the description. Is it an XTR, Ranger, Commemorative? Year of manufacture?
--Why are you asking more for your gun that what I can buy a new one for?
--A Llama 45ACP is not worth $450 no matter what you think.
--Know your AR-15 chambers. Is it .223 Rem, 5.56 NATO, or .223 Wylde?
--A 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 year old gun is not ""new"" whether it's been fired or not.
--Just because you built it does not make it worth more.
--Of course we've got pro- and anti-union users of this site, so I'm sure I'll ruffle some feathers with this next one. I'm going to peg on Colt...
Colt has a union represented by UAW (WFT?) and for about the past 35 years has done nothing but manufacture over-priced sub-standard firearms. (Do just a little research and learn how they screwed around and lost the M16A2 contract.) At one time the Rampant Colt truly deserved its premium price and prestige--but those days are long gone. If you want to dish out over a grand for a run of the mill 1911 that has the Colt name on it, go ahead, it's your money. If you want a REAL QUALITY 1911 that won't send you to the poor house, look into the Ruger SR1911CMD.

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380, a micro compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""Zero-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a stainless steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine, and real windage adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. a steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, five pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide barrel and internal parts are all hard coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

It is intended as a minimal sized survival rifle.  It folds in half and can be put in a backpack or under car seat very easily.  
The rear peep sight is fully adjustable for windage and elevation. 

I have also added paracord on the gun barrel and stock.  The purpose for this was putting a bare piece of metal to your face while trying to aim is either cold (during the winter) or hot (in the summer).  The paracord does not get hot or cold so it keeps you comfortable shooting it within the elements.  

I also made ranger bands and put them on the rear of the stock and behind the trigger to harness more 22lr rounds.  this way you will be able to carry 16 extra rounds with you at all times.  

I will include 100 rnds of Thunderbolt 22lr ammo so you will be able to shoot if you have no ammo.  

I am located in Bolivar so please do not ask me to drive all the way to springfield or nixa.  We will have to work out location.
