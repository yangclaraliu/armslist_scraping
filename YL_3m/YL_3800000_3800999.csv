THIS GUN NO MATTER WHAT IS GOING BY FRIDAY NIGHT, SO CONTACT ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH OFFERS. THANK YOU!

Ive got a used Remington 870 Express Magnum 20 GA pump action shotgun that features a 20 1/2"" vent rib barrel with front brass bead sight, solid hardwood furniture (the newest models have cheap looking laminate stocks), youth length of pull stock, dark matte finish, capable of accepting 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells, and I believe it has a full remington choke in it (im not entirely sure, as I dont have a choke tube removal tool at the moment).

Overall condition is good/very good with a few wear marks on the barrel and wood, but overall it is good looking shotgun and it is mechanically 100%. This would make a excellent christmas present for a wife or the kids, as this shotgun is lightweight and the lenght of pull on the stock is short.

Im asking $275 or best offer for this shotgun, and im open to a few possible partial trades but id prefer cash. Only possible trades im interested in at the moment will be listed below, and you can either email me or call/text at REDACTED. I would prefer texting out of all the communication options for ease of communication and being able to remember both your phone number and the terms of the transaction. The only downside about all of this is that im unavailable to trade till friday night (12/12/14) but im available all throughout the coming weekend. Thank you."

The only reason I'm keeping this ad up for a while longer is because I'm having internet issues and can't seem to reply to the dozen or so people that are asking about it via email.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience and I will delete this ad as soon as I can get my email working again - thanks for understanding.

I'm selling this for less than it's probably worth because I need the money as soon as possible for the vet for my dog; otherwise I would keep it. I'm going to have to sell some other firearms and stuff too, so please check out my other listings if you have a minute. This rifle looks absolutely brand new and could easily be given as a Christmas present. I shot exactly 100 rounds though it and it is perfect. The BX-25 magazine and one of the factory 12 round magazines were never used. The bore snake was used just once for an infield cleaning after I shot the 100 rounds, then I cleaned and lightly oiled the gun at home afterwards. 

** It's not in the picture, but I'm also including 1,800 rounds of Federal and/or Winchester .22 LR ammo **

All together with the ammo this would cost over $450 to buy new, but like I said I need the money as soon as possible so the first $300 gets a real nice deal.

The barrel and receiver have both been recently coated in Brownells moly resin and the foregrip and buttstock have recently been sanded, stained, and waxed.  I've had the rifle for 11.5 years now (first gun I ever purchased) and hate to part with it but my girlfriend, friends, and family get expensive around this time of year. The rifle has been cleaned after every use and is ready to take out on the range.  A copy (paper and electronic) of the takedown and reassembly manual will be included with the rifle.  I will also include approximately 100 .22 long rifle (Winchester 36 grain, 1280 fps, hollow point copper plated) rounds to the purchaser as well.

The receiver needs a little work if the purchaser wants to ensure unfettered rapidfire cycling. As seen in the pics, the upper left portion of the receiver  bolt port is chipped. The rifle fires very accurately and well; however, due to the chip the bolt *occasionally* locks to the rear when rapid firing. When slow firing/plinking (generally with a minimum of 1-2 seconds between shots) the bolt will cycle fine.

Would be a great first rifle for a youngster or someone new to the sport of shooting/hunting. My grandfather taught me how to shoot on a very similar setup when I was young and would love to see it go to a family/young person wanting to learn as well. Would also be great for someone interested in very basic gunsmithing and or receiver repair. 

I also have a 4x (non-adjustable) Timber King scope I use on the rifle that I'm willing to throw in to the right buyer.

More pictures are on my harddrive and am willing to send them to serious inquirers.

This was an impulse buy back in April and I've sent only 71 rounds down the pipe, so it's lightly used. It's a fun gun and would make a good home defense/truck gun, I just don't have a place for it in my life now so I'm passing it on. I'm located in the Beaverton area and can do some travel. Bill of Sale and/or CHL needed for my own CYA .

**For you People Out There That Don't Know What Type Of Trigger It Is, Here's The Description Directly From Bill Geissele's Web Page:

The Geissele 2 Stage (G2S) was designed to be a high quality, cost effective option of the SSA. The G2S is a 4.5lb. non-adjustable combat trigger that is a precision two-stage trigger and allows precise and accurate trigger control. The G2S is manufactured from the same tool steel as the SSA. Visually, from the outside of the weapon there is no difference from the SSA and the feel and reliability is the same. The G2S however has a different way of holding the hammer pin in place, there is no laser markings, and the parts are only spot checked for MP

Money (per the person initiating this scam) was to be sent to 

Helen C Mcloon
1434 Secret Hill Lane
Jacksonville FL 32234

This person (who told me her name was Helen Mcloon via e-mail) used a text number of REDACTED (area code from Idaho, but address in Florida ??).  When I called the number after I recieved her first text, went to some answering machine.  The person then replied via text that they were at work and could text, but not call.  Geeze, wonder where they work LOL

This low life scam artist used a e-mail address of REDACTED

People, if a price is REALLY good and the person listing the ad is unregistered, PLEASE just ask for some basic questions, such as contact info or who the FFL gun is going to ship from.

The kicker is, this douche bag who was trying to scam me still thinks they're getting their money.

This is a great website, it's just pathetic we have people who have no qualms with ripping others off.

If I've broken any rules of Armlist (which I didn't see), I apologize.

This 9mm Colt Carbine is setup as a great training rifle similar to a 5.56 variant. The bore is shiny, the magazine looks barely used, the rifle is in overall great shape. The box and manual come with the rifle but are not pictured. Payment must be through  Money Order and certified check,I will not ship until all funds have posted to my account."

STATUS: Still waiting on my FFL to receive the gun from Glock. You can contact me to reserve the gun ahead of time. Will attach photos once the gun comes in.

STATUS UPDATE (12/13/14): Based on what I've read online, I don't anticipate my FFL receiving the gun until the week of Christmas at the earliest. I have also had several inquiries. Rather than being a jerk and raising the price on you, I'll just do a random drawing. So let me know if you're interested and I'll add your name to the drawing.

UPDATE (1/1/15): I tried calling Glock to find out when they expect to have it shipped to my FFL, but their GSSF staff seem to be off for the holidays until January 5. Those of you that have expressed interest, I'll let you know as soon as I find out when it'll get to me, and if you're still interested I'll keep you in the drawing. $500 ain't bad for a brand new G30 Gen4, so thanks for being patient."

One form needs to be a Va. drivers license and the other can be a Conceal carry permit of a voters registration card. No other forms will be accepted. Thank you for looking."

You can shoot 22LR, 22 long, and 22 short out of it. First $220 cash/firm takes it.

 Description: 
 The Micro Might handgun is a five shot, fixed cylinder mini-revolver. It is designed around an historical and simple single action mechanism. By ""fixed cylinder"" means that the cylinder does not swing out of the frame for loading and unloading. Removal of the cylinder is accomplished by removing the cylinder base pin and taking the cylinder completely out of the frame. By ""single action"" means that the trigger performs only one function: it releases the hammer.
 Ammunition Warning
 Micro Might Inc. produces and sells Micro Might handguns designed and chambered for two different calibers. The intended caliber is noted both on the shipping and storage box and on the barrel of the Micro Might handgun itself. If your revolver is chambered for 22LR, any good quality factory made 22 caliber ammunition in long rifle, long or short may be safely used in the revolver. The revolver will also safely handle high velocity 22 ammunition.
 If your revolver is chambered for 22WMRF ammunition, ONLY USE 22WMRF cartridges. This designation stands for 22 caliber Winchester Magnum Rimfire ammunition. Use of standard 22 caliber ammunition in the 22WMRF revolvers can result in malfunctions and serious injuries.

ONE TIME in about 2003 did they sell a supply to a civilian distributor before signing exclusive agreements that mean it is only sold to agencies. 

Four years ago Accutec ceased fabricating projectiles and now they only lease their patents to governments so that they may make them for their own use.

I purchased the remaining world supply of Accutec projectiles in civilian hands. I have one retailer that is selling the Accutec RRLP projectiles in .40, 9mm and .45 at present, www.eabco.com

I have a very, very limited supply of 5.56mm projectiles available. I believe they are 82grains each but because of their greater density and compactness, clients have had success loading them into AR platforms.

Please do not attempt to offer barter on these and I will not take less than asking price. When they are gone, they are gone forever and no civilian will ever have another legal source for this product.

They are sold in boxes of 3000 projectiles for you to load as you wish. I have 3 boxes remaining at present. 

A box is $0.40 per projectile x 3000 = $1200.00 per case.

Hold the PX4 Storm Compact and you'll immediately realize that this handgun can do it all. Perfectly sized and balanced, it is equally suited for concealed carry, home- or personal defense as well as recreational shooting. With its full grip, full-capacity magazine, accessory rail and interchangeable backstraps, you will get a further sense of its versatility. But it is at the shooting range that this double/single-action compact handgun will truly wow you: thanks to its rotary barrel system, recoil dissipates radially, resulting in much less thump in your hand and super-fast follow-up shots.


An Ultra-Reliable Professional Choice for Holster Carry

As you read this, the PX4 Storm in its various configurations is being carried by countless law-enforcement and military organizations around the world, in every environment imaginable. This is because it is engineered to be absolutely reliable and ultra-durable, and it is capable of shooting well over 100,000 rounds without any part breakage. And its dimensions that fall right in between the full-size PX4 Storm and its sub-compact counterpart make it perfect for everyday holster carry (concealed or open), offering light weight and smaller proportions while still affording a full grip.



Modular, Easy to Customize and Full of User-Friendly Choices

The Px4 Storm Compact offers a plethora of features that make it easily adaptable to your preferences. Its modular construction allows you to interchange backstraps to perfectly fit your hand and shooting style, while the slide lock and safety are ambidextrous; in addition, the magazine release is reversible, meaning that you can easily train with and use your PX4 with either hand. Other features include a retractable lanyard loop, as well as user-adjustable sights and a number of accessories that make this pistol a true champion in its class.


Safe, Easy to Use and Maintain

This handgun offers intuitive controls and an absolutely safe mechanism. In a holster or purse, an automatic firing-pin block and a manual safety enable you to confidently carry it all day--day after day, without any worries. Furthermore, it is easy to use and take apart for cleaning, and its tough Bruniton finish make it even more trouble-free to maintain. In short, the PX4 Storm Compact will give you years and years--and thousands upon thousands of rounds--of reliable service, accuracy and safety for personal or home defense."
