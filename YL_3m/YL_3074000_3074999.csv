Like new in the box. 170 rounds fired.  All original factory stuff.  
This is the updated version of the classic 1911.  The ejection on the 1991 is improved to provide cleaner ejection and allow less debris & contamination to enter through the ejection port.  The new design improves firing dependability in dirty environments, with lower cost (dirtier) ammo, high volume rapid firing or heavy volume between cleanings.  
This is not a cheap imitation, knock off or low quality copy of the classic 1911.  Except for ejection, it is the same pistol, same design, same operation, same feel, same American craftsmanship, with a lot of interchangeable parts.  A purist might argue potato potato but I'm not picky enough to spend a few hundred dollars over pronounciation;  for the cost, the 1991 is a better buy than the 1911.  And at this price, you are saving an additional few hundred dollars + tax       
Bought the pistol and a bunch of ammo for my wife.  She didn't care for it so I'm selling it.  I have enough 45's without this one and I'm starting to downsize.  I'll throw in up to 15 boxes of ammo at $20.00 each (saves a few bucks per box + no tax).  With my wife not shooting the 45, I'm a bit overstocked in ammo.

With my upgraded sights and trigger on this G36, the Springfield has almost nothing on this pistol. The Glock 36 is a little bit bigger than the XDs, but is the same weight, has a longer sight radius, and will get better velocity from your 45acp rounds. Plus, it holds an extra round over the XDs, which explains the slightly taller height.

-6+1 capacity (one more round than XDs-45)
-Single stack (1.1"" width, 3.8"" barrel)
-3 magazines, one comes with Pearce pinkie extension
-Perfect condition except for a bit of wear on the muzzle end of the slide. No scratches anywhere, and the frame is perfect.
-Grip plug installed

Upgraded trigger
-Ghost 3.5' connector
-6' Trigger spring, 6' striker spring, lightened safety spring
-This trigger is super smooth with a very positive and SHORT reset. It isn't super-lightened since this is a carry gun, just much better than stock!
-NOTE: If preferred, I would be willing to install brand new OEM parts to return this to a stock trigger setup, instead of the Ghost trigger, for the same price.

Upgraded sights
-TruGlo H3 sights!
-These combine green fiber optic rods for daytime light and tritium for nighttime. I cannot completely explain how awesome these sights are! Most tritium night sights are barely visible if there is any light at all, except for the white paint around the vials. You can see the glow of these sights even in daytime in your house. VERY bright!

Has had a few things added to it. The rifle itself is just 800$. For a total of 1000$ the scope and scope mount come with. It has a few scratches from where screws have been tightened, where the safety slides across the receiver and on the muzzle device has been tightened down. These are purely cosmetic and the function of the rifle is flawless. It has been fired 75 times since first unboxed and never experienced a malfunction.

For 800$ you get:
*20.5"" Vepr
*Rifle Dynamics Ak-Ar stock adapter allowing it to take any mil spec AR-15 buffer tube and stock
* ACE Skeleton Stock
*A2 buffer tube
*Magpul Ak grip
*Carolina Shoot Supply Buckshot Vepr handguard
*Cnc Warrior original Russian muzzle device 14x1LH

For 1000$ all of the above and:
*Kvar KV-04s Side Scope Mount
*AR Stoner 1"" Scope Mount
*Vortex 3-9x40 with V-Plex reticle

The screws that hold the stock adapter in have been thread locked down so the adapter will not wiggle out of the receiver. This model of Vepr will not work well with most POSP scopes because the integrated sights on the gas block won't let the scope slide all the way forward and lock in place. The Kvar mount doesn't have this problem as it is a weaver railed side mount that lets you mount any western scope rings/bases and optic well above the gas block. When shouldering the rifle with the scope mount on the cheek weld and eye relief are nearly perfect.

Any additional pictures can be taken on request."

This is possibly the most fun .22 Ive ever had. The trigger is light and crisp with about a 4lb pull. As fast as you can pull the trigger it goes bang. Check out the youtube link at the bottom.

My 11 year old niece did it.

Im the original owner and there are no mods made to it. Its truly LIKE NEW. I still have the warranty card! The only reason Im selling my precious UZI is I want a 3rd Gen Glock 21 or 30.

It's designation is 'Midsize G.I.', and it is a beauty. Never-fired, touched once with gloves to inspect, then placed in the Plano case and put into the safe. Also included are 1,000 brand new Armscor .45 ACP brass bullets, that I bought specifically for the pistol. In addition, I also bought a very tough Plano Protector pistol carrying case with a nice 'wavey' bubble interior for maximum protection, as well as three Chip McCormick magazines, widely regarded as the best 1911 magazines you can buy. The total cost came out to $1,221.46, but to keep it simple I'm just going to say $1,200.

I was very, very excited to take this shooting. This was going to be my first pistol, but I've decided to finish my Mosin-Nagant collection first.

I'm not looking to make a profit on this; I am trying to complete my Mosin-Nagant collection, I'm only a few rifles away.


The price is firm. Like I said, I'm not trying to make a profit, but I'm not selling a brand new gun and bullets for less than their actual value, either. Strictly speaking I'm already losing money, I just want these gone. This is a first-come, first-served. Cash takes precedence.


Please, unless you are offering multiple Mosin-Nagants (or clone rifles chambered in 7.62x54R), I will have to decline your offer. The only firearm I need at the moment are Mosins, plural.


Feel free to email me at REDACTED anytime for more detailed pictures or questions.

It would be easiest for the buyer to come directly to my home, as that's where all the items are anyways, but I am willing to meet anywhere in the Portland area. Please bear in mind I have very odd weekends from work 'Wed-Thur', so we might have to juggle schedules a bit.

I took this on trade not too long ago.  From what I read, the 10-6 model was made between 1962 and 1977.  It's in excellent shape givin it's age.  It doesn't appear to have been fired much.  Lock up it tight and trigger pull is very nice in both double and single action.  It does have a wider target type hammer spur.  There is a slight holster wear along barrel, closest to the muzzle.  The front ramp was painted red/orange that actually looks decent.  Currently has a set of Hogue combat rubber grips.

Comes with the following:
-150rds FMJ .38SPL
-about 50rds mixed .38spl defense type ammo (some +p)
-2 additional sets of grips (Pachmyer and original wood Magnas each set comes with grip screw)
-2 Bianchi speed strips
-new police type old school belt holster
-red plastic pistol box/case

I don't have the original box or papers.

Yes you are correct our prices are out of line. I tasked one of our guys to reactivate our listings on armslist and these were from over a year ago and we did forget to update the current pricing. Our fault, so sorry but this reinforces our apprehension of using armslist because of the proliferation of dick faces such as yourself. We are currently selling the 9mm at your mentioned price levels and so sorry we made a mistake. Please take this time to take a step back and go fuck yourself. We sell a lot of ammo at very competitive prices and dont need your business if you insist on being a fucking troll bitch meat son of a bitch. Thank you for your feedback and if we didn't make ourself clear...go fuck yourself and fuck armslist and the scumbag pieces of shit it attracts. Have a great day dick face.

The first $895 takes this gun.

This gun is a 2013 unfired 1911 Series 80 Government model 45 Auto. It was bought  new last summer and has been stored in a gun safe since. It has been oiled and maintained, but never fired. The barrel is polished stainless steel and is in perfect condition, with no scratches or rust. Likewise, the bluing on the gun is in 100% condition, with no blemishes, scratches, or rust. It has checkered Rosewood grips, raised 3-dot sights, a lowered ejection port, and an extended trigger (all factory). In short the gun is ""new"", as it's the same condition as the day it left the Colt factory. It's a beautiful gun, and comes in it's original Colt factory case. I also have 2 extra Wilson Combat 8-round mags that are included, along with a heavy duty 18.5 pound Wolff recoil spring kit (which also includes a heavy duty firing pin spring). These extra items are a $100 value.

Once again, the first $900 takes this gun. I can be reached at REDACTED (no texts), or at REDACTED. All potential buyers must be 21 or over and Kentucky residents. Cash only. I can meet any potential buyer either in Owensboro or at any place a reasonable distance from Owensboro, so long as it's a location in Kentucky.

I would also consider a trade for a Glock 41 Gen 4. Contact me for details of any trade of this nature.

Additionally, I also have around 300 rounds of new .45 ACP ammo that I will sell at a great price."
