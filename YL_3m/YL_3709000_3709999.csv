Less than 50 rounds fired.
Gun Condition is 99%
.45 ACP
2 Mags included (1 with pinky ext.)
Hogue grips as well as standard 1911 grips included.

Extremely Accurate, concealable and reliable. My husband says that this gun outperforms his kimber ultra and his dan wesson mini (eco I think?)

It is in the line of the ""mini 1911's"" BUT uses Hi-Cap double stack magazines. 

The only difference of the picture and the actual gun is that it has been duracoated in black since that photo was taken. So the furniture controls are all black. 

The only reason I am selling is because my husband bought me a different gun that uses smaller bullets and is just easier for me to handle."

The aged blued finish on the gun is beautiful. This particular model is a flip up or tip up barrel. Having the longer barrel and being dated pre 1968 makes this gun hard to find especially in this condition with no rust and minimal wear. Shoots well and pretty accurate. Have one magazine which holds 6 rounds and one can be chambered. Can either manually load a round in the tip up or pull the slide back chambering a round from the magazine like most larger semi automatic guns. Bore is nice and parts/action are still tight. Make an offer will consider reasonable cash amounts or trades. Will certainly trade for a nice Sig Sauer in 9mm, 357 or 45. Will throw some cash in for mk 25 or p226 tacops.

Has slight sound in engine, mechanic said it is MOST LIKELY a stuck lifter that needs replaced, but possibly needs a wrist pin replaced on a piston.

If you practice with ""Managed Recoil"" loads, what's going to happen when you have to shoot those full power hollow points you carry?  Will you be surprised by the recoil? You might not be holding the pistol tightly enough.  

Then again, you don't want to spend dump money into the backstop at the range by shooting hollow points for practice either.  

I have a single sealed box of 120 rounds of Federal .45 ACP ammo.  It really is an ingenious concept.  If you've just bought a .45 and need to practice with it before it becomes your CCW gun, this is a perfect deal.  If you just want some practice ammunition and some jacketed hollow point ammo for defense, it's a good deal, too.  Otherwise you could buy this one box and add to your overall supply of practice and defense ammo.

Both the practice ammo and the defense ammo are 230 grain bullets, so theoretically, you'll have the same recoil, muzzle flip and recovery in practice as you will get if you ever have to fire the Hydra-Shok defense ammo, when your life may depend on that second or third round."

The Bear Domain is one bow below the Method in Bear's bow line up. Although the Method is only $50 more on its MSRP there are many differences. The Bear Method is a dual cam bow and is 18 fps faster on its IBO. The Domain, however, is a more comfortable and forgiving bow to shoot. It seems to be a little more of a ""hunting"" bow, although either would work fine for hunting. The Method has 5% less let off and .25"" less brace height. Their weights are the same. Both of these bows have great value, however, for only $50 more it seems that the Method may have a little more to offer.

The Domain is what a hunting bow is. It will be more than able to harvest any big game that one could hunt. Recreational 3D shooting would also be fine for this bow and would probably satisfy the majority of shooters. It has great comfort, decent speed, and is very easy to adjust to fit a large range of shooters. Archers on a budget, entry level or experienced could find this bow just right for them.

6.5x20x50 PA -- $385
6.5x20x44 PA -- $350

Both have the BDC Reticle as well as the tactical style turrets with quick set zero when uncapped.  The side knob parallax allows quick and easy parallax adjustments from 50 yards out to infinity.  This also allows you to set the focus to your eyes and never touch it again.  Simply adjust the parallax to the correct yardage and it is focused for that range.  30 mm tubes gives a much larger range of adjustment as well as more durability.  And as far as durability goes, Vortex's warranty is like nothing else in the industry.  If you are unfamiliar, check it out.   No one comes close when it comes to value, features and warranty.  The only scopes I have seen under $1000 with better glass are the Zeiss' in the $800+ range.  To me, these are better glass than Leupold VX-3s.

The 6.5x20x50 has one area where the surface black shows wear on the zoom adjustment.  One of the pictures represents this area.  Other than that, the scope is in flawless condition.

The 6.5x20x44 is in like new condition.

Both scopes have seen the range less then a handful of times and have never been hunted.  The 50mm is just over 2 years old and the 44mm is less than 2.  Nearly their entire life has been spend just sitting in the safe which is the reason I am selling them.  I just don't think I will ever have the opportunity to hunt. 

I prefer to sell locally but will ship with PayPal payment and buyer picking up shipping/PayPal expense.  I will also be in the Dallas, TX area between 26 Nov and 3 Dec."

When I got it the throttle adjustment was set at half so they couldn't go fast. Don't under estimate the power of these bikes. I had 3 brothers, all over 6'4"" that bought these new back then and loved riding the Allegheny mountains on them.

Below is a write up from their website if you are unfamiliar with A-TACS.

A-TACS is a new and radical advancement in camo design and technology. Most digital camo patterns use small square pixels. A-TACS by way of comparison uses very small organically shaped pixels. The end result is that all the hard 90 degree angles of a typical pixel are removed which creates a camo pattern that has a more natural appearance.

Taking this process a step further the small organically shaped pixels are placed within larger groupings to create a ""pattern within a pattern"". This radical advancement means that A-TACS is able to conceal the operator far more effectively and at greater distances vs many other camo patterns.

The line of A-TACS ACUs from Propper will be made to military specifications. The initial line of clothing will be made from a 65/35 poly/cotton ripstop fabric which is designed for maximum durability."

The two long mags in the middle are both DC Eng. and the short one on the far right has no markings. 

These are the most reliable due to the heavy gauge metal construction plus the easiest to adjust because of the single flat bar in front.

Includes a large sun shade.  An awesome scope. Very good glass. The tube does show an area on the back with dings, and someone thought about sanding it down to paint. It is simply cosmetic, and does not affect the function of the scope. Text for more pictures of the rifle. This outfit is a shooter, not a looker, but would be nice for a cerakote project if you wanted it to look the part. Asking $625 for the entire outfit, or would separate and take $400 for the rifle and $250 for the scope. Theses cash prices are fair for the models and the condition. Trades will be considered on a case by case, but I will not trade both for a Glock, or two high points, so please don't waste our time. Trade value should be closer to $700 than to $600.
