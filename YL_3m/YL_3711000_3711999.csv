Greetings - I have a slightly used and meticulously cared for Sig Sauer P250 Sub Compact chambered in 9mm.   Comes with (3) 12 round magazines, 50 rounds of hollow point, 20 founds of FMJ, and 60 rounds of the good-stuff (Federal Hydrashock), AND a Fobus holster (not pictures).  Slightly used means ~100 rounds.

This incredibly versatile pistol system by Sig Sauer allows you to use the Fire Control Unit (FCU) in any of Sig Sauer's P-250 grip modules, so you could buy different sized grips, slides/barrels and use in any configuration you can dream of, including full-sized, compact and sub-compact in 9mm, .357sig, .40, and .45ACP.    

This pistol features SigLite night sights, a custom polish and trigger job, polished feed-ramp, and a rare railed grip module (for mounting lights, lasers, etc).

Asking $500 or best offer.  Will ship to your favorite FFL in the lower 48 contiguous states for $25.   Face to face for Florida residents (with a Florida drivers license)"

From LaRue's catalog: 
Building off the success of our highly-accurate and reliable OBR 7.62, we set out to apply the same proven design features into a 5.56 rifle. The result is a lightweight, and reliable, tack driver that remains cool…even after high-rates of fire. The barrel and barrel nut does not touch the handguard at any point, so there is very little heat-transfer to your support hand. Like its 7.62mm sibling, both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum, for the optimum fit and consistency...translating into maximum accuracy. Even though this is a complete rifle, the upper will fit to any Mil-Spec AR15/M16 type lower."

A favorite of many hunters and shooters, the Short Rifle was fast to the shoulder, quick-swinging, lightweight and a pleasure to shoot. It was a favorite of the range rider who could snatch it from his saddle scabbard and fire faster than prairie lightning. The new Winchester® Model 94® Short Rifle has a compact 20"" deeply-blued round barrel and a straight grip walnut stock. It has a rifle-style forearm, black grip cap and a full-length magazine. It’s drilled and tapped for scope mounts, and a hammer spur extension is included with the rifle. The sights are traditional with a semi-buckhorn rear and a Marble Arms® gold bead at the muzzle. With the new Short Rifle Model 94 there’s a lot of fun waiting in the saddle, in the field or at the range.

NO import marks!  This gun is absolutely correct and original.  It has a 4.25"" barrel and overall length is 7"".  An FFL or C&R is required for transfer. The gun is in overall excellent condition.  Only minor marks and scratches to the baked black enamel finish which is seen regularly on these guns.  The barrel is strong and the gun functions flawlessly.  However, I am not a gunsmith and therefore you should have it check by a professional before shooting.  Must ship to an FFL and is C&R eligible.  Buyer is responsible to know your local gin laws and ensure its safe to own in your area.  The cost is $450.00 PLUS shipping. 

about the gun.   According to Medlin & Huon ,Military Handguns of France, 1858 to 1958; “The German ordnance designation for the weapon was 625(f). The Germans maintained quality control, with the standards of manufacture the same as with French-made arms. The finish on the pieces remained the same, as did that of the magazines.” Magazine bottoms were blank once they started production but utilized the captured 35_A marked magazines for the first few thousand guns produced.  “The German military acceptance stamp is on the left side of the frame, between and slightly below the 1935A and SACM marks. The first group is stamped Waffenamt 655 (Eagle 655), starting with serial number B701A and  ending with serial number B1250A.  Afterwards Waffenamt 251 was then used (Eagle WaA 251), until the end of manufacture, the last pistol being serial numbered D4550A.”   Only a total of 23,850 German accepted guns were produced!  
Futhermore , Medlin & Huon state that; “During the run of Eagle 655 pistols, breech blocks and barrels have the 655 stamps. The change to the standard eagle with swastika on the barrel came with the change to WaA251. In the late 'B' series, numbering of the breech block to match the serial number began. Between C3341 and C6327, the barrel was given a two digit mark to match the last two digits of the serial number. This continued to the last of the German arms. Thus a pistol after C6327 should have military proof on the barrel, the last two numbers of the serial number on the barrel and breech, and Eagle WaA251 on the slide.” 
Therefore this gun having an early serial number of B3658A, is absolutely correct to have a non-numbered breech block as well as just having the eagle with swastika marked barrel and with a captured 35_A marked magazine!"

Description:
The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

This new P226 TACPAC bundle now includes the SIG STL-900 Weapons Light with strobe feature and integrated Laser System. In addition you receive a holster specially built to fit the pistol with the STL-900 which is not available outside of the TACPAC bundle!

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer. Comes with factory holster.

The SIG Sauer P229 is widely recognized by SIG pistol fans as one of the best designed and proportioned of the SIG P series pistols. The P229, in some ways, builds on the compact P228 9mm. However, the short and heavy slide of the P229 has no counterpart in a full-size pistol. Many American law enforcement officers, including the Secret Service and Federal Air Marshals, use the P229. As peace officers using the SIG may rightly state, “When the brass chooses the SIG for the rank and file, you know they have not purchased the low bid.”

The trigger reduces Trigger pre-travel and over-travel by approximately 20%. It features a flat face with a center mounted pivoting safety. The center mounted pivoting safety bar prevents unintended operation by creating a trigger block that will not disengage unless the shooter places their finger directly on the trigger face. The flat, smooth face trigger causes the shooter to place their finger on the center line of the trigger and encourages trigger manipulation directly in line with the bore axis. This changed the gun completely, it's faster and smoother.  Gun comes with 3, 15 round magazines, original case and paperwork.  You can see the upgraded trigger in the picture,.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s

need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, 4 extended 8 round magazines, front and rear checkering, and Ergo XT grips"
