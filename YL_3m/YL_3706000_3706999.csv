Boat is about 15'. One of the great things is that it seats 6 but small enough to fit in a garage. Engine runs good. Recently replaced a power pack, spark plugs, lower unit oil, pee line. It's considered a run-about. 

I was only able to use it twice this past summer so I'd like for it to go to someone that actually has the time to enjoy it.

I used it for fishing since the back is so open but my wife liked using the bench seats in the front for getting sun. Use the ladder for swimming and tubing. Includes trailer (tail lights just re-wired), prop was just completely refurbished, boat cover. Can hook up to water muffs to run the outboard for you.

It pains me to do so.

This is my CZ-40P. These were a limited edition pistol made by CZ and are noted to be extremely comfortable, accurate, and reliable. Mine is the most accurate .40 caliber pistol I have ever owned. It's in mint condition and if you know what a CZ is, keep reading. This one has been professionally gunsmithed and has an extremely smooth and crisp trigger. The rails inside have also been polished to 2000 grit. So the pistol is SMOOTH. While being 'smithed, I also had the feedramp polished and a stainless guiderod fitted. There is really nothing left to do on it.

It comes as-packaged by the factory with its original box, sight adjustment Allen key, and its original snap cap - and owner's manual. Two factory magazines and the factory speed reloader also come with it.

The CZ-40P also has night sights. I will also include a Blackhawk holster with it. These holsters are hard to find, and it is a Level 3 retention holster with a push button release.

Not only is it my most accurate semiauto pistol, it's also the most comfortable one to grip and fire that I have ever owned. I have NEVER had a malfunction with it. Accuracy is good enough to reliably hit empty shotgun shells at 25-35 yards.

Contact me through Armslist with your phone number if you would like to see it in Santa Fe. I used to put my phone number here, but I got tired of Nigerian scammers offering me a small fortune if I would only send them a check, lol.

I am selling this pistol cheap, but when you see it, you will understand it is certainly not a cheap pistol. Bring your cash because you'll like it.

HECKLER & KOCH - VP9 - PISTOL - CALIBER: 9mm - STRIKER FIRED - BROWNING RECOIL OPERATED - TRIGGER PULL: 5.4lbs - MAGAZINES: 2 - CAPACITY: 15 ROUND - SIGHT RADIUS: 6.38"" - BARREL LENGTH: 4.09"" - WEIGHT W/EMPTY MAG: 26.56oz. - WEIGHT LOADED: 32oz. - INTERCHANGEABLE GRIP PANELS -  Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail  

 In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.  Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. 

 HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. 

 The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. 

 The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. 

 Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. 

 A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. 

 The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. 

 The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. 

 HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. 

 The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. 

 Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis."

These have night vision settings as well as 7 daytime settings. The battery lasts 3 years on a medium setting and always on. Uses 1/3N batteries, available at most stores. Very solid, almost bomb proof, red dot that stays on for years. No need to fumble with dials or buttons in a dangerous moment. These units are always on. I have several available in the same condition. All were purchased from the army DRMO. These are legitament issued units that were legaly purchased. Not ""bring back"" with questionable past."

I've sighted the scope in and can hit a milk jug from 200yds on a good day. I was shooting close to 200grain but it handled it like it was a normal round, minus the bigger kick of course. It's always been scrubbed down and coated with oil and bore butter after the range or a hunting trip. 

I love the adrenaline you get from knowing you only have one shot more then likely(unless your very fast and have a round and pellets set to go). Your also far more likely to draw those hard to get Elk tags around here then a guy with a center fire rifle. The ultimate and true sportsman's gun.

HexID Color Identification System – Why Guess- Ammo Identifier

We believe that marking your magazine should not be a home improvement project. Over the years we have marked our magazines using many different methods such as tape and paint. We found that colored electrical tape made our magazine marking standout when viewed from a distance. There was no need to check letters, numbers or other text, the colored tape worked just fine as an ammo identifier. Our HexID Color Identification System Is based on the principle that color is the simplest way to mark your magazines. So we incorporated color into our ammo identifier design.

Not only does our HexID color identification system eliminate the messy task of adding paint or tape, it can be changed in less than a minute. Finding a particular magazine in a mag pouch, gear bag or a storage cabinet has never been easier. Our colors may be bright but you can be assured you’re not hanging Christmas lights on your rifle. Blends in perfectly with your lifestyle either at the range or in the woods.

HexID is the perfect complement for three gun competitions, prepper storage, law enforcement officers and anyone who uses more than one brand of ammunition or multiple caliber rifles.

High visibility, easy to see colors in critical situations. Why risk your gun your life your reputation or family by loading the wrong ammunition. HexID “Safe Color Choices”, all it takes is one minute."

I just purchased this spring of '14 and only have enough rounds through to sight in the scope. It is a single shot, break open style rifle similar to the Blaser K95. It is incredibly lightweight, only pushing the scales at 5 lb 8 oz without scope, just another 15 oz with scope, making this an absolute breeze to carry in the field. It has an easily adjustable 3 position trigger weight from 2.5 to 4 lbs. Beautiful wood on the stock, which is what first lured me to it. Engravings on one side of two rams feeding, the other side has a running whitetail buck. The gun is broken down without tools into an easily transportable size and the scope mount is a quick disconnect that when re-installed gives MOA accuracy after taking on / off. The 24"" barrel shoots way better than what I can do it justice, it easily shoots 1/2"" MOA with the right ammo. If you don't believe me look for videos online which can prove it. I can go on and on, but unfortunately I need to sell so my loss is your gain. I still have the original box, packing and all paperwork that goes along with the gun and scope.

I am willing to split the gun and scope, the price will be $2,400 without scope, but will include the base / rings. If you would like to see more pictures or have other questions just let me know."

SMITH & WESSON PISTOL MODEL M&P 40 SHEILD

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

SMITH & WESSON PISTOL MODEL M&P SHEILD CALIBER .40

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.
