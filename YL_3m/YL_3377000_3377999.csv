The CZ 97 B is a semi-automatic firearm incorporating a locked breech principle and double-action mode of fire. The handgun is equipped with manual safety, firing pin safety (block), and loaded chamber indicator. The magazine is of a double column type and has a 10 round capacity. The slide is locked open when the last cartridge from the magazine has been fired. The loaded chamber indicator indicates the presence of a cartridge in the chamber. A safety notch on the hammer prevents inadvertent discharge and the firing pin safety positively ensures drop safety of the pistol. The manual safety is designed in such a way so as to engage the pistol's safety mode while also enabling the ""carriage"" of the pistol while the safety is off and a cartridge is loaded in the chamber. At the same time it is safe for all normal handling. Characteristic features of all versions A large capacity double-column magazine. A comfortable grip and balance in either hand with good results at instinctive shooting (without aiming). A low trigger pull weight, and high accuracy of fire. A long service life coupled to high reliability. The slide stays open after the last cartridge has been fired, suitable for COMBAT shooting. The sights are fitted with a three-dot illuminating system for better aiming in poor visibility conditions-optional tritium or micrometrical sights can be fitted on request to the customer's specifications. Selective SA/DA firing mechanism operation.

I wouldn't waste your time or money by exaggerating the description.  Only 70 rounds have been shot through - that's it (25 rds Remington, 25 rds Hornady Critical Defense, and 20 rds Federal Premium reduced recoil).  I bought this mainly as home/cc protection use for my wife.  We went to the range and she did not prefer the recoil.  To me the recoil is minimal but everybody's different.  There is not one scratch, wear, or any blemish whatsoever.  It looks brand new and is in mint condition.  Obviously included are the original case, extra magazine, and manual just as I received it.  An added bonus in my opinion is the serial number: 3801.  Personally I thought this was pretty awesome to own a Walther .380 with the serial number 3801 and planned on keeping it for life.  My wife just can't handle it though, so better a .22 in hand with velocitors than nothing at all.  I bought this from Kentucky Gun Company.  Their price is $621.19.  I want $550.00 and in addition I'll give you a 25 round box of Hornady Critical Defense (value $20.00) and a 20 round box (value $20.00) of Federal Premium Reduced Recoil.  Please send me an e-mail if interested and I will reply quickly.  Thank you for your time."

Purchased from CMP by me in 2006. Very nice condition. Not one piece is new or reproduction.
 Overhauled by the Springfield Armory during WWII. This was part of the WWII rebuild that is described by LTC Bill Brophy in his book. Originally was a 1905 manufactured M1903, and was put into M1903A1 configuration by the Army at the Springfield Armory. Original USGI WWII late type 'C' stock.Stock is almost perfect, as I take care of my stuff and don't abuse it. Barrel is SA, dated 11-44, correct for a WWII M1903A1 rebuild, and is quite shiny with strong lands and grooves. Muzzle guages a tad less than one, indicating it was barely fired after this last barrel was put onto the old girl.
Would consider trade for nice USGI M1 Garand, Colt SP1, Colt Sporter, Colt Hbar, Colt 6920, or perhaps other AR-15. Also interested in a break open type muzzleloader, plus cash on your part. All reasonable and unreasonable offers entertained.

Ruger® LCR™ Revolvers: 
Light, compact and easy to conceal
Five-shot capacity
Recoil-taming Hogue or Crimson Trace grips
The Ruger Lightweight Compact Revolver (LCR) is a light, small-frame handgun with a smooth, easy-to-control trigger and highly manageable recoil. Its patent-pending polymer fire-control housing holds components in their proper dimensional relationships, reduces weight significantly and reduces recoil. An optimized friction-reducing cam results in a smooth, nonstacking trigger pull. The cylinder and barrel are supported by a monolithic, aerospace-grade aluminum frame treated with a black synergistic hard coat to reduce weight and enhance durability. The cylinder is strong 400 Series stainless steel, extensively fluted to reduce weight and is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s durable Target Grey® finish. Five-shot capacity.
Hogue Tamer grip reduces perceived recoil.

After Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Brazil in 1980, the Taurus 92 9mm pistol was created to improve on the Beretta design. The specially-designed drop hammer-forged ordnance-grade alloy frame won't crack or allow the slide to come off, and a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode and
also functions as a DA decocking lever. The Taurus 92 also features a loaded chamber indicator, the Taurus Security System, a Picatinny rail, and fixed sights.

594,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3377594,For Sale:  McCabe’s Custom Leather IWB Holster for S&W BodyGuard 380 w/Laser,"Cordova, Memphis, Tennessee",$ 100,"Listed On: Monday, August 11, 2014",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Need a custom made IWB holster for your Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 380 with Laser?

I have some leather holsters designed by some of the absolute top craftsman in the holster business. Made from the best hides and cut with great attention to detail. But even these high dollar holsters can feel rigid and unforgiving at times due to the thickness of the leather. 

Kydex has some advantages over leather in that can be thin and yet very durable and weather resistant. It can be shaped to just about any form and for an outside the waistband application, it can be a perfect solution, especially where it will be exposed to foul weather. 
But Kydex can sometimes feel harsh when worn inside the waistband under a t-shirt against your body. It's that feeling of metal or plastic against your skin that can annoy over time. For me, outside the waistband in the elements is ok; inside against your skin, no so much. With that said, I do currently have a particular Kydex holster that's on my wish list right now, but it won't be against my skin. 

Nylon can be very comfortable and very affordable. I have some nylon holsters and I like them for their small size and comfortable feeling, not to mention their cost effectiveness. But they can lack a certain confident feeling of pistol management. It always seems to feel like a bag rather than a fitted holster. Again, I have several and use one for inside the front pocket in Jeans for its small size and comfortable characteristics, and it's a favorite for that application.

But no holster is perfect and a year ago, I was in the market for a holster for a new Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 380. I liked the small size of the BG380 and believed it would conceal well in an inside the waistband application that would be against my body in summer months under a T-shirt. 

At the time, I was fortunate enough to read an article about Billy McCabe of McCabes's Custom Leather. I was interested enough to order three IWB holsters for the new BG380 with laser. 

McCabe created an IWB holster that seems to address everything I wanted in this holster. It is a perfectly shaped leather holster that is thin enough to address comfort and yet thick enough to address pistol management. The finish is a matte black as opposed to the more often seen shinny or glossy look.

The leather is also thin enough to avoid feeling hard or rigid. My first thought was that it reminded me of Italian leather because it's a little thinner than most. If you want a holster that will take a year to break in and that you will pass down to your grandchildren, this is probably not the holster for you. If you want a holster that will be comfortable from day one, this may very well be your next holster. (Besides, your grand kids will most likely be using Apple's new I-ZapU, an implanted 1000-TB pulverizing cloud weapon anyway.)  

The fit is perfect, including an extended rise in the back of the leather to keep the slide off my skin. (See photo) All in all a very simple and clean design that perfectly matches my BG380 - Very simple, just leather and craftsmanship. It just looks right for the BG380. And after living with it for a while, it is right - for my needs. It's so right, I wondered if that's what Billy carries.

I would love to ask him to make me a custom front pocket holster for a little Seecamp but he is backed up for months and currently not taking any new orders - none. That brings me to the point of all of this. 

I ordered three holsters from Billy when he was still taking orders and I waited about five months for mine. But I do have one extra McCabes custom-made IWB all black leather holster for a SW BG380 with laser. (See photos) So if you are in the market for one, I may have just what you want without the waiting. It’s never been used or worn and it's just $100, plus $12 s/h."

The guide and list are free.  The guide covers a wide range of target and other use pistols by Hammerli, Walther, SIG-Hammerli, Steyr, Pfuff, Hi Standard, and S&W (M41).  A second guide (and list of to be sold items) includes rifles by Walther, Anschutz, Tanner, Gruenig and Elmiger, Schultz and Larsen in .22 and center fire calibers.  These are free for the asking.

Includes all (I think) tools, and full set of weights. OEM case marked Hammerli, and original test target (pictured).

$1870, offers considered. FFL transfer only.

The gun really is not as accurate as the target would suggest. Hammerli was not entirely honest with the test targets of the 100 and 200 series guns, and slanted the data towards greater accuracy due to the testing method used.

That said, the gun is more accurate than the current Morini and Pardini series, probably better than the TOZ35 or at least as accurate, but not as accurate as the Steyr and Pfuff free pistols by 20 rounds fired.

The 160 uses a higher barrel position than the Steyr and Pfuff, so it does not require the high sight position for those positions, and is not as sensitive to hand position in the grip when shooting.

The 160 is similar to the 150, but the cartridge exraction is less fussy, and the trigger is a bit improved. Both are significantly smoother than the 120, which uses a Luger locking system rather than a falling or rotating block.

The gun is in near perfect condition. The OEM and SN matched case has a few marks, but is at least in very good condition. Please remember, the materials for the case and tools OEM Hammerli are cheap, and their quality does not parallel the guns.

$1870 but offers considered, as there is not much info for basing a price on this gun.

If desired, 120, 150, Steyr, and Pfuff Match free pistols also are available. The Steyr begins in this price range, the others are less.

Again, this gun is one of several target and ""other use"" pistols available, which are NOT listed on Armslist.  For a complete list and EXPERT'S SELECTION GUIDE to these guns, please email.  The guide and list are free.

Concatenations not included, as those go to gun shows with the guns and gun chicks."

Feel free to offer trades, but don't offer me anything stupid. I'm asking $1800 OBO with Aimpoint and mount, or $1200 without aimpoint and mount. I'm flexible with price, but I'm not giving this thing away. I'll include some picatinny rail sections and some rail covers with the gun as well. Text me or email me if interested. This is much better quality than any Walmart sold AR-15 and most factory rifles. I'll also include 250 rounds of .223 with sale. REDACTED.

Please don't take this as an opportunity to try to pawn off your garbage on some unsuspecting idiot. I know what I have and I am familiar with gun values. 

I am even willing to add cash to the right trade. The right trade would be a nice revolver in .44 magnum, a pistol caliber carbine (9mm, .357 or .44 mag), an Aimpoint or EOTech sight, a .223 upper, a rifle in .308, a good scope, or anything else that you think might fit. I even have a soft spot for old battle rifles.

Make me an offer! The worst I can say is no.

Oh yeah, the rifle! 
This is supposedly a sweet shooter out of the box (MOA or less) with decent ammo. If you're looking for a budget hunting rifle or a gun to bang around with at the range, this is perfect for you. Inspecting the rifle, I notice Ruger has done an excellent job of choosing where to save money. The action is smooth, the trigger is very pleasantly surprising, and the stock feels great in the hand. Get yourself a nice 3x9 scope and you are ready for the (very near) deer season. 

FTF transaction only! I will abide by all CT state laws. The buyer must posses either a valid CT pistol permit or a CT long gun eligibility certificate. If you are a felon, buying this for someone else, or do not have the required certificate, please just move along.

773,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3377773,For Sale:  *** SOLD *** Smith & Wesson Bodyguard BG 380 IWB Holster,"Cordova, Memphis, Tennessee",$ 75,"Listed On: Thursday, September 11, 2014",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Need a custom made IWB holster for your Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 380 with Laser? 

A year ago, I was in the market for a holster for a new Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 380. I liked the small size of the BG380 and believed it would conceal well in an inside the waistband application that would be against my body in summer months under a T-shirt. 

At the time, I was fortunate enough to read an article about Billy McCabe of McCabes's Custom Leather. I was interested enough to order three IWB holsters for the new BG380 with laser. 

McCabe created an IWB holster that seems to address everything I wanted in this holster. It is a perfectly shaped leather holster that is thin enough to address comfort and yet thick enough to address pistol management. The finish is a matte black as opposed to the more often seen shinny or glossy look.

The leather is also thin enough to avoid feeling hard or rigid. My first thought was that it reminded me of Italian leather because it's a little thinner than most. If you want a holster that will take a year to break in and that you will pass down to your grandchildren, this is probably not the holster for you. If you want a holster that will be comfortable from day one, this may very well be your next holster. (Besides, your grand kids will most likely be using Apple's new I-ZapU, an implanted 1000-TB pulverizing cloud weapon anyway.)  

The fit is perfect, including an extended rise in the back of the leather to keep the slide off my skin. (See photo) All in all a very simple and clean design that perfectly matches my BG380 - Very simple, just leather and craftsmanship. It just looks right for the BG380. And after living with it for a while, it is right - for my needs. It's so right, I wondered if that's what Billy carries.

I would love to ask him to make me a custom front pocket holster for a little Seecamp but he is backed up for months and currently not taking any new orders - none. That brings me to the point of all of this. 

I ordered three holsters from Billy when he was still taking orders and I waited about six months for mine. I do have one extra McCabes custom-made IWB all black leather holster for a SW BG380 with laser. (See photos) 

So if you are in the market for one, I may have just what you want without the waiting. It’s never been used or worn and it's just $75, shipping included."

Going to be rather blunt and to the point. 

First, if you have something, details are key, the more I know the better idea I have if it is worth my time, or something that I am looking for. Otherwise be prepared to get a laundry list of questions as a reply. I also need a price. No price or value and I am not liking going to bother responding. 

Only interested in 5.56 in ARs, and 7,62X39 for AKs. If you refuse to allow the rifle to be broken down for inspection do not offer it, I will assume you are trying to hide something and more on. If you don't know how to break it down, then we can talk. Will consider AR lowers, depending on condition, make, and parts used. Not interested in franken-ARs. And no, your DPMS is not built better than a Colt, nor would it be worth more, so don't try selling me your Sportical for $1200. As far as AKs, WASRs are not $900 rifles, and this isn't Haji-stan where if the rifle is beat to hell it gives street cred. Looking for quality rifles, not interested in Norinco, collectors pieces, or Century junk builds. 

As far as mags go not interested in mags that have beat up, been painted, are from unknown manufactuers, korean junk, pro mag, tapco, or their related failings. Also not interested in USGI or Magpul mags at 2X what I can order them for new. Also, not going to pay new price on used mags. 

Other things of interest. Quality mounts, rails, optics, lights. Need another Scout light, maybe two, as well as several other things. Again, UTG, promag, and related junk is not of interest. 

Not interested in ammo unless the price is cheap and below what I can buy it for. And no Cabela's prices are not good so don't use that as a reference. 

Lastly, don't waste my time with BS offers, bait and switch, overpriced junk, or if you think your stuff is worth five times more than you paid for it. You know who you are.

Looking for local, and local only."

Time has proven that with handgun calibers, shot placement and multiple hits trumps all. With that in mind, standard velocity 147 grain ammunition offers faster follow up shots and better ballistic characteristics than its +p/+p+ counterparts. They will penetrate further and more consistently through any medium, will retain more weight, and will expand just as much. Law enforcement agencies across the country, including the FBI, have been using or switching to 147 grain ammunition for these reasons. 

Gold Dots meet and exceed the FBI's stringent requirements, and have more recorded stops by law enforcement than any other round. The proprietary bonding technology in the bullets prevents core/jacket separation, allowing for more consistent penetration and expansion through different materials."

I have a good condition Turkish Mauser. Not all numbers match, though some do. It's a fun to shoot rifle, as I am sure you know, I just am running out of 8mm rounds and don't want to buy anymore unless I am firing a German Mauser (If you have one, please let me know. I will trade mine with cash for yours.)

Until then, if you want a Turkish Mauser, feel free to write me and tell me what you have to trade. If you're paying cash, I will need to see proof that you're not a criminal as in a military ID or conceal carry permit.
