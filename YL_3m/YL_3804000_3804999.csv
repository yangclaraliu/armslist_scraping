Far surpasses the Bushnell that I have on my hunting rifle.  I paid just under $500 for it when I bought it new. The scope rings were $70 by themselves. I believe $200 firm is a fair price as I only shot the gun a few times, so the scope is basically new. Only issue that it has is a small spec just above the horizontal line on the right(see pictures).

I'm sorry I don't have a better picture at the moment. I'm not at home, but will take them ASAP. It is this exact gun in 20 gauge: http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/70780 -- I believe Century Arms is the manufacturer, JW-2000 coach is the model. 

It was purchased two weeks by me factory new. Fires fine. Cosmetically perfect. No issues whatsoever. It was purchased for my wife, who it turns out doesn't like the weight of it and I don't much need it.  

I'm looking to trade even trade+cash on my end ONLY and would like to keep it local because I don't have the time to travel more than 20 miles outside of Northeast Indy.  

Open to all offers, but would prefer compact to midsize frame, in 9MM only. I can add between 100-150 + various ammo for the right offer. All e-mails will be read and responded to.

I have all original parts, springs, grips, scope rings, case, papers, etc. as new.  I will put it back to original condition if you request.

It currently has Wilson springs, Hogue Tamer grip, and rear peep sight from One Ragged Hole and is a tack driver.  Trigger is excellent, and has not been altered (other than springs) from factory.  This is an extremely accurate pistol, and built like a tank.

Included with trade:

Lee carbide dies for 44 Mag

Hunting cartridges (240gr XTP, Star Brass, CCI mag, 23.5gr H110) - very accurate, approx. 200 rounds+

One box of Remington 240gr SP

The ""Hunting Cartridges"" I listed above are not maximum loads, perform very well and accurate, and will easily kill deer and hogs up to 350lbs at over 50 yards - I have pictures and recovered bullets from quite a few large hogs this pistol has taken.

This pistol has been babied, and has not seen over 200 rounds of light loaded ammunition (other than hunting loads, and that was less than 30 of the 200).

The ONLY reason I'm selling it is to go with a larger caliber for Elk, Moose, and possibly brown bear."

The M9A1 is one of the most widely used handguns on earth. It is the duty handgun for the U.S. military as well as 25 other countries. The 92 series operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system that allows for faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. The double/single action trigger system provides a very safe and combat proven design, while the high capacity steel magazines are durable and drop free quickly when the magazine release button is depressed, even when empty.
Distinctive military style markings on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols. While a unique M9 prefixed serial number: (M9-xxxxxx) sets this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols.

I purchased this in March in hopes to find a platform I liked to shoot 9mm in but decided I am just going to get out of the caliber all together. This is my last 9mm pistol. It is in great condition. I have taken it to the range only 2 times, it has fired about 300 rounds. Has absolutely no holster wear. The ONLY thing this gun has that is not mint is I painted the bottom of the mags brown (I paint the bottom of all my mags to differentiate them on the range/class/etc.) but it is merely cosmetic and can be painted back to black if you prefer. NO BOX.

I am not looking for any trades at this time. Need the money for 300 upper."

Solid, reliable, and every bit as remarkable a Hi-Power as the Browning Hi-Power.  The XS express sights that are stock on this Hi-Power are a world's difference for a quicker target acquisition than the Browning Hi-Powers.  This will come with two (2) new MecGar 13-rd. magazines. Read the reviews of the Charles Daly Hi-Powers across the years on the Internet; it is every bit as awesome as the Brownings.  Get into a Hi-Power platform for a third of the cost.  I'm funding a new project, so my loss is your gain.  $300 firm, cash. If you are not local, I would consider shipping through a local FFL with you paying the s/h cost and any fee to do so.

Here is a good review and comparison to get you started in learning about how good these Daly Hi Powers are: https://gunner777.wordpress.com/2007/09/30/the-charles-daly-hi-power-compared-to-the-browning-hi-power/  There is lots more out on the 'Net about these fine automatics.

WEST HARTFORD, Conn. – Colt Defense LLC, one of the world’s leading designers, developers, and manufacturers of rifles and carbines, has advanced its one-piece monolithic upper receiver to introduce the LE6940P. This modular carbine has an articulating link piston (ALP) operating system and offers shooters a highly accurate, lightweight and easy-to-clean AR-platform rifle with an extended lifespan.

“The new LE6940P puts to use a new, improved version of a piston system that Colt originally pioneered for the US Army,” said David Ridley, Vice President of Colt Defense LLC, “Now, any civilian shooter or law enforcement professional has the opportunity to shoot using this superior piston-operated AR.”

The advanced piston carbine (APC) is a lightweight, highly accurate alternative to the traditional direct gas impingement system found in most ARs. The LE6940P utilizes a unique articulating link piston (ALP) operating system, which reduces inherent stress in the piston stroke by allowing for deflection and thermal expansion. As a result, shooters are offered a highly accurate firing experience and the weapon’s lifespan is extended. 

Measuring 35 inches with the stock extended and weighing just over six and a half pounds, the LE6940P was designed to be lightweight to reduce shooter fatigue. A one-piece monolithic upper receiver gives ease in assembling parts, disassembling and cleaning. The 5.56mm, magazine-fed carbine has a semi-automatic rate of fire with 700 to 950 rounds per minute. Chambered in 5.56 x 45 NATO (.223 Remington), this rifle has an effective range distance of 600 meters. 

A continuous rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight translates to unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with aftermarket rail systems. In order to enhance the shooters’ versatility in both close quarters and long range, Colt has also incorporated a back up iron sight (BUIS) and a folding front sight. 

“The LE6940P exemplifies Colt’s continued dedication to innovation,” said Ridley, “Colt was the first to put a piston system in an AR, and we have continued to improve on that system since, giving shooters an unmatched edge.”"

The scope is also unhunted & mint, and I have the box for it also.  Face to Face sale only."

Call or TXT Joe @ (602)3 six 1 seven 2 7 three or email REDACTED  Barrett Model 95 Bolt Action Rifle System .50 BMG 29 Inch Barrel 5 Round With Accessories
Match-grade, chrome chambered fluted barrel. Bullpup design. Sling attach points, air/watertight carrying case, one five round magazine, 1913 accessory rail, and detachable adjustable bipod.

The Model 95 may weigh in at a smaller class, but packed into its convenient bullpup design are the intense power of a magazine-fed weapon, the pinpoint accuracy of a bolt action rifle and the effortless functionality of a perfectly designed machine.
This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a shortened overall length of just 45 inches. Adopted for military use, the Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power.
Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. the steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 optics rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. the two can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools.
The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation. Designed for speed, reliability and safety, it slides effortlessly on machined-smooth parallel rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. The firing pin is driven by dual firing pin springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time.
The only thing more impressive than the Model 95 rifle’s performance is the comfort with which it can be used. The ergonomically designed rifle rests on a lightweight front bipod and an optional adjustable rear monopod. This careful attention to usability allows the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds, reload with a fresh magazine and get back on target in seconds.
The Model 95 provides the discerning shooter with bolt-action accuracy and magazine fed rate of fire.
The Model 95 is what you expect in a Barrett. Innovative. Purposeful. Rugged.

Uses #11 percussion caps.  Drilled and tapped for a scope mount.

I bought this new in 1992 for $649 before tax and shipping – I still have the receipt.  Serial Number 17505.  This was a limited production gun called the “Grand American.”  I shot it at the range and took it on 1 hunt.  Cleaned, lubed and properly stored with anti-seize grease on all threaded parts of the action.  A true safe queen.  I’m not likely to hunt muzzle loading season again, so it is time for it to go to a new home to be used and enjoyed.  

No FFL is required since it is a muzzleloader.
Asking $595.  Sorry, but I’m not interested in trades.
I will ship within the lower 48 states for $30.
