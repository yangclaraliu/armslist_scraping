The build is cannibalized a little bit. It has NO BCG or Charging Handle, I took to put into a Custom SPR build. Other than that everything works, it'll take a standard .223/5.56 BCG and Charging Handle.

It's a Red X 16 Inch 1:10 Twist Stainless Steel Upper Receiver. 
Free floated Quad Rail, low profile gas block, carbine length gas tube.
The ""actual"" Barrel length is more in the ball park of 14.5"" but it has a PINNED Stainless Steel Red-X Compensator.
I am the second owner, I have personally put around 20ish rounds to Group/Zero it. Can't speak for the previous owner. It was shooting 1/2"" 3-shot groups.

The lower is an ""almost"" all-polymer complete lower (buffer tube assembly, springs obviously aren't polymer) made by New Frontier Armory out of NV. Makes for a really light weight rig, and the trigger breaks nicely around 4.5 lbs, but can always do with a better one.

Price is negotiable only if I can stay local to the Clarksville/FTCKY/Hop-Town area and if you can buy soon.

I'll include a PMAG with 20ish 147gr .300 BLK handloads and keep the BSA (Cheapo) Red Dot on it.

Reliable, revolvers don't jam.

Low recoil but packs a big punch, which is perfect for anyone sensitive to snappy recoil or who have a hard time pulling back (racking) a semi-auto's slide.

Shoots the .32 H&R Magnum, which is the ballistic equivalent to a .38 Special.

Guns that shoot the .32 H&R magnum can also shoot the shorter .32 S&W, .32 S&W Long and .32 Auto.

Although, I wouldn't recommend the .32 auto, looks too short.

Pin type cylinder. This means, you have to pull the pin out to remove the cylinder.

Great for truck, garage, bed stand or toilet. You never want to be caught naked (without protection).

It's lightly used and has only had about 200 rounds through it with it on the rifle, bought new earlier this month.  Does reduce recoil as intended, but I think I'd like to try something different.  These work particularly well on ar pistols and help tame the recoil and muzzle rise (while throwing 5 foot fireballs out the side!).  Will fit on any ar15 with standard threads or barrel with the same threads.  Will come with two washers, I believe one is a peel and one is a crush, but they are used and I can not guarantee they will work on your rifle, so you may need to get a new one.

CZ P07 (would prefer the newer version, which is not marked ""Duty"", these are differentiated by the forward cocking serrations, interchangeable cocking backstraps, etc)

of course I will compensate you for additional items such as magazines, night sights, threaded barrels, etc. But first person to contact me with an SP01 9mm will take top priority! I do prefer the all metal framed CZ's.

9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.
Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.
The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.
Features a Nitron®-coated stainless steel slide over a dark hard anodized alloy frame. Hogue® Rosewood Grips round out this package."

This is not a toy make sure you can legally own in your state I will ship at your expense. You may see others out there but they do not have the cartridges, chargers or spare holders or they are the C2 civilian model. Each holder sells for $20-25 & charger runs $50-75.

This is a limited run pistol that was made for a law enforcement group who backed out on the order.  The serial number was even printed under the cylinder release as LEO revolvers are for ease of access to the number.  It is a scadnium J frame, the same one the $1000 PD series of revolvers is made on.  It has a stainless lined barrel and the cylinder is stainless. The rubber grips are elongated slightly with 3 finger groves instead of 2.  It weighs only 13 ounces and is awesome to shoot.  I believe there were only 5000 of these made and you can google to verify this information although there is a lot of speculation out there about this pistol because if you call S&W they won't verify everything. It is becoming very hard to find and probably going to be rare.  If you take the grips off there is a hole in the bottom for a lanyard and it was never filled in by Smith.  It has the original box and paperwork.  This is one of the coolest airweights I've had.

BMG,"Alki, Seattle, Washington","$ 2,600","Listed On: Thursday, March 19, 2015",Rifles,no type,50 BMG                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"For sale is a Bluegrass Armory Viper XL 50. BMG. Rifle is an all-black right hand single shotbolt action model with 29” barrel and weighs 25 Lbs. without optics. Rifle comes in original foam cutout shippingcontainer from factory. Rifle has an excellent muzzle brake and bipod from factory that does extremely well at reducing felt recoil (but stay away from muzzle blast!!). Have only broken in and then sighted in at 100 yards (shot a cloverleaf). I attempted to shoot at 400 yards (farthest target on the range that particular day) and my scope had broken the internal adjustments and was stuck on 100 yard zero (I know I know, cheap scope). So, I have only shot it 100yards at targets and rocks so I can’t tell you how it shoots at 1,000 yards,etc… but it shoots fantastic at 100yards. Rifle has been shot exactly 41 times (have exact round cound of spent brass). Rifle comes with 46 loaded rounds of .50 BMG ball ammo (CBC brand) and 10 rounds of HSM Hornady 750 grain Amax pills (2900 fps+ with a 750 grain pill ) and 41 once fired brass.

Rifle is a great design if you are unfamiliar with the ViperXL .50. I was told they made internal parts for the Barrett M99 (single shot version that look very similar to this) but don’t know how accurate that is. But, the features, functions, and looks are very similar. 

Full disclosure, the only thing I don’t like about the ViperXL .50 is the bolt handle length (same on all models). It is really short and takes a lot ofleverage to close those big lugs and has very tight tolerances with non-match ammo. It has shot every ball ammo I’ve tried just fine, but closing the bolt with the very short bolt handle takes getting used to when you are used to a large oversized bolt. I have verified this is correct with Bluegrass through email and they confirmed they are built on tight tolerances and this is normal and not an issue or error, but I wanted to disclose so no surprises.  I was going to get a longer bolt made similar to the Barrett M99 (several inches longer) and had it quoted around $50 dollars from several places, but never went through with it since I didn’t have optics for it yet. Just to be clear, it is functionally fine, and in original factory settings and the factory confirmed this, but I like a longer bolt handle for easier leverage. 

Price is $2,600.00 OBO to your door.  $2500.00 local seattle area.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Will only ship to FFL in states where .50 BMG is legal.

My dad built this up in 1985 with a Leupold M8 4X fixed power scope on a Leupold base and rings.  Included is the leather sling.  Makes for a great vintage era plinking gun.  Or, if you want, just use the action to build up your perfect 10/22.  The action is silky smooth.  

There is some light damage the on the lower butt stock.  See the pictures.
I doubt the gun has more than 800 rounds shot through it.
Would prefer face to face local sale to a NV CCW holder or at least a blue card holder. If you have neither of these, we can go to your FFL to run a background check.  Will ship out of state to your FFL as well.  $25  for shipping.

Extras include the additional machine cover, powder and shot funnel, used primer cup, and fully adjustable powder and shot bar.

It also has the additional powder baffle that allows more consistent powder metering. I have only had the machine a year, and am selling because I ordered a Dillon reloader. The base machine is $600 so it will be like getting bag of shot(already in the machine), a new pound of Hodgdon Universal Powder, Cover, Shot Bar, Funnel, extra capacity shot container, and Powder Baffle for free. 

 With this machine you can easily load 400+ shells per hour. It is easy to use, my kids even help put in the empties and wads in the machine and all I had to do was pull the handle.

 I will also sell the table it is mounted to. It is a butcherblock top with a cabinet underneath that I used to store, powder, shot, wads, and primers. The Table is $175 and is a perfect reloading/gunsmithing bench. The items in the cabinet are not included.

For sale is a Remington 783 bolt action in 7mm Remington Magnum.  Barrel length of 24"".  Rifle is only twenty shots old.  Also included with this is a box of Federal ammo 175 gr PSP.  And one box of reloads I bought and never used which are 139 gr.  They are designed to be reloads that match Hornady Whitetail loads.  Gun purchased July 2014.  I am the only owner.  Includes original box and manual.  Barrel is immaculate.  Bolt action is super smooth.  Barrel is free floated for unsurpassed accuracy.

There are NO issues, blemishes, scratches, pings, rust, anything.  Have may have shot it more at Remington during quality control than I have.

Thought I would be going out West and this would come in handy for me.  But for where I hunt in WI, it is just too much gun for me.

If interested, on the gun now is a nice Simmons masters series scope 4-12x.  Price below excludes scope price.  Scope was $80 and I can discount that as much as I did above with the rifle.

Cheapest place to get one new would through buds guns hop .com for $363 + $25-35 in FFL fees.  So at a minimum my rifle is $48 bucks cheaper, and mine comes with a $27 box of ammo and box of reloads.  Will also include two snap cap practice shooting rounds.    Additionally will include a 7mm bore sighting laser catridge which makes sighting in easy.  This is a great value.

Must be over 18, not a felon, have WI DL and be willing to sign a bill of sale.  

Not interested in any trades.  need to buy something else if I can sell this.  If you want it shipped you pay for your FFL and if your FFL needs it shipped from another FFL, you cover that too."

Factory Info Below-

Adams Arms Upper-
Carbine Tactical Evo 16"" 1/7 twist ratio Upper is a M4 Profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with a salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured by Samson Manufacturing and is a 10"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper.

Factory Info Below-

Adams Arms Upper-
Carbine Tactical Evo 16"" 1/7 twist ratio Upper is a M4 Profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with a salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured by Samson Manufacturing and is a 10"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper.

Also one extra $75 magazine  . Scope warranty card and scope manual/catalog included also includes a extra Magazine.  Easy to shoot, like an M1A.  This rifle shoots out to 1,000 yards easily with the attached Shepherd scope.  See shepherdscopes.com.  

This thing is one smooth shooter would make a great rifle for someone who wants the power of a .300 win mag without the kick . My semi auto .308 kicks a lot harder than this and  this weighs lighter than my .308 so the combo of the muzzle  break and the factory stock and gas system really really makes a huge difference from other shoulder dislocating .300 magnums   . its just too long for my safe and i don't want to rearrange it and I don't want to cut it. I am also listing my browning and am keeping the one that does not sale .  

The Shepard scope is such a useful tool and almost a must for ammo that is $1-2 a round as it has like a second set of cross hairs that gives you a point of reference Its so cool . the glass compares to leupolds vx2 and Bushnell elite 3200 but built like a tank and i can't say enough about the the features of this scope its worth reading about 

this rifle is in near new condition only 2 boxes fired and used one elk season and is over a $2000 value with its scope and extras so the price is very firm and if my browning sells first I am just going to have the barrel cut and retreaded to fit my safe and keep it.

PRICES ARE FIRM and may even go up as it get closer to hunting season . Only trades I would consider are A left handed browning BAR .300 which i would be quite generous towards . Or a firearm of greater value the  whole retail price of this package  ."
