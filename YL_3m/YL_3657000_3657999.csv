I bought it new, fired 90-100 rounds total but 7.62x39 just isn't my thing I guess... I'd rather start another AR build for the money.

If you're unfamiliar with this rifle it's basically a VZ58 with a brand new U.S. made receiver and barrel. All other parts such as the furniture are Czech milsurp but are in excellent condition.

Includes the 5 magazines and bayonet which the rifle originally came with.

Changes I made to the rifle:

1. Stock: These come from the factory with a horrible side folding wire stock which I replaced with the original fixed stock which matches the rest of the furniture. The stock was ordered directly from the Czech Republic where they store a lot of their old military surplus equipment.
2. Trigger: This came with a trigger somewhere in the 12 pound range, I don't know for sure because it was over what my scale could read. I followed a guide to lighten the trigger by removing one of the two leaf springs that are not necessary for operation. This is shown in one of the photos. The trigger is now a consistent 5.5 pound pull on my scale.

I fired in total around 90-100 rounds through this rifle (with the improved trigger) and function is flawless. You'll find online people are saying they're able to lighten their triggers further but you risk function issues if you lighten it past what I have done.

$500 price is firm

It is absolutely rust free, everything is perfect, and all 3 serial numbers match. The iron sights are ridiculously accurate. The only tiny thing is that the stock is a little blemished from bumping into a wall or something.

This gun comes with the a strap and 110 rounds of ammo. Most is 2 different types of 1953 and 1980 something military surplus corrosive ammo all in stripper clips. You can look it up on that 7.62x54r ID website if your'e really curious. Those are all steel core. Then there are like 10 or so rounds of non-corrosive wolf  lead-core ammo. I've never fired any of that. I fired Wolf ande Remington ammou out of it only and always kept it very clean.

The gun has less than 700  rds through it with no malfunctions.
It was purchased new in 2009 for my wife to CCW, and we are the only owners.
It is lightly used and was rarely carried. It’s in great shape, but spends more time in the safe than anywhere else, so its time to sell it off to make room for something else.
The gun has night sights and comes with 2 magazines.

Prefer FTF sale in the St Louis area, but buyer pays shipping if not able or willing to do local pickup.

It will chamber both 2.75"" or 3"" magnum ammo and holds up to 6 in the tube and 1 in the chamber. It has black composite stocks with some scratches & wear from normal use. The receiver is blue steel, the barrel bore is bright with no pits and the action is in excellent condition. There are no plastic or MIM parts used on this gun (unlike the Express model). It was built to last with an action smooth-as-silk. The 870 POLICE MAGNUM has these improved characteristics: An aluminum trigger group as opposed to the plastic one used in the Express models. An old style magazine retention system. A much smoother finish inside and out with minimal machine marks or burrs. The Police gun receives a higher level of inspection and finishing and is built in a special area of the plant from 100% inspected parts. It has a one piece barrel and the bore was polished. Heavy-duty trigger / sear spring. Heavy-duty shell lifter spring. The barrel is locked down with a ""ball detent"" system (as opposed to the lesser grade ""synthetic magazine spring retainer"" lock down used in the Express models). A milled extractor (as opposed to the MIM extractor used in the Express models). Remington builds these guns specifically for law enforcement and military use. They have to be 100% reliable and able to withstand the toughest of field conditions. For these reasons, the 870 POLICE MAGNUM was built to the highest standard for endurance and reliability.

I say this because there are a number of people who attempt to sell there firearms for more than they are going for new.  This tells me that they are either dishonest or they are trying to attract people who are not allowed to buy firearms legally.  Additionally, there seems to be a lapse in clarity about why this site exists.  Well let me spell it out for those who think this site is an extension of craigslist.  In other words, THIS SITE IS FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO SELL OR TRADE GUNS AND GUN RELATED ITEMS!  Therefore, it should be pointed out that 99% of us are really not interested in trading our firearms for TV's, computers, lawnmowers, and rusty old tools.  Don't get me wrong, some of these posts are amusing, however, if I want to be amused i will watch the recents skits SNL has done on Obama.  Now I'm sure some of you will take offense to some of the things that I have said. I certainly expect that, but it should be pointed out that I am merely exercising the constitutional rights that were bestowed on me by the founding fathers of this great country. God bless all of you! Finally, I hope you have a happy Thanksgiving and a Merry Christmas.

I have a Ruger SR22 that is threaded and ready for a suppressor. This is a secondary SR22 that has less than 200 rounds through it. I purchased it originally but found a Bi-Tone threaded that is my plinker. If you haven't had the SR-22 and know nothing about it know one thing, it eats all ammo you put through it with no hiccups. No need for the CCI Minimags and higher velocity ammo to cycle. My SR-22 is in great shape with no issues and will come with everything that it came with new. 2-10rd mags / pinky ext / thread protector / thread wrench / manuals / box / case. I am looking to trade my SR-22 for one of the following items that I will list below. I am willing to add any of the following for the right trade, Ammo / Cash / Lee Hand Press ready with everything you need to start reloading 9mm tomorrow. That being said I am willing to work a fair trade out with value of my SR-22 but expect the same in return. I’m not looking for a Glock 42 valued at $540 due to that being the price paid and can be found for $400 at this time. I am looking for the following,

Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor.



The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability.



The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones.

The AR6720 is a hybrid of Colt’s Government Carbine model AR6520 and Colt’s Flagship M4 Carbine model LE6920. This Lightweight Law Enforcement Carbine has a roll mark of AR-15A4- recognizing Colt’s newest designation of an ORC (optics ready carbine)."

This gun is in great shape.  I had it at a gun show, and the wise old timers hit me with so much info my head was spinning.  The only thing I know for certain is that the rifle was re-barreled with a Remington barrel in 1944.  
  The stock is old and has not been refinished, it has a lot of the original preservative ingrained in the wood, it has that smell…I like it!
  The Trigger guard and magazine bottom plate have worn bluing, and some ‘character’ dings and scratches, but are in good shape.   The end cap where the bayonet connects is very fresh and looks new to me, as does the butt plat, I would guess they are replacements.

Features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a quality U.S. made barrel. All metal parts are bead blasted and coated with a non reflective finish.
