This is a PISTON operated upper, not gas operated, so the gun runs cooler and cleaner than standard gas guns.  The gun has run approximately 1000 rounds with not a single failure, suppressed or unsuppressed.  

The upper features a monolithic handguard design, which results in an extremely rugged setup.  It also means that the top rail is slightly taller than a standard AR.  For that reason, I fitted a set of Troy Industries Micro flip up battle sights on the top rail to ensure a proper cheek weld ($200 in sights).  

the BCG is nickel boron coated, as is the internal part of the charging handle.

NOTE**  the surefire brake currently installed will be removed and replaced with a standard A2 muzzle device prior to being sold.  Sorry, need to hang on to the mount for my suppressor, they are hard to find.

-Firearm is in good condition.  I have shot about fifty rounds through it with no problems and treated it properly given the corrosive salts in the ammo.

Only noticeable wear/damage is the finish being spotty on the wood.
-I cleaned the barrel and the internals.  It should be nearly free of cosmoline.  The only cosmoline left is in the stock.
-Passed firing pin protrusion test.  Fired fifty rounds with good primer strikes and no misfires.  Headspace should be good, I have had no problems with the fireform on any of the casings and recoil has been very consistent. 

Buyer pays fees.  I am relatively close to Herb Bauer's but would be willing to meet at another local FFL."

This rifle is a Steyr AUG clone made under license by Microtech, so it actually works.  It is a piston operated bullpup style rifle, which results in a rifle with SBR handling without the 8 months of NFA paperwork.

Bought this rifle 2 years ago cuz it was different and cool and i hadnt seen one before.  And it has since sat in my safe and collected dust after my initial range trip with it.  I was highly impressed with how the gun shot.  It was surprisingly accurate and shot extremely flat.  Felt recoil was almost nonexistent, and the trigger was capable of being run very quickly(uncommon in bullpup rifles).

Mounted on top of the rifle is a Nikon M-223 1-4x scope.

Included with the rifle and scope are magazines.  LOTS of magazines.  Twelve 42 round magazines.  Six 30 round magazines.  Two 20 round magazines.  One 10 round magazine.  these are all FACTORY magazines, not cheap knock offs.  They worked with 100% reliability, and the majority of them are still in the factory packaging.  The magazines themselves retail at $30-39 a piece.

Call or text with any questions.  It's chambered for 5.56 NATO and .223.  I'm open to reasonable offers.  Here's a breakdown of the parts:

Upper Receiver: Palmetto State Arms Mid Length Gas System with a 16” 416 Stainless Steel Barrel (1/9 Twist rate)
M4 Feed Ramps
A2 Flash Hider
T-Marks
12” Free Floating Rail
There are some attachable rail pieces I’ll throw in (along with the tools to mount them) for a vertical grip or other accessories

Lower Receiver: DPMS LR05K For .223 and 5.56

Blackhawk Lower Receiver Parts Kit

Bolt Carrier Group:  M16 Nickel Boron ICE/Magnesium Phosphate Hybrid from Prime Weaponry
This thing is really sweet.  The hybrid makes it harder than most nickel boron coatings and more resistant to carbon build up

Buttstock and Pistol Grip:  This comes with an ATI Strikeforce Stock, aluminum buffer tube assembly, and a Scorpion Recoil Pistol Grip.  The pistol grip feels really nice in the hand, and the buttstock has an adjustable cheek rest.  There’s a foam pad for the cheek rest that I’ll throw in as well.

Sights:  The front and rear sights are both from UTG.  These things are dead on accurate.  Super easy to take off if you want an optic on instead.

Charging Handle:  This is Mil-Spec with an oversized and extended latch for easier handling

This rifle is extremely accurate.  I had it picking off shotgun shells at about 70 feet with ease.  It’s only had 80 rounds through it and is practically brand new.  Super sweet deal for an awesome gun.  Retail value on the parts alone is about $1050.  It also comes with a brand new steel 30 round magazine.  Text or call at REDACTED.  My name is Nick."

I bought a bunch of this just to break in a pistol and for plinking. I no longer have a need for any of the remaining boxes since the gun is broken in and I have acquired my defensive loads.
I have 4-6 boxes as of now. I might keep 1 or 2 for plinking depending on how I feel. Asking $16 per box right now just to recover what I had in it after shipping. If you aren't fond of the price, feel free to shoot me an offer. If I get multiple offers at the same time, the higher offer will get the goods.

It had a very nice silver camo paint job with ghosted punished emblem on the grip.  I'm looking for $800 firm.  This gun has a 3.5 pound trigger pull.  It's very smooth and crisp.  I have enjoyed both of them, but right now I'm trying to purchase a truck and need the cash quickly.  I can email or text pictures upon request.  No trades will be accepted at this point.  Email me or for a faster response, text me at REDACTED.  I can't answer my phone most of the time, so email or text are the best options.  Once one or the other is sold, I will remove the ad.  If it's still up, I still have them both."

The AF2011-A1 Double Barrel Pistol comes actually as the very first industrial double barrel semiautomatic pistol of all times. The result was a long slide, double barrel 9mm, highly decorated collector piece, which indeed shot very well. Our idea took the challenge further: to commemorate the legendary Colt 1911-A1 in the Centenary by making a true industrial market-ready double barrel .45 caliber pistol. We achieved success in the brief span of 6 months, after intense and round-the-clock 3D designing, stereolithographic modeling and parts machining. The gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .45 Acp and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate....Am not interested in TRADES, interested buyer should contact me directly."

The M22 gives shooters the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a Lothar Walther match barrel, standard on all models, an extremely crisp, 4-lb single-action trigger and adjustable sights.

Each M22 comes with a 10-shot magazine, manual, training target and tools to adjust the front sight and lock the trigger in place.

NOTICE - Do not use BreakFree Powder Blast to clean M22 pistols.  This cleaning agent reacts against the aluminum in any gun slide and will discolor or flake off the finish.

In addition to its economical approach to handgun shooting and training, all ISSC M22 pistols are equipped with multiple safeties to insure that shooters will enjoy their shooting time to the maximum degree

I love this gun but it needs to move on to another good home. Comes with one clip and you must already have a NYS permit. For all you casters out there this is a gem. Please feel free to make offers."

Listing this for my father. He has had it two weeks and fired it 50 times. It just isn't for him. Very nice gun, no problems whatsoever, no FTF's or FTC's. 

Lets just say these are a different animal than a ar15 in 223/556. They're a beast.

Has an aftermarket grip on it. Can't remember what kind and the gun is all packaged up. It looked and felt great the couple times I shot it.

Gun is in perfect shape. No nicks, scratches, dings, scrapes. It has been taken out and used to sight in and punch paper twice and cleaned and put away twice. I went along the second time and got to fire it and I'm no AR guy, but this thing was neat. The only thing I can compare firing this to a ar15 w/223 is like going from firing a 38 sp+p revolver round to a 44 mag.

No, it's not a Colt, but they didn't have the right manufacturer to choose from (when making the ad)! Until I recently got a target gun, this .45 was the most accurate .45 I have ever had (its been in my family for over 30 years.) It shoots my own hand-cast bullet/ softball reloads in an excellent fashion! Slide, barrel and frame all match. . The grips have really excellent function and are non-slip!  It has an excellent trigger. These really are good shooting firearms!

 It is a new, unfired, Anderson Arms 16"" M4 pattern carbine.

 It has MagPul furniture, and a MagPul MBUIS rear flip-up sight. Five x 30-round PMags, and 500 rounds of Tula (non-corrosive) ammo in a spam can.

 I own this rifle/PMags/ammo combo for $659 (rifle) $75 (PMags) $119 (ammo). That is a total of $853 + about $85 in sales tax.

I am not going to lose money on the rifle, but I don't need it (I have more AR's than I really know what to do with), so I want to make a FAIR trade to both parties. I am NOT looking for one of those ""TRADE IN MY FAVOR"" kind of deals that twatwaffles on backpage seem to be looking for so they can screw another guy, and I am not under any illusion that this rifle is ""special"" in any way, or rare, or a collector's dream, or masturbatory fuel for some tacticool dude with delusions of Low Speed High Drag Operashuns while making a tactical exfiltration from his favorite donut shop with his 400lbs of fat stuffed into his knockoff tacticool clothes as he regales people with stories of when he was ""with the teams"" or other such nonsense.

 I want to make a FAIR deal to ME, and to YOU. This is a basic, working, decent quality AR carbine with a LOT of bang for your buck when you figure in the ammo and mags.

 These are some of the things I am looking for:

 1. Glock 35, Gen 3 with a decent number of magazines and a bit of cash ($200).

 2. 5"" 1911 from Springfield Armory (Range Officer or LOADED Model)- Straight Across.

 3. Smith & Wesson Model 25 in 4"" or 5"" - Straight Across


 I am not really interested in other trades or models. I especially do NOT want any shotguns, or SKS, or anything of that nature.

 Let's be realistic, and FAIR to each other. Let's make a deal we are BOTH happy with, and not trying to get over on one another. Yes....maybe my rifle CAN be bought somewhere for XYZ dollars...I don't care. I listed what I honestly PAID for it, and the ammo, and the PMags. I am NOT trying to put anyone together, or come out on top.

 Have a great day, and a great New Year.

 By the way...I am in the San Tan Valley area around Hunt Hwy and Bella Vista. I'd like to trade with an East Valley guy or gal.

 We can meet at Dunkin Donuts at Hunt Hwy near Gary Road, and I can buy you a coffee when we make the trade, and NO I don't weigh 400lbs and wear knockoff tacticool clothes! 

P.S. I will sell the rifle and ALL the PMags and Ammo for $800 FIRM."

No scabbard.

Manufre de Klingenthal Coulaux & Cie markings indicated the disastrous Franco-Prussian war of 1870. The French moved the government manufacturing of swords to Châtellerault.
On September 1870, Klingenthal was captured by the Germans. Alsace remained a German territory until 1918. The company produced some bayonets for the German Empire (bearing the mark C ) but was never able to challenge the manufacturers of Solingen (Germany). The making of tools and the few orders for blades for private swordmakers were not sufficient to stop the decline of the Manufacture de Klingenthal. 

In 1815, six hundred workers were making swords in Klingenthal, in 1910 they were one hundred. In 1955 only fifteen men were employed in the tool manufacturing company of Klingenthal, which closed its doors permanently in 1962."
