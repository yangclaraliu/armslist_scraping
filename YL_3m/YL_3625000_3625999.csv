I ordered mine from two sources and finally both came through so I have an extra.  I have an AR-15 300 BLK and enjoy my Handi-Rifle the most.  This light weight (5lb.) rifle is more fun than a guy should be able to have with a gun.  It will take any loads and is not fussy.  Compact hardly describes this small rifle.  The trigger job that AAC gives this gun is what you would expect on a way more expensive rifle.  Ultimate quiet with no action noise when shooting subsonic with a suppressor.  Very accurate.  Low cost fun.  They list for $349.00 when you can find them.  

Following is the AAC factory write-up:
The H&R Handi-Rifle, made to AAC specifications and chambered in 300 AAC BLACKOUT, is a 30 caliber rifle in a very compact and lightweight package with such minimal recoil that anyone can comfortably shoot it. This durable, optics ready break action single shot rifle is ideal for the beginner and great fun for the experienced shooter. The barrel is a low profile lightweight 16.1” barrel threaded 5/8-24TPI with a 5R 1:7"" twist. The rifle accurately sends rounds down range whether feeding it heavy subsonic or high performance hunting ammunition. The phosphate steel action and barrel are complimented by the compact, lightweight super tough glass polymer filled black stock. All models are equipped with the H&R transfer bar system that makes the Handi-Rifle one the safest single shot platforms available today."

There appears to be wiring for electric brakes coming out of the wheel hubs but I never tried to do anything with them so I do not know if that works at all. Also there is a piece of wood missing on the front end of the deck. I just didn't get the chance to replace it.

The stock is in excellent condition and shows no signs of being refinished, no cracks no heavy marks at all and the checkering is clean, a beautiful piece of wood. Swivels and sling are in great shape too and are included.

The barrel appears all original in finish, there are a few very very thin scratches in a few places but overall shows wonderful. The stampings are clean and show well, this gun has a very low serial number of 1073. Redfield rear sights are in good working conditions and markings are clean and ratchet clicks work fine. Front sight is original and in great condition. 
There are three H&R magazines, (2) ten rounders and (1) 5 round all of which seem just fine and engage and disengage properly. 
The inside of the barrel shows nice and shiny and clean of defects to my eyes. The cocking plunger and trigger mechanism and safety function fine in dry firing. There are little to no signs of any corrosion showing internally on parts, there is still some crud to be cleaned. I don't know of any missing parts. I will point out that there is some minor distortion to the trigger guard flat area (against stock) where the trigger protrudes through. This is the 'old' style trigger guard and all components on this gun to the best of my knowledge are original. If anyone sees that I am wrong or have misinformed please let me know, I am not an expert by any means. 
I will ship to your FFL in CONT US at your expense and will properly and safely package the gun. I recently sold a few very nice Winchester rifles here and this rifle is another from the same collection. 
I am open to discussion so don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or offers to consider. Monies going toward a reloader or another pistol, thanks!"

These are new fresh production bullets.

Manufacturer's Description

Like the Barnes TAC-X bullet, the Barnes TAC-TX bullets offers controlled double-diameter expansion, maximum penetration and full functionality at long ranges. The only difference between the X and the TX is the polymer tip that increases the Ballistic Coefficient for better long-range ballistics. Composed entirely of copper, these bullets have high weight retention and exhibit excellent performance when shot through barriers. Designed specifically for Military and Law Enforcement customers, these bullets function flawlessly in AR-type rifles.

The stock is in excellent condition and shows no signs of being refinished, no cracks no heavy marks at all and the checkering is clean, a beautiful piece of wood. Swivels and sling are in great shape too and are included.

The barrel appears all original in finish, there are a few very very thin scratches in a few places but overall shows wonderful. The stampings are clean and show well, this gun has a very low serial number of 1073. Redfield rear sights are in good working conditions and markings are clean and ratchet clicks work fine. Front sight is original and in great condition. 
There are three H&R magazines, (2) ten rounders and (1) 5 round all of which seem just fine and engage and disengage properly. 
The inside of the barrel shows nice and shiny and clean of defects to my eyes. The cocking plunger and trigger mechanism and safety function fine in dry firing. There are little to no signs of any corrosion showing internally on parts, there is still some crud to be cleaned. I don't know of any missing parts. I will point out that there is some minor distortion to the trigger guard flat area (against stock) where the trigger protrudes through. This is the 'old' style trigger guard and all components on this gun to the best of my knowledge are original. If anyone sees that I am wrong or have misinformed please let me know, I am not an expert by any means. 
I will ship to your FFL in CONT US at your expense and will properly and safely package the gun. I recently sold a few very nice Winchester rifles here and this rifle is another from the same collection.

This gun is a perfect trainer, plinker, test bed for your AR, and could be good for varmit management.

The stock is in excellent condition and shows no signs of being refinished, no cracks no heavy marks at all and the checkering is clean, a beautiful piece of wood. Swivels and sling are in great shape too and are included.

The barrel appears all original in finish, there are a few very very thin scratches in a few places but overall shows wonderful. The stampings are clean and show well, this gun has a very low serial number of 1073. Redfield rear sights are in good working conditions and markings are clean and ratchet clicks work fine. Front sight is original and in great condition. 
There are three H&R magazines, (2) ten rounders and (1) 5 round all of which seem just fine and engage and disengage properly. 
The inside of the barrel shows nice and shiny and clean of defects to my eyes. The cocking plunger and trigger mechanism and safety function fine in dry firing. There are little to no signs of any corrosion showing internally on parts, there is still some crud to be cleaned. I don't know of any missing parts. I will point out that there is some minor distortion to the trigger guard flat area (against stock) where the trigger protrudes through. This is the 'old' style trigger guard and all components on this gun to the best of my knowledge are original. If anyone sees that I am wrong or have misinformed please let me know, I am not an expert by any means. 
I will ship to your FFL in CONT US at your expense and will properly and safely package the gun. I recently sold a few very nice Winchester rifles here and this rifle is another from the same collection. 
I am open to discussion so don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or offers to consider. Monies going toward a reloader or another pistol, thanks!"

The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-HaveThe CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology1. It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round.2. Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols.3. Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.Size & FeaturesWith an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster.The CCP comes in stylish stainless or Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation.This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface.Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide."

Brand new, never fired AR Pistol.

A great deal of thought and consideration was put into the design of this pistol, and all of the components selected were chosen specifically with performance and ergonomics in mind. This is NOT your neighbor's uncomfortable and clumsy slapped-together gun-show AR pistol.

I started with a matched Anderson Mfg AM-15 lower and A3 upper set, and paired that with a DPMS lower parts kit. The match grade 10.5"" Rainier Arms .223 Wylde heavy barrel (.223 Rem/5.56 NATO) and GunTec low profile gas block fit perfectly under the 10"" full floating quad rail handguard with integrated forward QD sling point.

Under the hood is a PSA full auto nickel boron bolt carrier group for extended performance and easy cleaning, coupled with an extended tactical latch charging handle. Unlike the constant problems people have with shorter pistol-length gas systems, this has a carbine-length gas system to ensure dependable operation and perfect timing. Fully headspaced with both Go and No-Go gauges.

The extended buffer tube with positive stop keeps the Sig Brace firmly in place, standing it off a bit from the back of the receiver for a very comfortable shouldered position, and won't interfere with a QD sling. That, in combination with the Magpul K2 grip which is canted forward to a more vertical angle makes this AR ""pistol"" as close to a super comfortable SBR as you can legally get without crossing into NFA regulations.


This AR pistol already has all of the upgrades you would have to pay extra for, when buy a ""standard"" off the shelf or cheaply built AR pistol and realize how uncomfortable and inaccurate it is. Does NOT disappoint.

Gun is in fantastic condition with a clean, bright bore, tight barrel cylinder gap, and perfect lock-up.  

Also included is a fully adjustable leather chest/shoulder custom made for the gun.  The holster alone was $175.

Firm price is $600 cash.  As anyone who has looked for a Redhawk recently will know, they are now selling for upwards of $800, so this is a great deal with the holster and custom grips included.  I MIGHT consider trades that include either a 4"" .357 Magnum, a pocket .380, or both.  Not interested in any other trades.  

All applicable laws apply, and face-to-face sale is prefered, though I am willing to ship if buyer pays all the costs/fees."

It has a 22"" barrel with custom wood. Redfield one piece bases and rings (no scope). Really do not know much about the build or who did it. I do recall him talking about the Griffin & Howe conversion and that it was a ""4 Groove"" barrel. But as i really wasn't into rifles at the time i cannot verify that. It is hard to make out entire serial number as iy is partially under the scope bases.

The one thing i will attest to though was the amazing accuracy of this weapon. I can remember my father shooting 1/4"" groups @ 100 yards at his gun club in Toledo, Ohio.and he was 70 years old at the time. Club is long gone now.

I have had this gun in my position for about 25 years now. When i received it after his passing. The rings and bases were there but no scope. Scope in photos not included. Has some minor scratches in wood and some surface flaking on stock where a sling with brass fittings rubbed up against it. I have put about 20 rounds through it and it is still amazingly accurate!

Asking $450 shipped. Please PM for additional info or pictures. I tried to describe the gun as best as i can but i am not a rifle expert.
