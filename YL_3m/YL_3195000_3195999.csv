Whether you choose an FMJ bullet for its deep, bone-shattering penetration or its ability to protect the integrity of the pelt, you’ll find the perfect Full Metal Jacket in our traditional line. Secant Ogive Design Pioneered by Hornady for use in hunting bullets, this technology broke new ground in ballistic engineering and is now used in bullets for everything from match to varmint shooting. The secant ogive is a geometrically developed design that creates the most ballistically efficient profile, yet retains the optimum bearing surface. The combination of the slender point and increased bearing surface results in lower drag, increased stability, flatter trajectories and amazing accuracy."

Here is what the manufacturer calls a faithful replica of the famous open top, iron frame receiver patterned on Oliver Winchester’s key employee Nelson King, who hit upon the loading gate and wood forend development, an important step between the 1860 Henry Rifle and the form that traditional lever action rifles embody even today. Photos show a specimen from a small lot we got on a distributor closeout, a 20 inch Octagonal Barrel Carbine chambered in the venerable .45 Long Colt caliber. This rifle was originally designed for black powder cartridges, and owners should not use ammo rated at over 800 fps, stick with cowboy loads. This well balanced carbine weighs in at only 7 pounds 4.5 ounces, and its center of gravity is the juncture between barrel and receiver, exactly where it’s supposed to be. Barrel is nicely blued with a hint of purplish hue, marking is Chaparral ~ Repeating Arms / King’s Improvement Patented March 29, 1866, October 16, 1860, in front of the traditional set-screw anchored dovetailed traditional buckhorn type rear sight, with the words Cal .45 Colt behind the sight elevator. On the bottom of the receiver beneath the Italicized serial number is Cat. 18166. Upper tang is marked Model 1866. Right side barrel flat reads with the import mark, Charles Daly KBI H’Burg PA Made in Italy, barely visible above the forend as photo #10 shows. The 10 shot magazine tube, like the barrel, screws, trigger, and lever locking key are blue steel; and the receiver, forend cap, lever, hammer, and buttplate are color casehardened steel. Shell carrier mechanism and ammunition storage plate on the buttplate are solid brass, and the carrier of course mates at the bottom of the receiver. Forend and buttstock are Italian walnut with occasional shelfwear creases like the photo specimen shows only one of, on the left side of its buttstock. These rifles have been displayed, but never loaded, fired, or transferred; they are in their original boxes with all their papers. We only have a handful of them. Chaparral Arms, of course, is an Italian based company with relations to three great companies, KBI, Charter Arms, and Armi San Marco. Similar Italian-made rifles from competitors Uberti and Navy Arms command prices upwards of $1000 - $1500 per unit. We have not been able to offer any quality 1866 or Henry type rifles in this price range for many years, not since the 1970s. We’re offering these beautiful rifles, the rifle in the photo or one of its identical mates, each		for only	$ 719.00.	2% discount if payment is by USPS Money Order and not credit card.

       The XR9-L is truly the finest pocket pistol money can buy, representing the pinnacle of performance, accuracy and low recoil via an exclusive ""mid-buffer"" that absorbs the very harsh jarring normally caused by the barrel stopping against the frame. The pistol comes with an integrated Picatinny rail to support several commercial lasers and flashlights. Using select 9mm +P ammunition, this pistol generates over 500 Ft-Lbs of muzzle energy with felt recoil similar to .380 ACP. Using standard-pressure 9mm ammunition, the XR9-L produces felt recoil similar to .22 LR.

204,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3195204,For Sale/Trade:  BEWARE TONS OF SCAMMERS HERE,"MN, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota","$ 123,456,789","Listed On: Friday, June 20, 2014",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have been a armslist regular for over 5 years. Half of them while living in WI and half living here in MN. I have sold, traded and bought many many times and have meet some real good people, most the people on here are honest and legit, but recently the amount of fake and scam ads has risen dramatically and it seems armslist either cannot or will not do anything about the repeat offenders. While some may be ATF or other law enforcement doing some sort of stupid test or sting, most if not all of these ads are just people trying to scam or frustrate others, possibly trying to swing market prices ect.

In the ""private party"" section here are things to look for-

1.While I know some prefer email most text and call, so if an ad does not have a phone number it could be a scam. If you email your phone number and they either don't reply or reply again by email and not phone, or they don't leave their phone number it's probably a scam.

2.Generic text. Look for copy and paste ads where they just copy the gun manufactures info and paste it in ad. One can tell if a person is actually talking legit in a ad.

3.Real pictures. I know some people don't have good cameras or they are just too lazy but generic pictures are just that, I could post a pic of a tank and say it's mine and for sale. Look for real pictures. In many of the fake ads there is a red background, backgrounds set up to look like actual photographers background are either dealers or scams, many pics are just taken off google images.

4. Willing to meet face to face. If it's ship only it's again either a dealer or a scam. I even had a guy willing to ship to my home knowing I didn't have a ffl or a c&r. In a private sales if they are not willing to meet up they are a scam. As for traveling that is up to a individual person and their schedule but unwilling to do a ftf in a private sale is a for sure warning sign of scam.

5.Too good to be true. Obvious. While some will give a good deal in a trade and maybe just need the cash bad if one knows firearms prices they know is real and what is scam.

6.The no reply or stupid reply. Many scam artists don't even reply because they have so many scams going they can't get to all of them. Then there are some that will send messages like ""Waiting on you response"" or ""are we going to deal?"" If these are then type of responses you get after you send a valid question or pry for more info it's a scam.

7.No trade. While many just want to sell and many legit sellers post ""no trades"" I have seen a trend lately of scam ads using this language. It has to do with the fact there is no way to scam in a trade as the scam is to get you to send money. Anyone not interested in a good trade I really have to wonder. But this is the least of the warnings as again many only want to sell and there is a sale/trade option but then again many don't even know that title option is there.

Hope this helps some. I just couldn't sit by anymore and not post a response to the numerous fake and scam ads up this past week and longer. I know for a fact the Ed Brown 1911 up just today is a scam. So they are not going away.

Here is what the manufacturer calls a faithful replica of the famous open top, iron frame receiver patterned on Oliver Winchester’s key employee Nelson King, who hit upon the loading gate and wood forend development, an important step between the 1860 Henry Rifle and the form that traditional lever action rifles embody even today. Manufacturer was Chaparral Arms of Brescia, Italy, an Armi San Marco successor company that was briefly connected to Charter Arms and a German Corporation. Barrel marking on the top flat reads Chaparral ~ Repeating Arms / King’s-Improvement-Patented-March 29, 1866. October 16, 1860. 2 O’clock flat is marked by the importer, Tri-Star S.A. of NKC, MO. Specimens are not date coded, but we estimate they were manufactured in 2005 or 2006. This well balanced carbine weighs in at only 7 pounds 7.5 ounces, and its center of gravity is the juncture between barrel and receiver, exactly where it’s supposed to be. Barrel is nicely blued with a hint of purplish hue, marking is Chaparral ~ Repeating Arms / King’s Improvement Patented March 29, 1866, October 16, 1860, in front of the traditional military two leaf type rear sight, with the words Cal .45 Colt behind the sight. Receiver is blue steel with original Henry style plates. On the bottom of the receiver beneath the Italicized serial number is Cat. 16166. Upper tang is marked Model 1866. Receiver, 10 shot magazine tube, barrel, screws, trigger, hammer, lever, and lever locking key are all dark blue steel. Shell carrier mechanism and ammunition storage plate on the buttplate are solid brass, and the carrier of course mates at the bottom of the receiver. Forend and buttstock are Italian walnut with plain oil finish. These rifles have been displayed, but never loaded, fired, or transferred; they are in their original boxes with all their papers. We only have a handful of them. Similar Italian-made rifles from competitors Uberti and Navy Arms command prices upwards of $1000 - $1500 per unit. We have not been able to offer any quality 1866 or Henry type rifles in this price range for many years, not since the 1970s. We’re offering these beautiful rifles, the rifle in the photo or one of its identical mates, each		for only	$ 659.00.	2% discount if payment is by USPS Money Order and not credit card.

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.
The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional. LNIB with all factory papers, test casing, bushing wrench etc. serious inquiries only, no trades.

This is a pretty neat little pistol you don't see too often. Chambered in .co.380 ACP imported by CAI. Because of import restrictions most are shipped with no magazine. This pistol holds 13 rounds in the mag plus one it the pipe. Being a fixed barrel blowback operated pistol with adjustable rear sights makes accurate shooting a simple task. It feeds FMJ reliably and I have run DRT round nose hollow points through it as well with no issue. I have 2magazines for this pistol (converted Beretta model 84 mags) and they function perfectly. The gun has been re-finished using gun kote titanium on the frame and flat black on the slide and controls. The trigger pull is smooth in double action and a crisp 4 lbs in single action. The slide mounted safety also has a de-cock function as well as a firing pin block safety. This allows for safe carry with a chambered round.

Fantastic weapon. Amazing trigger. Every time I take it out, the first trigger pull surprises me even now. I've shot a few 1911's but this trigger seems something extra nice. 
Very aggressive grip with the checkering on the front and the back. Never have to worry about it slipping in your hand. 
Night sights are great. Just as strong today as they were when I bought it a year ago.
Took this with me for the conceal carry course qualification, had more than a few people staring before we were done. I'm not a great shooter, but the sights and standard 1911 qualities, not to mention Sig's next level manufacturing, make it hard not to stand out.

This gun is safer than the milsurp tokarevs because of its safety. If the gun is dropped on the hammer, the milsurp tokarevs can fire, even with their crude safety engaged. The Zastava tokarev has a safety that when engaged blocks the hammer from hitting the firing pin. 
This gun comes with a manual, cleading brush, two 9 round magazines, and 1 box of 50 rounds of Wolf brass cased, reloadable ammo. This ammo has the PPU headstamp on it, meaning that it is just repackaked prvi partizan ammo.

I am also including a bushnell tlrs red dot sight with riser, (used but like new) and 50 rounds of sierra match king 77 gr bullets from the army marksmanship unit.(new in box) Lastly, i am including a surefire hl1-a-tn helmet light also NEW in box. also Including  one windowed pmag. like new but not new.  the rifle new in box msrp 1365.00 the surefire helmet light new in box 190.00 the bushnell red dot with riser 130.00 and the 77 gr stupid accurate smk rds 75.00 and windowed gen 2 pmag 15.00 That is 1775.00 new the only not new is pmag and bushnell and you would have a hard time telling. and I REPEAT.. THE RIFLE HAS NOT had 1 round fired through it other than the factory. I am only selling this package due to a unforeseen medical issue w the wife. also, I know and shoot w many different shooters/operators and i couldnt find a bad word about this rifle.

(upper description from PSA)...
Barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN Manufacturing using their proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feed ramps, and a carbine gas system. The barrel has an A2 style profile, is mil-spec phosphate coated, and MP/HP tested. The upper is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, and an A2 flash hider.
Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.

The Colt Python is a .357 Magnum caliber revolver formerly manufactured by Colt Manufacturing Company in Hartford, Connecticut.   It was first introduced in 1955 and marketed to high-end collectors that preferred the quality of hand-fitted, hand-tuned, and hand-polished firearms.  As a Colt double-action revolver, the Python is best known for its accuracy, smooth trigger pull, and tight cylinder lock-up.  The 8-Inch barrel was originally designed for game hunting.

The Python has many special features that contribute to its reputation.  It has a distinctive appearance with full barrel underlug, top ventilated ribs, and adjustable sights at the front ramp and rear.  The solid underlug reduces recoil and helps balance and stabilize the heavy load.  The barrel is bored with a slight, full length taper toward the muzzle which also helps contribute to its accuracy.

In October 1999, Colt announced the termination of Python revolver production.  The Colt Custom Gun Shop continued to make a limited number of Pythons on special order until 2005.  Many gun collectors and industry experts believe that the Colt Python was the finest revolver ever made."

This rifle:  http://www.browning.com/products/catalog/firearms/detail.asp?fid=023B&cid=035&tid=240
From Browning:   
Combining sports car style with pickup truck utility, the X-Bolt Stainless Stalker Carbon Fiber Fluted rifle has undeniable appeal. The reduced weight fluted barrel combined with the carbon fiber weave pattern on the stock lend a futuristic feel to a rifle that is truly one of the most advanced bolt-action sporting rifles around.

Barrel, action, trigger guard and other metal surfaces feature matte Stainless steel to minimize reflection and provide resistance to corrosion.
Dura-Touch Armor Coating provides positive gripping surface that is both comfortable and easy to hold onto during all weather conditions
Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil.

1941 Code jhv G98/40 Infantry Rifle 


The Mannlicher Gew.98/40 German Infantry Rifle was known by the Germans as the Infanterie Gewehre G98/40.

These German contract guns were made from 1941 to 1944 by Fémáru Fegyver és Gépgyár, Budapest, (German Ordnance code “jhv”), with some or all of the work possibly subcontracted to Danuvia Gépgyár, Budapest (German Ordnance code “jua”). 

The Hungarian-made G98/40 is not a mauser, and shares nothing significant with the G98, rather it is a mannlicher-based receiver design patterned after the Hungarian 35M, the only firearm ever purpose-built for the 8x56R cartridge. The G98/40 was contracted as a war-expedient, to exploit the existing 35M tooling. They were issued primarily to the Luftwaffe.

Distinguishing features of the G98/40 include:

- mannlicher-based receiver design with all steel parts blued;
- two-piece bolt with detachable bolt-heads, and bolt handle positonned ahead of the receiver bridge;
- chambered in 8x57;
- two-piece stock system (similar to that found on the Lee Enfield). Early stocks were walnut, later laminate; and
- mauser sling, bayonet and staggered row magazine designs, allowing the use of the K98 sling, bayonet and stripper clips.

G98/40 infantry rifles are among the rarest Third Reich infantry rifles a collector is likely to encounter and should be recognized and purchased at any opportunity, if possible. Available numbers of examples today indicate that either very few rifles survived the war, or the countries who may still have them aren't releasing them for sale at this time.

Manufactured in 1941:  Serial number 6164

This rifle has been customized to be a high-quality sporting/hunting rifle.  The stock is in near perfect condition.  Sale includes 2 boxes of Lellier & Bellot 8x57 JS."
