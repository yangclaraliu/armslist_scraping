The S-202 action with a 26"" fluted barrel, the Wolverine adjustable match style stock, and the rings and ammo you see pictured. Mounts and rings are from Talley Manufacturing and made for the S-202 models. If you want to know about these rifles, I've put a link to this model's homepage, and you can feel free to Google for impressions.
The ammo is indicative of the quality of rifle, the optic shown is a very nice Swarovski (not included for this price, but will negotiate if you can't live without a complete package). Round count on this rifle is right around 100, and a few of the rounds have been shot out of the boxes you see. From left to right in the pictures, there are 94 left of the Hornady ""Custom"" 100gr, 48 remaining Hornady ""SuperPerformance"" 95gr, 54 of the Hornady ""Whitetail"" 100gr, and 12 of the Nosler Custom Trophy grades remaining. Total ammo to be included: 208 rounds. Over $250 worth of ammo in various weights so you can see what you like/performs best.
This rifle was sighted in and used in Colorado. My friend asked me to find a home for it in Texas on his last trip down, so I'm shopping for a trade, sale, or partial trade either up or down. If you had the right weapon to trade, I'm certain he would increase cash or optics or other interesting options to make the deal. As you can tell from this type of rifle, high to higher end rifles, revolvers, and optics are his primary interests. THIS RIFLE IS IN MY SAFE IN AUSTIN, so no weird mail deals or strange cons from our end. 
Unless you shop the gun library at Cabela's, you generally will not find this type of weapon on display anywhere. Maybe McBride's. But not in your run of the mill gunstores. EuroOptics sells this model for $3200. European gun dealers retail this weapon exact weapon as high as 3,000 British pounds. Gunbroker has this model listed for $3200 as well.

This is not your typical plinking AR as it is expensive to feed and belongs out putting deer on the table. I have an Alexander Arms 6.5 Grendel M4 carbine that has been test fired with 20 rounds of Hornady 123grn AMAX. The carbine has a 14.5 barrel (made by Sabre Defense) with a welded and pinned 1.5inch flash hider to bring this to the legal minimum limit of 16 inches.  The value of the carbine is $1499.00 approximately as they no longer offer this barrel length. The carbine comes with a silicon cleaning cloth, instruction manual, (1) ten round magazine, (5) 26 round Alexander Arms magazines, brand new rear Troy Back Up Iron Sight, and KNS anti-rotation pins. If you are concerned about ammo, I have two boxes of 123 grain Hornady AMAX. If you live in Colorado then I can only supply the ten round magazine. The ammo is still in the case it was shipped in and is valued at $24.00 per box of twenty. If you decide that this offer is something you would like to move forward with then we go to a local FFL. I do have multiple photos to be emailed to you if you are interested. If one carbine is not enough for you, I have three Alexander Arms consecutive serial number carbines waiting for that father sons hunting trip. I would be happy to sell all to you for $1000.00 each. I will pay for all the transfer and shipping fees. 

Maybe we could consider a trade for a Sig M11A1 228 or Sig M400 Carbine. 

 I want to thank you for taking the time to read and consider this, if you have any questions please email or text and let me know.

Most of the Stag Arms 3T-M is, as mentioned, standard mil spec. So, there are not a lot of surprises or caveats to talk about when discussing the working parts like bolt carrier, trigger group or receiver construction. But I know that AR enthusiasts want the specs, so here are the key items:

 Very old turn of the century weapon.

 Shotguns of that era used a 2 9/16ths "" shot shell.
 So a qualified gunsmith should be consulted to determine if modern ammunition can be used.

 What I was able to research was that all NEWPORT shotguns were made by either Crescent Fire Arm Company, Iver Johnson's Arms & Cycle Works, W. H. Davenport Arms Company or Stevens Arms & Tool Co. Again according to my research. the Model CN and Model WN were made by both Crescent and Iver Johnson.

 I f found that Aguila makes a #7 1/2 shot 1.75"" 'mini' shell that will work for this gun.
 http://www.midwayusa.com/Product/255579 ... -box-of-20

 Shotgun is in good shape, no rust and appropriate patina for age.
Wood retains most of finish.
 Matching serials on forearm ( pic included )
 Forearm a touch "" wobbly ""

 Again, a qualified gunsmith should determine if this weapon is safe to fire and the weapon is being sold as is.

 If nothing else, it would make a great wall hanger for an antique side by side enthusiast.

This Scorpion is new never fired. It is in perfect new condition and comes with threaded barrel. Comes with original box. I'm including 4 Sig 8rd magazines and 2 cmc 10rd power+. One Sig mag needs a new base plate. I'm also including a new Off the grid concepts multicam holster which is compatible with a surefire x300 ultra. Holster is compatible with any g code rti wheel. Super nice holster and I had to wait 2 months for it. I think that's all for now. I'm asking $1000 which I feel is very fair with the extra mags and $120 dollar holster. I'm in south Vegas.

Year of manufacture is 1956.  The gun comes with two barrels from the factory and both are marked FIELD KING.  There is a 4 1/2 inch barrel and a great 6 3/4 inch barrel with compensator slots just aft of the muzzle.  Both barrels have bright bores with sharp rifling and good front sights.  Rear sight is adjustable.  The Field King is a relatively rare High Standard pistol and is particularly rare with the two barrel combination.  The Field King Model was only produced between 1954 and 1958.  It was made as a high quality plinker, but was too close in quality and price to the Supermatic target pistol to be viable as a separate product line.  Some of the 1954 models had a lever takedown and the remainder, including this gun, had the superior front button takedown.  The takedown is helpful in cleaning the gun and particularly helpful in making barrel swaps easy.  The only flaw of any significance to the gun I have for sale is a small chip at the bottom rear of the right hand grip.  Comes with one very good condition magazine.  I will consider partial trades for a 22 revolver such as the High Standard Double Nine, Longhorn, or Sentinel as well as H&R top break guns such as the Sportsman.  I would also consider a trade for an H&R Trapper and possibly a decent Iver Johnson or other 22 revolver.  I will also consider pump action 22 rifles.  You can contact me at REDACTED .

Collectable Browning SA-22 Grade II hand-engraved semi-auto takedown rifle.  Produced in Belgium in 1969 (not the post-1976 rifle produced in Japan).  The SA-22 was the first production semiautomatic .22 rifle, and is regarded as a classic firearm.  Awesome looking stock with checkering at 22 lines per inch.  The SA-22 ejects spent cases downward, which was intended by the designer to keep the user's face ""protected from gasses and flying particles while firing.""  Factory engraving was done by hand at FN Herstal (which is now done by laser engraving in Japan) and consists of two prairie dogs on the left side and two squirrels in a tree on the right side.  In addition there is a lone duck in flight on the top of the receiver.  The engravers initials are also included under the lone duck.  1969 Weaver C4 4-power scope is attached with a Weaver .22 Tip-Off scope mount.  Scope is super clear.  Includes original Browning case and owner’s manual.  Compare at $2,500."

I'm looking to sell this FNX .45 Tactical for $1000 OBO. It's an awesome pistol but I can't wait any longer to complete Remington 700 AICS build, and quite frankly, will probably buy another one in a few months. I've only had it a few months and have ran only 30 rounds (2 magazines) through it, and it received a standard thorough cleaning after, so to say that this pistol is like new is an understatement. It comes with 3 magazines and the FN soft case, with and has a 5.3"" threaded barrel and 15+1 mag capacity. It is a crazy accurate pistol and obviously, suppressor ready.

This gun is great.  Bores are mirror bright with no dark spots.  It locks up tight.  There is no slop in the breech whatsoever when it is closed.  Cocking mechanism, extractors, safety, forend assembly and everything else works exactly as it should.  Condition is good with no dents in the barrel, or rust pitting.  There is one small imperfection in the forend where it meets the rear of the iron and one small imperfection in the buttstock where it meets the receiver.  These are no larger than about 3mm and are not cracks,  They look more like places where the user was a little careless and put the gun down hard.  Both the buttstock and the forend are solid and sound.  The gun has original finish throughout and the only nonoriginal part is an early model Pachymar shoulder pad which appears to be a direct replacement for the original with no alteration to the buttstock.  This is a 1923 model which is preferable to the prewar models which are said to have weaker receivers because they were not experienced enough with smokeless powder to really know how strong the guns needed to be, but WW I taught them all the lessons they needed to know.   This gun is wonderful because it is so versatile.  The Flues models are known for being lightweight, easy to shoulder quickly and thus easy to find the target.  Trigger pull is crisp for both barrels.  Being a 16 gauge it won't kick you as hard as a twelve gauge but provides much more firepower than a 20 gauge.  16 gauge ammunition is still readily available and just as affordable as 12 or 20 at the larger sporting goods stores and at online sellers.   If you would like to purchase it and you are not in my area I will need to ship it to your FFL.  I think shipping should be $35 for a total of $385 plus whatever you have to pay to your FFL.  Still a pretty good deal for a nicer gun than the ones others are asking sort of cuckoo prices for."

The original M16 was simply shortened by cutting the half of the lenght of the barrel (from original 20 inches to 10 inches) and by shortening the buttstock by another 3 inches. The butt was plastic and retractable, the handguards were of triangular shape and the flash hider was of original three-prong type. Based on the origunal CAR-15, Colt quickly developed the CAR-15 Air Force Survival Rifle, intended, as a name implied, to serve to downed airplane and helicopter pilots. This version had tubular handguards and metallick tubular buttstock, and fo some reasons the pistol grip was shortened.
Initial combat experience with CAR-15 brought up some problems. First, the carbine was too loud, deafing the firing soldier quite quickly. Second, the muzzle flash was also terrific, blinding the shooter at night and giving away the position of the shooter to the enemies. Colt partially solved this problem by installing a new, longer flash suppressor. This version, known as the Colt model 609 Commando, also carried new handguards of tubular shape. This model was officially adopted by US ARmy as XM-177E1. his version had M16A1-style receiver with forward assist button. In the mid-1967 Colt slightly upgraded the Commando by lenghting the barrel up to 11.5 inches (292 mm), and this version was adopted as XM-177E2.

For those of you shoot Glock, S&W M&P's, and other DAO guns, or if you're looking to get into the DAO system, this is the perfect gun. Sig makes the finest quality handgun available in our market, in my opinion; special forces and the government like to think so as well.
This gun retails used for $750-850, but I'll take $675 obo (be realistic and conscious about offering though, anything ridiculous will be ignored).
