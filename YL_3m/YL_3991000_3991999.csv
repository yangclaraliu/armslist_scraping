Winchester Custom Shop Island Express safari sights.
KICKEEZ recoil pad.
The rifle has fantastic wood with lots of color and figure and only very minor handling marks. The bluing is mint and only has a small rub on the floor plate. The bore is mint and the rifling looks like it was cut yesterday. I know for a fact the gun has been fired less than 50 times. Comes with the original dealer hanging tag and owners manual. The rifle has been well cared for.
Also comes with a hand fitted Browning model 1915 safari case that was purchased in the early 70s. The case is mint with the Browning instruction manual and care card and both locking keys. I have seen some of these for sale in the past but not one in this condition with all paper work and both keys. Rifle also comes with a Torel hand tooled Cape Buffalo sling that was purchased along with the case. One box of vintage Winchester Western 458 solids and one box of empty's.

I've moved it around and played with it indoors often resulting in a couple light cosmetic marks, which I've pictured in this add. The flash hider has had a suppressor mounted to is a few times, and several keymod rails have been mounted on the rails. The trigger pin hole on one side has a small nick from when I installed the timney trigger, it is pictured.

This M-1600 is manufactured by Armscor of the Philippines, the company that brings us their excellent 1911 pistols that perform so very well. Action type is, of course, blowback semi-auto, and it is a direct descendant of the Remington 550-1 rifles that are still in service after 60 years. Sights are correct aperture rear and post front with authentic carry handle and gas housing replicas. Magazines are 10 round blue steel, housed in a correct-looking and fitting AR-15 type housing. Extra 10, 15, and even 25 shot magazines are in production, and we stock them when we can get them. Forend and buttstock are classic Colt SP-1 Vietnam Era styling black ebony stained hardwood with removable vertical pistol grip. The forend configuration allows barrel exposure for better heat dissipation. Shoppers note that the pistol grip installs easily with furnished bolt, same way with the sling. Barrel is 18 1/4 inch blue steel with 1:16 rifling, and receiver is blued steel as well. Weight empty is a well balanced 6 1/2 pounds. We have sold substantial numbers of this brand rifle with good results since the 1970s, when the 550-1 phased out and the Filipino manufacturers filled the gap with a good quality economically priced rifle marketed under the Squibman and K-Mart brands, then Armscor. ARMSCOR uses, writes the factory, only high grade ordnance steel for all major parts for durability and mechanical reliability even in the most adverse operating conditions. Instruction manual and magazine indicates high velocity .22 ammo; our local customers have always had best results with Winchester, Federal, and Aguila coppercoated ammunition. This is a good little rifle, but it is NOT a garbage-mouthed Ruger 10/22. Own the rifle in the photo or one of its identical mates for only $ 139.00.

Special Operations Equipment description: 

S.O.E. Tactical Gear is proud to present the next generation of Modular War Belt. Our new tapered War Belt is the pinnacle of comfort, fit, and advanced performance in load carriage. Padded with closed cell foam and designed to fit to your natural curvature and cofrom to activity and movement without slipping or sagging, the Tapered War Belt reinvents how you carry your first line gear. 

The Tapered War Belt is lined front to back with genuine CoolMax material to improve ventilation and keep the waist cool, reducing the chances of chafing or overheating. Our design gradually progresses from 3.5"" height to 4.5"" height in the back, providing a more natural, hugging shape that sits more naturally on your hips. This allows your body's most stable platform to take the weight load of your first line gear more effectively, reducing or eliminating fatigue from belt-mounted kit and lessening the perceived weight of your gear. 

The Original S.O.E. Gear Tapered War Belt is designed to take advantage of our Suspenders, which distributes the weight of your first line kit even more efficiently--combined, they are quite possibly that ""perfect"" solution you've been looking for. 

The Tapered War Belt is covered in full grid PALS, and with four rows in the rear pouches are able to be mounted at different heights, vastly improving comfort for your particular situation, no matter what vehicle you're in and out of all day. These also come standard with our well-known belt access slots, allowing you to wear dropleg panels or holsters without any fuss or difficulty, and access quick release hangers with ease

It's a 2002 Chevy Impala. Original owner was my great grandfather who only put 40,000 miles on it before he passed and I purchased it from family. I have put around 40,000 myself. Cars never been in a wreck and has clean title. There is a flow valve that needs to be replaced or cleaned sometime in the next few months. It's a $75.00 part and they carry it at any auto parts store. Doesn't affect how she drives and If you'd like to we can take the car to advance auto parts when you come to see it and have them plug in the computer for free so they can show you for yourself that's the only thing she needs. Other than that she's a tank. New fuel pump, good brakes , good speakers, all lights work, no cracks in windshield or any windows no major dents or cracks on body, all windows work, heat and ac work perfectly, interior is in decent shape. The driver side window switch covers have been popped off but all switches work. Hard to explain so I attached a picture. Stock, CD player, all pretty much the same as it was the day she rolled off the line in 2002. Just over 84,000 miles total. This is a tough car with low miles that will make a reliable vehicle for someone for a long time. Asking $2000 in cash+ a handgun but MAY be willing to negotiate for the right person. There is NOTHING WRONG WITH IT SO DO NOT LOWBALL ME . You will not find a 2002 in better shape with less miles. Just won't"

I can't risk getting another DOSL & going to jail with my 11 year old son in the car. If I had family to borrow the $ from believe me I would. I paid $1,100 for this rifle when I bought it Jan. 2012. & that was without the flash light, laser, ammo, drum mag, & Eotech. I paid for those out of pocket when I could.

Would like it to be in great working order. Not too concerned about the cosmetics as long as it functions properly. Would also like it to come with the 2 - original 15- round mags. 

I'm also looking for a Bersa BP9 CC with original mags that I would trade towards also.

These are the 2 guns I am interested in trading towards the Zastava or the Bersa.

1st: I have a great working FEG Hi Power made in Hungary (basically a replica of the Browning Hi Power). Comes with 4 - 13 round mags, 1 - Bianchi Accu mold RH belt holster and a LH Leather top snap belt holster. This is valued more than the EZ with all that I have with it, but I will trade even up for it. 

2nd: Marlin 30-30, model 336w with microgroove barrel, Bushnell scope, sling, butt stock ammo holder and a soft case. I have 120 rounds of good ammo as well. This is worth $575 which is more than the EZ9 (sells for $300 - $350 plus tax) so I would need cash or extras on top of the trade. Maybe some good survival/camping gear (can let you know more of what I'm looking for if there is interest). Also would need cash or extras if I were to trade towards the Bersa.

Let me know if you have either of the pistols I'm looking for. Thanks for looking.

Gun is a like new 96A1 in .40 (smoothest shooting .40 I have ever shot, probably has to do with the internal frame buffer). What makes this gun different from most is that in addition to the mounting rails and the frame buffer, the gun will allow you to swap out the factory .40 barrel for a 9MM one. No slide change necessary, simply swap the barrel and you are good to go. The mags accept .40 and 9.mm. Never ever a jam of any kind in either caliber.

Gun comes with 3 mags, the factory case and all the other factory stuff.

The gun comes with nice extras listed below:

1. 9MM barrel. This one of the few guns where you can go from .40 to 9mm with a simple barrel swap out. It is a Beretta brand barrel, not some aftermarket junk. I paid $100 for it.

2. Beretta tactical backback. 

3. Two additional sets of grips. One set is a simple set of hogue wrap grips worth about $20, and the other is a beautiful set of Wilson Combats in black cherry color that I paid $75 for.

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

From Trijicon's website:

The military’s need for a magnified, self-luminous tactical sight that enhances target identification and increases hit probability on extended-range shots has given rise to the new Trijicon ACOG® 6x48. Powered by Trijicon’s patented fiber optics and tritium-based technology, the new TA648-308A ACOG® reticle features an amber chevron aiming point. It also incorporates a bullet drop compensator (BDC) with additional aiming points estimated for trajectory of the 7.62mm M80 out to 1200 meters. To further improve target acquisition and hit potential, the new ACOG® 6x48 incorporates Trijicon’s Bindon Aiming Concept™ (BAC) – a revolutionary both-eyes-open method of aiming. Like other members of the Trijicon ACOG® line, the new ACOG® 6x48 is battery free and waterproof to 500 feet.

This listing is for FIVE Boxes, a total of 125 cartridges or rounds; winning buyer, however, may take any number of additional five box lots we have on hand at the same per-box price and no extra shipping. Do the math. Remington Golden Saber ammunition comes 25 cartridges to the box, not 20 rounds like competitors Federal, Winchester, PMC, and Mag-tech. That’s 20 percent more ammo for your money. Here is Remington's unmatched high performance load for the .45 Automatic, its Golden Saber 185 grain Bronze Jacketed Hollowpoint. Here is what Remington says about the Golden Saber line: Remington's Golden Saber High Performance Jacket (HPJ) ammunition is designed for law enforcement and personal defense, and it successfully combines match-type accuracy, deep penetration, maximum expansion, and near 100% weight retention. This HPJ handgun ammunition was built around revolutionary hollow-point bullet design, and the jacket is made entirely of cartridge brass, which releases energy over longer distances while mushrooming. Primer and mouth-waterproofing are standard, and the spiral nose-cut feature permits mushrooming at lower velocity without sacrificing penetration or terminal performance. The cases are nickel-plated for reliable feed, function, and extraction. This load is the 185 grain BJHP, Bronze Jacketed Hollow Point. It clocks out of a 5 inch Government barrel at 1140 fps, and delivers a magnum-grade 534 foot pounds of energy at the muzzle. These fine cartridges come 25 to the box, enough to charge two magazines for a Glock 21, a Taurus 24/7, or a Springfield Armory XD. Similar loads from competing manufacturers fetch $1.50 to $2.00 per cartridge. We're offering what few we have, however, at only 63 cents a round, in Five Box Lots at $15.80 per box. Own 5 boxes, total of 125 rounds, for only $ 79.00. Shipping. $15.00 flat fee shipping lower 48 for the whole order. No Returns on Ammunition.

The 1887 was, of course, one of John Moses Browning’s signature developments. Folk often called it the Rosebox shotgun. Here is a well executed, very slick copy of the 1887 Winchester Lever Action 12 gauge. It is made by our good friends in the world's most populous nation, imported by Interstate Arms. While Schwarzenegger’s ’87 was chambered in 10 gauge, this one is 12 gauge, chambered for 2 3/4 inch shells only. This shotgun retains the look and feel of the Old West Cowboy shotgun while constructed with modern high-tensile steel. One of our best local wildlife officers has an original Winchester that he no longer shoots, coupled with one of these that he does frequently shoot, and he vouches for these guns’ reliability. Manufacturer is Zong Zhou Machine Works of the People’s Republic of China. Importer is Century Arms in the former Republic of Vermont. Type is falling breech, tube fed lever action shotgun. Capacity is 4 + 1, overall length is a compact 38 inches; weight empty is a handy 7 pounds; and the stock and forend are American Hardwood. Barrel is 20 inch, plain bead sight, cylinder bore. While these are immensely popular in Cowboy Action Shooting, they are simple enough to operate for non-specialists. Photo shows one of only a few we were able to acquire recently after a 3 year absence from our store. Replacement price on these is upwards of $600.00 in our area, if a person can even find one.

I have a Kahr CM9 for sale.  Has 2-6 round and 1-7 round magazines, talon grips (easily removed if you choose).  This was a daily carry gun and while in good shape does have a little wear on top of slide.  Around 800 rounds fired.  Very reliable, accurate, and easy to shoot despite it's compact size.  Disappears in a pocket holster or IWB holster.  Have box, lock, and manual.  Can include a pocket holster if you like.  

If interested, please contact Don at REDACTED (text/call). Please be 21 with a current handgun permit and we can complete bill of sale. No permit, we can do transfer at FFL in Valparaiso. The ONLY trade I may consider is for an H&K VP9 plus $200 on my end.  We can meet at the Bass Pro in Portage for transfer, so if you can't make it there, this probably isn't the gun for you.  My price is set.  I can appreciate the need to try and haggle, because I do that myself, UNLESS I see someone say price is firm.  I know the prices here and there for this and that, so I would appreciate if you spare quoting them.  If you find it elsewhere for less, I encourage you to buy it, but please don't try to use that as a bargaining tool.

This listing is for TEN Boxes, a full factory case, Total of 500 cartridges or rounds. Buyers may take any number of extra 10 box cases we have on hand at the same per-case price and with no additional shipping charges. Ulyanovsk Machinery Plant began ammunition production in 1917, and the firm served as a principal supplier to the Soviet Military for many years. After the dissolution of the USSR, Ulyanovsk began selling on the US Commercial Market in the late 1990s under their own name. More recently, their product has come packaged as simply, Brown Bear ammunition. Here is Brown Bear’s Military Load, number A919RFMJ. Caliber is 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Construction is laquer coated steel case, not reloadable and with Berdan type priming system. Bullets are lead core bi-metal jacket, 115 grains. Out of a 5 inch Beretta 92, factory specs show a pretty warm 1235 feet per second muzzle velocity, with 390 foot pound vicinity muzzle energy. Garbage mouthed pistols like the CZ75 series, 92 Beretta, Ruger P series, Kel-Tecs, Smith & Wesson 39 59, and Tokarev type pistols like our Zastavas, all like this stuff.

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The SIG SAUER P238 comes factory case and with one 6 round magazine.

This listing is for FIVE Boxes, a total of 125 cartridges or rounds; winning buyer, however, may take any number of additional five box lots we have on hand at the same per-box price and no extra shipping. Do the math. Remington Golden Saber ammunition comes 25 cartridges to the box, not 20 rounds like competitors Federal, Winchester, PMC, and Mag-tech. That’s 20 percent more ammo for your money. Here is Remington's unmatched high performance load for the 9mm, its Golden Saber 124 grain Bronze Jacketed Hollowpoint. Here is what Remington says about the Golden Saber line: Here is what Remington says about the Golden Saber line: Remington's Golden Saber High Performance Jacket (HPJ) ammunition is designed for law enforcement and personal defense, and it successfully combines match-type accuracy, deep penetration, maximum expansion, and near 100% weight retention. This HPJ handgun ammunition was built around revolutionary hollow-point bullet design, and the jacket is made entirely of cartridge brass, which releases energy over longer distances while mushrooming. Primer and mouth-waterproofing are standard, and the spiral nose-cut feature permits mushrooming at lower velocity without sacrificing penetration or terminal performance. The cases are nickel-plated for reliable feed, function, and extraction. This load is the 124 grain BJHP, Bronze Jacketed Hollow Point. It clocks out of a 5 inch Beretta at 1125 fps, and delivers a magnum-grade 349 foot pounds of energy at the muzzle. These fine cartridges come 25 to the box, enough to charge two magazines for a Glock 26, a Taurus PT111 Compact, or a Smith & Wesson 6906. Similar loads from competitors Winchester and Federal go at $1.50 per cartridge. We're offering what few we have, however, at only 63 cents per cartridge in Five Box Lots. Own 125 rounds for only $ 79.00. Shipping. $15.00 flat fee shipping lower 48 for the whole order. No Returns on Ammunition. Bids and offers to buy must be for the registered user only. Don’t buy for your buddies, that kind of thing smells like a felony level straw purchase attempt for guns or ammunition. Magazines and any small light non-gun items ride free with ammo orders.

Signed ammo statement and legible photo ID copy showing your current address required for shipment to non-dealer civilians, see the form among this ad’s photos.

This listing is for FIVE Boxes, a total of 125 cartridges or rounds; winning buyer, however, may take any number of additional five box lots we have on hand at the same per-box price and no extra shipping. Do the math. Remington Golden Saber ammunition comes 25 cartridges to the box, not 20 rounds like competitors Federal, Winchester, PMC, and Mag-tech. That’s 20 percent more ammo for your money. Here is Remington's unmatched high performance load for the 9mm, its Golden Saber 124 grain Bronze Jacketed Hollowpoint. Here is what Remington says about the Golden Saber line: Golden Saber high performance jacket handgun ammo, the driving band makes the difference bullet diameter directly ahead of the driving band is reduced from groove to bore diameter, so the bullet is precisely aligned before the driving band engages the rifling. The result: match grade accuracy and reduced barrel friction. The driving band locks the jacket and core together for maximum weight retention and core/jacket integrity. This load is the 124 grain BJHP +P Proof Load, Bronze Jacketed Hollow Point. It clocks out of a 5 inch Beretta at 1180 fps, and delivers a magnum-grade 384 foot pounds of energy at the muzzle. These cartridges come 25 to the box, enough to charge two magazines for a Glock 26, a Taurus PT111 Compact, or a Smith & Wesson 6906. Similar loads from competitors Winchester and Federal go at $1.50 per cartridge. We're offering what few we have, however, at only 63 cents per cartridge in Five Box Lots.

Hornady FTX bullets for reloading and roughly 200 pieces of 44 Mag. brass. Text me at REDACTED for pictures and offers, thank you."

She shot maybe 4 rounds through it and lost interest instantly. I thought it was a cool gun to have so I've held on to it but I never shoot it. I could use the cash to fund other projects and figured someone else would get more use out of it. Since her experience I think I've shot one full mag through the gun. It comes with a 10 round clip and a gun case that came with it. 

If you like we can meet at a gun shop and you can inspect the gun and see if its your fit before we go through with the deal and if you don't have a lock I can find one somewhere in the safe. 

I used to live in a small town, Blythe, so I'm sure prices were higher there since the next closest gun shop was 2 hours away, but I paid around 550 for it.

Both originally came with wood grips (included) and we're replaced with Pachmayr grips.

Both are .45's. 

I know that a lot of guys who t even look at anything but a Colt, Kimber, etc. But if you are like me and wanted a good 1911 (or two) but can't afford $1000 for o e of these then this is a good option for you. 

I paid $600 each but I'm going through a divorce and I need to raise some funds. I hate to sell them but that's the way it goes.

906,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3991906,For Sale:  Taurus .45 / .410 Circuit Judge Rossi Braztech 45 Long Colt and 3 inch 410 gauge interchangeably Stainless 18 inch 5 Shot NIB SCJ4510SS Revolving Rifle / Shotgun,"Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 489,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 3, 2015",Shotguns,Rossi-Braztech                                                                                ,410                                                                                ,no type,Shotgun,"Our # LGSCJ4510SS Not since the Beals Carbines of the late 1800s has anything like this come onto the market. Here is Taurus’s highly popular Judge Revolver format converted into a revolving carbine that has shotgun capability. Manufacturer is Amadeo Rossi of Sao Leopoldo, Brazil, a Taurus affiliate; this .45 / .410 is marked Made In Brazil By Taurus. Metal construction is entirely steel, stainless finish except for the hard chrome trigger and hammer. To keep everybody comfortable, Taurus left its barrel at 18 1/2 inch with a .455 cylinder bore choke tube when its operator is using Shotshells. Bore is shallow rifled, 6 groove right hand 1:18, well capable of stabilizing .454, .455, and .457 diameter bullets. Chambering is .45 Colt Caliber, but the enormous appealing aspect of this firearm is its capability of handling 2 1/2 inch and 3 inch .410 gauge shotgun shells. Capacity is 5 rounds. It also includes a two shot plug for when the operator might want to hunt federally regulated migratory birds, including the corvus brachyrhynchos, the American Crow. Sights are black anodized screw on ramp front with red high visibility fiber optic insert, and 700 type windage and elevation adjustable rear with green fiber optic dot picture. Stock and forend are oil finish Brazilian Hardwood. Trigger is .312 smooth faced, with matching serrated spur hammer that contains Taurus’s lock mechanism. Cylinder setup is thumb latch swingout, with detent on the front yoke of the necessarily long cylinder. Note the off arm protector gas shield on the lower portion of the cylinder that helps guard against right hand shooters getting their left wrist burned. Receiver is outfitted with a removable 6 slot black Weaver or Picatinny Scope or Optic Base. Weight empty is 4 1/2 pounds, and the photo specimen, our first one, had a length of pull of 14 1/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 1 inch black recoil pad. This firearm is legal for white tail deer in Tennessee, for instance, with the Colt or .410 Slugs, and in Mississippi with .410 Buckshot loads. It is against the law to shoot snakes, so don’t put your wildlife officers on the spot doing that. Each Circuit Judge comes in its factory box with instruction manual, safety brochure, warranty statement and factory registration card, protective papers, total of two choke tubes and wrench, two keys for its hammer lock, and adjustment tools. Replacement pricing on this rifle in our area is $600 or more, and one rarely sees them. Current wholesale is well above $500. We’re offering the Stainless Circuit Judge in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for a limited time, for only $489.00. Shipping. $20 flat fee lower 48 states; $60 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground or USPS Priority with full insurance coverage.
