Below is the description off of the Nightforce website:
One of the most versatile, practical all-a round riflescope configurations. Its compact size, low profile and streamlined design provide a wide range of mounting options on virtually any rifle. The superb resolution of Nightforce lenses results in low-light performance comparable to–and in many cases exceeding–lesser quality riflescopes with massive, bulky objectives.
There are no parallax or focusing concerns, making it extremely quick in the field. A wide magnification range allows the 2.5-10×24 to perform brilliantly from close-in situations to substantially long ranges. It is light in weight and will not overwhelm smaller rifles.

And yes, there's a  reason you don't see too many Crass doubles around:  because responsible shooters have retired them to wall-hangers. But leave it to guys like you to try to foist that bomb off on some unsuspecting schmuck. Any we wonder why gun owners have a bad image:  it's because we don't police our own ranks and rid them of fools like you."

It has a milled receiver The Arsenal SAM7 utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, the underfolding stock locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it."

Looking to switch out my fairly new Tisas Zig M 1911.

I bought it new and put 1 box of 50 through it, it's still pretty tight and needs to be broken in.
One of the magazines is still sealed. Besides some wear marks from me playing with it it's in great shape.

Shoots well, at least for me. Had 1 FTE on my first shot, but I think that was from me limp wristing it.

Has excellent reviews on Bud's, go check it out! These are very well made pistols for the price.

I have 2 other 1911's, this one isn't being used so I'd like to trade for something different.

I'm looking for anything really, pistol, revolver, rifle etc.
From .22 to .44 and everything in between.

I have been looking for a .375 Magnum revolver, but I'll consider anything.

No black powder unless you're making a group trade!

It more than likely ""went missing"" from the factory and was later supplied to Keng's for importation to the US through some back channel. Professionally engraved (not electro-penciled) import marking is discreetly concealed on the underside of the barrel below the gas tube where you don't see it unless you are really looking for it, unlike Century Arms imported guns. Chrome lined bore, has spike type bayonet, cleaning rod, sling, butt-stock cleaning kit and will come with ammo pouch, 10 stripper clips and a steel 30 round detachable conversion magazine. One of the nicest built SKS variants ever made in collectors grade condition.

It is blued, original Colt parts. Less than 500rds fired in 20+ years. No longer have the box. These sell for $1300+ with box+docs. If you looked at these before, you know exactly what you're getting. A badass Colt, and one of the baddest 1911's. Two mags, including a Wilson Combat 10rd (9+1). Gun is in good condition but has some wear as it is expected from a 30 year old gun. Shoots excellent. Inspection is welcome.

http://www.midwayusa.com/product/917864/dpms-firing-pin-retaining-pin-ar-15-matte


I'm loving this rifle; the only reason I'm thinking of selling is to immediately replace it with the mid length version, due to a personal preference for longer handguards.
I've fired between 120 and 160 rounds through it with no problems, even bumpfiring wolf performance ammo. The cleanliness and temperature advantages of the piston system seem legitimate, although I have no DI AR to contrast with. Accuracy is unknown; I'm a terrible shot and haven't tried resting it. 
The original blemish it had was just a weird spot in the finish of the left side of the upper. Since buying it, I've scratched up the barrel and optic rail.

No sights, mags, or ammo included. For extra, I could throw in a scope, see all open sight, PMAG20G3, PMAG40G3, PMAG30G2FDE [6 availible], and/or some ammo [910 wolf performance FMJ rounds available, around 100 expansive/fragmenting rounds]

130,000, 4x4, auto, 4.3L vortec, PW,PL, decent tires, runs and drives well, has nice reese hitch setup.

Previous owner was a trucker and he towed this behind him when he was on the road. He was the original owner. I use this blazer to occasionally pull a trailer with four wheelers or bikes etc for my work as well as try and drive it a couple times a week to keep it running well. (It isnt my main vehicle).

The power windows are a little sluggish, drivers usually works fine, passengers is a crap shoot on if it works or not. (need new window motors). The blower for the AC/Heat just went out, pretty sure its a relay or fuse, havent checked yet though. (I do know the heater core is good though).

Thats all I can think of that it needs before winter. Other than that its a good running vehicle for daily driving, or winter beater for the 4x4. I am wanting to trade it for ANY running and driving truck (4cyl, v6,v8 whatever) doesn't have to have 4x4. I need an open bed truck to haul things with easier than the blazer. Will take partial gun trades as well, or full trades depending on weapons offered."

This is one of 500 of these limited edition 1911s that Sig Sauer made. The engraving work on the sides and top of the slide is amazing as shown in the pictures below. Also included is an extra grip and rail adapter made by Recover Tactical, a box of hollow point rounds, a box of Hornady Critical Duty, and 35 rounds of ball/range ammo. The Recover CC3 grip and rail adapter is made of high-grade polymer composite and is engineered to fit perfectly on any standard sized model of 1911 pistol. This is not pictured but I'm happy to provide additional pictures showing how this looks on the piece.

The Sig Sauer 1911 POW-MIA pistol honors and remembers those who have served and sacrificed for their country. With a black stainless finish, the 1911 POW-MIA has a barb wire pattern etched along the side of the slide. On top of the slide is engraved the American flag and a pair of dog tags with one reciting the soldier’s oath “I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies” and the other stating “Not Forgotten”. On the grips is the POW-MIA Flag, with it’s motto “You Are Not Forgotten”. This commemorative pistol is ideal for the collector who is looking for something to honor our country’s soldiers.

This is the only Auto-5 from this period that I have been able to own that retained the box, and that in fantastic shape. The gun has been hunted with, but not abused and remains in very high condition. The only paperwork not present is the instruction card for installation of the magazine plug, though the envelope is there. Magnums from the 1958-60 period are uncommon in high condition as most were hunted hard and saw extensive use in duck blinds and so-on. For an advanced Browning collection and an owner who still enjoys shooting their investments, this represents an extremely rare package"

This is an ideal concealed carry weapon. Essentially, the P224 was designed as a scaled down version of the full size Sig P229, one of Sig's most popular guns. 

This version of the P224 is the SAS Edition, which stands for ""Sig Anti Snag"" meaning that the edges are all slightly rounded off, reducing the incidence of snagging when upholstering your Pistol in a hurry. An added benefit of this is it looks AWESOME. I’ve fired it about 200 rounds, 100% reliable EDC.

The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. You will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns.
