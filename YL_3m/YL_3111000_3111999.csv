""From the start, consider all guns as being loaded whether you know them to be empty or not. Treat them as loaded guns and you will never have an accident. I am scared of empty guns and keep mine loaded at all times. The family knows the guns are loaded and treats them with respect. Loaded guns cause few accidents; ""empty guns"" kill people every year.""

4 Day Defensive Handgun
This fast paced and exciting course is for law enforcement officers, military personnel and private citizens who want a complete understanding of the defensive handgun and a skill level that surpasses 95% of those who carry a gun for a living.

Cost: $2,000.00
Prerequisite Class(s): None
Regardless of your experience prior to entering this course, upon completion, your gun handling, marksmanship, and tactical skills will be better than they have ever been and you will be able to safely and easily draw your weapon from a CONCEALED holster and fire two,sighted shots to the center of a target 5 yards away - all under 1.5 seconds! That`s right, from a concealed holster in 1.5 seconds!

You will understand the principles of tactics and have multiple opportunities to use your acquired skills under the stress of simulated, lethal encounters. This course is a must for anyone who chooses to own or carry a handgun for self defense.
Lecture Topics and Firing Range Drills: 
As outlined in Two-Day Defensive Handgun with added emphasis on Concealed Carry; Tactical Training Simulation using Realistic Targets in Shoot/No Shoot Scenarios; and Target Engagement from Arms Length to 15 yards under Time Pressure. Course also includes Supplemental Lectures on Shotgun and Rifle topics with Single Elimination Shoot-off, and Distinguished Graduate Skills Evaluation.
Firearm, Equipment and Ammo Requirements:
The weapon must be fully functional, have all factory-installed safety devices intact, and have no dangerous modifications (such as a “hair” trigger less than 4 pounds, removed trigger guard, etc.)
“Pocket Pistols” are not allowed due to their very small size and difficulty of use.
Holsters must be on the belt, correctly fit the weapon, completely cover the trigger guard, remain open when the weapon is removed, not allow the weapon to cover the shooter’s body, and not have a trigger guard retention device (such as the Blackhawk Serpa model and others). NO thigh rigs, cross-draw, etc.
Electronic hearing protection is mandatory and is available at the Front Sight Pro Shop or numerous retailers.
600 rounds of factory ammunition is required, NO reloads.
Age Requirements:
Minimum age is 16 if taking the course unaccompanied.
Minimum age is 11 if taking the course with a parent or guardian. The parent MUST have taken this exact course before, work with the child during the entire course, and be responsible for only ONE child.
Children age 10 and under are not allowed.
Unattended minors are NOT allowed on the property. They must be escorted by a parent or guardian at all times or be enrolled in an appropriate course.

I added an ACOG/RMR combo to the rifle(black). Model # TA01NSN-RMR. Great scope. Very functional with quick and easy transition from scope to red-dot sight. Uses tritium, not fiber optic therefore the reticle brightness is consistent regardless of available light. Red dot uses tritium as well.

If your looking for a long range shooter, but don't have the cash for a 338lapua, or 50bmg.
On eBay you can pick up lee reloading dies for $25 to $35, the projectiles are in abundance and you can get great deals on arms list and gunbroker same as 308 or 30-06.

The Sporter Economy rifle is semi-automatic, long-stroke piston operated rifle which is chambered in 7.62x39mm cartridge. The difference between the Sporter Economy and the traditional Sporter is the Economy (this unit) doesn't have the Scope Mounted Rail.
The design and construction are based directly from Polish AKM blueprints. The Sporter also features several upgrades over the traditional AK, including a tough polymer furniture, and a hand guard with a built in accessory rail at the bottom for easily mounting lights, lasers, tactical grips, bipods, etc. On top of all these great benefits, it includes a limited lifetime manufacturer's warranty and is completely American-made in Florida.

It is recommended that the shooter only uses high velocity ammo. I bought this kit new for my Glock 17, I used it with some Federal auto-match rnds and it worked flawlessly, its had exactly 45 rds through it, cleaned and well maintained. has no wear or anything on the exterior, it does have some slight wear on the top corner of the chamber where it has been fired, the barrel and slide make a tight fit so the friction caused a little bit of wear there. This is a well built, reliable kit, I was very pleased with it but I don't use it anymore so looking to sell or possibly trade.

This is one of my favorite guns, but over a short period of time I've acquired too many handguns and need to sell this guy. I purchased it in November and it was my favorite gun. The trigger (SA) is so short it's incredible. I want to keep it because of it's history with the military and law enforcement but right now I need money for other things. I think us gunnies can all agree that one you get a taste of guns, it can turn out to be quite the addiction. But hey, no regrets! I have cleaned this guy more than it needed to buy, and I installed a rubber texture Talon Grip which makes it truly fit like a glove. Not exactly for small hands, but man will I miss the perfect grip of the Beretta 92FS. I am a fan of heavy all steal guns. Anyway, If the right person offers the right price, I might be willing to let go of it."

You make quickly notice that this isn't one of those plastic tuba ware handguns. The CZ is constructed of all steel giving it GREAT recoil reduction due to the increased weight. I've managed to hit the target from 75 yards with consistent groupings with this handgun! It is a beast and will dominate at shorter ranges, eating any kind of ammo you feed it. The CZ features a manual safety that allows you to carry it cocked with a round in the chamber. Both 16 round mags work flawlessly inside the weapon and any kind of jamming of the any sort has yet to happen with the little over 100 rounds I've put through it. It also includes the original factory case, cleaning tools, and manual/other paperwork it came it. I am selling this beauty because I am interested in buying an AR. Do you think you have what it takes to wield this awesome weapon?

464,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3111464,For Sale:  NIB Sampson Evolution 7 Rail System,"NW Columbia/Irmo, Columbia, South Carolina",$ 100,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 28, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Samson Manufacturing Evolution Series free float rails are customizable AR-15 handguards. The Evo rail attaches to a standard barrel nut with a two piece thermal bushing constructed of stainless steel, two locking tabs ensure the rail does not rotate under stress. The thermal bushing along with the generous ventilation slots help to keep heat from transferring into the handguard and into the operator's hand. The continuous top rail allows you to mount optics anywhere along the top of the rifle and allows same-plane iron sights to be mounted. The top rail has also been relieved to accept most aftermarket piston conversion systems. Each Evo handguard includes two 2"", and one 4"" customizable rail sections that can be mounted anywhere along the handguard tube. The interior of the tube is 1.56"" in diameter, allowing most suppressors to fit underneath.

The EVO Extended Rail series feature a front sight cut out, so the lower portion of the handguard extends out past the sides of the front sight post, giving you more mounting options on guns with shorter gas systems. The EX handguards are the perfect choice for gas piston conversions.

Installation of the Evolution series handguards does not require special tools. Since the standard barrel nut (not included) is used to mount the handguard only the delta ring, weld spring and snap ring must be removed. This means you can install the EVO rail system without removing the barrel from the upper receiver, a step that requires specialized tools such as receiver blocks, barrel nut wrench or AR-15 multi-tool. The delta ring must be cut if you do not remove the barrel from the upper.

The trigger has also been replaced with the Vogel Competition Trigger System, which is also worth $150.  http://www.glocktriggers.com/products/vogel/

I have also done the small work around the gun that makes a big difference.  The standard magazine release was replaced with the extended mag release.  The standard slide release extended slide release.  Those 2 mods make a HUGE difference when using the firearm.

I'm asking for $600 for it.  That is slightly higher than what a store sells it for but you're getting a firearm that needs no work.  The modifications I made are over $300 in extra work you don't have to spend."

And he keeps stating in his posts, ""don't get cought with hi cap mags buy these the only legal magpuls in ca""
First and foremost this is a public information announcment for all those who own hi caps/oem mags.
In the state of California, the law states no persons other than police officers, government officials, and military may buy sell trade or be givin items classified as hi cap mags ""ie. More than 10 rounds"". 
That being said it is completely """"legal"""" yes legal to own and use hi cap mags in the state of CA finding a range that will let you use them because they know the rules is a bit harder.
Furthermore, the statue of limitations on ""building buying trading selling or importing for personal use"" of hi caps is three years so if for some reason three years ago you bought some hi cap mag kits and put them together, yes you broke a law but, once you pass three years you cannot be charged the burden is on the investigators and Da to prove you committed the crime writhin the last three years. 
Also if you sign up and actually compete in competition shooting with any recognized shooting organization, then you are exempt from the law as having hi Cap mags would increase your chances of doing well in the competition.
That all said im in no way a legal deffence nor afilliated with any law group nor is any of this to be taken as legal advice, go about it yourself and read the laws ""a few times"" and remember it's the weird word of the law if it doesn't explicitly say you can't, then you can. Finding hi caps isnot illegal under any laws..."

The 5.56 PDW Base 7.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm.

We've also added a 4"" Samson drop in rail for any shooters tactical options. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper.

This is like-new, barely used, thoroughly cleaned. Made a number of custom upgrades and it includes a bunch of extras as outlined below. I honestly really, really like this rifle as it stands right now. 

So why am I getting rid of it you ask? Everyone should have a solid .22 rifle, right? Well I bought this for my former girlfriend and made all the adjustments/upgrades per her request. Caught her cheating on me, we obviously broke up, and now it's got to go. I own a lot of firearms but have never sold a single one before, even the ones I'm not too fond of. It's feeling like about time to make an exception. I'll be using the funds to start over with another .22 rifle. While I'm open to trades, I would prefer to start new. Might go with a Ruger 10/22 Sporter, I want something with a wood finish since I already have too many all black guns.

This Black Rain has never been fired other than in the factory.  I attached the link below.  This has a stainless steal barrel upgrade on it, I am not sure what the cost if you order it that way but I assume it is at least a 100$ upgrade.  It comes with the single point sling, bag and book, like all of theirs from the factory, here in MISSOURI!  

It shoots 556 and .223.  Note it has the skull design that is their 2nd Gen (not sure what it is called), not that cartoon looking stuff from their original line.
