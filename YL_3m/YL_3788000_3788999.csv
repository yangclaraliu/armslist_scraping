For more than three decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so infinitely precise it is hard to believe it's man-made.

As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot. FEATURES

The innovative Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua Semi-Automatic Rifle provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform.

Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .338 Lapua Semi-Automatic Rifle is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. The rifle’s custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil. With no bolt to manually work, the smooth action semi-automatic action allows the shooter to keep his head in the scope and his eye on the target for rapid, accurate follow-up shots.

In the AR tradition, the Bad News .338 Lapua Semi-Automatic Rifle disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reassembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle virtually seamless.

Piston-driven semi-automatic action

He's a retired Santa Fe Police officer and this was his CCW revolver. It has not been shot much at all, and I put maybe a box of ammo through it. Condition is about as new, with a faint dragline around the cylinder. This one is stainless steel so it's more durable than the aluminum frame ones. 

 The holster is a very comfortable leather one with adjustable retention. It was made by Blackhawk before they started making cheap plastic holsters sold in Walmart. It's as high quality as a Galco or Bianchi, and very comfortable and concealable.

I am open to interesting trades or a combination of cash and trade. Or you can just bring cash, lol. Contact me through Armslist and we can discuss meeting in Santa Fe. If you need me to ship to an FFL, I can do that as well on receipt of payment. You won't be disappointed in the revolver or its condition."

Both types of ammo are steel case, non corrosive ammo but the main difference besides bullet types is the fact the brown bear is a poly coated steel and the gold bear is copper plated (looks like brass unless you held a magnet to the casing). This is high quality ammo that im offering at a great price of 50 dollars for the lot (and I am very firm at that price, finding gold bear ammo is next to impossible).

Overall condition is good/very good with a few wear marks on the barrel and wood, but overall it is good looking shotgun and it is mechanically 100%.

I'm wondering who out there would be willing to help a fellow out.  Checking headspace is a 3 to 5 minute check when the bolt carrier is ready.  I cant get a gun shop to do this without handing over my upper and wait a few days.  I thought I would ask here if anyone has these go and no-go gauges and be willing to meet me for five minutes.  I'm not ready to check my headspace yet, but real soon.

As you can see from the pictures, this Glock 21 is in excellent condition, and it has virtually no wear on the slide or frame. The only reason why I am selling this Glock 21 is because I barely shoot it. I tend to gravitate towards my 1911, but this Glock 21 is an amazing firearm. I will probably regret selling it, but I think this Glock 21 should belong to someone who will use it the way it was meant to be used!"
