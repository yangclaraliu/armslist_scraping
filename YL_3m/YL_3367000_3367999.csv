Comes with front handle

These Mossberg tactical .22LR rifles, with the look and feel of AR-style rifles, are based on the proven 702 Plinkster® autoloader platform. The Mossberg 715T has quickly become one of the most popular tactical rimfire rifles on the market.

Unlike many other tactical .22s, Mossberg has differentiated themselves by going with a A2-style (carry handle) receiver instead of the A3-style. The Mossberg 715T Tactical has A2 front and rear sights, and the carry handle includes a picatinny rail if you want to mount optics.

Most tactical .22s have a 16 inch barrel, but Mossberg decided to go with an 18 inch barrel for a better sight radius and a more traditional look. Also featuring a full length picatinny rail hand guard, adjustable stock and a 25 round magazine.

Shoots GREAT and accurate.
Fantastic shape!!
Comes with front handle

These Mossberg tactical .22LR rifles, with the look and feel of AR-style rifles, are based on the proven 702 Plinkster® autoloader platform. The Mossberg 715T has quickly become one of the most popular tactical rimfire rifles on the market.

Unlike many other tactical .22s, Mossberg has differentiated themselves by going with a A2-style (carry handle) receiver instead of the A3-style. The Mossberg 715T Tactical has A2 front and rear sights, and the carry handle includes a picatinny rail if you want to mount optics.

Most tactical .22s have a 16 inch barrel, but Mossberg decided to go with an 18 inch barrel for a better sight radius and a more traditional look. Also featuring a full length picatinny rail hand guard, adjustable stock and a 10 round magazine.

I'm selling my Gen 3 Glock 19 and thought I would post it here as well. It comes with (2) magazines, Blackhawk OWB RH holster, US flag grip plug, bore brush, manuals and box. The original owner also modded it bit. The grip was stippled and the under side of the trigger guard was grooved to fit your hand better. Pretty awesome ergonomics!

Includes (1) original Colt 10mm magazine.

What makes this particular example interesting is that per the Colt serial number on the frame, that it's a Colt Government model frame, manufactured in 1985; the Delta Elite became commercially available in 1986, so it has been advised to me by a reputable Colt collector that this is one of the first Delta Elites that utilized left over Government frames. Upon sending pictures to a historian at Colt, as I suspected and was confirmed, the gun was never refinished by Colt and appears original. 

Early blued Colt Delta Elite's are hard to find and this is a very unique early Colt Delta Elite and a great shooter!

It is in good shape. I would estimate around 90-95%% condition. The finish is in great shape with minor cosmetic wear due to age. No holster wear, just normal wear from handling and shooting. This model is approximately 15 years old. It has been well taken care of but does have some burns around the sides of the front sight from the porting, but very minor in my opinion. The sight is still 100% visible while aiming. It shoots extremely well, is very accurate, and has never malfunctioned. This has been in a safe for the past 8 or so years and only shot recently to make sure everything still functions 100% to sell it.

It comes with Harris bi-pod adapter and Pachmyar for-end I have only fired this 10 times myself. Nine times for sighting and once for the hunt. My eyes no longer allows me to hunt antelope at those kind of distances with open sights. So this barrel and dies are in need of a new home. I will consider reasonable offers doesn't hurt to try.

The first is a Spyderco Paramilitary 2 with a black DLC coated S30 blade and digi-cam g10 handles. I got some super glue on the end up it while I was cutting through something, but all you'd need to do is let it sit for awhile in acetone (naipolish remover) and it would fall right off. 

The second is a CRKT Ripple 2, and an acuto+ blade. This is a first production version of the second iteration of the frame lock design, and is in the bronze color.

So as you can see, I put a lot of work into making this a very high quality, accurate, match grade rifle. I tried to make it a little more unique than the standard black rifle, and this color is both tacti-cool and practical. This gun looks killer in person, and im in no rush to sell it. I've priced it fair, and I would be happy to run down the inventory costs before labor on this weapon with you. I have well over 2200 dollars in custom parts added to this rifle.

Asking Price is $1500 pretty firm without advanced optics. Ill include a basic red dot and iron sights. 

probably looking at $1675 with optics."
