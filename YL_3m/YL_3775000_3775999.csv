The dagger-ground blade is a beautiful Robert Eggerling damascus, and the double bolsters, also by Eggerling, have an pattern to them that has to be seen in person to be truly appreciated. This linerlock knife features blue-anodized titanium liners, and also features more Eggerling Damascus for the backspacer which is also entirely file worked. The thumbstud is fileworked 14k gold and facilitates the extremely smooth opening of the blade. Another very unique feature of the design of this knife is the faceted handle. Each side of the handle has three distinct flat surfaces, making the knife look very geometrically interesting and pleasing to the eye. The overall fit, finish, and tolerances on this knife are superb. A beautiful piece! I used to own a lot of high end custom knives and this is probably my favorite piece.

Specs on upper:
The 5.45x39 Carbine Base 16"" Upper comes complete and ready to go onto any mil-spec AR 15 lower. This upper is built with the Adams Arms proprietary piston system. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The bolt and bolt carrier have also been protected by using an ion bond finish. Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surp ammo without fear of the parts being unduly worn out. Each upper also comes with 2 x 30 round magazine and a Wolff extra power hammer spring to ignite the older hardened primers.

Everything is factory with the exception of 3 things.
1. Extended Muzzle Break has been added to make it legal to own without the SBR tax stamp.
2. There has been a quad-rail added. ( I put a reflex(not included) and dialed it in to 50 yds and it shoots amazingly well despite the AK's notoriety of not being very accurate but trust me when I say that the quad-rail is a good thing as shooting it without it can potentially burn your hand with which you stabilize the gun as it DOES get hot without the added protection from the rails.. )
3. I put a vertical grip towards the end of the rail on the bottom-side to help adjust for any recoil AND it keeps you from placing your hands directly on the railing on the bottom in the event you're not wearing gloves. (GET YOURSELF SOME SHOOTING GLOVES no matter what gun you're firing)

No need to really sell the gun, and I absolutely love shooting it, I'd just like to hear some offers on it to see if I could move over to an AR platform for the wife .

Feel free to call(leave a VM) or text John @ (865)six-six-one-three-two-five-six

This is not a parts kit. There have been some changes to make it legal, but aside from that you're looking at the original build and setup. Do some research to know what you're looking at prior to contacting me please.

This carbine lists for $1725 in stock configuration, the stock costs $225 alone and the sling, mount, selector, oversized mag release and BCM charging handle, trigger group, etc. are probably worth another $200. I'll also include a new $55 Blackhawk! Sportster rifle case and 2 new black PMags rather than the one aluminum mag shown in the photos.

 Now for the extras, available but not included in the quoted price is a new EOTech XPS2-0 with GG&G flip-up covers mounted on a LaRue Tactical ECOS-C quick release mount that places the YHM back-up sights in the lower third of the lens. Mounted up front is an also Streamlight TLR-1SHP white/strobe light with remote activation. If you want the EOTech, mount and covers add $550 to the price (the street price of the EOTech alone is $500 or more, the mount cost $135 and the lens cover was $42). If you want the tactical light plan on another $150. The YHM flash hider/suppressor mount is not included but will be replaced with a birdcage flash hider.

I bought this new and love it. I have shot 410 slugs and buckshot as well as many different kinds of 22LR from it with never one misfire. 
Both the 22LR and 410 shoots straight.
I took the trigger guard off but still have it if who ever buys this wants to put it back on. 
I preferred it folding tighter when packing it.
I put some leather on the lower barrel so my hand would not get hot when shooting it. Only really needed this when I was shooting skeet.

This is a super cool gun that is no longer made.

I bought this new and love it. I have shot 410 slugs and buckshot as well as many different kinds of 22LR from it with never one misfire. 
Both the 22LR and 410 shoots straight.
I took the trigger guard off but still have it if who ever buys this wants to put it back on. 
I preferred it folding tighter when packing it.
I put some leather on the lower barrel so my hand would not get hot when shooting it. Only really needed this when I was shooting skeet.

This is a super cool gun that is no longer made.

This gun is off the CA roster and will only be available next year through private party transfer IF you can find one.

The Walther PPQ is known for having the best striker-fired trigger out in the market. The 5"" is no exception and also has the added benefit of increasing sight radius which only enhances your accuracy even more. Simply put, this gun is a certified tack driver!

The gun is in excellent condition and includes all the factory accessories/parts and the Walther box. The gun has only seen 250rds through it and is in excellent shape, looks brand new still. The barrel has been titanium nitride coated which increases the durability of the barrel finish while also adding lubricity to high-wear areas. It also has the added effect of making the gun look even sexier.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking."

This is an AK built 100% here in America and even has an American flag on the side of the reciever. It is a milled reciever unlike normal stamped AKs, and it's milled from one block of 4140 steel. This AK is equipped with some unique features such as a windage adjustable rear sight like the one that is usually found on an RPK and can be adjusted with a hex wrench rather than a normal AK sight tool.  The rifle also features a Tapco G2 trigger that pulls at a predictable 4.5 pounds. It has laminated wooden furniture with the front handguard having a palm swell for a better grip.  It also has an aftermarket finger groove pistol instead of the standard peg grip.The bolt carrier has lightning cuts in it for fast cycling of the action. It has a 16"" US made barrel and Up front is Century's proprietary chevron muzzle brake (14x1 LH) that does a good job of keeping the muzzle down on rapid fire. I am selling the rifle with the Tapco magazine it came with although it will accept any other brand AK mag As I have tried Magpul, surplus steel, Circle 10, US Palm, etc.  The rifle has a nice even parkerized finish.

I have about 400 rounds through the rifle with no problems. Shoots well and prints approx 2.5-3"" MOA groups if you take your time since the trigger is nice which is standard for all AKs.  I'm selling the rifle in order to get some extra funds for the holiday. I am asking $600 OBO which is fair considering that what people try to charge for junk WASR AKs here on Armslist, and I can be reached at the reply email address or by texting me at 724seven146020.

Website Description:

The Signature Compact Model features many of the Signature Series attributes such as a proprietary thinned frame and mainspring housing that are scalloped to provide a positive grip without the abrasion some people feel from checkering. The grips are a new pattern of G10 that are thinned to make concealed carry even easier, and feature a relieved area on the side to allow easy access to the magazine release. Add to that the soft shooting 9mm caliber and you have an ideal carry gun.

The barrel / bushing combination make for an easy take-down without the use of any special tools.

Just like all newly manufactured Nighthawk Custom handguns, the new Signature Series Compact features our ultra hi-cut frame that allow shooters with very large hands to get that pinky finger to rest firmly on the frame while shooting. It also allows a more natural point when you extend your arm since your hand goes up into the frame much further.

For Sale or Trade: A very clean 2002 Harley Davidson XL 1200C Custom Sportster with the following upgrades:

* Screaming Eagle Stage 2 kit which includes:
* Screaming Eagle stainless steel & chrome exhaust pipes
* Screaming Eagle Stage 2 breather & carburetor jetting
* Custom Mustang Seating - very nice and comfortable
* Removable rear seat and back rest
* Forward foot (brake & shifter) controls - very comfortable
* Removable HD windshield
* Custom aluminum rear mag wheel & chrome spoke front wheel
* Many HD chrome and accessory updgrades - too many to list
* Tires have less than 3k miles on them

There is absolutely no rust on this motorcycle at all - it has always been stored inside with a cover. Bike starts right up every time and sounds great and is a very fast bike - if you have never ridden the 1200 cc bike versus the 883's there is a huge difference.

Within the past year the following parts have been replaced or maintenance performed at the local Harley Davidson dealership:

* Drive Belt
* Plugs
* Motor oil & oil filter
* Brakes - front pads and rear review and adjustment
* Transmission fluid
* Overall engine, transmission and physical inspection by HD certified mechanic at the dealership
* Battery replaced along with battery tender connection installed for ease of maintaining the battery
* Over $1200 in repairs and maintenance performed
* Mileage just turned on 21k but you would never tell it by the bikes condition

You may find a cheaper bike than this one but I dare you to find one in better condition and one that has been as well maintained as this one. No hurry to sell just looking to clear out some garage space and will be looking to order a new 2015 Road Glide in the Spring.

You are more than welcome to personally inspect this bike or even have it inspected by the HD dealership at your cost - nothing to hide here. No rides (at all) without cash exchanging hands first - no exceptions. TN clean and clear title in hand. 

If the ad is up then the bike is still for sale - will not respond to bogus or phishing emails or text messages. I will remove the ad as soon as the bike sells. Bike is sold as-is with no written or implied warranty. 

Not interested in boats, junk, projects, or items not worth at least $5500 - please don't waste your time or mine. If you have trades to offer, please send complete specs and pictures.

Will respond to emails or legitimate text messages but prefer calls.

The Custom takes Sportster grunt to high style with forward foot controls, bullet headlight and drag style handlebar with unique riser.

The gun has a 2 3/4in chamber, also there is engraving on both sides of the receiver, one side depicts a pheasant in a field, the other side depicts a duck over a pond."

Sleek design with daylight-capable illumination, the Leupold VX-R patented
1 button design minimizes bulk, while allowing users to select between 8
intensity settings, including a low/high indicator. The readily available
CR-2023 coin-cell battery produces remarkable run times, while the fiber
optic light pipe eliminates the need for an eyepiece-based control module.
Proprietary motion sensor automatically deactivates illumination after 5
minutes of inactivity, yet reactivates instantly as soon as any movement is
detected. Leupold's legendary Index Matched Lens System combines with
edge-blackened lead free lenses for astonishing clarity and light
transmission, while the extreme fast-focus eyepiece ensures optimal diopter
adjustment in the field. The 30mm main tube and finger-click adjustments
assure maximum adjustment precision, while the second generation
waterproofing resists the effects of thermal shock much more efficiently
than standard nitrogen. Water proof, shockproof, and backed by the Leupold
Full Lifetime Guarantee, the Leupold VX-R is the next generation in
sporting optics.
