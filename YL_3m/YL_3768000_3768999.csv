I've had the rifle less than a year, and only have about 500 rounds through it. Still in great shape. I haven't done anything to the stock or handguard, so you can refinish it or leave it as is. I did put a Magpul grip on, which I like better than the Tapco grip it shipped with. I'll give you both. It will also come with 1 surplus steel mag, 1 tapco mag, and one magpul mag.

These rifles are harder to find these days, as production has permanently ceased and all the US stores (that I can find) are sold out. 

Good review here: http://youtu.be/x-fDRqPeCwc

I'm not completely sure what the capabilities of this rifle are, but with cheapo Wolf ammo, I can hit a 12"" steel plate over and over at about 200 yards.

It's brass case with a Full Metal Jacket bullet. The jacket material is actually a two part deal with a thick steel inner jacket covered by a thinner copper outer jacket, and that's why this ammo attracts a magnet. It's probably also a part of why this stuff penetrates like crazy. The truth is that this round's penetration ability comes from a combination of very high velocity coupled with a small diameter bullet that has a thick steel inner jacket. There really isn't anything quite like the 7.62x25 in our American pistol cartridge lineup. 

This Polish ammo also always seemed to shoot a little cleaner than other surplus ammo for me, and it's sure to fire. It is corrosive primed so cleaning your firearm is a must and you'll never have any problems.

Then the last thing is that this ammo is noticeably hotter than any other surplus or commercial ammo I've tried. This may be due to the fact that this ammo was designed to function properly in the Pole's sub-machine guns. If you shoot it side by side with anything else I think you'll notice the difference too. I've shot this same ammo in a number of CZ52's and various TOK pistols without issue, however all of my firearms were in tip top condition. So you must be sure your firearms are in top shape too before firing this ammo or any other military grade ammo in them. When in doubt seek the advice of a professional gunsmith.

THIS LISTING IS FOR 5 SEALED 70 ROUND BOXES FOR A TOTAL OF 350 ROUNDS. THE LOOSE ROUNDS SHOWN ARE FROM AN OPEN BOX AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS LISTING.

Price is $125 with pick up in the Brandon area or I can ship via UPS ground for the actual cost.

The brand new bullpup-rifle from IWI that's taking the world of modern semi-auto rifles by storm. After more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

I purchased this optic about 3 months ago and planned on using it for night hunting coyotes. I have never used it for this purpose so I cannot justify keeping it around to gather dust. It is an excellent optic, however. It is regarded as the best Gen 1 night vision optic out there and I certainly believe that. The clarity is superb for a first generation unit and has very few artifacts. This unit is built strong like a PVS 14 and is not flimsy like most other entry level night vision equipment. This unit is in like new condition. It has less than 1 hour of runtime on it. It also comes with the pictured carrying case. 

This unit and the picatinny rail mount that is included were bought off Amazon. I paid $575.99 for the combo. I would like to get $490 cash or in trade value. This is 15% less than the cheapest place on the web for these. For trades, I am interested in most all types of guns. I may also be interested in optics that are in this price range as well.

These are solid steel CZ75 clones if you aren't familiar with them, uses CZ pattern mags and can be carried cocked and locked or hammer down. The .40 caliber C-100 is hard to find here in the states and was only released here recently. Functions well but I didn't like it like I thought I would.

I could use some Christmas money so I'd like to sell it for $300 firm. Will include my remaining .40 ammo with the sale, 45 HP's and about 75 rounds of FMJ.

That is how much they used to sell for but they have recently been discontinued. It is actually a tall version of their Light Hiker. Very lightweight and breathable and have a built in Orthotic insole. They are awesome boots that are very popular and these are still brand new in box, they have never been worn. They are size 13 but I think they would work for someone that takes a 12 too. I ordered them for $69 plus shipping on clearance hoping they would fit because the cheapest I could find them in my size (14) was $112 plus shipping, but as soon as I tried them on I knew they were just a little too tight for me. I didn't even have them on for more than 10 seconds and the tags are still on them. I can send them back if no one wants them within a few days but I won't get refunded the shipping charges I paid plus I would have to pay shipping again to return them. So if anyone wants a great deal on an exceptionally comfortable pair of quality boots they can have them for the $69 I paid and I will only lose the shipping once in stead of twice. No need to send me any offers of less, it is $69 firm or I will just return them.

This SKS came with the 3-point bayonet, I've added the strap, cleaning kit, and oil/solvent can. Also included are a sealed box of 120 rds. of surplus Russian 7.62 X 39 ammo, and 139 rounds of boxed Wolf Russian non-corrosive 7.62 X 39 steel cased ammo. The Sentinel 8-gun safe in the background is part of the deal, though I am willing to sell that separately. The case pictured is included - and has broken clasps. Also including the gun cleaning supplies and box, the magazine pouch, and the ammo can.  She shoots incredible. I'm going to miss this gun. 644 is my rent, done deal. Willing to entertain offers but don't lowball me, I'm no fool. Rifle alone is worth at least 450, 50 bucks in ammo, mags are at least 10 a piece X 3 is 30, safe is 50 used, figure at least 20 for everything else - you get the picture. Somebody might take this full pop, rest assured I won't let it go for cheap.

Designed through close collaboration with Israeli Special Forces, the MEPRO M21 is battle proven, simple to use accurately and totally reliable.

MEPRO 21 offers a large 30mm diameter lens which allows rapid target acquisition with both eyes open. This was the first reflex sight in the world designed for close quarter combat, and it can be ordered with optional reticles – dot, triangle, open-x and bullseye.

Illumination of the aiming point is achieved by a fiber optic collector system during the day, and by a miniature self-powered tritium light source at night. Transition between the two systems is instantaneous and automatic to assure good contrast between the aiming dot and the target area.

The MEPRO 21 reflex sight offers users the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open.

The MEPRO 21  is also designed to work in tandem with a magnifying scope like the
MEPRO MX3 - mounted behind it for ultimate accuracy.

Advantages
- Always ready for action – no batteries or switches.
- Aim & shoot faster than ever - with both eyes open!
- Self-illumination means always available

This is a Superposed B-25 that was manufactured in Belgium in the FN Custom Shop.

The silver/grey coin finished receiver features a pair of ducks on the right and a pair of pheasants on the left with plenty of scroll on the borders, bottom of receiver and trigger guard. The engraving on this example is reversed to the standard layout, shows exceptional detail, and is signed by FN engraver Pierre Lallemand. The barrels measure 29-1/2"" in length, have 2-3/4"" chambers, and are choked Improved Modified over Improved Cylinder (the previous owner had Briley Manufacturing open the bottom choke from IM to IC, a very sensible modification). It has the single-selective trigger, automatic ejectors, and non-automatic safety. The oil finished wood shows very attractive figure, the buttstock with the round-knob configuration and the forend with graceful schnable tip. There is a ""Decelerator"" pad installed for a LOP measuring 14-3/8"". The butt shows standard right-hand cast-off, Drop @ Comb is 1-1/2"", and Drop @ Heel is 2"". Weight is 6-pounces, 8-ounces. Condition is excellent and this gun shows only very light use. The original metal finish rates 98% with only a tiny amount of blue wear to the bottom barrel where the forend slide during assembly/disassembly. There is no rust or any pitting. The stocks are in excellent condition as well with a couple of very minor handling marks and I'd grade the wood at 98% as well."

This weapon has less than 100 rounds through it since new.  A friend of mine bought it thinking the size would fit her, but the mass of the gun means more recoil.  So, she can't handle it and is trading to a 9mm.

Her loss, your gain.  I'm selling this basically NIB Glock for less than retail, but I'm not looking to give it away.  

You get everything you'd normally get with a retail purchase + 2 extra magazines.  If you have questions reach out.  

I accept ONLY cash or gold as a method of payment.  IF you think you have something else I'll consider, I'm a reasonable guy. 

Retail this gun goes for over $550.00 and then you add sales tax on top of that.  Buying this one saves you over $100 when you consider price and the 2 free magazines.

Since I'm not interested in arming criminals for crazies, you MUST possess a current CCW permit OR have this weapon transferred to a FFL holder.  No exceptions, period.

IF you are a CCW holder it will work like this: I will need a copy of your CCW and Drivers License  if we make the sale.  I will give you copies of mine as well so you know with whom you are dealing. I will keep this in my possession, in my gun safe and will NEVER share it with any other person or government entity unless a crime is being investigated where the firearm is proven to be part of a legitimate investigation.

Hopefully you are OK with this."

These are solid steel CZ75 clones if you aren't familiar with them, uses CZ pattern mags and can be carried cocked and locked or hammer down.

The Sig P938 Equinox is a Custom Shop sig sauer with the Custom Shop logo etched in the brushed finish from the factory. I am the original owner. It has maybe 50 rounds through it. It is a recent model, not one of the early ones that had issues. This one fires HP and FMJ flawlessly. It comes with the factory hard case, two mags (one extended) and four holsters. The holsters are a very nice Desantis Pocket Holster with shield accessory, Galco leather IWB, Alien Gear Cloak Tuck 2.0  Hybrid, and an Uncle Mikes IWB I bought when I bought the gun before I ordered the nice ones. I have large hands and shoot something a little bigger better, but this is a match grade little gun that packs a lot of firepower and can reach out with accuracy. It has siglite night sights and the front one is fiber optic as well giving the sights a nice daytime white and green dot contrast and all bright green at night. The grips are Blackwood and are beautiful on the gun. Gun is like new.

The Kahr CW40 is also a nice gun and is my preferred IWB carry gun. I have had Sub Compact and Compact guns from glock, S&W, Springfield, etc. and this one is thinner, lighter, and is more accurate to me than all of them. I got used to the combat sights quickly and the laser is dead on at 15 yards which I don't usually like to use, but on this gun with CT it is very natural feeling. I prefer the Sig for pocket carry, but this gun is capable of that and is very comfortable IWB. It is in great condition, and it comes with two extra mags (three total), some good .40 ammo (HP and FMJ) and an IWB holster. Hard case and paperwork also included. There are mixed reviews on this gun, but if you look closely and do research it is due to improper reassembly after take down and this one has been done correctly. Thus it is 100% reliable with no FTF, FTE, etc. I have at least 200 rounds through it with no problems. It is a clean gun that I trust. It is a double action gun but has a very clean and very light single action feeling trigger, just longer than a single action but just as light. I usually do not hit well with a double action, but I do great with this one. I also have an Alien Gear Cloak Tuck 2.0 for this gun as well special made for the Crimson Trace laser, but I am going to keep it unless I get a nice holster in return. These holsters have a 1.5 month wait and free exchanges for life. I will include it though if I receive a holster in return.

The reason I want to trade is because I have large hands and I wanted the smallest and nicest 1911 platform possible (Sig P938 Equinox) but I think that with my large hands that I should go up one size. I am content keeping it as the world's nicest pocket gun if no trade occurs, but I am also willing to make a deal. The Kahr I got on trade but kept it because I liked it, but I am willing to let it go as well for the right gun.

*I am located in Auburn and will meet 1/2 way. More pics of either gun upon request.
* Black Talons in Sig mags are not incliuded.
*Gun I trade for must be as nice as mine (like new) and come with factory equipment."

Up for sale is my used S&W full sized 1911. The gun was my carry gun for a while, so it does have some holster wear from the included holster. It is a steel frame earlier version I bought new in 08ish.  I can take a photo of the label on the box if you have any more specific questions.  There is a list of features but they are all in two digit codes.
The gun will come in its original box with everything it came straight from the factory with. I am also including the holster.

This 1911 fires as well as any Kimber I have ever fired, and not once did I ever have an issue with it. It is still in excellent shooting condition and completely stock, no modifications at all.

This is a nice used 1911 you can either carry or go out and shoot til your hearts content.

I also have 450 rounds 230 grain FMJ, they are not included in the price, but if you want to work something out for the rounds and the gun we can do that. Thank you for looking and have a nice day!

Up for sale I have 2 Colt Navy cap and ball revolvers and miscl black powder accessories. I have one replica C&B revolver, and while its fun I have no use for 3.

I got these two and accessories as a part of a larger lot, so I don't know much about their history, nor am I am expert in these guns so I may be off on a few things. Of I am let me know and I will edit accordingly. While not an expert I do have enough knowledge to work one of these things, and will describe both guns as well as I can.

Top gun in the photo: This is really what I am selling, the rest just sort of goes with it. This is a CVA Colt Navy(unsure of year). It is in very good condition and operates flawlessly, very smooth and tight. You can't really see it in the photo, but the cylinder is engraved, nothing fancy, but it is cool looking.

Lower gun in the photo: This gun is likely not shootable in its present condition. The pin that holds it together is slightly loose enough to leave a small gap between the cylinder and the barrel. Other than the loose pin the revolver operates very smooth. This gun was obviously used significantly more than than the one above and it shows in the appearance. I would say fair at best. This gun may only be good for its parts. This one is a Pietta.

There will also be an ammo can full of everything you need to shoot the guns, and a bunch of stuff you don't need too. Unfortunately it is all a package deal though. There are plenty of caps, the wadding, balls, plenty of powder, a couple powder horns, and some other stuff for a larger caliber musket. I think the only thing you would want to buy is a powder measure, unless you already have one.

There is also an additional Cylinder in the ammo can that will work for either gun.

I have tried to cover as much as I can, but if I left something out please feel free to ask. I will answer as best as possible and send anymore photos you might want. Thanks for looking and have a nice day!

(Note: please disregard the the populated information from the site.  There were no options for what these are so I had to pick the closest option)
