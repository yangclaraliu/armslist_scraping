Through this comprehensive Concealed Carry training course, PatriotTAC's students benefit from decades of real-world knowledge. Topics Include: - Practical Applications of Concealed Carry - Weapons Retention- Handgun Manipulation and Firing Techniques - Legal Aspects of Firearms Storage and Transport - Concealed Carry Gear Selection and Consideration - Firearms Safety Concerns While Carrying Concealed - Low Light Shooting Considerations - Drawing / Weapons Presentation from Concealed Carry - Modern Defensive Ammunition Selection - Defensive and Tactical Reloading - Firearms Safety at Home, In Vehicles, and at Work Participants are better prepared to deal with the real-life implications faced by legally armed citizens. While we do teach avoidance, mindset, and handgun skills, we don't just focus on pre-incident factors. PatriotTAC instructors also explain in great detail what you should expect if you use deadly force. Whether you live in Jacksonville, Wilmington, Richlands, or Emerald Isle, we're the shooter's choice for Eastern North Carolina. While our Veteran-owned, small business was officially formed in 2011, the owner conceptualized its framing more than ten years ago while serving on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps. As a Marine Infantryman, and later as a Federal Law Enforcement Agent, the founder was first certified to teach tactical weapons training to military and law enforcement units in 1988. All of our instructors possess recent real-world experience in either military or law enforcement service, or both. Handgun rentals are available for JUST $25; this INCLUDES the ammunition to go along with the Handgun, a G Code holster, a G Code magazine carrier, and two magazines. That's right, just $25 for a handgun AND THE AMMUNITION plus all of the gear you'll need for this course."

Like new and hard to find in this setup. Stainless 22"" barrel with camo stock. Good looking gun and very accurate with factory ammo. Shot less than 50 rounds thru it and set in the safe all last season so its time to make room for something else. Weaver bases and rings and Bushnell reticle. Have 3 boxes of factory 80/100 grain ammo that will go along as well and some empty brass if wanted. Thanks"

22 magnum ammo
Hey all,
I got real lucky and just had a big order of mag ammo process and it is on its way at a really good price. As a result of it I can âshiftâ the price and average it to all of what I have 22 mag wise, which lowers the price that these cost me and thus what theyâll cost you! That being said, here is what I physically have on hand right now, and I will be getting a decent amount more in in the coming week or so. 

I'm selling it at cost to me with shipping and tax so price is for pick up in Norman only. Would also consider trades for certain pistols (derringers in bigger bores mainly), looking specially for a PF9 actually, and even trades for certain other ammunition. Would also consider trades for 45 auto ammo. (Probably a 1-1 ratio depending on the ammo) Here is what I have available as of now:

-27 boxes of 50 rounds of 40gr JHP Armscor precision 22mag-$16 per 50 rounds (1.350 rounds in total) 

-15 boxes of 50 rounds of 40gr JHP Fiocchi Performance 22mag-$16 per 50


I will break it up however you would like to buy it box wise or you can buy it all. It is all the same to me. It is not the best price in the world, but at least I found some I could get available to y'all. Shoot me a text at REDACTED if you would like to arrange a trade or pickup. Or just shoot me a PM on here. Thanks and happy hunting!"

This was a trade in from a person that purchased it and then got orders to leave and had to sell it.  This is your opportunity to get this new gun below dealer price.  This is an excellent rifle for home defense or target practice.  It never gets mentioned in an ad that an AR15 has almost no recoil making it an ideal gun for home defense for men or women.  When you fire and miss, you do not have a large recoil to mess up your aim for the next shot that you would have in other guns.  The AR15 is easy enough and light enough for a lady to hold in one hand and fire.  Think about leaving your wife at home with a AR instead of a gun that she will be afraid of the recoil.  All she has to do is point and shoot.  A great gun for men and women.

A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns.

I would prefer to trade it for another firearm and open to fair trades, and willing to throw in money if the offer is right.  I will also consider selling it outright including 87 rounds of Winchester white box 165 gr ammo, 20 rounds of Speer Gold Dot 185 gr GDHP, Plano plastic case, Sig Sauer P226 pistol, a 10 round factory magazine, and a 13 round magazine.

The P226 has probably less than 500 rounds through it. I shoot it a few times a year, but typically 1 or 2 magazines at most.  I tried to count how many times I shot it, and let's say 4 times a year and 24 rounds a trip (at most).  On a 2009 gun, that is just short of 500.  There are some very slight dings, one on each side of the front rail, one near the trigger, 2 on the beaver tail. They are easily touch-up-able, but I would let the next owner do it so that I am not hiding anything. It has Hogue rubber grips, and Sig Night Sights.

If you would like more pictures, just let me know, and I will get them to you."
599,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3144599,"For Sale:  PS-90 by FNH with Ammo, Optic, and More","Bellevue, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,200","Listed On: Saturday, June 7, 2014",Rifles,FN Herstal S.A.                                                                                ,5.7x28mm                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"For sale is one FNH Gen 3 PS-90 bullpup style rifle in 5.7x28mm.  You can find more info on the differences online but in essence the newest ones no longer have the auto-sear while this and earlier models do.  When I purchased it, I was told that it was more desirable and sought after due to this fact and so this is why I added this one to my collection.  I've also heard that the construction of the Gen 1-3 may have been superior as they wanted to attract a broader audience with the new Gen 4.  I'm not sure how much of a factor this is as two friends of mine with the Gen 4 have had no complaints.  I'd say it is difficult to go wrong with a PS-90 regardless of the Generation.  

Included with the purchase is a 1-4x optic, which allows the user to rapidly switch from 1x to 4x magnification at the flip of a switch, a Sightmark laser sight, four 50-round magazines, and 250 rounds of ammo.  With the cost of these rounds, the ammo represents a value of nearly $200.  Whether bought locally or online after you factor in shipping and/or tax you'll find this to be true.  The magazines represent a value of nearly $100. Though I paid $30, I now see them online at a price of $25 with promotions sometimes pricing them at $20 but again, keep in mind that shipping and/or tax will augment these figures.  I'm just throwing in the optic and laser as I don't have a need for them anymore but the scope had cost me $300 with the laser costing another $100 or so.  Ignoring the optic, the value of the ammo and magazines puts the cost of this practically new rifle well below the $1,600 I had paid for it just months ago.

I'm selling the rifle at the wife's request due to a new baby on the way, so unfortunately I can only keep what will fit in the safe and I'm keeping primarily just those firearms in 5.56 or 9mm. I hate to let go of this having been able to use it just three times. Putting two mags downrange each time, I estimate only 300 rounds fired down range. The lack of use coupled with the ammo, as I have no other guns in 5.7, are the reasons I'm letting this one go. Yet the ammo coupled with the great design are the main reasons this rifle is so appealing.  The lack of recoil (almost on par with a .22), compact bullpup design, and lightweight, of both the rifle and ammo, make this rifle great for home defense (easily maneuverable in tight spaces with less reloading) and many other applications.  4 mags on their person plus one on the rifle with ease.  I've not seen another rifle for which this could be said. 
 I certainly plan to get another at some point in the future when circumstances allow for it.

I got this with the intent of dropping the hammer on some hogs, but I've decided to build a bolt gun instead.

The carbine has a 14.5 barrel (made by Sabre Defense) with a pinned and welded 1.5inch A2X flash hider.
Alexander Arms has discontinued the production of this type of upper and barrel length. (Valued at $1400)!!!

I went ahead and installed a brand new KAC RIS to the carbine to give it that M4 look.
I've put only 40 rounds of 123gr Hornady Amax down the barrel. It shoots like a LASER! 

Package Includes:
Carbine w/KAC RIS, KNS anti rotation pins and Troy BUIS
5x 25 round ASC Magazines (Like new) (Parts Kits)

Also, if you are in SoCal (in or near Los Angeles) you can arrange for Local Pick-Up.
I just added this, because i was thinking it would make an great Father's Day gift.

Anyway, here are the basics:

Winchester ""Legendary Frontiersman"" Model 94 
( aka Model 1894 )
38-55 Lever Action Rifle -  24"" barrel - checkered Walnut stock - Engraved Silver Receiver
Limited Edition, made by Remington Arms in 1979
in Amazing Condition - Never Fired

Ships to you with an original 1979 Booklet (that came with the gun), 
...and a hard case.

Here are some further details:

""Legendary Frontiersman"" 1979 - Limited Edition

Receiver is Engraved Antique Silver
BBL: 24 inch round barrel 
Stock: high grade walnut with cut checkering (with embedded Nickle Silver medallion and curved blued metal buttplate)
Forearm high grade walnut with cut checkering (with Antique silver tip)

Gauge: 38-55 Win 
Capacity: 7 rounds
Barrel finish: blued steel 
Serial Number: LF0XXXX

Condition: Excellent. Has never been used, has never been fired.

I am a private seller (not some auction house, or third party seller, who is just guessing what the history of this gun might be),  
I am the one and only owner of this gun, ever, so i know.

It was bought as gift to me, by my father (who bought it new, from Winchester Arms).
As this gun has only been in our family since the day it was bought, I can personally vouch for its history, the fact that it has NEVER been fired, and that its received TLC over the years.

I am also including the original 1979 Winchester ""Western"" Sporting Arms and Ammunition booklet that came with the gun.

It is all in near-perfect condition.  it was kept in a non-smoking house, and has always been handled with care (and kept lubricated).  Other than periodic lubrication, there has been ZERO restoration done to this gun.  It is 100% original parts, original finish, â¦original everything, and has NEVER been fired.
It is just as it was the day I received it in 1979. The rifle retains 99+% of the original blue finish. a few minor handling marks overall. but it is in truly great shape.

p.s. I am also including a hard case for this gun 
(I don't have the pictures of that up yet, but I will put some up of the case in a day or so).

I'll ship this anywhere in the continental US for $29 (USPS or FedEx Ground, or equivalent - just tell me whats best for you).  
If you want it faster than that, or are out of the Lower 48, ask me and i can let you know what shipping would cost.

I have for sale a like new Ruger LCR 22LR it's only had 32rds through it. Purchased it last month. 

The Ruger LCR, (Lightweight Compact Revolver) represents one of the most significant new revolver designs in over a century. This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted, specially coated, stainless steel cylinder. Each of these components give the LCR a unique advantage over traditional revolvers.

The lightweight, chemical-resistant polymer fire control housing contains the entire fire control mechanism, providing a tighter dimensional relationship of the components than if divided between a traditional grip frame and cylinder frame. The end result is that the fire control components are assembled with less hand fitting involved, resulting in a highly consistent, quality product at an affordable price.
