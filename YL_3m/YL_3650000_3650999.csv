Very hard to find in the usa since it is not imported anymore.  For more information or pictures just text.REDACTED) thanks and God bless you. Attention:  there was a discrepancy about the price, at 15 dollars a box the cost is $360. Reason being...this ammunition is not made anymore and is a plus plus submachine gun ammo that hasn't been in circulation since the 1990's. What I have is real Hertzenberg ammunition that was made in Austria for use in the British sterling to penetrate automobiles and still have effective killing power to individuals inside a vehicle. This ammo ""when and where it can be found goes for $30 a box"". The reason I am selling it is because I don't want to shoot it in my M9 and my poppa can't  shoot it in his M&P 9mm for the fact its 3800 psi and will cause wear on a basic handgun. I just want to resupply my ammo therefore to do so I need $15 a box. Thanks ,Carrie"

I have over $2k into this rifle. The barrel alone was $400 plus another $450 in work from Marvin. I have shot exactly 60 rounds through the barrel. It shoots sub MOA at 100m easily. Marvin Pitts is the guy who dimpled all of KAC's barrels and now does his own side custom work. Phenomenal work. Marvin Pitts worked for KAC and is the one who actually designed the URX rail system along with the dimpled barrels KAC supplied with their 14.5"" carbine SBR. So rest assured, this is a professionally put together rifle. Not a garage project.

Rifle has approximately 500 rounds through it and has ran like a champ. Polytech M1a's are about as close to an actual M1a receiver as you will find. The designs were sold to China in the 80's I believe and their receivers are second to none. Many custom M1a builders will use a Polytech (or Norinco) M1a receiver as a host for a custom build since they are so close to spec. The minor issue with Chicom M1a's is having a soft bolt, so many people will have their bolt replaced with a US made one, like I have. Here's the breakdown of what is on the rifle and the type of work I have had done.

I picked this up at a promotional event to support the breast cancer awareness, it became my daily carry for this past month, and proved to be extremely reliable and accurate(1.5-2"" groups at 25-30yds).

I am not in the need to sell, but would like someone to have it that would carry it on a more regular basis and get a better use out of then I will(its just going to sit in the safe for until net October).

Included is a custome molded Kydex OWB hoslter with a bladetech short drop offest and tek-lok.  I can throw in 50rds of 9mm that had the bullets coated to match the gun(not really sure why seemed like a fun idea).  On a side note on the ammunition, the color coating does not effect accuracy or cause gumming or gunking in the barrel upon firing.

This would be a perfect, reliable and dependable carry piece for you girlfriend or wife, or for a guy that isn't afraid of a little pink.  I at first was a bit put off by carrying a pink handgun, but the conversations that it sparked were interesting to say the least, mostly people that had just never held or seen a pink gun before, they either thought it was a toy or it was painted.

This is out-of-the-box accuracy and hunting performance from Remington.

It comes with a pre-mounted and bore sighted 3-9x40mm riflescope. But most importantly, it's built to Remington's rigorous standards for accuracy and reliability. Simply choose your ammo and you''re ready to shoot.
It features the same great action and barrel as our Model 710 (based on the Model 700) with super-accurate button rifling, but now has an easier-to-cam bolt and a more durable magazine latch. Other advancements include a new, ergonomically contoured stock with a raised cheek piece for rapid scope-to-eye alignment, and grip texture in all the right places."

--Back up parts: I have extra used Glock 30 parts I'll throw in in case one day you ever need them for back up. Glock OEM dual spring guide rod, Glock OEM trigger connector, Glock factory OEM front & rear sight, and a Glock OEM trigger.
The trigger has been hand polished and the safety tab painted red, has an adjustable pre-travel screw so you can adjust the pre-travel just by picking up your gun and adjusting the screw without disassembling the gun (like some 1911 triggers have). It is a smooth faced factory Glock trigger that this guy buys and modifies and sells online for $40. I tried it out in my Glock 30 once or twice and it worked great, the trigger pull felt great as a brand new Glock trigger.

This is out-of-the-box accuracy and hunting performance from Remington. An upgrade of the famous Model 710, the new Model 770™ is the perfect choice for any hunter looking to fast-forward through the process of selecting a scope and components. It comes with a pre-mounted and bore sighted 3-9x40mm riflescope. But most importantly, it's built to Remington's rigorous standards for accuracy and reliability. Simply choose your ammo and you''re ready to shoot.

It features the same great action and barrel as our Model 710 (based on the Model 700) with super-accurate button rifling, but now has an easier-to-cam bolt and a more durable magazine latch. Other advancements include a new, ergonomically contoured stock with a raised cheek piece for rapid scope-to-eye alignment, and grip texture in all the right places."

This is out-of-the-box accuracy and hunting performance from Remington. An upgrade of the famous Model 710, the new Model 770™ is the perfect choice for any hunter looking to fast-forward through the process of selecting a scope and components. It comes with a pre-mounted and bore sighted 3-9x40mm riflescope. But most importantly, it's built to Remington's rigorous standards for accuracy and reliability. Simply choose your ammo and you''re ready to shoot.

It features the same great action and barrel as our Model 710 (based on the Model 700) with super-accurate button rifling, but now has an easier-to-cam bolt and a more durable magazine latch. Other advancements include a new, ergonomically contoured stock with a raised cheek piece for rapid scope-to-eye alignment, stock spacers that insure correct fit, and grip texture in all the right places."

The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy.

The Diamondback DB9 is a micro-compact 9mm automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a Zero-Energy striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380, a micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a Zero-Energy striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

It is just a DIY cheek rest and is not professionally done but is perfect for it's intended use. The Barrel is off of a Savage 10 FCP-K and is a 24"" fluted barrel chambered in 308 and threaded 5/8x24 with the factory muzzle break. I have only put ~75 rnds down the barrel and it is a hammer.

Safe for use in all 10mm firearms with a ramped feed barrel. 
(Examples: Glock, EA Witness)

Built to the tightest tolerances for peak performance rivaling and sometimes surpassing handloads in many guns. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

FMJ-FN bullets are non-expanding, powerfully penetrative bullets that are designed with your woods defense needs in mind; whether fending off wild hogs or black bears the FMJ-FN bullets are consistently effective in taking down the wild animals that you may encounter.

In contrast to the round nose non-expanding bullets, the flat nose bullets are able to pierce through dense bodies of mass while maintaining their nose forward position, which is optimal for maximum penetration.

All of our ammo is loaded with flash suppressed powder so that your visibility will not be compromised if you need to discharge your firearm in low light.

While taking advantage of our state of the art testing equipment, this high performance ammunition is field tested using popular, real firearms that our customers are most likely to own out in the real world with all the elements you would experience. If for some reason Underwood Ammunition fails to meet performance expectations, we stand by our product 100% and will make sure the customer is satisfied with every purchase.

Speer Bonded Full Metal Jacket Handgun Bullets represent the highest level of evolution of the full metal jacket bullet. Uni-Cor construction bonds the jacket to the core for near perfect uniformity and eliminates the opening found on the base of other bullets. Conventional FMJ bases can also deform under pressure, which decreases accurracy. Perfect for indoor target shooting.

Both are smooth and accurate, and have never had any failures of any kind. They're totally reliable due to the open slide, blowback design, center fire cartridge, and  Beretta quality. There is virtually no recoil on these; you can easily and confidently place 8 rounds right on target in less than 2 seconds, using a one handed grip.  They're both very small and easily pocketable. The 21A is double/single action and the 950BS is single action with cocked and locked, half cocked and locked, or hammer down carry choices.  Both have tip up barrels which increases safety and greatly simplifies cleaning, loading and unloading since there's no need to manipulate the slide. It's also great for anyone with arthritis, tendonitis, or any kind of hand or forearm injury (like tennis or golfers elbow).  Both come with 2 factory magazines, original boxes and paperwork.  Original owner. Both of these are ideal candidates for adding a suppressor due to the subsonic caliber.  The 950BS is a 1911 style gun, and is no longer made, making one in this condition a rare and valuable find.

If you're thinking about a 300 Blackout upper, consider this upper as well. 300 Blk was designed to mimic the performance of the 7.62x39 round. Although the 300 uses the same bolt, mags, and brass diameter as 223, its expensive as SHIT. Reloading is a good option, however cutting each piece of brass is a pain and requires a whole new set of dies, powder, bullets which adds up. At 5 bucks a box of 20 for 7.62x39, and out of an AR platform, this round performs very well, much better than an average AK platform. Plus there is seldom a shortage of ammo, even during the last scare, walleyworld always had it in stock."

It was sold to an LE dealer near here- Keisler's/Orion Arms back in the beginning of the year. From there it was sold to a dealer in South Carolina, who has since gone out of business and turned in his FFL so I hit a dead end tracking it. I had this same gun in my hand when I received my career-ending injury, so you can imagine the sentimental value it has for me.
