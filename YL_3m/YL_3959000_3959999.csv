This light rifle has a 20” barrel and a tube feed – my wife likes it, she is small and says fits her very well. The scope is a 4-power Bushnell (missing the rubber ring on the rear of the scope – does not affect view). There are a couple of tiny dings – see photos – nothing big or distracting. Being light-weight and a classic design by Browning this rifle will make a great “first rifle” or an heirloom you can proudly pass along.  It is an accurate rifle…It likes Federal ammo.

Very good shooter, the bore is dark but still has sharp rifling and is as accurate as I can be. I do still have the box for this rifle I believe. Also has the sling, 3 ammo pouches, and tool kit.

Next up is a 1946 Izzy M44. This rifle is beautiful. All numbers match and are easily visible. Bore is nice and shiny with sharp rifling. This thing shoots true though I will say the bolt is just a touch sticky.

I also have 872 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo to go with the guns. 440 in a sealed spam can, 340 in 20 rd paper packages (from a previously open spam can), 34 rds of wolf, and 58 rds of loose surplus.

There are some minor scratches here and there, but it's in great working condition.  I had it on my rifle for about 3 weeks.

Fits all style barrels from bull to sporter or even the stock barrel.

I have searched and searched for one of these for sale and simply can't find one.  From what I know, there were only 1200 of these rifles made.  I'm setting this price based on the fact that there are very few available...I will consider all offers.  Worst I can say is 'No, thanks.'

Upon test firing this rifle discovered this rifle has a headspacing issue. It sticks out of battery about a 1/4in when you go to chamber a round. This would be an easy fix for a gunsmith, or someone who is willing to take this rifle to a gunsmith and pay the $100 have it adjusted. I PCS to Alaska in 2 weeks so I haven't the time to drop it with a gunsmith but I have dropped the price to account for the cost of the adjustment. 
I am just not going to screw anybody over the way the previous owner did me. I am simply not that asshole. It is still a really rare rifle now a days and would be worth the while of someone with the time to get it repaired.

If you are tried of lightweight junk and want the feel of quality this may be your .22LR. The front site has been professionally filed to shoot point of aim and the top edge of the front sight was re-reblued after filing. Anyone who shoots revolvers with a fixed front blade is familiar with them needing a light filing for adjustment as it is very common. This firearm looks and functions like new and the blued version which is offered on this auction is very difficult to find if at all.

Springfield Armory Socom 16. Only has 200 rounds through it. Comes with one 10rd mag. I am the original owner. I have the box and paperwork. Sweet shooter. 

I have extra mags, ammo, and tools I can ad for an additional charge. Was trying to trade for older colts, smiths, m1s, brownings, and others but I am tired of lowball jacked up offers. If you have any of these and want ""actual"" value for your gun feel free to offer. But as of right now I'd rather negotiate a cash price.
