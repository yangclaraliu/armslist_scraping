Since 1959 the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on should they have to punch out over a remote area. Through the years the AR-7′s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

Specifics to this rifle: I have one extra 8rd magazine that is stored in the mag well when broken down. The other two mags stay in the buttstock.

Notable extras are a Lula loader, some iron sights (a set of 45 degree offset sights) a Monstrum scope (combination green/red plus laser, intended to mount on the CMMG upper, but never did, it is NIB as well) and a Syrac Ordnance gas block (bought to tune a suppressor which I never got, this is also new and has never been mounted)

This rifle is chambered in BOTH 5.56mm NATO and .223 Rem. This means you can shoot surplus ammo! Rate of twist is 1:9 which means bullets up to 69 grain bullets for long range accuracy. This rifle also accepts AR style magazines, so you can keep on shooting. This gun is a tack driver because of it's floating barrel, ""lightning"" trigger (adjustable), and heavy, fluted barrel.

Included are: Factory 10rd mag, 10rd P-Mag, 5rd metal mag. Also included is a harris benchrest bi-pod. Fewer than 50rds down the pipe. Also I'll throw in a hoppe's bore-snake.

It was shipped from the Colt factory on April 30, 1895 and went to Houston, Texas.  The gun was purchased from the estate of Theodore L. Roberge who was a 35 year veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard where he served in WWII, Korea and Vietnam.  Dorothy Roberge, his widow said that the gun was originally purchased by his father or grandfather and had been in the family since new.  This fine old gun is about 60% in 45 Colt caliber. It sports a 5 1/2 inch barrel and has rubber grips.  This is an early ""smokeless powder"" model with a vertical screw holding the cylinder pin rather than the later horizontal latch system.  I firmly believe that this is one of the nicest ""old"" Colts I have seen and think it would make a fine addition to the most discriminating Colt collection."

I sent the laptop in for warranty a few weeks ago because the DC plug in jack was losing it's connection and I didn't know how to swap them. So they installed a new DC plug in jack for me, as well as a new battery, mousepad, and gave me a new charger. They also gave it a factory cleaning on the inside, and updated the BIOS. So this laptop is in very good shape, I tested it for awhile to make sure everything was good to go as well. The only thing wrong with the laptop is that it has scratches on the back of the shell.

The wood stock is in excellent condition with the diamond pattern checkering undamaged, though smooth in areas of normal handling. For example the fore end pattern is smoother towards the trigger than the muzzle as you normally grip your hand around the stock, closer to the trigger area, hence the smoother texture of the diamond pattern checkering.  Not bad for almost 50 years old.

• Maintains match grade accuracy

As far as reloading is concerned, the poly coat is more ""slick"" than copper, which in turn makes the bullet faster. So when hand loading it is recommended to use cast bullet recipes or 1 to 2 grains lower from a FMJ load and work your way up and down from there."

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.



The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Examples:

There is NO general loan exemption for family members or friends, even in the presence of the owner!
You couldn’t loan your sister-in-law a firearm for self protection!
You couldn’t loan your adult sons shotguns to go hunting!
A person could “gift” a firearm to a family member but could NOT loan or sell it to her!
A police officer who loans a personal firearm to a fellow officer would face prosecution under I-594!
Concealed Pistol License holders, who are subjected to fingerprint-based checks, are not exempt!

Whether you're buying a reliable gun to put thousands of rounds downrange, or to sit on until the next ""scare,"" this is definitely a safe buy. 

It is equipped with a 20.5"" chrome lined barrel.
The firearm is semi-automatic, and has beautiful finished wood buttstock and forearm. Everything on the rifle is in 100% perfect condition--it isnt like the unfinished models that are cracked and need replacing. I wouldnt change a thing on it, but for those who want to add an optic or mount for a scope, there is a side rail that came mounted on the gun.

This gun comes with one 5rd mag, a cleaning rod/handle, and a very detailed manual. 

Stop looking and buy the thing already ;)

Cycles silky smooth! Buttstock and Forend are GORGEOUS, no scratches or dents in them, has a Factory Remington Extended Recoil pad, only downside is, the receiver has been scrubbed of rust, I bought it like this, was gonna re-do the receiver and use it, but decided to go another route. Other than the receiver, the shotgun is gorgeous! Bore is mirror, this shoots 2 3/4"" ONLY, this was manufactured BEFORE the Magnum 870's! Selling for what I paid for it. You could part it out and make more than what I'm selling it for, the stock and forend is worth half of what I'm asking. Would make a good candidate for a tactical conversion!

This Compressor runs great just like it did the day I bought it at Lowe's. There is absolutely no issues with this compressor. The impact wrench that comes in the tool kit is seized up and does not work. All of the other tools in the tool kit work great and have always been taken care of. The only reason I am selling this is because I am getting out of the military soon and cannot take it with me to college. You can come by my house to test it out before purchase if you would like to. Please contact me via call or text @    REDACTED for fastest response. My price is firm and I will accept no trades at all. Thanks and my name is David."

They were made for the US Boarder Patrol and only 2000 were ever made of this model. Only a few other models had such a limited release. 

This handgun still sits new in its case and has never been fired, holstered, or taken to the range. It includes both factory 10 round (high capacity ban wasn't lifted until 2004) aluminum base magazines. The Brigadier heavy slide dovetailed with Trilux sights. Two sets of factory grips came with this model, the rubber and hard plastic. Shortened 4.7"" chrome lined .40s&w barrel. Factory hard cases and original/Trilux manual. 

There is not wear the rails, hammer, feed ramp. No holster wear, no wear in the mag well, no barrel to slide contact wear that occurs as a round is fired in a 90 series... All because the handgun is truly new and unused. This is a collectors dream come true.

While this 96 Brigadier has never been fired I do own other 96 Brigadier pistols. And it is my honest opinion that the 96 Brigadier handles better than no other 40s&w pistol. The heavy weight Brigadier slide was specially designed for the .40s&w round.  

I collect Berettas and I'm in no rush to part with this piece, but would like to start acquiring firearms I can use and pass this on to another collector/Vets/Beretta enthusiast. Serious, educated offers only please, no low ballers, local exchanges only it at all possible.

I have a very nice Marlin lever action 30/30 rifle model 336CS.

A Sears Roebuck and Co. model 45 lever action also chambered in 30/30.
This gun is old and looks the part.  The stock is in remarkable condition for it's age.
The bluing on the metal is very worn and is mostly exposed metal.  While it does have an old patina to it, it shoots very well (really).  If you like an old looking rifle that is very functional, this is it.  I am not sure who made these for Sears, but this rifle is very similar to the more modern Marlin.

4 (four) WWII Spanish Model B pistols.

I purchased them from AIM Surplus back when they still had them. The guns fire, but sometimes the empty shell fails to extract all of the way on some of them. The guns have the wood grips and not the black plastic ""synthetic"" grips.  

Link to the AIM ad
http://www.aimsurplus.com/product.aspx?item=F3StarB


This is how AIM described them, ""WWII Star Model B 9mm Luger Pistols. Manufactured in Spain between 1943-44 as part of a 15,000 piece contract for Bulgaria. These pistols feature original Wartime Factory Markings. They were refinished by the Russians after WWII as was common practice with firearms they obtained during & after the War. They will have checkered wood or black synthetic grips. Some markings may be lighter due to the refinishing. Almost identical design to the 1911. Includes 1-8rd magazine.""
