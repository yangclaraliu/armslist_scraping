Prefer cash for best price on my gun. I can throw in some hollow points for the right deal.

My email and text number are below as this sights emailing doesnt work often.

I got this gun in a multi gun trade from original owner, has Sig Night Sights, Holster, lock, one extended mag, original carry box and papers.  I have this same model in 9mm and in .380 and dont need another right now.  They are awesome carry guns for men or women and fit great in small and medium hands, but with ext mag, still work for most large handed individuals.  My mom who is a senior and has arthritic hands actually carries same model too as the trigger pull is minimal and it has a safety thats easy to disengage.

Was told it was unfired but carried.  It is in great condition and I think they probably fired a few rounds through it to test it out but not completely sure.  I have not fired it but it functions perfectly otherwise.

Send all reasonable cash offers.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or guns,  ammo or extras for the right AR in .308, I cant add cash.

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, CDNN, classic firearms or J&G when they are in stock, dont need anything full retail, craze inflated or BPS or Gander pricing.

I would prefer to buy things with my cash so I have the initial warranty but if its the right deal, I am willing to work on my guns price too, but since I prefer cash deal, its really going to have to be a trade I really want thats in great shape or new.

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and  condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'm really looking for a Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, or similar price ranges $1000-$2000.....Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built.  Must be new or like new.  I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's prefer pistol plus cash, possibly rifle if even trade.  I would consider Zastava m92 PAP  (I know they are out of stock in some places, but they pop up weekly under $500 and I can wait)  others i'd consider if not canted  CAI Centurion 39 ,  Yugo M70AB,  Yugo Zastava NPAP,  CAI Centurion 39 Tactical AK, Draco or Mini Draco ....... No wasrs, not interested in saigas even though I know they can be great and arsenals are out of my price range.

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus..........  Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  Glock 30s, possibly Gen 4 21......no stippling please   (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600)  Also might consider LCR if under $400 plus cash, prefer .357 but open to .38

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or  hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale  required. 

I will try to post my other guns I have for sale/trade today or tomorrow.

Up front, as shown in the pic, this is no longer in original condition. The previous owner had the bolt turned, reshaped the stock some and added a Limb Saver recoil pad. I have shot it to zero, then put it away. This was going to be a project but I never got around to it and it's just taking up space. The original parkerized type finish is still good with no rust or pitting. Comes as shown with the bayonet, a bandolier and 155 rds (55 rds on stripper clips) of M80 ball. Also has cleaning kit and front sight tool in tube under the barrel.

Update: You can see this rifle at Guns-N-More in Osage Beach."

1911 Carry .45 Tacops with Threaded Barrel Sig Night Sights SAO Nitron

My email and text number are below as this sights emailing doesnt work often.

I got this gun in a multi gun trade from original owner, has Sig Night Sights, lock, 4 mags, original carry box and papers.  The trigger pull is Light and Crisp and it has a safety thats easy to disengage.

It is in great condition with some wear on barrel at extraction area and minor wear at the business end and very minor wear on grip.  I can send additional pics as needed.

Send all reasonable cash offers.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or guns,  ammo or extras for the right AR in .308

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, CDNN, classic firearms or J&G when they are in stock, dont need anything full retail, craze inflated or BPS or Gander pricing.

I would prefer to buy things with my cash so I have the initial warranty but if its the right deal, I am willing to work on my guns price too, but since I prefer cash deal, its really going to have to be a trade I really want thats in great shape or new.

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and  condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'm really looking for a Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, LMT, PWS, Ruger, Windham, Core, etc or similar price ranges $1000-$2000.....Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built.  Must be new or like new.  I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's prefer pistol..... plus cash, possibly rifle plus cash.  I would consider Zastava m92 PAP  (I know they are out of stock in some places, but they pop up weekly and I can wait)  others i'd consider if not canted  CAI Centurion 39 ,  Yugo M70AB,  Yugo Zastava NPAP,  CAI Centurion 39 Tactical AK, Draco or Mini Draco ....... No wasrs, not interested in saigas even though I know they can be great and arsenals are out of my price range.

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus..........  Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  Glock 30s, possibly Gen 4 21......no stippling please   (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600)  Also might consider LCR if under $400 plus cash, prefer .357 but open to .38  I would trade even up for 2 Glocks also in different sizes or calibers even if one has more wear or one of Glocks listed above and another like new or new gun.  Holsters and self defense ammo are not really helpful for me.

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or  hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale  required. 

I will try to post my other guns I have for sale/trade today or tomorrow.  Sig Extreme P938 $625, Spikes Ar 5.56 $950, possibly Glock 27 with lots of extras $600, Spikes .300 aac in FDE $1350, possibly Mossy Tactical 12ga with lots of extras $500  all prices are asking prices assuming every one will negotiate, so I can be fair if others are with me.

I agree with one thing this person said- anybody can ask whatever they want for their stuff. But why attack somebody repeatedly just for asking about it? If you are that incensed at a courteous inquiry, then maybe you should consider putting the gun up for sale on consignment in a shop somewhere.

1911 Carry .45 Tacops with Threaded Barrel Sig Night Sights SAO Nitron

My email and text number are below as this sights emailing doesnt work often.

I got this gun in a multi gun trade from original owner, has Sig Night Sights, lock, 4 mags, original carry box and papers.  The trigger pull is Light and Crisp and it has a safety thats easy to disengage.

It is in great condition with some wear on barrel at extraction area and minor wear at the business end and very minor wear on grip.  I can send additional pics as needed.

Send all reasonable cash offers.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or guns,  ammo or extras for the right AR in .308

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, CDNN, classic firearms or J&G when they are in stock, dont need anything full retail, craze inflated or BPS or Gander pricing.

I would prefer to buy things with my cash so I have the initial warranty but if its the right deal, I am willing to work on my guns price too, but since I prefer cash deal, its really going to have to be a trade I really want thats in great shape or new.

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and  condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'm really looking for a Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, LMT, PWS, Ruger, Windham, Core, etc or similar price ranges $1000-$2000.....Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built.  Must be new or like new.  I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's prefer pistol..... plus cash, possibly rifle plus cash.  I would consider Zastava m92 PAP  (I know they are out of stock in some places, but they pop up weekly and I can wait)  others i'd consider if not canted  CAI Centurion 39 ,  Yugo M70AB,  Yugo Zastava NPAP,  CAI Centurion 39 Tactical AK, Draco or Mini Draco ....... No wasrs, not interested in saigas even though I know they can be great and arsenals are out of my price range.

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus..........  Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  Glock 30s, possibly Gen 4 21......no stippling please   (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600)  Also might consider LCR if under $400 plus cash, prefer .357 but open to .38  I would trade even up for 2 Glocks also in different sizes or calibers even if one has more wear or one of Glocks listed above and another like new or new gun.  Holsters and self defense ammo are not really helpful for me.

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or  hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale  required. 

I will try to post my other guns I have for sale/trade today or tomorrow.  Sig Extreme P938 $625, Spikes Ar 5.56 $950, possibly Glock 27 with lots of extras $600, Spikes .300 aac in FDE $1350, possibly Mossy Tactical 12ga with lots of extras $500  all prices are asking prices assuming every one will negotiate, so I can be fair if others are with me.

My email and text number are below as this sights emailing doesnt work often.

Only fired less than 100 rds through her to sight in.  Still in great condition and very accurate.  Only selling as it's duplicate and to fund other toys as listed below

I can send additional pics as needed.

Send all reasonable cash offers.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or guns,  ammo or extras for the right AR in .308

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, CDNN, classic firearms or J&G when they are in stock, dont need anything full retail, craze inflated or BPS or Gander pricing.

I would prefer to buy things with my cash so I have the initial warranty but if its the right deal, I am willing to work on my guns price too, but since I prefer cash deal, its really going to have to be a trade I really want thats in great shape or new.

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and  condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'm really looking for a Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, LMT, PWS, Ruger, Windham, Core, etc or similar price ranges $1000-$2000.....Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built.  Must be new or like new.  I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's prefer pistol..... plus cash, possibly rifle plus cash.  I would consider Zastava m92 PAP  (I know they are out of stock in some places, but they pop up weekly and I can wait)  others i'd consider if not canted  CAI Centurion 39 ,  Yugo M70AB,  Yugo Zastava NPAP,  CAI Centurion 39 Tactical AK, Draco or Mini Draco ....... No wasrs, not interested in saigas even though I know they can be great and arsenals are out of my price range.

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus..........  Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  Glock 30s, possibly Gen 4 21......no stippling please   (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600)  Also might consider LCR if under $400 plus cash, prefer .357 but open to .38  I would trade even up for 2 Glocks also in different sizes or calibers even if one has more wear or one of Glocks listed above and another like new or new gun.  Holsters and self defense ammo are not really helpful for me.

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or  hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale  required. 

I will try to post my other guns I have for sale/trade today or tomorrow.  Sig Tacops 1911 Threaded $1025, Sig Extreme P938 $625, possibly Glock 27 with lots of extras $600, Spikes .300 aac in FDE $1350, possibly Mossy Tactical 12ga with lots of extras $500  all prices are asking prices assuming every one will negotiate, so I can be fair if others are with me.

My email and text number are below as this sights emailing doesnt work often.

Only fired less than 100 rds through her to sight in.  Still in great condition and very accurate.  Only selling as it's duplicate and to fund other toys as listed below

I can send additional pics as needed.

Send all reasonable cash offers.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or guns,  ammo or extras for the right AR in .308

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, CDNN, classic firearms or J&G when they are in stock, dont need anything full retail, craze inflated or BPS or Gander pricing.

I would prefer to buy things with my cash so I have the initial warranty but if its the right deal, I am willing to work on my guns price too, but since I prefer cash deal, its really going to have to be a trade I really want thats in great shape or new.

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and  condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'm really looking for a Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, LMT, PWS, Ruger, Windham, Core, etc or similar price ranges $1000-$2000.....Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built.  Must be new or like new.  I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's prefer pistol..... plus cash, possibly rifle plus cash.  I would consider Zastava m92 PAP  (I know they are out of stock in some places, but they pop up weekly and I can wait)  others i'd consider if not canted  CAI Centurion 39 ,  Yugo M70AB,  Yugo Zastava NPAP,  CAI Centurion 39 Tactical AK, Draco or Mini Draco ....... No wasrs, not interested in saigas even though I know they can be great and arsenals are out of my price range.

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus..........  Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  Glock 30s, possibly Gen 4 21......no stippling please   (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600)  Also might consider LCR if under $400 plus cash, prefer .357 but open to .38  I would trade even up for 2 Glocks also in different sizes or calibers even if one has more wear or one of Glocks listed above and another like new or new gun.  Holsters and self defense ammo are not really helpful for me.   Open to 1911's or p226 or most quality pistols

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or  hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale  required. 

I will try to post my other guns I have for sale/trade today or tomorrow.  Sig Tacops 1911 Threaded $1025, Sig Extreme P938 $625, possibly Glock 27 with lots of extras $600, Spikes .300 aac in FDE $1350, possibly Mossy Tactical 12ga with lots of extras $500  all prices are asking prices assuming every one will negotiate, so I can be fair if others are with me.

Prefer cash for best price on my gun. I can throw in some hollow points for the right deal.

My email and text number are below as this sights emailing doesnt work often.

I got this gun in a multi gun trade from original owner, has Sig Night Sights, Holster, lock, one extended mag, original carry box and papers.  I have this same model in 9mm and in .380 and dont need another right now.  They are awesome carry guns for men or women and fit great in small and medium hands, but with ext mag, still work for most large handed individuals.  My mom who is a senior and has arthritic hands actually carries same model too as the trigger pull is minimal and it has a safety thats easy to disengage.

Was told it was unfired but carried.  It is in great condition and I think they probably fired a few rounds through it to test it out but not completely sure.  I have not fired it but it functions perfectly otherwise.

Send all reasonable cash offers.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or guns,  ammo or extras for the right AR in .308, I cant add cash.

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, CDNN, classic firearms or J&G when they are in stock, dont need anything full retail, craze inflated or BPS or Gander pricing.

I would prefer to buy things with my cash so I have the initial warranty but if its the right deal, I am willing to work on my guns price too, but since I prefer cash deal, its really going to have to be a trade I really want thats in great shape or new.

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and  condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'm really looking for a Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, or similar price ranges $1000-$2000.....Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built.  Must be new or like new.  I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's prefer pistol plus cash, possibly rifle if even trade.  I would consider Zastava m92 PAP  (I know they are out of stock in some places, but they pop up weekly under $500 and I can wait)  others i'd consider if not canted  CAI Centurion 39 ,  Yugo M70AB,  Yugo Zastava NPAP,  CAI Centurion 39 Tactical AK, Draco or Mini Draco ....... No wasrs, not interested in saigas even though I know they can be great and arsenals are out of my price range.

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus..........  Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  Glock 30s, possibly Gen 4 21......no stippling please   (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600)  Also might consider LCR if under $400 plus cash, prefer .357 but open to .38

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or  hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale  required. 

I will try to post my other guns I have for sale/trade today or tomorrow.  Sig Tacops 1911 threaded barrel $1025, Spikes Ar 5.56 $950, possibly Glock 27 with lots of extras $600, Spikes .300 aac in FDE $1350, possibly Mossy Tactical 12ga with lots of extras $500  all prices are asking prices assuming every one will negotiate, so I can be fair if others are with me.

Here is some info from the importer:

The Izhmash Saiga autoloading shotgun incorporates the Kalashnikov design, providing reliability and simplicity of operation. Outstanding accuracy is achieved by the smooth bore, Lancaster style elliptical barrel, which imparts a spin on projectiles, increasing accuracy and exterior threading to accept chokes. The chrome lined barrel, chamber and gas system resist corrosion, making cleaning easier and extending the life of the shotgun. A lightweight, impact resistant polymer sporter stock and forend are checkered for comfortable control and include 3/4” sling mounts. An oversized trigger guard allows use with gloved hands. Models are available with side optic mounting rails, bead front sight, V notch rear sight or leaf rear sight. Included is a detachable five round magazine (two round hunting magazines are also available)."

Redfield Revenge 2-7x34mm 4-Plex Rifle Scope 115204 is an ideal rifle scope for close to medium range hunting in low light situations. The advanced, fully multi-coated lens systemimage of these Redfield rifle scopes results in a high light transmission rate that gives you high contrast, high clarity images even when the sun is just rising or setting. The highly adaptable accuracy of these riflescopes is achieved with the use of pop-up windage and elevation turrets, both of which can be easily reset to zero. Like many other scopes in the Redfield Revenge series, the Redfield Revenge 2-7x 4Plex Reticle Riflescope features fast focus eyepieces that both improve your target acquisition speed and give you a plentiful field of view so you can see your entire surroundings. Redfield has equipped this scope with the simple but effective 4-Plex reticle, which sports thick crosshairs with a slightly thinner center to increase target visibility. As with all Redfield Revenge rifle scopes, the 2-7x34mm variety is waterproof, shock-proof, and nitrogen filled for state of the art fogproofing. For all your short to medium range hunting needs, you can attain pinpoint accuracy in almost any conditions with the Red Field Revenge 2-7x34 Fast Focus Four Plex Scope."

TG Knox TN is Tennessee Guns, importer located in Tennessee.

This is NOT a kit rifle. This one must have come in before feds put the stop on importing complete PSL rifles from Romania. How do you check? EASY! A kit rifle would have a receiver that was made in US of A, such receiver would have information about company that made the receiver, their name, their location, their serial number (that usually different from the original, in this case Romanian, serial number). To my knowledge, TG imported things, it never made their own receivers so the rifle you are looking at has the Romanian receiver and matching serial numbers verify that. And there is the fall back in the Made in Romania statement to top it off. Kit rifle would not say made in Romania.

I had to leave on a disability retirement after being injured on duty and had to turn in my issued weapon. To add insult to injury, I missed the chance to buy back the G22 I had carried daily since 1998!
It was sold to an LE dealer near here- Keisler's/Orion Arms back in the beginning of the year. From there it was sold to a dealer in South Carolina, who has since gone out of business and turned in his FFL so I hit a dead end tracking it. I had this same gun in my hand when I received my career-ending injury, so you can imagine the sentimental value it has for me.

The problem, however, is that my wife shot my PK and won't give it back! So now I need to get one for her. 

The CW9 is a rugged, compact, 7+1 9mm that is easy to take down and clean. I have fired around 350 rounds through this handgun with zero issues. Even a box of steal ammo went through just fine. Groups at 20 feet are small (dependent on shooters skill of course) and the gun overall is easy to handle and fun to shoot. ONLY reason I'm trading/selling is that I don't have spare cash for another firearm at this time. If I come across some money to buy a PK, this gun will no longer be available! 

Will discuss transfer fee options with trades, I could possibly cover both parties. Buyer covers all fees in the event of sale"

Combining this advantage with less felt recoil and other popular 2011 features, 
the STI Tactical is a superior pistol for all close quarters applications. Introduced in 2012, the STI Tactical 4.0 fulfills an important part of the ‘STI Tactical Family’ line of pistols.Building on the popularity of the 5.0 version, the STI Tactical 4.0 delivers the same high capacity, accuracy, and dependability in a more compact package. The STI Tactical 4.0 is well suited for multiple applications, ranging from police and SWAT teams requiring a firearm with a light rail and high capacity, to the individual demanding a high performance pistol with special features for personal protection. The tactical rail milled into the dust cover of the frame accepts all industry standard light mounts. The STI Tactical 4.0 comes with one 140mm magazine, I purchased a 126mm magazine for carry. The front of the trigger guard has been taken down a bit to allow the DG-switch to sit flush with the grip. I can have a FFL ship to your FFL or I can ship directly to your FFL whichever you prefer. I also have more photos.

This leaves me with 1100 rounds of ammunition, actually 1106 because I left six rounds of ZQI in a magazine last range trip. Here is a rundown of what I have for sale:

Exactly 1000 rounds of Australian AFF90/F4-83 marked ammunition. I bought this ammo new in a crate at Knob Creek in 2003, and it was in the bubble packaging. I put it in .50 ammo cans not long after, and it's been there ever since. This is their 144gr. FMJ load, and is stupid-accurate for military ball ammo. 

100 rounds of Portuguese 7.62x51 currently in M1A mags, but I will put this on stripper clips and in two old Australian bandoleers.

6 rounds of ZQI .308 from Walmart. 

$650 cash for a middle Tennessee sale. I am not going to ship this ammo, so please don't ask. If you're from out of state; come to Music City for a long weekend, then take it with you. 

For trades, I'd like 1000rds of M855 AND 1000rds of 9mm FMJ, preferably 147gr., but 124gr. would work, too."

1983–1984 Browning B-80 Ducks Unlimited 
A product of collaboration between Browning and Beretta, the B-80 is a gas-operated autoloader manufactured from 1981 to 1988. A well-made and popular gun very similar to the Beretta A303, the B-80 was discontinued only because the Browning-Beretta partnership ended. This dinner gun has a 2 3/4-inch chamber, a 30-inch full-choke barrel, high-grade walnut, and a DU grip cap. The receiver is decorated by famous Browning engraver Jose Baerten and features a bronze medallion with a white-fronted goose by David Maass. ""The Plains"" designation marks this gun as the third of four in DU's ""Flyway"" series."
