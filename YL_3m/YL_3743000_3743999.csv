I've owned the gun for 3 years and it's been hunted with a few time.  The scope mounted on it is a 3-9 by 40 Nikon Buckmaster scope with Warne rings.  The scope has blizzard caps installed.  Included are 9 full boxes of slugs shown in the picture.  I purchase some different one to try with it that I never ended up shooting.  I settled on the remington accutip 2 3/4 slugs and have shot them to 200 yards with good accuracy.  The gun is ready to hunt with meaning its sighted in.  I take real good care of my guns and it's always been cleaned after shooting and hunting.  It's all ready for deer season.  Has accutrigger adjusted as light as it'll go and about 50 rounds through it.  I reload rifle ammo so I decided to buy a 444 marlin to hunt with this year so I'm thinking about selling this.  I have over $900 invested in this and will sell for $675 the way it sits.  I may be interested in trades.  Just ask and the worse that I can say is no.  Would really like a nice Beretta or Benelli semi auto shot gun.  I'm firm on the price and don't need to sell it.

These are solid steel CZ75 clones if you aren't familiar with them, uses CZ pattern mags and can be carried cocked and locked or hammer down.

I'd be interested in trading it for a different mid sized .40 or one of the police trade in Glock 22's that have flooded the market lately.

233,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3743233,For Sale:  DPMS A3 Package,"St. Tammany Parish, New Orleans, Louisiana",$ 900,"Listed On: Sunday, December 7, 2014",Rifles,DPMS                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I'm here today to put up for sale my DPMS A3 Classic. It's a 20"" 1:9 twist HBAR chambered for 5.56/.223 and A2 stock.

The rifle itself has had roughly 300 rounds through it that consisted of nothing but factory new Federal 55gr M193 or 62gr M855. Cleaned after each range trip, it is functionally flawless. Zero issues with it and pleasantly accurate. I've taken it to Honey Island range several times for the 100 yard range and have hit the gong consistently with this rifle. If you've been hesitant about a DPMS, let this ad change your mind. I was truly amazed with this rifle.

So why am I getting rid of it? Simple, I just want to try something different. I've had my fun with it and with the holidays right around the corner no doubt someone would be very happy to receive this on Christmas Morning! Or on one of the days of Hanukkah, or whatever you celebrate, even Festivus!

It does have some obvious signs of wear and use, which you can view in the pictures. Though they are nothing major, they can be easily fixed with a bluing pen and some elbow grease. Then again this rifle is meant to be shot and handled, not left in the safe for the occasional looksie. The flattop upper receiver allows the rifle to be optics ready or whatever sight fancies your taste.

Well by now you're probably asking what makes this a package? This is where it gets fun!

Purchase of this rifle includes the following (all which can be seen in photos below):
- Rifle bag
- 3 point sling
- Not one, not two, not three but FOUR magazines! Three 30 round standard mags and... wait for it... a 20 round COLT magazine!
- Knight's Armament M5 RAS, that's right the same rail system used by the United States Marine Corps on their M16A4s! It's a two piece drop in and comes with one rail cover!
- And just when you think that was it, I'm throwing in a BSA mildot scope ready for a scope mount of your choice to go on the rifle!

All totaled the value of this package exceeds $1,000 for everything included. I'm starting the offer at $900. Make this the ultimate gift for that love one of yours and make it a memorable holiday season with such an epic deal with great items!

I'm currently not entertaining any trades of any kind so please don't bother. My price is somewhat firm. I can negotiate some but please no low ball offers. I know what this is worth and it's not just the gun you're buying. I am not splitting anything up or selling the rifle separately unless you're willing to pay $700 for the rifle alone with one mag. Other than that the package stands as is.

Feel free to send me a message for info, pics, or to make an offer. Low balls and trade offers will not be entertained.

And now for the pictures!"

Description from web: 

Lightweight and requiring no maintenance, the polymer frame features an integral accessory rail for mounting SIG laser or SIG tactical light systems. The frame houses fewer moving parts than most semi-autos, and those parts fit together precisely, giving you that characteristically smooth, dependable action that has become a SIG trademark. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and treated with SIG's unique Nitron™ finish for exceptional durability and corrosion resistance. All controls and the trigger are Ilaflon®-coated for added lubricity, excellent wear and corrosion resistance greater than stainless steel. Chances are the sig pro is the most corrosion resistant pistol available.

I am selling a beautiful 1942 Sk.Y Finnish M39 Mosin Nagant. The Finnish M39's have a reputation for being some of the nicest, most accurate Mosins, with a fascinating history.  This is one of 10,000 Sk.Y rifles issued to the Finnish Home Guard to fight the Russians.  The Finns captured these rifles from Russians, and after rebarreling, restocking and improving the sights, used them against their original owners.  The tiger stripe Beech stock on this rifle is beautiful, and all of the metal has a nice, shiny grey patina.  Stock is cleaned, no cosmoline, and treated with Tom's 1/3 mix.  The bore is good, and there is a small, discrete import mark on the bottom of the barrel just behind the front sight.  The stock appears to have been sanded at some point in its life, as the SAKO cartouche on the stock is not intact and barely visible. This SAKO example was built on an 1898 Tula receiver, as as such, does not need to go through an FFL.

Serious buyers only. No tire kickers and no dealers. Please don't contact me with trades, offers, or requests to hold the rifle.  I will not respond.  The first email that says ""I'll take the M39"" gets it.  I am happy to entertain serious questions from serious buyers. Prefer FTF in Colorado Springs, but will ship to FFL if FFL receives from individuals.  Buyer pays all transfer fees (if FFL is involved) and shipping ($25), if applicable.  I will remove the listing as soon as it sells, so if the listing is still here, the rifle is still available."

MODEL # 30-000598
The CBF keeps the blade edge at hair-splitting sharpness for far longer than the average knife. The CFB, like all of our military products, is built in Portland, Oregon.

MULTI-FACETED PERFORMANCE
Distinct in its tanto shape, the CFB tanto-style 4.6-inch blade will brilliantly execute in capable hands. The partially serrated knife can be tasked to hack through a tree branch, feather a stick, saw paracord, or provide a first line of defense in combat. Cut, pry, scrape, or slice with this knife while relying on its well-balanced feel. The CFB knife is effortlessly fluid when applied properly by its operator.

SUBSTANTIAL YET LIGHTWEIGHT
With a grippy rubberized handle and substantial yet lightweight 4.9 ounces of heft, the CFB pulls no punches. Generous jimping along the top edge of the exposed steel of the tang as it curves into the hilt along with similar jimping on the underside of the handle provides an excellent tactile surface for the operators  thumb and pinky to stabilize against while using the knife. Additionally, rubberized surfaces on both sides of the handle allow for enhanced grip. The slender rubber grips adhered to the handle of the no-glint black oxide blade   tang maintain the slim overall profile of the knife. The CFB   rounded pommel acts as an additional firm anchor in the user   palm.

SECURE FOR THE LONG HAUL
Encased in a molded plastic friction lock sheath, with removable MOLLE compatible webbing, the CFB can go even lower-profile when tethered to the operator   kit or person. Paracord attached to the base of the nylon sheath provides for optional leg tie-down.

Has updated factory installed hammer (early CZ 912's had an issue with the hammer cracking).  Made by the well known Huglu company in Turkey.  I'm firm on the price, but I think the price is fair.

""The CZ 912 is built with a high gloss finish and sleek look with attractive lines both on the alloy receiver and on the walnut stock.  The modern-style recoil pad provides for not only a significant reduction in perceived recoil, but is snag-free as well. A long recoil spring is located in the butt of the stock, simplifying assembly and allowing it to cycle a wide variety of loads across the power spectrum in both 2 ¾” and 3”.

In addition, the rearward spring design makes required cleanings less frequent and easier when they are needed. Removal of the installed magazine plug is simple, requiring only the magazine cap to be unscrewed. Without the plug it gives the upland hunter a 4+1 capacity. With superb balance and an average weight of 7.4 lbs, the 912 is well-suited to the pursuit of both birds and clays."""

This is a Bulgarian AK-47 that is milled and has a right-siding folding stock. I have shot roughly 200 rounds down the barrel and is most definitely the nicest AK-47 I have ever held or shot. The rifle comes with Bulgarian bakelite handguards, the polymer heatshield handguards, Bulgarian AK sling, ten 30 round magazines (Yugo and various others), roughly 1,000 rounds of Tula 7.62x39, a soft case, and a case for the ammo. This AK-47 brand new is about $1,500 and the ammo and mags are estimated at a few hundred dollars. Note in the pictures that the Glock is NOT for sale. 

If you do some research on this amazing rifle you will find that it is one of the best made AK's on the market today. Below are some more details from the K-VAR site.

This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its unique right-side folding tubular buttstock to its 24x1.5mm muzzle threads with muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7SF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7SF rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7SF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

This is a legit 9mm MP5 not that 22lr look alike. Made by Turner Fabrications who has been making MP5's for a long damn time, its the closest you will get to an Genuine HK MP5 without taking out a second Mortgage! Note, HK does not make MP5's anymore, they havent for awhile, finding one for sale is near impossible, and if you do it is going to cost a but load.

So here it is:
-All parts German HK, minus the US made Receiver(LSC Manf.)!!!!!

-Fluted Salt Nitrate barrel

-Threaded 1/2x28 barrel and 3-Lug for both types of suppressors. 

-NAVY SEF trigger group/housing (this MP5 shoots Semi-Auto ONLY tho)

-Has a ""Action 3"" bolt group with F style bolt carrier, this means it will fire F/A with a NFA Registered F/A Trigger pack. These bolt groups are banned from further importation and cost about $1,000, check hkparts.net(SOLD OUT) to confirm for yourself. Couple this with a registered F/A Sear installed in a F/A pack and your ready to blast rounds. Obviously NFA Rules apply if you take this route, and it costs $$$.

-MFI Low Profile claw mount($130)

-3 Mags ($50 ea)

-Bushnell TRS Red Dot(~$100)

-Brand New Folding stock($140) in separate box, I was going to make this MP5 an SBR but spent money on a suppressor instead and just haven't done it yet. I probably will if I keep it, so get it while its a Non-NFA Weapon and SBR it yourself! 

-1,000+ rnds of factory 9mm, most are American Eagle, some Remington and Winchester too.

----Note, installing the Stock on this ""Pistol"" makes it a SBR(Short Barreled Rifle), which needs to be Registered with the NFA branch of the ATF. Do not install it without registering it first, you will be getting pounded by a big fat guy in prison if you do and get caught.


Serious offers only, do your research before making a Low Ball Offer, also have an offer ready when contacting me, please no emails like ""How much do you want for it"".

I am selling a BA date code (2010) HK P30 in 9mm.  I purchased this gun used, and have personally fired just under 1000 rounds of brass cased 115 gr ball ammo through this pistol.  I purchased this thinking it was a V2 LEM, as shown on the box.  However, I think the previous owner may have tried to convert this to the V1 Light LEM, with a spring change.  The gun is in very good condition, and the only issue is a weak/broken trigger return spring.  The trigger must be manually reset after every shot.  This occurred the last time I had it to the range, and I never got around to fixing it.  Prior to this issue, I don't recall ever having had a malfunction with the pistol.  For this reason, I am selling the gun at a great price.  

All original grip panels/inserts, fired case, tool, lock, and warranty card that came with the gun are included.

I am selling an MP5 clone that was built on an original HK MP5 parts kit by RDTS (www.rdts.com) in Arizona.  RDTS normally specializes in HK belt fed machine guns and full autos.  I purchased this pistol new from RDTS a few years ago, with the intent to SBR it and eventually for use as a host for a registered sear.  Since then, I have put approximately 500 uneventful rounds of brass cased 115 gr ball through the gun.  Apart from its quality construction and German HK parts, Ralph at RDTS welded a magwell from an original W. German MP5 to the gun.  This is about as close as you can get to a real HK MP5/HK94 without the high price and the worry of collector value.  

The pistol comes with 10 genuine HK 30 rd stick magazines, 1 curved ATI 30 rd magazine, a German A2 stock, an ATI A3 retractable stock, a nylon carry case, and an assortment of HK spare parts (push pins, extractors/extractor springs, firing pin/springs, roller retainers/pin).  Buyer will also receive a copy of my receipt from RDTS to verify authenticity.

Today I'm selling my Rock River LAR-15A4, which is a special ""First Responder"" model - only available to Government and LE officers. It has been shot approximately 150 times (5 magazines worth) and has been well taken care of. Unfortunately, it has spent a majority of it's life in it's carrying case (which comes with the rifle as well as the manuals) and I will be using the money for a new project of mine. 

This rifle was bought from an LE officer and will be sold with a legal bill of sale that both parties will sign. The rifle also comes with the original magazine that the rifle was shipped with. The rifle was bought from Rock River for $985 (not including taxes or shipping) and I am willing to part for a slight loss. 

I am not interested in trades unless it is something worth my while (multiple pistols/one high-end pistol, AR trades, etc). Cash is preferred. 

Pictures can and will be sent upon inquiry (they are on my phone, not my computer). Price is negotiable, but would highly prefer to trade for a SIG 556 Classic (or any model, aside from the Patrol model). I will also add ammunition and magazines into a trade or sale if needed."
