We use brand new match grade barrels from Shilen, Krieger, Bartlein, and others.  We can thread your bolt handle or even opt for a more ridgid one piece bolt.  There are more than a few upgrades that can be added to your build as well.  As far as stocks we use Bell & Carlson; HS precision; McMillan - basically to tell us and we build it!

We offer just the barreled action or a completed rifle custom built...  The complete rifles include a pillar bed/free floated barrel and are guaranteed to shoot 1/2 MOA.  There are many reports of 1/4 MOA with custom loads.  If you have interest in having a Rem 700 built for you we'd be happy to help...  Pricing starts at 800 using your existing action/bolt and will include a brand new match grade Shilen barrel installed on your blueprinted action/bolt.  If you need a ground up build we can offer blueprinted barreled actions for 1200 with a Shilen barrel or 1400 with a stainless barrel.  .338 Lapua barreled actions start at 1800 and include a PTG one piece bolt and muzzle brake.   I welcome all calibers and enjoy building the Ackley calibers and WSM just the same.  If I don't have the reamer I will order one.

We also have a .338 lapua that is in process now...  I'd be happy to send a few pics if interested.  A few other builds we have going a short magnum action that I'm considering a custom built .300 wsm and another short action leaning towards a Rem .260 or a 6.5 creedmoor.  If you have interest in a custom build I would like to hear about it.

The P229® was the first pistol to be manufactured in Exeter, New Hampshire.The P229 is one of the most popular SIG SAUER® pistols and carried by thousands of law enforcement professionals throughout the country. The compact size of the P229 makes it ideal for concealed carry. Not only is it non-railed like the traditional P229s, but it also has the classic P229 slide with the half-height rear cocking serrations. These are hard to come by NIB for under $900.

This gun comes NIB with the original ergo grip not installed. It currently sells on eBay alone for up to $75. I added the Sig panels with $13 stainless hex button head screws from TJ's Custom Gunworks. The older style panels fit my hand better. Sig ergo grip tool, Sig owners manual, and cable lock come with the sale. Also included are two new Sig branded factory 12 rnd. mags. I also have (hard to find) 3 more new factory 12 rnd. mags for $45 each if needed. This is a great configuration if you don't require all the tacticool features of a TacPac or railed model. Not alot of these non railed models floating around NIB. Checked Buds.com and several local dealers prior to this listing so I'm aware of whats out there currently. No trades, and cash gets the deal done! Buyer will need to meet me at a local FFL for the transfer. Buyer is responsible for his/her state background fee and any associated dealer transfer fees. Gun is for sale locally only. Sorry, no shipping or out of state sales at this time. $700 firm!

The rifle only has about 200 rounds through it. You can buy one new for about 1050, but this one has the rail so I'm asking 1200. Comes with one 30 round mag, blackhawk buttstock mag pouch, and sling. Its a sweet weapon, I think I would just prefer a carbine for my style of shooting. Im in no rush, and I would happily keep it if I don't find the right deal. Thanks for looking."

The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward.  The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel.  Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 14 rounds of 12 gage 2-3/4"" rounds (7 per tube).  The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube.  The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine.

Restrictions apply for some areas in the US, please read this entire ad carefully before offering to buy. This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. Factory magazines are vastly less likely to mis-perform than aftermarket magazines. Here are representatives of the standard issue Factory 15 round blue steel magazine for the tried and true CZ-75 and CZ-85 pistols that were manufactured after 1991 and chambered in 9mm caliber. They will also fit the EAA Italian Made Clones and their ancestors the TA-90 Excams. Also, they will fit the Israeli Baby Eagles marketed by Magnum Research. They will fit Bernardelli P01 and P18 Pistols, with some protrusion. They may not fit a Pre-B CZ75 manufactured before 1990. Manufacturer is Czeska Zbrojovka of the Czech Republic. Importer is CZ-USA. CZ number is 11101. Construction is entirely steel, with the exception of the black polymer cartridge follower. Note that the finish on these is matte blue, where many of the CZ USA Magazines have a bright blue finish. That is because these were manufactured for duty use in Europe. These are new and unissued, only some have insertion and ejection marking from being inside a pistol, same level of newness as many magazines a person buys from a gun shop. All of them are packaged in CZ USA Bags. Each magazine holds 15 rounds of 9mm Luger Caliber Ammunition – 9x19, 9mm Parabellum, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Our single mag price is $39 per.

That unfortunately has not happened, and I realized it just isn't something I plan on using/carrying. I haven't even holstered it. One could argue that it was sort of an impulse buy. I don't really need the cash, but if there isn't a trade, I'm asking 400 or best offer, which does not mean $250, so save yourself the time if that's all you plan to offer.

That unfortunately has not happened, and I realized it just isn't something I plan on using/carrying. I haven't even holstered it. One could argue that it was sort of an impulse buy. I don't really need the cash, but if there isn't a trade, I'm asking 400 or best offer, which does not mean $250, so save yourself the time if that's all you plan to offer.
I realize this is no 1911 or HK or something crazy, and I don't think I'm asking a lot. Just let me know what you have to offer.

Winchester manufactured just over one million Model 1892's from 1892 to 1940. This one is serial number 308; a good low number that's in a great configuration. Caliber is .44 WCF. 24"" octagon barrel, full magazine, crescent rifle buttplate, and original winchester sights. Barrel has the early two-line Winchester address across the top flat of the octagon. Caliber is also located on the top flat just ahead of the receiver. The upper tang has the m'fr, Model, and original Browning patent date...which is also in the earliest style. Nice first pattern hammer with decorative dipped border at the top of the checkering. See photos. This rifle is a good original gun and it will letter! We called the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, WY which houses the original Winchester factory records. They provided us with the following information taken from the original Winchester factory ledgers:

WINCHESTER MODEL 1892 - SERIAL NUMBER 308

TYPE: RIFLE
CALIBER: 44
BARREL TYPE: OCTAGON
TRIGGER: PLAIN

RECEIVED IN WAREHOUSE ON AUGUST 09, 1892
SHIPPED FROM WAREHOUSE ON AUGUST 10, 1892 ORDER NUMBER 1107

Overall Condition grades to NRA Antique Fine. The receiver has a good bit of fading original blue mixed through a brown patina. It photographed better than it looks as it's really about 40% original blue. Barrel has 80% original blue and magazine tube retains about 65% original blue with balance turned to brown patina. Hammer shows traces of case colors while the lever shows just a hint of faded color nearest the frame...having mostly turned brown. Loading port shows a hint of original fire blue near the back. Original owner of this rifle must have had sweaty palms as the upper tang at the wrist of the stock has some very light corrosion...markings are all there and very strong. Top of bolt retains 60% faded original blue. The walnut stocks have very little in the way of dings and blemishes...nice enough to grade Fine+ but they've been lightly cleaned in the past so we'll call them Very Good. They stocks exhibit good wood to metal fit and remain even to the metal in most areas. No chips, cracks, or repairs. Bore has no rings or bulges. It's semi-bright with pretty good rifling but it looks like it has the measles with scattered light to moderate pits. Fairly common on 19th century Winchesters from the black powder era. Overall, I'd grade it Fair+ to Good-. Most early production Winchesters got used pretty hard. For such a low serial number, this is very respectable example of an early 1st year production Model 1892 in 44-40."

For your consideration is a Mosin-Nagant model 91/30. Build at the Tula arsenal, year 1939. All parts match, with the magazine floorplate being force matched by factory.

This gun is in excellent shape for its age. No sign of rust anywhere. Bore is nice and shiny, with pronounced lands and grooves. Passes the bullet test with flying colors (see pic). Stock has very few handling marks, solid with no cracks or deep gouges anywhere.

Round count of 55 - shoots like a dream.  Rifle was cleaned meticulously after the 2 range trips I had a chance to shoot it. I just don't have the time to hit the range anymore, and since it's taking up space, it has to go. 

Included with the rifle you get the sling, a complete cleaning kit, oil/solvent bottle, ammo pouch and a bayonet (bayonet is non-matching, normal for these guns).

I am asking $140.00 for everything. Price is very fair, considering you get all the accessories with it. Vendors on-line often don't include anything else but the rifle, and the accessories are getting pricier by the day. You get exactly what you see.

Buyer MUST be in good standing, present VALID identification, and MUST sign 2 copies of a bill of sale - one for you and one for me. This is for your safety as well as mine. No exceptions. 

If interested, CALL (not text!) at (six-zero-8) 5-one-eight-7-one-seven-2."

Sight was just sighted in using slugs at 7 yards (21 feet) which is what the FBI survey show most common distance of a typical home hallway distance and is the baseline for home defense sight ins. 

Details:
This is built off the superior remington 870 wingmaster reciever. For those that dont know this is the highest line 870 with the tightest machining specs and finish. This sell for 600$-700$ typically used as this is the older model with stainless steel parts not the lower quality flextab plastic ones. This is a beautiful shotgun through and through. 

Part list: (all internal work done by a certified gunsmith)
Replaced a lot of the internals with newer parts since i was redoing the whole gun. some of those internal parts are the following
**Extractor (non-mim) and had a gunsmith polish it for a smooth pivot.
**extractor spring
**firing pin
**ejector

**Fenix tk22 special edition light - This light is proven to withstand the recoil of a 12gauge over extended use. remembers last brightness setting and has a max output of 680 lumens. This is a great home defense light as it has a low (7lumen output) to give enough light to identify an intruder but not blind you off white walls.

Please don't let that deter you.  This is a very good 1911 Concealed Carry pistol.  I have run about 4 different types/makes of ammo through it without a hiccup.  The barrel bushing and slide are as tight as my Series 70 Colt National Match Gold cup (no that is not on the table).  It's a great carry .45 and comes in the original box with two mags, etc.   The only reason I'm even considering getting rid of it is it's the last gun in my safe with a 4473 on it. (I have no faith in government)  I have a Kimber CDP compact and there is no difference between the two in performance/function/accuracy other than glitz.  I might be open to trades for a .45ACP or a 9mm particularly if they have a tactical light/laser mount.  Let me know what you got.  Oh, price is $500.    I'm in Grants Pass.

Ruger Redhawk .44 Mag in Blue with a 7 1/2"" barrel.

Damn nice shape,  has 2 very small pitting spots, one under the barrel about half way up, the other under the trigger guard.   It shoots like a dream, and comes with a pair of speed loaders and a belt case for them, a full size soft pistol case, a RH thigh holster, and a RH shoulder rig.    I'll sell it separate for $900 Cash.

And it comes with some factory new ammo;  a case ( 6 boxes )of HSM  from Cabelas,  2 boxes of Cor Bon,  4 boxes of Blazer and Fiocci, some shot shells and dummy rounds,  and one box of monstrously heavy  Buffalo Bore +P+ 340 grain Flat nose rounds.
There's some reloads with it too;    2 boxes heavy loads,   2 boxes light stuff 
They chrono at 1400 and 800 fps respectively.   I'll even include the chrono and tripod.  It still works great even after that nasty incident where I shot a bit low (and we shall never speak of that again.)
It comes with 3 jugs of trail boss,  plenty of primers,  200 new unfired brass cases, and a  Lee Loader for .44 mag.  and a couple hundred 240 grain HSM slugs.  All tucked away neatly in a few 50 cal Ammo cans ready for extended storage.

Literally - everything you need except a hammer. 

If you were to go buy this ammo ( if you can find it)   you would spend  abut 500 for the factory stuff, and  150 to 200 for the reloading gear,  
 I'm valuing all the ammo  and holsters at $600 Cash

So that's $1500 for the complete set up.   You can be shooting today and reloading tonight.
