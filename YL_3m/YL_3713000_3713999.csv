Made by ADI Lithgow Australia, Sacramento CA.

This is a very nice 30.06 Semi-Auto rifle.  I bought the rifle about 3 years ago from a family member and have fired less than 100 rounds through it.  It is basically a new gun.  My limited research has discovered this gun was made by an Australian company that is no longer in Business, it seems the company was “managed” into failure.  As I understand it the rifle parts, some or all, were made in the USA and finished in Australia, then re-imported back in to the USA.

This gun is in great shape.  I had NO miss-fires or miss-feeds with this baby on the range.  I cleaned it after every firing.  This is a new M-1, very shoot-able and ready to go.  
  The stock is finished flat, and is undamaged and not scratched.  The bluing great.  I added a sling, and a GI cleaning kit that fits in the Butt-stock.  I DO NOT have the BOX or any of the original paperwork

I will sell the rifle for $860.00,   price is pretty firm.

Local delivery only (approx. 35 miles radius from Parma Oh), Must be legal to purchase a firearm, please be ready with ID, CC permit preferred.   We can do a bill of sale if desired.  I know of nothing wrong with this gun, and I have had ZERO problems with it.  It is for sale as is.

NP3® PLUS has all the self lubricating attributes of our original NP3® firearm finish; however it offers far more corrosion resistance for marine and other hostile environments. Firearms and other equipment gain up to five times as much corrosion resistance over standard NP3® and up to ten times more than regular electroless nickel! NP3® PLUS is an excellent choice for protecting all firearms deployed in wet environments. This includes shipboard operations and environments where there is frequent exposure to rain, salt spray and high humidity.

Whether you choose one chambered for .22 LR, .22 Magnum, or .17HMR, the
Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting
enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the
excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. The Golden Boy
has a 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, brass
buttplate, with a gleaming Brasslite receiver and barrel band. The classic
styling will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America's
Old West, when company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original
Henry lever action rifle. Adding to the historic authenticity is the
adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. Small game hunters and plinkers will
appreciate its substantial 6.75 lb. heft. It balances well and makes for
highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry
rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness, and left-handed
shooters can safely use any of Henry's lever action rifles.

For a dirtbike it will need to be a 250 or up 2 stroke or a 400 and up 4 stroke. The ar was built to resemble the older model m4 in the a2 configuration, I've always liked that better. It was built usi a complete eagle arms/armalite 16 inch a2 upper, with a welded muzzle break to comply with the assault weapons ban. It has a r guns lower reciever that was built with a cmmg mil spec lower parts kit with a pinned stock for Massachusetts compliance. It has 4 pre ban 30 rd mags, a nice heavy duty case, an extra set of m4 style handgaurds, and a scope mount for the a2 upper. I have ammo as well, but I can split up this package for the buyer however they want it. The rifle itself with 1 mag I put an honest value of 700 for it because it was built using good parts. If you wanted the case it will be 40 bucks, each Mag is 25 each, and the scope mount is 20, and the extra hand guard is another 20. I probably have at least 250-300 rounds of ammo as well. If you wanted everything with the rifle minus the ammo I will do 850. Ammo I'll get an exact count and let the buyer know or I'll just update it here. The rifle shoots and functions excellent, and it even feeds cheap crap Tula 223 pretty good, most ar I shot won't feed it worth a damn, I'm just not really into the whole ar thing as much as I thought, and I really need a dirtbike in my life again lol.

But in the event you do they have had their triggers engineered so that they are the only ones who can put them back together and its about a 2month wait to get your muzzle loader back. I have secured their blueprints for all their triggers. I also put my trigger back together after I cerakoted my CVA wolf.  The model I own requires a special fixture to get the trigger back together.  I am able to do it without the ""special jig"" 
If you need the trigger assembly pictures you can contact me and I will be happy to send them to you. If you need your trigger back in and cant wait 2months - let me know I will be happy to help. CVA charges $50  depending on your model I can do it for less. but the bigger issue is Do you want to wait two months to get your gun back? or do you want it back in a few days or less?"

This short reset provides for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting making it ideal for competitive shooting. With its enhanced ergonomic features of a beavertail grip, front strap checkering and front cocking serrations, the P220 Carry Elite is an excellent choice as a big bore carry pistol. Its beavertail grip allows the shooter to obtain his or her grip quickly and with confidence even under stress. Each P220 Carry Elite Stainless comes equipped with SIGLITE® Night Sights and the all-stainless construction provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long."

This is a very hard to find Glock 19 rtf2 with gills.  It is a Gen 3, some say Gen 3.5 because it was ran at the end of the Gen 3's.  The rtf2 is an aggressive grip and the serrations were changed to experiment with better grip for cocking the firearm. Due to diehard fans not liking the changes Glock discontinued these firearms. You can no longer get the gilled serrations and only law enforcement is offered the rtf2(rough textured frame) grip. People list the rtf2 guns as rare which is semi accurate however NOT ALL ARE RARE. The most rare rtf2 are the 23c rtf2 with gills and 22c with gills. Then the 19 rtf2 with gills.  This is due to shorter production runs. The 22 and 17 rtf2 are readily available everywhere.  You can not find these on here or gunbroker very often. Here is what the last one on gunbroker sold for. See the link below. With transfer and shipping tbey are almost 900.
This gun will come with all the original Glock stuff; case, paperwork, stock sights, two mags.I also have a factory glock 33rd extended magazine and truglo tfo sights on it. I will also throw in 100 rounds of 9mm winchester white box ammo. This thing as about 100 rounds down the pipe but is in like new condition.  Never been holstered and sits in my safe. I will sell everything for $800 or 750 for everything minus the extended mag and truglo sights. Do your research before you email me or give me your opinion about this gun. Those who know Glocks know what this is. I will also consider a trade towards a Tavor that I will throw cash into as well. Thanks for looking.

This is semi-automatic sniper rifle set up.  It is designed to put multiple rounds through long distance targets in seconds and it does this flawlessly.  This rifle is a serious tack-driver and probably one of the most accurate semi-auto .308 rifles in production.  Sub-MOA groups with it are boringly easy.
Total retail value of this package is over $3,375.00.  Asking price for everything is $2900.00!

This gun was made in 2006 and has all orginal Marlin markings including the jm stamping on the barrel to prove it (see pics). I am having a hard time putting a price on the gun because I can't find any for sale. I do know that cabelas sells the Remington built model (which is an inferior product) for just over $800.

This rifle was was refurbished by the Soviets at the /25\ (Triangle-25) facility, which is known for painting the sight numbers in a red paint. They were the only facility known to have done this and the reason behind it is unknown, though it does add some interesting character to the rifles. I've owned three from /25\ and they've all been fantastic shooters, this one included. The bolt fit is nice and tight and this one has done 2"" groups at 100 yards using standard Russian surplus 148gr rounds.

Whenever you use a new or different bolt carrier group in an upper receiver, it's very important to have a gunsmith make sure that the head spacing is correct prior to operating the firearm. You should not switch out a bolt carrier group without doing this. Legal Disclaimer: The buyer assumes full responsibility, and further agrees to assume full liability for compliance with international, federal, state and local laws, as well as for the use, misuse, or sustainment of any injuries to self and/or others by and through the usage of this item. By purchasing this item, the buyer agrees to hold the seller and its affiliates harmless, and fully indemnified against any and all claims (individual, group or stream-of-commerce), which may arise from the proper or improper; intentional or unintentional; and/or careless or neglectful usage of this item. 

* Written by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE), Chief of the Firearms Technology Branch ...M16 bolt carriers are not designed and intended solely and exclusively for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun and are not any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled. Further, an M16 bolt carrier is not a firearm as defined in the GCA or a machinegun as defined in the NFA. An M16 bolt carrier is simply a machinegun part and as such its domestic sale and possession is unregulated under the Federal firearms laws. It is not unlawful to utilize a M16 machinegun bolt carrier in a semiautomatic AR15 type rifle."

More pics available.,"Columbus, OH, Columbus, Ohio",$ 900,"Listed On: Sunday, November 16, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Evaluating interest in this scope that I recently purchased. Grabbed a Trijicon Accupoint 5-20x50mm for a good deal from a local individual. He had no need for it and was willing to sell it cheap because of a defect in the scope. I purchased this with intent of having it fixed by Trijicon and then using it for a build. However, I was informed by Trijicon that this would be about a 4 week turnaround and I have absolutely zero patience. So, i'm going to attempt to sell this scope or trade it for something else that I won't have to wait 4 weeks for! I have all the necessary warranty information to have this fixed free of charge by Trijicon.

The scope has what appears to be a hair like object extending from the bottom sight post. I contacted Trijicon and described what I was seeing and they explained to me that the tritium that illuminates the center of the reticle is placed there by a wire that extends through the bottom sight post. For some reason or another this scope was jarred enough to have the wire come loose and appear this way. It does not affect the function of the scope whatsoever. Some of you might not ever want to bother having this fixed. Purely up to you! I have attempted to show this in pictures. It is very hard to see.

Scope body is in perfect shape. No visible scratches. Tritium is bright. Fiber optic is bright. Scope is about 2 years old. Was previously mounted on a Rem 700 .308 and fired for about 100 rounds. Absolutely stunning shape to the exception of the ""reticle hair"".
