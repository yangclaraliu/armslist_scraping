It's a WASR built by Sure Survival in tampa, unlike other WASRs of it's class thing one does have dimples in the magwell, and the receiver is of higher quality.
I've taken good care of it for the two years I've had it and have only put 500 rounds of Golden Tiger through it, and it does have some light wear marks that are only cosmetic.
In general I've found it to be significantly more accurate than the run of the mill WASR or OPAP, and the sights are perfectly in alignment.
It comes with the pictured 30 round yugo bolt hold open magazine, along with two 5 rounders, and an awesome chicom 40 round steel mag, seriously I love this mag.

ALSO!

For your consideration I'm also pairing this with a Tokarev Pistol chambered in 7.62.
The Pistol is in FANTASTIC condition with no rounds through it at all.
If you're a big Romania fan or just want a good combloc pistol to pair with this excellent combloc rifle then you've come to the right place.
The Pistol itself comes with 2 magazines, a holster, lanyard, and cleaning rod.
The action is very smooth and the pistol still has that out of the box cosmoline smell to it.
From what I've experienced these pistols are the combloc equivalent of the 1911 but with a significantly hotter round. 

Anyway, on to pricing.

I'm asking $700 for the rifle, since it is a higher quality gun in general, that includes all of the magazines and case. If you don't want / need some of the magazines we can negotiate (Also if you're from a ban state that can be a dilemma).

And I'm asking $250 for the pistol, which includes everything pictured and a cardboard box if you decide to just get the pistol.

Now to the good part, if you decide to get both of these awesome guns together I'll set the price at $1000 flat for you. That includes everything listed above. Finally if you're interested I do have some golden tiger left over if you want to add to your purchase, but only if you're buying the rifle or the combo.

Thanks for checking out my listing and I hope to hear from you soon!

EDIT: Hey guys I sold the Tokarev already and only have the WASR left. Also price reduction."

30,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3275030,For Sale/Trade:  Hypertech Power Programmer for anything with the LT1,"Madison, Huntsville, Alabama",$ 380,"Listed On: Sunday, July 13, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Increasing horsepower and torque is as simple as pushing a button with Hypertech's Power Programmer III! You simply plug the Power Programmer into the underdash diagnostic plug, answer a series of ""Yes/No"" questions, and the Power Programmer does the rest. The Power Programmer is much more than a tuning chop - it is a self-contained automotive tuning computer. 
When you connect the Power Programmer to your vehicle, its ""smart"" program instantly recognized your vehicle's powertrain by reading its Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). The VIN contains specific information on the engine, transmission, and drivetrain, which the Power Programmer decodes before it downloads the Power Tuning program that is precisely tailored to your car or truck. 

The Power Programmer lets you choose Hypertech's Power Tuning program for regular 87 octane or premium 93 octane gasoline. Both options improve performance without detonation. After the tuning program is selected, the Programmer automatically installs the tuning program, and allows you to access and reprogram the vehicle's computer to function properly with aftermarket components such as non-stock tire sizes and rear-end gear ratios. 

The Power Programmer is incredibly powerful, but it is also incredibly easy to use. Reprogramming does not require any tools or knowledge of cars or even computers - plus you can return to OEM stock programming in just minutes.

Had pretty much just been sitting around for a couple years by the look it it but gave it a cursory cleaning and oiling and looks healthy as ever. Have put 40 rounds of FMJ through it just to make sure it works. No issues although when you rack the first round in sometimes it'll need a tap on the rear of the slide to go into battery - this is just due to the dude never using it, magazine spring is still real tight, will loosen up over the course of a break in. Cycles fine when firing.

Price is firm and fair, cash only, no trades or checks please, just wanting a bit of cash for a baby shower gift.

Will need to show Iowa Permit to Purchase or CCW (either Iowa or a state with reciprocity).

Fully functional with all original parts. Very few scratches in the finish. I've seen well-cared for rifles 6 months off the press that don't look as new. The original owner whom I acquired the rifle from a few months ago took meticulous care of it. This a true collector's item and a must have for anyone who can appreciate the simplicity, light weight, and user friendliness of Stoner's masterpiece in its original, true, unadulterated form.

Barrel is the full length 20"", 1/12 twist--same as was used in Vietnam.
Comes with two 30 round magazines.

A while back I got a VZ-58 and in recent times I've been wanting to give it a better home.
It's in EXCELLENT condition, I have run less than 100 rounds through this thing and it only has a little paint chipped off from the inside of the magwell.
As you know these are getting very hard to come by since they can no longer imper the receivers into the country. 
I have to say though this thing is dead accurate with about 1/3 less recoil than a traditional AK patterned rifle.
Also the currently installed wire stock is the most solid wire stock I've encountered in a while.

Enough talking about how good this gun is though lets talk about the deal part, when I got this thing I went kind of all out on the accessories.
It comes with the original bakelite (Beaver Vomit) furniture, including the fixed stock which is already hard as hell to find, and the original bayonet, sling, 2 cleaning kits,and a slew of spare parts.
It also Includes a third party polymer furniture set which matches really well with the installed folding stock, along with a darker sling to match that furniture set.
Still not done yet. There is a Mako group pistol grip currently installed on it which has a storage compartment in it, and it comes with the railed furniture from that company as well and an AR buffer tube adapter for when you're feeling extra tactical or if you want to look like czech special forces.

AND FINALLY, this rifle comes with 7 mags, the three pictured and another 4 which have the original finish and are in the leather magazine holder that came with the gun.

That's it! Shit my fingers hurt. Anyway I'm asking $1600 for the entire set. I can work a little on the price but that's what I'm really looking to get. Also NO TRADES, even if you have a shard of the true cross or something I'm good.

Thanks for checking out my listing! Hope to hear from you soon.

EDIT: I'm reducing the price to $1200, and that still includes everything pictured plus 4 mags in the original leather mag pouch."

The scope is a pentax lightseeker II, 3x9x40. The scope is ten years old as well, and it doesn't fog. It has great light at dusk or dawn. 
In ten years, I've put less than 100 rounds through the barrel. 
I've stopped a bear with this gun, and it is a perfect shooting solution for any hunter here in the Pacific Northwest. 
I shoot 165 grain Remington core lokt ammo. 
The scope is dead on at 100 yards. You will not have to re-sight this gun in. However, I do recommend to see where it shoots after purchase as we all focus differently.
The sling in the photo will not go with the rifle.
I hate to sell it...it's made many good memories.
Will consider a trade for a pistol or a nice high quality camera of equal value...and best offer.

Looking to sell/trade my Arcus 98DAC. It is used, but in very good condition. I've fired 300 or so rounds through it, and am the original purchaser. It is a Double Action/Single Action Browning Hi-Power based system.

Recently I discovered I shoot handguns a lot better left handed, as I shoot rifles and shotguns left handed too. All the controls on this pistol are right handed, so it's fairly annoying for me to shoot it left handed.
I'm looking to either trade for another pistol(preferably 9mm) without a safety or either with ambi controls or can easily be converted to have them.

Trade/Cash value is $300. Would come with 3 magazines. The pistol can take any Browning Hi-Power magazine. I have other things to offer if you have a pistol that exceeds the $300 range by a 200 or less. Keltecs, Rock Islands, etc are some ideas of what I'd be interested in for trades.

This is the predecessor to the F/FS models. The 84/85 Berettas are considered the softest shooting .380 ever made.

 This model has the rounded trigger guard, blued slide and barrel assembly and gloss anodized frame, whereas the F/FS are bruniton coated slide and barrel, and matte anodized frame with squared trigger guard. Additionally, the safety of the BB allows for cocked and locked carry like a 1911, whereas the F/FS safety acts as a decocker. AN date code gives this pistol a 1985 mfg date. Original owner was from AZ and claims only 50 rounds fired, I've put another 50. The bore is excellent. 

Pistol has some slight wear from carry; the finish on the grip tang and a little on the rear frame serrations has worn off some. They have since been touched up with a bluing pen. Also has the normal ""ring"" on the barrel from where the slide shroud rubs on the barrel during firing. 

Sorry for the not so great pics, they really don't do the gun justice.

Includes two mags and original manual.

It scores a 7 or an 8 out of 10. It has never been re-done. It is pretty. I quit bird hunting long ago. 
It is a really diverse gun for those who love to hunt birds. I've never had any troubles with it at all. The recoil is nothing compared to most shotguns. It hasn't been fired in 5 years. I have put less than 100 shells through the barrel. I currently have a modified choke on the barrel. I can send you more pictures if so desired. Please call REDACTED with any questions...willing to accept best offer.
Would gladly trade for an SKS or AK-47."

They come from working stock, these are not your mix with a herding dog breed. These pups were bred to work the ranch and protect your family.  We still have 7 pups as of 7-13-2014 but they are going quick (6 boys and only 1 girl). They are a cross between three amazing livestock guarding breeds. They are 1/2 Great Pyrenees (which is calm, well-mannered and somewhat serious. Courageous, very loyal and obedient.) 1/4 Kangal (which is known for their protectiveness, loyalty and gentleness with small children and animals and guards them with extreme devotion) and 1/4 Anatolian Shepherd (Which is known for its independent and forceful, responsible for guarding its master's flocks without human assistance or direction.) All puppies will come with their first rounds of puppy shots, and de-worm. They are not wean yet but started on puppy mush. Since they are not wean we are accepting deposit of half to hold your puppy (which the deposit is 125.00) which is non refundable if you change your mind. We have both parents and grandma on sight and can answer any questions you may have. Again these are working dogs who have been bred to guard your family and livestock. They have been with goats since day one. The pups are already bonding with the baby goats we have here and snuggle up with them at night. I have photos of them but am having trouble posting them. Please feel free to text or email me. Calling is a little tricky as we live in a hollow and I get horrible service but you can try. (918) 809 3742."

Its in good shape with no problems or wear worth mentioning.  Comes with its box and two 17 round magazines.  The magazine disconnect has been removed and the trigger is better than a stock SR9 as a result.  Can post pictures latter but it is the stainless steel two tone version.

I'm wanting to trade it for a Springfield XD9 service model.  Nothing wrong with the Ruger and it carries arguably better since its thinner, but I've had a number of XD's and simply prefer them.  While that's primarily what I'm looking for I'd also be interested in a 9mm Stoeger Cougar or a 9mm SIG SP2022.  Depending on what you have for trade and what it comes with I would be willing to add cash or ammo to a deal.

Would prefer to trade but may sell it for the right cash offer, assuming its a REASONABLE cash offer.  No I will not take $300 for it.

I Have my CCL, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Numbers on receiver, barrel, & stock match, but the bolt does not which is quite common on arsenal refurbs as it was easier to simply replace a broken bolt rather than to repair it. 

Bore is in good condition with no pitting or rust and strong rifling. 

Bayonet is attached to the rifle and it pivots up and locks in place in a similar fashion to the SKS. 

I didn't have a scale to weigh this rifle but I don't believe it goes much more than six pounds making it a very compact and easy to carry package. 

Rifle comes with the sling I bought it with 30 plus years ago. I'm not sure if it's an original but think there's a good chance that it is. 

Also included is an original lead Carcano oiler and a special wood handle screwdriver that was specifically made for the Carcano rifles

This is a fun kit for an all around rifle combo. Hunt coyotes in the morning, swap into a shotgun for ducks/geese and swap back. Its accurate and a simple setup with few moving parts that could defect. The .243 caliber is great for Blacktail in the fall too if you are into it.

A lot of ranchers and farmers use these as their ""always in the tractors"" weapons due to their durability and accuracy.

It is a Bring back from WWII.  Came from a deceased Uncle.   He was in a home for 30 years and I have had it in my possession for the last 10   I would imagine the last time it was shot was more then likely when he picked it up in Germany.   I have not fired it.  So for the last 40+ years it has not had a round through it.     It has a low serial # and frame, slide and barrel all match.  Had it at gun show and had it looked at and given general value of what it would be worth.   Told more then likely with serial # would make it an German officers piece,  but since my Uncle has past I can't ask him how he got it.     Condition is very good for what it has been through.     I am looking at a trade only at this time unless a cash over that blows me away is offered.   I am only looking for a couple of things.  I am looking for a Ruger mini-14  with several mags + optics, or a little bit of cash or other gun.   Also looking for a 44 magnum minimum of 6 inch + cash or other gun.     I will consider possible a multi- handgun offer as well.    Be aware of my location! I will only drive roughly 15 mins from my house to make a deal so be prepared to drive to me.   I will not ship the gun!  Not going through the hassle.   I do not have to sell or trade this gun I'm looking to see what is out there and it's been sitting to long.   I will not just give it away.  Please be aware of what the value range of this gun is.   Mine is not made of gold, nor is your item.

893,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3275893,For Sale:  Americas truck for Americans! A 1969 Chevy C10 4x4,"Waukesha, Milwaukee, Wisconsin","$ 8,500","Listed On: Sunday, July 13, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale I have a 1969 C10 4x4 that was built for Uncle Sam when the Cold War was on every American's mind, in every American's home and all over the evening news. This beast was designed by Americans who built the Atomic Bomb, built to support our troops, to resupply them in the heat of battle, and to power forward when lives and country are on the line. This truck was forged in the Heartland of America built from recycled tanks and bombers in a time when STEEL was on the road to not just protect you from an accident but survive and drive you home!
Luckily Former President Ronald Reagan ended the Cold War giving us civilians a chance to drive a beast meant for the heat of battle but tame enough for Americas roads.
It's a stick shift built for that farmboy drafted to be a soldier, one who knows his way around mighty machines that tear at the land and feed a hungry country. 
There is no rust or rot as both fear to even try to form, and with its all American STEEL body she's as straight as an Arrow shot from the bow of Geronimo himself.
Born with a 350 V8 there is NO fancy namby pamby computer crap or sensors to choke life from this mighty machine. Which means you can bust out those Craftsman's tools your beautiful wife/girlfriend bought you for Valentines Day as a symbol of love and wrench on her yourself!
Here's a little 411 directly from Chevy on the engine that beats under the hood of this monster:
The L-48 is the original 350 cu in (5.7 L), solely available for 1967 in the Super Sport version of Camaro SS 350 (1967-up) or Chevy II/Nova in '68-79. In '69 it was used in almost all car lines; Camaros, Impalas, El Caminos, Chevelles & Novas. 1969 L-48's use a Hyd Cam, 4bbl Quadrajet carburetor, cast pistons, 4-bolt main casting number 010 Blocks & casting number 041 or 186 heads. Power output was 300HP and 380 lb·ft (520 N·m) torque. Compression ratio was 10.25:1.
Now take a moment to soak all that information in... An engine so powerful that it powered other champions and still does half a century later! We're talking cars with pedigree's only Legend's can drive!
Tear down trees, rip houses from their foundations, cause your neighbor's Prius to spontaneously combust by merely passing him on the freeway. Did I say freeway! That's RIGHT son of Paul Bunyan, drive her on America's freeways and highways! Keeping her away from those commie states who take your hard earned American money.
This is an AMERICAN truck meant for AMERICANS! God fearing, steak eating, gun shooting warriors of the back woods! This is that EMP proof, bullet proof monster to get you out of dodge in! Taking family and gear to your bug out location and doing it in classic style!
Now it's hard to put a price on American muscle like this! But with a growing family I need to pass her on to another worthy red blooded American who can appreciate power. A man or woman able to control this beast and love it as much as I have.
If you think you measure up shoot me an email and I'll introduce you.

Many parts are included along with a bed mounted tool drawer to keep your tow chains, double-bit axe and bowie knife safe in any weather! And the final item that should push you over is a 100 amp alternator pulsating, feeding unimaginable power to your whim! This means you can put a winch on her or install off road lights or anything else your imagination can conjure up!

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR! Americas roads needs you! Your honey do list can finally be completed!"
