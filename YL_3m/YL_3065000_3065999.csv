Photos are representative, but buyers will receive a virtually identical specimen to the one in the photos. Dealers, collectors, and Agencies, however, may take any number of essentially identical 229s we have on hand, at the same per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. Any ammunition showing in the photos is Not included. At press time, this was one of fewer than 2 dozen we were able to get. The P229® DAK™, writes the factory, is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, … tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. Manufacturer is Sig Arms USA of Exeter, NH, with frame made in Germany and so marked. Type is hammer fired double action only blowback semi-automatic pistol. The hammer does not stand, this pistol will not fire on single action. Construction is steel barrel and internal parts in a CNC Milled Steel Black Stainless slide. Sights are dovetailed MH3 Siglite® Night Sights, manufactured by Meprolight for Sig. Frame is lightweight alloy, square faced trigger guard with three slot frame integral Picatinny light rail. Trigger is .420 smooth faced, beveled edge combat type. Hammer is .315 Bobbed, and sets to a half cock ready-to-fire position but without the hammer resting on the firing pin. This Sig, like all its mates, has a firing pin safety. Overall length is 7.1 inches; height 5.4 inches; overall width 1.5 inches; and sight radius is 5.7 inches. Barrel is 3.9 inch, eight groove right hand 1:16 rifling. Chambering, of course, is .357 Sig caliber, not to be confused with the .357 Remington Magnum by novice shoppers. Magazine is factory Sig 12 round steel, Department issue and Law Enforcement marked. Grips are original Sig stippled surface polymer, held in place by factory Torx® head screws. Weight empty is 32 ounces, with center of gravity at the back of the trigger. This specimen has served and protected our fellow Americans in Indiana during its Law Enforcement career. From its AM150000 range serial number, it was manufactured between 2004 and 2009. Surface detractions are minimal to moderate, principally edge and front strap serration whitening on the frame, and on the slide and sight edges. We rate it as Very Good, close to Excellent, 85 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Night Sights retain fully 60 percent of their original luminosity from our dark room inspection. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. Lateral play to the slide is negligible. This is a well maintained pistol. We estimate it has been fired fewer than 1000 rounds for law enforcement qualification, no rounds at all for a Sig. Replacement pricing on this pistol, still in production, is upwards $1,000.00. We’re offering the Sig P229 DAK .357 in the photos, however, 		or one of its virtually identical mates	 	for only		$ 489.00.

Text Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

It's had one 50 round box of ammo ran through it. After that I used it as a carry gun for a short time and it's been a safe queen ever since. I'm looking at buying another vehicle so I decided to sell it to someone that will get more use out of it. It's in almost mint condition with very minor holster wear. Mostly just a rub on the coating but one very small area near the front sight actually went through the coating. Pic included.

If you've never shot a semi-custom 1911 or you never could convince yourself to spend the money........take it from me, it's well worth it. This gun has the smoothest action I've ever felt in a handgun. The hand tooling is obvious. The trigger is smooth and has a crisp break as it should.

It was ordered with these upgrades at additional cost: Gen III coating on trigger(rest of gun is also GEN III), flush barrel crown, extended mag well and 3 Ed Brown 8 round mags instead of 7 round mags. Also included are my G10 Punisher grips as well as the stock grips. Ed Brown range bag and cleaning solution also included.

Included in the sale is a Comp Tac MTAC Minotaur IWB holster and Nighthawk 2-mag OWB holster.

I have well over $2900 in this gun with upgrades/accessories. I'm asking $2450 Or Best Offer for everything. Don't be afraid to make an offer. All reasonable offers will be considered. Will consider partial trade for Kimber/Springfield 1911 plus cash or AR plus cash. Don't wait the 6-8 weeks it takes to custom order one from Ed Brown. Face to face deal is fine but I'll require that you show a valid Alabama drivers license if we do."

Photos are representative, but buyers will receive a virtually identical specimen to the one in the photos. The early 1990s saw cost cutting among pistol manufacturers, along with aggressive marketing to Law Enforcement. For Beretta, their Police Special variant of the highly successful 92FS series meant stamping a Police Shield logo outline on the forward left slide, and packaging in a plain brown box with a Police Special sleeve. This specimen’s BER200,000 range, Z suffix serial number dates its production to the early to mid 90's; and it issued to the Benton County, Washington Sheriff’s Department. Manufacturer is Beretta USA of Accokeek, MD. Type is traditional double-and-single action semi-auto pistol. Construction is semi-gloss anodized lightweight alloy frame; semi-gloss steel slide and black matte barrel and steel parts, including the slide’s steel guide rod. Barrel is 5 inch Government size. Sights are refurbished white dot front, slide integral front and dovetailed rear. Extreme overall length is 8 5/8 inches from the muzzle to the back of the grip frame strut. Weight empty is 33.8 ounces. Ambidextrous safety levers also serve as decockers. Magazine release is ambidextrous and easily reversible. Beretta logo black checkered high impact polymer grip panels are secured by flat slot screws. 5 1/4 inch height from the magazine base plate to the top of the rear sight. Slide thickness is 1.15 inch; grip frame thickness 1.03 inch with taper to 0.73 at the frame front. Trigger is smooth faced .355 combat type, with .315 short spur hammer. Surface detractions are moderate, principally holster contact surface wear. We rate this 92FS as Very Good, 75 percent vicinity by our estimate, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean; we estimate that this 92FS has been fired 1500 rounds for annual qualification, no rounds at all for a Beretta. Magazine is ban period, steel body factory 15 shot. Replacement pricing on a current production 92FS or M9 is over $600 in our area. We’re offering the Benton County Sheriff’s 92FS in the photos, however, 	or one of its virtually identical mates	 	for only	$ 419.00.	Transferable to eligible civilians in all jurisdictions of these United States. Ammunition not included. CA roster status expires 12/31/14. For any civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 15 round magazines are restricted to law enforcement only, we will sub a Mec-Gar 10 rounder for the 15. Affected jurisdictions include California, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York.

The “Baby” of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. 
Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free.

For extra 'trading points', I can even throw in the 1,000 .45 ACP brass rounds I bought for it. The RIA has a very interesting warranty in that it is for the life of the gun, rather than the owner. This means that this pistol could be passed down for entire generations, with free factory repairs the entire time.

I also have for trade a Model 94 .30-30 Winchester, recently inherited from my uncle. It has signs of wear, and surface rust along the bottom of the gun, right in front of the lever assembly. It does not look to be in bad shape, in fact I'd say it just needs a serious cleaning, but I have not taken it to the range yet. I have only 20 rounds for it, but they're yours with the rifle.

As I am only allowed three pictures, please google the following phrases to see pictures and descriptions of the handgun and ammo:


'Rock Island Armory Midsize GI .45 ACP'

'Armscor Brass .45 ACP'

Please Note! The pictures are stock, as a reference to the general condition of the firearms up for trade, as well as the general condition of rifle I am looking to trade for.

The Armscor and the pistol both look absolutely gorgeous, and I'm hesitant to let them go before shooting them. But I am also so very close to completing my collection of Mosins, so I decided to finish the collection first and get a new pistol later.

Please do not contact with trade offers on other types of firearms, or offers for ammunition. I am set on both guns and ammo, what I'm missing are things chambered in 7.62x54R!

The new R51 is a compact carry gun built on an aluminum frame that measures a mere 6.6″ long by 4½” high, and is less than an inch across. It uses a form of delayed-blowback operation called the Pedersen lock or an impingement lock. It represents a combination of features chosen specifically to make it extremely easy to point and shoot. Its grip angle has been optimized for rapid target acquisition. The low bore axis design boosts this effect while also aids in offering up to 25 percent less muzzle rise at the shot for faster, more accurate follow-ups. For comfortable carry, it features a lightweight aluminum frame with rounded edges.

Up for grabs is an AR-15 I had assembled with the best by the best. Rifle is pictured on the left in the picture. I wanted to make this a precision rig and put a 1-4x variable on it, but it's hard to justify when I shoot literally 20 times more pistol than rifle, and I get to shoot past 100 yds 3 times per year. The rifle was assembled by Robb Jensen at VA Arms, so it was put together correctly (i.e. lower receiver end plate staked, proper barrel nut torque, etc). Rifle was taken to the range once and has had 60-80 rounds of brass cased 55 gr .223 through it. The rifle will come with 2 NIW GI style mags and 2 NIW pmags.

Note: Aimpoint and mbus rear sight not included 

Cash price is $1200 solid. That means $1200. Im not selling because Im pressed for cash. If it rots in my safe so be it.

Also, photos often do not do nickel justice!  I have decided to focus on semi autos and have sold off my other revolvers, so this one is the last to go!  It has the pinned barrel and recessed cylinder, which of course helps with long term value as it relates to the quality of construction.  The target grips are in decent shape, but I put on Pachmayr professional grips as they work better for me in any case.  When I got it, I had the gun stripped down, cleaned and checked over by the Gun Doctor in Roselle.  (They said it is good to go for many more years to come). I have put through about 100-150 rounds through it since then.  It has been one of my around-the-house SD guns.  GO TO GUNBROKER.COM TO BID, as I decided to let it ride there.

Here is the original Glock compact, the model 19 from that worthy company, one the pistols that revolutionized the handgun market radically in the 1980s. If a person wants to actually be able to hit something, it is still far and away the best compact of the Glock series over the non-ergonomic Model 26 subcompact. Here is what the factory says about the 19. The Glock 19 is ideal for versatile use through reduced dimensions compared with the standard pistol size. With the proven caliber of 9x19, it has found worldwide distribution in security services. In addition to being used as a conventional service weapon, it is suitable for concealed carry or as a backup weapon. Factory specs are item number PI1950203, double action only semi-auto pistol; caliber 9mm; barrel length 4.02 inches; magazine capacity 15+1; trigger safety and firing pin block; polymer grip frame; fixed white outline rear and white dot front sights; weight empty 21 ounces; black high impact polymer frame with black matte slide and furniture.

Here is unequalled firepower in a manageable size, the Glock model 20 Slim Frame, factory #PF2050203. The 10mm, of course, performs as the rough equivalent to the .41 Magnum. Muzzle energy rating is some 550 foot pounds. Weight empty on the Glock Model 20 is only 27.7 ounces; the innovative Glock Polymer damping system, however, significantly reduces felt recoil on this powerhouse. Barrel is 4.60 inches with German style polygonal bore that ensures consistent accuracy with diminished fouling. Sight system is classic Glock dot front and U-white outline rear; frame is rail type. This pistol includes two 15 shot magazines, so the loaded capability is almost 12 tonnes, as the Brits would say, of energy. Bear, boar, and deer hunters here in Tennessee and Mississippi use these to good effect, and they are unmatched for power delivery in defensive or tactical situations. Current retail pricing on the Glock Model 20 in our area is $800 or more if a person can even find one. We're offering the pistol in the photo, however, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 559.00. Not transferable to civilians residents of Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 15 round magazines are restricted to law enforcement, $30 off but no magazines. Affected jurisdictions include California, Chicago Cook County Illinois, District of Colombia, Hawaii, and New York.

Photo shows a late specimen of the classic Colt Series 70 Government Model that occasional comes in a limited run from the Colt Custom Shop only. The forte of the Series 70, of course, is the lack of a firing pin block or firing pin safety, and the crisp single action trigger pull that only comes without the trigger having to depress a plunger. Factory specs are as follows. The pistol is the classic 5 inch barrel all-steel Colt Series 70 Government, catalog #O1970A1CS .45 ACP. It's entirely blue steel, 8 1/2 inches overall length, classic spur hammer, aluminum combat trigger, flat black combat sights, with classic Double Diamond Rosewood Colt grips. Both grip safety and thumb safety are standard configuration. Serrated trigger is standard, and it has two factory 7 shot magazines. Finish, as the photos show, is matte blue vertical surfaces with classic Colt bright blue side features. The pistol speaks for itself. Each one comes in its original blue box with its padlock, extra magazine, and instruction manual. In a market awash with plastic, here is the original real thing, all 36 oz. of it. Own one of these original classics, still the definitive combat handgun for only $ 1079.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts.

For as long as they have been on the market, we have had excellent service experience, and suitable accuracy experience, with the Rossi Single Shots imported by Taurus-Held Company Braztech in Miami. Brazilian rifle and handgun workmanship has always been excellent. This is a Rossi – Braztech Single Shot Rifle in .308 Remington; and photos show a specimen we had in stock. The stock and forend are durable, weather resistant, recoil absorbing graphite based black polymer with checkered grip surfaces, as the photos show. The buttstock even has a detachable hard rubber Monte Carlo comb and a 3/4 inch thick magnum grade recoil pad. This is not a youth length rifle; length of pull measures 13 5/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the recoil pad. Factory specs are as follows: Taurus catalog number R308MBS; caliber .308 Winchester; break-open single shot action; single stage trigger; transfer bar and manual lever safeties with cable lock; 23 inch barrel; Weaver base with filler screws furnished if anyone wants to go it with the Fiber Optic Sights only; overall length 38 1/2 inches; weight empty 6 1/4 pounds. This rifle comes with a factory blue steel, two-screw hammer extension for scope mounting. The red dot front, dual green dot rear fiber optic sights are high enough to clear many of the Weaver see-through scope rings. Competitor H&R Handi Rifles, from our local experience, are more prone to misfire, less accurate, heavier, and less well balanced. The H&Rs command prices of $300 apiece or more in our area. We’re offering the light, well-balanced, reliable and accurate Rossi Braztech in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 249.00

Price includes an extra 10-round magazine (in fact, I have the factory box, and all the stuff originally included, along with the dated sales receipt), PLUS a kit for gun maintenance/cleaning, required-by-law childproof trigger lock, PLUS separate lockable box for ammo storage, and a Defender DF-V200, a lockable and cabled automobile metal safe, with a 2nd tether attachment for locking 'on the go' (or for use in another vehicle).

Price also includes 30 rounds of Supreme Elite AND a box of (50) Federal Champion 40 cal rounds (I bought it at Walmart a year ago, but ammo is non-returnable and I never made it out to the target range, as planned).

I bought this handgun NEW two years ago for personal protection, and took it out to the range one time (I cleaned before, and immediately after, firing), after putting about 20 rounds down-range to verify ops.  Honest, you're not going to find a lower-use ""used"" handgun than this one, a classic ""little old lady from Pasadena"" situation, except with a Sigma.

(And yes, you probably could've bought one of these a few years ago for $ less, so get the bugs worked out on that time-travel machine, and bring me back a few items from the past, too, including shares of Apple stock at $80 per share?  Coulda, shoulda, woulda....). 

:)

Anyway, this is a turn-key starter package, ideal for someone who's looking for an inexpensive entry into gun ownership and personal protection.  

I must sell ASAP, so consider me a motivated seller who's open to all reasonable serious (good faith) offers.

I'd prefer local-area buyer (ie San Fernando Valley and Greater LA area: I'm in Van Nuys, but regularly make it out to the Northridge area), but would consider OC delivery for the right buyer."

Cal. 22 S, L, LR. Ser. # M17XX puts date of manufacture at 1955. I believe this was the first year of Marlin's Micro Groove barrels. Overall condition is excellent. I would rate the metal and wood at above 95% with a couple of minor compression marks in the wood from storage, bluing is excellent. No buggered screws, and bore is perfect. This one was sold by Sears, and the barrel is factory drilled & tapped (by Marlin) to accept a scope mount that was made by Weaver for Sears. Feeds, fires & ejects with absolutely no issues, and is very accurate. Nice pre Remington Marlins are getting harder and harder to find, and are dramatically appreciating in value. You would be hard put to find a 59 year old Marlin in better condition - No disappointments here, it will make a fine, shootable addition to any collection.

OMNI HYBRID DESCRIPTION:

The lower Receiver is made of a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert. Designed to give extra strength in the high-pressure sections, the Omni-Hybrid surpasses military pressure and weight-bearing testing.

This unique manufacturing process produces a lighter weight platform, with the total weight of the Omni-Hybrid stripped lower being 8 ounces, a ½ ounce lighter than a traditional aluminum AR lower.

Patented Inter-lock hammer and trigger pin retainment system prevents movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing.

“The Omni-Hybrid lower has gone through all the pressure and weight-baring testing of a traditional aluminum lower with flawless results,” 


Will meet within a reasonable distance from Pickerington/Canal Winchester. 

Cash Only. Trades may be accepted, just let me know what you have. I am looking for a nice gun safe.

Why don't you guys learn how to use the site. I am not a dealer or even a tech savvy person but there is a tab to the left of every category that has a place that you can select private party and it will filter out the dealers. I know it works because I use it all the time. You should try it before you stroke out worrying about dealer postings.

Made in Italy by master firearms company Pietta (F.A.P. di PIETTA Giuseppe & Co.)

PICS: Here are some pics of the original Ad (from 1986) for the gun, as well as some other pics: http://imgur.com/a/Ll6zi

As far as price,
I'm asking $399
PRICE CUT - I AM NOW OFFERING IT FOR $299
(includes FREE SHIPPING and FREE Hardwood case - details below)

This model, the commemorative, hand-made, laser-engraved, with a 24 carat gold etched version of ""Fredrick Remington's 'The Rattlesnake"" on the cylinder, was originally sold by the New England Collector's Society. Its number 302 (from a limited edition of 5000) of their ""First Frederick Remington Commemorative Pistol - The Rattlesnake"". (see pics for a copy of their original 1896 newspaper ad). Each one was individually hand crafted of authentic blued steel, brass and walnut, by Pietta of Italy Its hallmarked and individually numbered.

I have had it since it was first issued, I turned 21 in 1986, and my dad bought this for me, I've kept it around as a collector's item, but its never ever been used. Anyway, I'm trimming down my collection, so I'm offering this rare beauty for sale. Here's the basic info: Classic Remington .44 caliber 1858 New Army Revolver. Engraved and Gold Inlaid with the Fredric Remington's ""The Rattlesnake"" Both cylinder and frame are laser engraved, brass trigger guard, walnut grip.

The gun is as-new and never loaded nor fired. the finish has minor blemishes, and a light drag line. I would grade it at 98% Still, its in A+ shape, truly a beautiful and unique firearm, and as I've been its only owner, I can guarantee the condition, as well as the fact that its been properly cared for. The pictures should tell it all (or offer up most of what you want to know), but feel free to ask me any questions you might have.

	•	FREE HARDWOOD CASE: The custom made, velvet-lined, hardwood case, shown in the pictures, is included for FREE. This case shows very minor signs of wear (a few dings or light scratches here and there) but as you can see from the pictures, in in excellent condition. Similar cases tend to cost $140 and up, This case is included for FREE to whomever buys this gun.

	•	FREE SHIPPING: FREE ECONOMY SHIPPING IN THE US (Lower 48), for other shipping options or local pick up, contact me for details) 

This exact model, of this gun has regularly sold for between $600-$800. Why am I selling it for so much less? because I am moving to California (from my current state of VA), and with CA guns laws being what they are, its going to be 1000 times easier for me to sell any guns I dont want to take with me before I leave (as opposed to doing ALL the California paperwork, and pay all the CA fees, just to have it in CA, so I can sell it from there). And to get the higher price, I would have to list it for a few weeks, perhaps.
So, if this is a gun you would like, just check around, and you'll see, this is an amazing price.

As its a black powder revolver, no FFL is needed for private owner transfers/sales.

Worth mentioning, it can have the cylinder swapped out, and be used to fire .44 cal ammo (cowboy rounds) - although. currently it does not have such a cylinder.

However you choose to shoot it, or whether you just keep it as a collector's item, this is a truly beautiful gun, and a great gun for shooting too. As mentioned, this gun has never been fired at all, with any kind of round, ever, and its all original parts, exactly the same as the day it was given to me in 1986). I am in Northern Virginia, so buyer can pick it up (if you're local) or I am willing to offer free shipping to the lower 48."

I bought it roughly 10 months ago planning to get into longer distance shooting and hunting eventually, but my situation has changed and I no longer have the time for that side of the hobby.

It's a beautifully well put together rifle. Free floated barrel, ridiculously smooth bolt operation, crisp adjustable trigger, I'd buy it again in a heartbeat, I just don't need it.

It's magazine fed, 3+1 capacity, safety w a 2 dot system on the bolt and safety position letting you know its status. Ejects and feeds smoothly. I took it shooting once and put ~5-10 rounds through it, I can't remember exactly.

The barrel is 22 7/16"" long, cold hammer forged with an 11"" rate of twist. The trigger is adjustable between 2 and 4 pounds. The magazine is removable with the catch located just forward of the magazine when inserted. It is plastic and holds 3 rounds.

The scope is a Nikon Prostaff 4-12x40mm with the BDC reticle. It is mounted on Talley One-piece (Low) rings/bases. These are very solid mounts and in my opinion give the rifle a lot cleaner look than regular rings/mounts. Both the scope and rings were purchased for this rifle so they're both new too.

I'm asking $950, but feel free to make an offer.
Not that big on trades but it depends on what you have.

They also have different lengths both 223/556 and 300 BO. This is pretty much like putting a AK on your AR lower. All the benefits of the AK style bolt and gas system make for a very reliable rifle.

This also come's with OPTICS. I will include a pair of Diamondhead flip up iron sights. The front Diamondhead sight come's with a Blitzkrieg Chevron for better target acquisition. Also included is the all new Vortex Strikefire II with lower 1/3 cantilever mount.

Also including a Strike Industries Cobra grip.

Asking price for all is $1600 OBO. I'm not interested in trade's unless it's something really nice.
Shoot me a email if your interested
I also have plenty more pic's.

Got a possible glock 17 gen 4 for the right trade..which with the exception of the single mag I let off last weekend, gun is NIB. 
Also got a custom AR with an 20"" FN upper which hasn't even let off a full mag in its existence, and it has a bunch of extra rounds too. However, since I don't think there's a shotgun out there I'd trade for that, that trade could take some extra convincing.

I bought it roughly 10 months ago planning to get into longer distance shooting and hunting eventually, but my situation has changed and I no longer have the time for that side of the hobby.

It's a beautifully well put together rifle. Free floated barrel, ridiculously smooth bolt operation, crisp adjustable trigger, I'd buy it again in a heartbeat, I just don't need it.

It's magazine fed, 3+1 capacity, safety w a 2 dot system on the bolt and safety position letting you know its status. Ejects and feeds smoothly. I took it shooting once and put ~5-10 rounds through it, I can't remember exactly.

The barrel is 22 7/16"" long, cold hammer forged with an 11"" rate of twist. The trigger is adjustable between 2 and 4 pounds. The magazine is removable with the catch located just forward of the magazine when inserted. It is plastic and holds 3 rounds.

The scope is a Nikon Prostaff 4-12x40mm with the BDC reticle. It is mounted on Talley One-piece (Low) rings/bases. These are very solid mounts and in my opinion give the rifle a lot cleaner look than regular rings/mounts. Both the scope and rings were purchased for this rifle so they're both new too.

I'm asking $950, but feel free to make an offer.
Not that big on trades but it depends on what you have.

I've got a Sig Sauer P230 SL for sale made in W. Germany in 1993. With the gun I've got the original box, manual, hangtag, test target, leather OWB holster, and about half a box of 380. The pistol also comes with 2 original Sig mags with the harder to find metal baseplate.

The pistol is in pretty good shape, being perfect other than a few dark specs in the slide serrations and takedown lever. I'd rate it at roughly 95% and would be happy to provide more pictures upon request. I've only shot a box and a half of ammo with it, and did not have any problems, but I've got too many calibers to reload for and am downsizing a little bit.

I'd like to get around $425, so shoot me an email with what you feel is fair. I'm also interested in several trades as listed below."

This gun comes NIB with the original ergo grip not installed. It currently sells on eBay alone for up to $75. I added the Sig panels with $13 stainless hex button head screws from TJ's Custom Gunworks. The older style panels fit my hand better. Sig ergo grip tool, Sig owners manual, and cable lock come with the sale. Also included are two new Sig branded factory 12 rnd. mags. I also have (hard to find) 3 more new factory 12 rnd. mags for $45 each if needed. This is a great configuration if you don't require all the tacticool features of a TacPac or railed model. Not alot of these non railed models floating around NIB. Checked Buds.com and several local dealers prior to this listing so I'm aware of whats out there currently. No trades, and cash gets the deal done! Buyer will need to meet me at a local FFL for the transfer. Buyer is responsible for his/her state background fee and any associated dealer transfer fees. Gun is for sale locally only. Sorry, no shipping or out of state sales at this time.  $700 firm!"
