The THOMPSON DRUM MACHINE GUN is an alternate version of the stick Thompson Machine Gun, invented by John T. Thompson in 1919, that became infamous during the Prohibition era. It was a common sight in the media of the time, being used by both law enforcement officers and criminals. The Thompson was also known informally as: the ""Tommy Gun"". The drum magazine provided significant firepower, but in military service it was found to be overly heavy and bulky, especially when working on patrol or on the run in battle. This weapon can be famously seen in movies such as The Untouchables, Mobsters, Watchmen and countless others.

I have enjoyed shooting this rifle immensely, and you will too, the weight, wonderful two-stage trigger and overall design make for a very pleasant shooter.  The straight pull bolt is very unique and the machining in the cam mechanism is just a work of art, made by Sig in ~1939, it was issued to a citizen-soldier, and still has that previous Swiss owner's info card under the buttplate.  It also includes what appears to be an original leather sling with related hardware.  All serial numbers match on this rifle and blueing wear is quite minimal.

I also have ammo/brass for this rifle:
-2x 60rd packs of GP-11 surplus Swiss ammo, this is match grade stuff, really!   
-4x 20rd boxes of Prvi Partizan 174gr softpoint.  This is boxer primed, shoots quite well   and is suitable for hunting.

The Timber Wolf is an upgraded version of Glock Gen 3 pistols. Nearly all of the internal parts are interchangeable, with the exception of the magazine release(which is obviously included). Additionally, I have an aluminum extended magazine well, which is not installed but can be very easily. Currently, the frame is set up for .40S&W/G22. It can be converted to 9mm by switching the .40 ejector or entire trigger housing to a 9mm ejector or trigger housing. 
This is an excerpt from the Lonewolf website:
The TimberWolf is intended as a direct replacement for your 3rd generation Glock frame or use it as the foundation to build your own custom Glock pistol.  It incorporates all of the most desirable features custom builders offer including: a choice of 2 quick change grips, rounded trigger guard, extended beaver tail, round mag catch, improved checkering, higher grip angle and improved rail system. 

Slap the slim grip on your new TimberWolf frame and you instantly have the smallest sculpted grip in the industry. No grip reduction can compete with this custom fit or feel. Many claim it is better than any double stack 1911 offered! Install the swelled grip and try to decide, is it an XD or a Sig. Either way, it takes less than a second to try them both.

This new, shooter friendly polymer replacement frame works with Gen3 Glock models: G/17, 17L, 22, 24, 31, 34, 35 and 37. The Timberwolf frame includes the basic parts unique to it: round mag catch and two grips. All remaining Gen3 Glock factory parts are standard ""fit and function""."

 The Tavor SAR Rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier. The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier. Among its advantages, its bull pup configuration- the rear center of gravity enables a rapid acquisition of the target and provides the ability to fire the weapon with one hand. The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material; therefore, it is very light. The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat. The Tavor is state of the art modern design weapon which includes modular picatinny rails. ""Flattop"" rails for multiple single line accessories and devices are also available. The Tavor SAR Rifle is a complete platform that comprises optical devices and other accessories, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the XXI century.

 The Tavor SAR Rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier. The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier. Among its advantages, its bull pup configuration- the rear center of gravity enables a rapid acquisition of the target and provides the ability to fire the weapon with one hand. The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material; therefore, it is very light. The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat. The Tavor is state of the art modern design weapon which includes modular picatinny rails. ""Flattop"" rails for multiple single line accessories and devices are also available. The Tavor SAR Rifle is a complete platform that comprises optical devices and other accessories, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the XXI century.

I am dowtown Orlando during days and Oviedo, nights and eves.
I bought on locally while mine was on backorder, now I have one too many.

I am not a dealer. These list for $495, I am selling for $400,used for one outing and cleaned.

This is for the Trigger, Selector switch, ATF letter, box, the whole package ready to go.

See below:

3MR   trigger functions in a standard semi-auto mode with a 4.5lb trigger when the safety switch is in the standard Fire position. When you switch the selector switch back to where full auto would be on an M4/M16 you get the same 4.5lb semi-auto trigger, and the action of the bolt resets the trigger for you. All you have to worry about is pulling the trigger for the next shot.

The build quality is superb. USA manufactured utilizing CNC and EDM processes to produce the parts. The quality control process is top notch.

TAC-CON says the trigger is capable of a 600 rounds per minute (RPM) rate of fire. Most shooters will   be in the 400-500 RPM range,   Short travel distance and assisted reset means you have to do very little movement with your trigger hand.

The principal designer was George Kelgren, formerly of the the Intratec and Grendel firearms companies. The PLR (Pistol, Long Range) was designed for recreational target shooting, and small game, varmint, or predator hunting.[1] Due to the PLR’s relatively short barrel, the 5.56 cartridge’s velocity is considerably reduced compared to its velocity from a longer barrel. The PLR-16 combines the multi-lug rotating bolt design and breech-locking system of the AR-15 with a gas piston system similar to that of the M-1 Garand, M-14, and AK-47.[1] This system requires less maintenance than the direct gas impingement system of the AR-15 platform. The PLR-16’s frame is constructed of reinforced polymer, making the pistol both durable and light-weight. The frame incorporates an M-1913-style Picatinny rail molded to the top of the receiver to accept various optical sights.[1] Kel-Tec produces an optional polymer forend with a Picatinny rail for mounting flashlights or laser sights.This gun has it all! >>>  INCLUDES - LARGE RED DOT (8 BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS) SIGHT FOR QUICK ACQUISITION - 150 LUMEN PUSH BUTTON TACH LIGHT - GREEN PUSH BUTTON LASER (5mW) - SQUID FOREARM WITH RAIL - SLANT FOREGRIP (VERTICLE NOT LEGAL ON A PISTOL) - (1) 30 ROUND METAL MAG - (1) SUREFIRE 60 ROUND DOUBLE STACK METAL MAGAZINE - SOFT CASE W/ 4 MAG POUCHES - CENTER CARRY SLING - DOOR KNOCKER FLASH HIDER - 100 ROUNDS OF 5.56 X 45 AMMO.

  This FN15 is brand new in the box and comes with a new Trijicon Tri Power sitting on top of a new LaRue Tactical LT150 QR mount. The weapon light is a Elzetta C Charlie 900 lumens weapon light. Check this light and Elzetta out on the web they call it the scorcher. Its the brightest light you have ever seen mounted to a weapon day or night. Last is the best part of this weapon it has a AIMSHOT LS8300 Laser. That's right LS8300 try to find or buy one of these. I did see one on GB about a month ago it sold for 859$. They are only sold to SOCOM and other SOF on military POs only. Check with Jeff at Aimshot in Atlanta to verify. They are no longer sold to even LE Agency's. You know if they want let the cops have them this is one Badass laser. You can follow the beam even before dark and after dark it looks like something from STAR WARS. Yes it will light a match and get you in trouble very fast especially out here on the lake at night. This one was sent to me by a good friend who is a SFO serving in Afghanistan. Comes with two tail caps and zero tool. One pressure and one click. This laser makes the rest of them look like junk! Thanks so much for looking and have a great weekend."

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round

Since 1959 the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on should they have to punch out over a remote area. Through the years the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game. 

Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5? long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.

When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

Less than 100 rounds through the pistol, has functioned flawlessly for me. The gun shoots very well and is very accurate. I could use some extra cash right now, so it’s time to let this one go.

If you need an inexpensive gun for home defense or maybe to keep in your car/truck, this may be what you’re looking for. Like all Hi-points, she’s a bit ugly, and definitely heavy, which helps to make it really easy to shoot those big .45 rounds. I’ve added a Hogue Handall slip-on rubber grip since the stock grips are a bit slippery – I find that grip makes it just right – easy to grip and very comfortable in the hand.

It’s in very good condition. I take good care of my guns. It’s clean and looks just like new.

Includes:
•	Hi-Point JHP .45acp pistol
•	(1) 9-round magazine

This handgun was recently serviced by Taurus, who provides a lifetime warranty on their firearms.  The grip and trigger were replaced, which fixed the ""mag-drop"".  Since then, I have had no problems with this gun whatsoever.

(A second magazine is included, but I recommend only using it to carry more ammo, as it appears to be starting to wear out.)

The PT140 is a double-action semi-auto .40 caliber pistol with stainless 3.5"" barrel and 3-dot sights.  It has a safety lever on the left side and uses an easier-than-usual takedown lever/pin.  It uses a polymer frame with blued steel slide.  Its low-printing sides make it an excellent choice for concealed carry, and its 10+1 capacity in powerful .40 caliber make it a great sidearm for daily carry.

---

I'm selling this gun to finance a business cost.  It has been a great reliable shooter.  I have another sidearm for myself, and I have to ""bite the bullet"" and sell it to make my bills.  I'll sell it fully loaded with FN ammo, 10 in each magazine and one in the chamber, the same way I've always carried it.  Sale will be private-party cash to VA resident.  Winchester, VA area but can travel a little bit for a buyer.

The front-sight post has an enlarged white dot for better sight acquisition. The SR9C has an underbarrel rail for easy mounting a light or laser. It has a reversible back strap with an arched side and a flat side, so shooters can adjust it for grip comfort. Its 10-round magazine fits plush with the grip, but it also has a 17-round magazine and a grip extension, so it feels like a full-size pistol. It also has an ambidextrous magazine release and safety.

This beauty is a Model 32 or as it is commonly referred to as the “terrier”. It is not chambered for 38 special but rather 38 S&W cartridges. It is not as common as the Model 36 . Pistol was made between 1957 and 1961. S&W started marking the model numbers on their guns in 1957 and went to a “M 32-1” in 1961. So this pistol is over 50 years old.
Perhaps the best and most senior gunsmith in the area, Mr. Carl J. O'Connor, has inspected this weapon and certified that it is in ""excellent condition.""
