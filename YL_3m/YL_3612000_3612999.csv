Don't let the brand fool you. The 24/7 Tactical was developed to compete for a military contract against all the top names in gun making. This model was in the finals when the military canceled the contract. This model is no longer made and has been replaced with the G2 model with only a 4in barrel. This is a great weapon with several unique features. 5.25in barrel, DA/SA mode yet a Striker Fire system. Decocker/safety and the ability to cycle the trigger repeatedly without racking the slide. Very unique for a striker fire system. Allows you to attempt firing again after a misfire. Easy take down, everything is similar to a Beretta and 1911 rolled into one with the plus of a striker fire system. 24/7 are becoming very sought after weapons. I have one in .45 and .40 that I will probably never sell. I got this one in a trade. I originally thought I would collect and hang on to these but decided not to keep the money tied up. Pick up a great weapon for just $425.00. See link below. May need to copy and paste.

Great rounds for home defense or self defense. Very Effective, and serrated with a twist to create most damage upon contact.   They are a brass Jacketed Hollow point.  

Golden Saber is a favorite of police forces around the country and one of the most trusted self-defense rounds available today. With Golden Saber high performance jacket (HPJ) handgun ammo, the driving band makes the difference bullet diameter directly ahead of the driving band is reduced from groove to bore diameter, so the bullet is precisely aligned before the driving band engages the rifling. The result: match grade accuracy and reduced barrel friction. The driving band locks the jacket and core together for maximum weight retention and core/jacket integrity."

The new Buffalo Bore Heavy 38 SPL+p ammo will maximize the effectiveness of your 38 SPL revolver. The powders are flash suppressed so as to not hinder your vision should you be required to drop the hammer in low light.

Item 20A/20 is the terrific SOFT lead semi wad cutter hollow cavity bullet, however we've added a gas check to stop the leading that this load typically causes with other manufacturers version of this bullet.

Item 20B/20 uses the low velocity (LV) Jacketed Hollow Point bullet that is designed to expand at as little as 800 fps, so you will get expansion out of very short barrels.

Whether you prefer the very soft semi wadcutter lead bullet, or a very soft JHC, (jacketed hollow cavity) these HVY 38 SPL+p loads will turbo charge your 38 SPL revolver.

The tactical reload: Short (2 to 2.5 inch) barreled revolvers have short ejectors. Those short ejectors typically used on 2 inch to 2.5 inch barreled revolvers are not long enough to fully eject 357 magnum brass. So if you are forced into a situation where you need to reload your weapon under fire, you will find yourself picking your fired/empty 357 brass out of the cylinder one at a time - this is very bad. On the other hand, 38SPL brass is shorter than 357 brass and those short ejectors will often fully eject 38SPL brass. We have experimented a great deal with short barreled revolvers and have found that 38SPL brass normally offers an advantage if you need to reload your ""snub nose"" revolver, in a hurry.

Check out the below velocities that I fired from my personal revolvers. We believe that real world, stock, ""over the counter"" guns, give real world results, so we don't advertise velocities that are fired from long test barrels.

These 38SPL+P loads are generating low-end 357 magnum, ballistics. If you have an older or more fragile 38SPL, or if you are recoil sensitive, consider using our HVY Standard Pressure 38SPL ammunition. It is safe to be fired in any 38SPL revolver and it still packs much more punch than ordinary 38SPL ammo.

Item 20A: 158gr., very soft cast, semi wad cutter, (Keith) hollow cavity, with a gas check. This bullet will mushroom violently on impact and will penetrate roughly 14 inches in human flesh. Again, this bullet is gas checked and will not lead your barrel.

Despite its small size, the P224 maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 11 rounds of 9mm and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.

Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in most subcompacts.

New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.

The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns.

The SIG Anti-Snag (SAS) model features a de-horned slide and frame, and the new ergonomically enhanced one-piece grip.  SIGLITE Night Sights will be standard in the Nitron® coated slide.

Can't say enough good things about these scopes. Awesome value for your money with some features you will find on much higher priced units. Crystal clear optics with very good light transmission & a very crisp Mil-Dot reticle. The side parallax adjustment lets you fine tune the clarity for various distances to get a crisp sight picture. Red & green reticle illumination works very nicely in low light conditions. I love these scopes so much that I purchased multiples for various builds. Only selling because I don't have an immediate need for this many. I have had zero issues with these scopes on rifles up through .308 WIN although I would not recommend putting this on something with more recoil than that.

Milled from one solid piece of aircraft grade aluminum to withstand constant heavy recoil

Para USA Black Ops 1911 .45 ACP
A serious all-stainless steel pistol for operators who want to put their 1911 to work.

For professional operators serving in law enforcement and military roles, the selection of a reliable sidearm is not a matter of luxury, but a necessity. With the needs of these working warriors in mind, Para USA has released the new Black Ops 1911 chambered in .45 ACP.

Pistol Features
The frame and slide of the single-action .45 ACP Black Ops pistol are both constructed of solid, reliable stainless steel. The frame's dust cover features a milled-in tactical rail for light and laser accessories. The slide is milled with front and rear cocking serrations and a flared ejection port.

Inside the slide you will find a full-length guide rod, match-grade barrel bushing and Para's Power Extractor. The slide assembly is topped off with front and rear combat style fixed metallic Trijicon night sights. The match-grade trigger is skeletonized and fitted with a factory-set over travel stop, and the flat mainspring housing features 25 lines-per-inch checkering. The hammer is skeletonized for a fast lock time. The grip panels are manufactured of tough, heavily textured black G10 and held in place with black hex-head screws.

External safeties include an ambidextrous thumb safety and a beavertail grip safety with a raised speed bump. Internal passive safeties include a disconnector to prevent the pistol from firing out of battery and a hammer half-cock to prevent an accidental discharge if the primary sear notch fails. To prevent the pistol from firing if dropped, the captured firing pin will not engage a cartridge primer unless it is struck by the hammer, and a firing pin block prevents the firing pin from moving forward unless the trigger is fully depressed. Two of PARA's Expert eight-round magazines are included in the hard case this pistol ships in.   

The entire Black Ops pistol is treated with an Ionbond satin black finish. It is approximately three times harder than chrome with a lower fiction coefficient. This includes the 5-inch match-grade barrel. If you really want to find out how tough a finish is, applying it to the barrel would be the way to find out since most barrels treated with bluing or other chemical treatments tend to show wear right away. The PK2 treated barrel on this pistol shows no visible wear after hundreds of rounds. As it turns out, former U.S. Army Sergeant and World Champion action shooter Travis Tomasie has put thousands of rounds down range through a barrel with this finish, and it still shows almost no indications of its rugged use.

Don't let the brand fool you. The 24/7 Tactical was developed to compete for a military contract against all the top names in gun making. This model was in the finals when the military canceled the contract. This model is no longer made and has been replaced with the G2 model with only a 4in barrel. This is a great weapon with several unique features. 5.25in barrel, DA/SA mode yet a Striker Fire system. Decocker/safety and the ability to cycle the trigger repeatedly without racking the slide. Very unique for a striker fire system. Allows you to attempt firing again after a misfire. Easy take down, everything is similar to a Beretta and 1911 rolled into one with the plus of a striker fire system. 24/7 are becoming very sought after weapons. I have one in .45 and .40 that I will probably never sell. I got this one in a trade. I originally thought I would collect and hang on to these but decided not to keep the money tied up. Pick up a great weapon for just $425.00. See link below. May need to copy and paste.

Price does not include NFA tax stamp or sales tax. We can assist you with the creation of a basic living trust for FREE! A living trust will ease the transfer process. Let us know if you have questions.

New for 2014, we've improved the best in class price/performance to implement changes you've asked for. The new Guardian 22 is shorter, stronger, and quieter. And we didn't change the price.

•The entire serialized registered part (not just a thread insert, like a few of our competitors) is now made of heat treated 17-4 precipitation hardened stainless steel, protecting your investment in case of a catastrophic failure of your silencer.
•A 316 stainless steel tube to handle your most abusive use.
•All baffles are encased K baffles, providing a ""tube within a tube"" for ease of cleaning and durability.
•The first baffle is stainless steel, with all other baffles constructed from aircraft grade 7075 Aluminum for strength and durability.
•Length and outside diameter have been reduced.
•Sound level reduction is improved over the earlier Guardian 22 model.
•Retail price unchanged at $199.
You could spend hundreds more for another .22 suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, upgradability, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Guardian 22 has it all.

Suppression
The Guardian 22 compares favorably to silencers costing two to three times as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible. The Guardian 22 utilizes encased K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest silencers available.

Maintenance
Just because you can take a silencer apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable silencers, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted extra money, on top of the price they charge. Or worse yet, you lose or misplace them.  Even if the tool worked, you can't get the silencer apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired.  As with all Huntertown Arms silencers, all it takes to disassemble your Guardian 22 is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, good strong set of jaws, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools are required. Ever.  Guardian 22 baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Guardian 22 core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.  With the Guardian 22 full user serviceability is a reality. We are so confident you will be able to service the Guardian 22 yourself we offer the only clean silencer guarantee in the industry. If your Guardian 22 gets so dirty you can't clean it yourself, send it back to us and we'll clean it for free. Yes, free. Who else makes such a guarantee? No one. How can we do this? Absolute faith in our product.

Upgradability
Your Guardian 22 can be upgraded at any time to the Guardian 22 SS or Guardian 22 Ti, giving you a path to the most capable rimfire silencer we offer.

Price does not include NFA tax stamp or sales tax. We can assist you with the creation of a basic living trust for FREE! A living trust will ease the transfer process. Let us know if you have questions.

New for 2014, we've improved the best in class price / performance and added an all stainless Guardian 22.

•The serialized registered part is now made of heat treated 17-4 grade precipitation hardened stainless steel, protecting your investment in case of a catastrophic failure of your silencer.
•A 316 stainless steel tube to handle the most abusive use.
•The baffles are encased K baffles, providing for ease of cleaning and durability.
•All seven baffles are made of stainless steel for unparalleled strength and durability.
•Sound level reduction is improved over the earlier Guardian 22 SS model.
•Retail price remains unchanged at $289.
You could spend hundreds more for another .22 suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, upgradability, longevity, or price, the Guardian SS 22 has it all.

Suppression
The Guardian 22 SS compares favorably to silencers costing two to three times as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible. The Guardian 22 utilizes encased K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest silencers available.

Maintenance
Just because you can take a silencer apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable silencers, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted extra money, on top of the price they charge. Or worse yet, you lose or misplace them.  Even if the tool worked, you can't get the silencer apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired.  As with all Huntertown Arms silencers, all it takes to disassemble your Guardian 22 SS is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, good strong set of jaws, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools are required. Ever.  Guardian 22 SS baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Guardian 22 core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.  With the Guardian 22 SS full user servicability is a reality. We are so confident you will be able to service your Guardian 22 SS yourself we offer the only clean silencer guarantee in the industry. If your Guardian 22 gets so dirty you can't clean it yourself, send it back to us and we'll clean it for free. Yes, free. Who else makes such a guarantee? No one. How can we do this? Absolute faith in our product.

Upgradability
Your Guardian 22 SS can be upgraded at any time to the Guardian 22 Ti, giving you a path to to most capable rimfire silencer we offer.

Incredible price point. Great suppression.
The Guardian 9 is an addition to our popular Guardian lineup of affordable suppressors. As with the Guardian 22, from The Guardian 9's earliest inception the goal was simple - create a great quality, affordable suppressor with best-in-class suppression. You could spend hundreds more for another 9mm suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, multi-caliber usage, upgradability, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Guardian 9 has it all.

Suppression
The Guardian 9 compares favorably to suppressors costing more than twice as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible at the most affordable price. The Guardian utilizes K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest suppressors available.

Maintenance
Just because you can take a suppressor apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable suppressors, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted an extra $50. Even if the tool worked, you can't get the suppressor apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired. And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.

Longevity
There are several features designed into the Guardian 9 to ensure safe and enjoyable use beyond a lifetime. Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. Our end caps are made of softer aluminum so that if there is an end cap strike, the end cap will give way causing minimal if any damage to the rest of your suppressor. The affected end cap, and any damaged baffles can be easily replaced without having to replace the entire core.

Multi-caliber
What's your caliber of choice? 9mm? 22LR? 22 WMR? 17HMR? Whatever it is, rest easy knowing your Guardian 9 was designed to handle the pressures generated.

Will also come with the original case, literature, and...holster thing (apparently Sig no longer ships these with a paddle holster, see pic).
Looking to make a trade for a Sig P239. .40 version preferred but would consider a 9 as well. Must be a DA/SA model. Would really like to make a deal for a Gen 2 SAS model. Doesn't have to be brand new but no beaters please. I can add some cash for the right deal. 
Otherwise would be willing to sell for $600 FIRM. I have just over $700 into this pistol with the grips and extra mag, and I will throw in some hollow points to fill both mags. I just lost my job and could use the money, so please no haggling- this is still a better price than you will find online or retail, especially after applicable tax and/or transfer/shipping fees.

I wish I didn't have to sell this, but money is tight and I'm taking a pretty big loss but as the saying goes, my loss is your gain so don't pass up this piece of Cold War Czechnology!

I'm asking for $700 cash or trade it for a complete M16A1-A2 upper, plus cash on your end.

Just to put what I spent into perspective, I've spent $500 including tax for the Remington 879 it's self. The brand new, steel folding stock is another $200. The new fore grip is based off the Surefire 618FA, which retails for $300 brand new. That's over 1k all together.

TIKKA T3 TAC
When it comes to accuracy, the Tikka T3 TAC is in a class of its own. The free-floating barrel is made of match-grade Cr-Mo steel, and manufactured by a precision cold-hammer forging process by Sako craftsmen. The action and the barrel surfaces are Manganese-phosphatized for lasting protection against the elements and wear. The barrel features protected muzzle threading, providing attachment for optional Sako muzzle brake or suppressor assembly.

The modern bolt has two front locking lugs and a spring-loaded reliable operation. The Teflon coating on the bolt ensures a non-reflecting surface and a smooth bolt throw. The 2-way safety behind the bolt handle locks both the bolt and the trigger. The trigger unit is adjustable with a hand-honed sear/trigger - without creep. A single set trigger is optional.

The Picatinny rail on top of the action takes any Weaver or U.S. Mil.Std 1913 compatible mounts. New phospatized Tikka Optilock bases and rings are recommended for maximum accuracy and ease of use.

The detachable straight-feeding single column magazine is silent, durable and non-rusting. The standard 5-round magazines are tailored to each caliber for ultimate reliability and performance.

The stock is made of fiberglass reinforced copolymer polypropylene and features an ambidextrous palm swell. The wide fore-end has a swivel stud to take a bipod. The three sides of the stock are fitted with inserts which allow the use of heavy duty hook-type sling swivels. The recoil pad is of black rubber and the length of pull may be adjusted with spacers. The cheek piece is adjustable at 5 mm intervals, up to 25 mm (1”).

Scope, scope mounts, bipod, muzzle brake and extra large bolt handles are optional, as well as are adjustable open sights and fore- and rear-stock fastened military type heavy duty sling studs for hook-type swivels.

This is the Stainless 44 mag with the ported muzzle brake.
Gun has great fully adjustable sights on it . White horseshoe outlines on the rear sight and blaze orange/red front sight. Sights are easy to pick up and stay focused on. 
These come with a very nice grip which is designed to be easy on the hand for magnum calibers. Probably the best feeling revolver grip I've ever felt, or shot.
The lock up on this gun is great and it shoots very good in either double, or single action.
Bud's sells these for 530.00 + shipping + FFL = $580.00.
You can get the plain blued model for under $500.00 + the rest.
Gun has had 5 boxes of ammo through it works and functions perfectly.
I have the pistol + 1 full box of ammo for it.
I'd like to have 450.00 OBO for the gun and ammo.
I have got set us to reload 9mm and 45acp this year so I'm culling out my other caliber pistols and trying to stick to those two.
This is a very nice shooting gun, I'm selling it to buy more reloading stuff, but might trade it for something in 9mm, or 45acp of equal value."
