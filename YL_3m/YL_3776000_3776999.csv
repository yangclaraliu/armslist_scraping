Leave it to Taurus to make the most heralded concealed carry semi-autos in company history even better.
For sale is a Taurus PT740 handgun.  Comes in factory box with one wire brush for bore cleaning.  This is an excellent concealed carry weapon,  and is only 19 ounces(empty magazine). The handgun capacity is (6)+1, >100 Rounds fired in it's lifetime with not a single FT(Failure to)FEED, FTFIRE or FTEJECT.  The magazine is very easy to reload, and has been kept empty for the majority of the time I have owned it, to keep the spring in excellent condition. There are magazines with grip extensions available for this firearm. There are also 8 round magazines for the PT740 on the market, but currently none are OEM.
This firearm has a polymer grips suited for medium to small hands. For a compact pistol, the sights on the 740 are very good. They use a typical three-dot arrangement, and the rear sight is fully adjustable for windage and elevation. 
Field stripping the pistol is similar to that of a Glock pistol. Partially retract the slide and pull down on both sides of the bar located in the frame above the trigger. Once the bar is down, the slide can be pushed forward and off of the gun. It has been cleaned and lubricated to prepare this for sale. 
Please note: The Taurus Unlimited Lifetime Repair Policy™ is just that. The lifetime of the gun...not the buyer. This is the first warranty of its type in the industry. No other manufacturer has the confidence to extend this kind of offer.

This listing is for FIVE Boxes, a total of 125 cartridges or rounds. Buyers may take any number of 5 box lots we have on hand at the same per-box price and with no additional shipping charges. Do the math. Remington gives you more value for your money than the imported rounds; their Golden Sabre brand comes 25 to the box, not 20 like everyone else’s. Here is Remington's unmatched high performance load for the .357 Magnum, its Golden Saber 125 grain Bronze Jacketed Hollowpoint. Here is what Remington says about the Golden Saber line: Golden Saber high performance jacket handgun ammo, the driving band makes the difference bullet diameter directly ahead of the driving band is reduced from groove to bore diameter, so the bullet is precisely aligned before the driving band engages the rifling. The result: match grade accuracy and reduced barrel friction. The driving band locks the jacket and core together for maximum weight retention and core/jacket integrity. This load is the 125 grain BJHP Load, Bronze Jacketed Hollow Point. It clocks out of a 6 inch Ruger GP-100 at 1220 fps, and delivers 413 foot pounds of energy at the muzzle. These cartridges come 25 rounds to the box. Normal retail pricing on these is $40.00 per box. Similar loads from competitors sell at $1.50 or more per cartridge; ours are only 63 cents per cartridge. We're offering what few we have in Five Box lots at only $15.80 per 25 round box. Buy 5 boxes, 125 rounds, for only $ 79.00. $15.00 flat fee shipping lower 48 for the whole order.

The big thing is the old computer system will not let you tune it to get all the power out of all these parts so this was done

The entire wiring system was taken out and new wiring that had ( MAF) mass air flow system was installed, and the computer was burnt for all of the extras to run perfect

Then the E40D transmission need a computer to run with the new system, so I got a ford racing development to make one for the exact truck and its extras, you can hook it to a computer and change when it shifts up or down for every mile and hour. Not like the cheap add on computers.

It runs -shifts-brakes and drives EXCELLENT 

It gets 11mpg in the city

Its very quick, when I ordered all the parts from summit racing they said it should have about 375HP

584,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3776584,For Sale:  Winchester Model 100 .243 Semiauto,"Santa Fe, NM, New Mexico, United States",$ 475,"Listed On: Thursday, December 4, 2014",Rifles,Winchester                                                                                ,243 Winchester                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I bought this rifle a couple of days ago to help out a young man where I work. I really like it, but have absolutely no use for it since I have plenty of hunting rifles. This one was made in 1967. Has the rolled-in basket weave stock. Other than doing this instead of checkering, Winchester didn't cheapen it up after 1964. The rifle's internals looked about new when I disassembled it. Bore is perfect and there has never been any rust on it anywhere. It still has its original front sight hood. This is a lot less common than the .308 version of the Model 100.

 Here are the negatives: There are a small amount of scratches on the left side of the stock above the trigger guard. The stock is oil finished so they look pretty good, but can be cleaned up. There are a couple of hairline scratches in top of the barrel near the front sight. Hard to see, but I tried to photograph them. 

 Now for the positives. I completely disassembled the rifle to clean it and to check if the firing pin recall has been done. It still has its original firing pin. If you want to replace it, Winchester/Olin is still honoring their recall, and will send you an updated pin plus a check for $30 if you send them the original. The stock is solid with no cracks and it still has its original butt plate in place. These don't need a recoil pad, especially in .243, since they are a ""soft shooting"" gas operated semi. Most I have seen have an aftermarket pad. Lol, it feels about like a Ruger 10/22 in the hand. I think it's an attractive, lightweight hunting rifle.

 Other than what was noted above, the metal is in terrific shape, and would rate at least 95%. The trigger is particularly nice in comparison to others I have owned in the past. it should make a fine hunting rifle, especially for a youngster or a lady hunter. It already has a one piece scope base installed, so it will be easy to mount a scope. I have a spare never-mounted Leupold 3-9 Rifleman scope you can have for an extra $125 that I can include if you want it. I haven't bought rings for it in case you want to choose your own scope height or see-through rings.

 I think I am at the low end of the price range on this, judging from what I am seeing on Gunbroker. These rifles in .243 are bringing much more than the same ones in .308.

I've shot around 300 rounds and haven't had a misfire yet. I'm pretty set on the price and I am not interested in any trades. Will need to exchange at Metro Police Station. Thanks

TF-17


Like their other magnum rifles, the TF Rifle features a blowback design. However, in order to help handle the increased pressure of the 17 HMR and 22 WMR rounds, the TF Rifle also utilizes a precision engineered and machined counterweight system attached to our CNC-machined steel bolt. This eliminates the need to use more expensive alloys in the bolt. The weight is located in front of the receiver and concealed in the stock.

Our TF Rifle also includes the same TG2000 trigger unit – a Volquartsen exclusive – tuned to a crisp, clean 2.25lb trigger pull. The rifle sports a black matte coated stainless steel bull barrel.

We also modified the factory sights and threaded the muzzle of the gun so we could install a US Made copy of a Bulgarian brake for better handling. While the factory sights do not have an indexing pin, we used the threading to index the brake.

Cabela's offered $960 for it and they only pay 60% of value which puts this one at $1600+. A quick search online shows nice condition ones sell for$1600-$2200. I don't have a license to ship so I wanted to sell to someone locally private party.

This was manufactured in 1942 so it's right in the heart of WWII - very rare in this condition. Barrel has perfect rifling, and shows almost zero wear around the muzzle. See the photos this is not some heavily used, well worn or redone rifle.  This is original with almost no wear on even the slide of the pump.  

All wood is in beautiful condition. The original Winchester bakelite buttplate - most of these have replacement buttplates since they would crack or break during use.  

This is collector quality - check out this one at Cabelas for $1399 and its not nearly as nice as the one I have listed!

Overall condition of the gun is good, with some wear marks from use on the metal and plastic, and the only noticeable wear is a 1"" series of scratches marks under the receive inside the pistol grip (have no idea what it is from, and it is not noticeable at all unless the gun is turned upside down and you are looking next to the trigger), but it is defiinitely mechanically great (I ran 200 rounds of mixed types of ammo through it since i got it used from somebody else, ZERO malfunctions and this gun is very accurate for a ak) and looks great as well. 

Im asking 650 OBO for the whole setup, and only trades im interested in is a Glock 19 gen 3 in very good to like new shape (and unless it comes with lots of extras, I will need some cash as well). This is fantastic rifle that comes with features that are seen on 900-1200 Ak rifles, so this gun is priced to sell. 

You can contact me at REDACTED, I will more than likely be at the gun show as well this weekend as well to sell this if it is still available along with a few other items but DO NOT WAIT as I could sell it before then. Thank you!

P.S. Im listing links below to give you a idea of the guns worth if you bought everything new, do NOT troll me with BS emails or texts about getting something cheaper elsewhere, I research my stuff and have had years of experience selling firearms on the retail and personal end of it. Also, Im only willing to travel in the NIXA/SPRINGFIELD area, and if we meet up, you are agreeing to PURCHASE said item, not to just ""Look"" at it. If you need more pics or whatever, just let me know. I dont want to waste your time and I dont want you to waste mine. thank you again.

They were built in 1987 or 88.  I think Hexcel quit selling skis to the public a few years earlier.  Both sets are 185cm.  Both sets are serialized.  Both sets are silk screen signed by Hub Zemke, the original Hexcel ski builder who built these.  In their day, there was nothing lighter weight at any price.

These are new, never used but they have been in a downstairs storage room and not boxed.  I took a couple pictures of the first two dug out of storage.  The under-side is blue color and flat with no center groove.  They have no damage except maybe a few light small scuffs from storage over the years.  I'm just cleaning up and know I am too old to want to ski again, so they are going.

Hoping this ad finds a ski buff / collector.  I boughg them from Hexcel when working there.

The price requested is the total price for both pairs of skis.  If you pay the shipping, I'll cover the boxing / UPS them to you."

Overall condition of the gun is like new, with no noticeable wear marks anywhere on the gun, and this gun was purchased new by me (the only owner) and have put exactly 165 rounds through it since purchase.

This gun is superb and quite frankly hard to find around this area, I ended ordering online because the only one I could find was a beat up one at a local gun shop for 589 plus tax that came with only two magazines. This gun is unique because it is the first true nato approved handgun that is issued a nato stocking number that was available to the public (the M9 came out 5 years later to the public), and look up the nato qualifications for this handgun, it went through hell to get approved.

The whole package is priced at the low ball price of 600 OBO, as the gun normally only comes with two mags new and I purchased the other mags since owning it. You can contact me at REDACTED. I will most likely be attending the gun show this weekend, but DO NOT WAIT if you are interested in it, as it could be sold by then. The only trade im looking for at the moment is a Glock 19 gen 3 in very good to like new condition (by default, I will consider the 19 as partial trade with a little bit of cash unless it comes with some extras). Thank you

P.S. Im listing links below to give you a idea of the guns worth if you bought everything new, do NOT troll me with BS emails or texts about getting something cheaper elsewhere, I research my stuff and have had years of experience selling firearms on the retail and personal end of it. Also, Im only willing to travel in the NIXA/SPRINGFIELD area, and if we meet up, you are agreeing to PURCHASE said item, not to just ""Look"" at it. If you need more pics or whatever, just let me know. I dont want to waste your time and I dont want you to waste mine. thank you again.
