The rail system is UTG and is one-piece that comes off easily and is made for a mini, as itslides rigth over the front of the barrel/stock.

The serial numbers start with 186-630xxx indicating that this is the model run from 1991-1999 I believe and this gun was made in 97/98.

Take off the stock and the true ""mini"" is in incredible shape. The last two pics show the internal front and back of the chamber and I couldn't get my camera to take a decent pic of the inside of the barrel but it is bright, shiny and the rifling is great. The gun shoots perfectly. The action is smooth and crisp. The magazine go in tight and crisp and snaps right into place, where I've had other minis that you fought with the darn thing to get it in there.

The barrel and top of the gun are very very clean and the only blemishes on the thing are a couple nicks on the suppressor and the stock has use marks.

This would be a perfect gun to throw an optic on and use as it is or to take off the stock and rails, sell them, and build whatever you want. I'd put a tactical folding stock on it from tapco or some other brand and just use a regular scope mount with a 3-9x30 myself. Or one could just put a nice red dot on the upper rail of this setup and go.

Anyhow, I hope this better explains the gun. I wish I had the original stock for it, but I don't. The nice thing about these mini's is that there are hundreds of cheap things that can be done to customize them on ebay, amazon and all over. Or if someone wanted a cheap really light mini, take off the rails in about 5 minutes and use the peep sights and go spray some lead at the coyotes.

$500 and thanks for looking.

The Industry Standard.
 The LT104 is the best mount made for attaching high-power riflescopes onto flattop-style AR15's, period.

 The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.

 The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.

 Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.

 Assembly and adjustment only takes a few minutes, then off to the range."

From Burris:
The Burris AR-332 is perfect for quick shooting at point-blank to intermediate ranges. 3X magnification plus the Ballistic CQ reticle provide for instinctive target acquisition. The black reticle is etched directly onto the prism with red and green light illumination available with the turn of a dial. Reticle dots correspond to bullet drop from 5.56 or 7.62 rounds, however this tough optic is built to handle much heavier recoil if needed.

The AR-332 is designed for reliability under harsh use, with hand-fitted internals and exacting tolerances. The Burris Forever Warranty protects you and your optic from anything you can throw at it.

I'm putting a feeler out there for my like-new Sig P938 Scorpion. The gun was picked up just last month around Thanksgiving and has only had around 50 rounds put through it. I've had zero malfunctions out of the box and the gun is dead accurate, which for such a small pocket pistol is truly amazing. I honestly love this pistol and will probably regret selling this later however my interest has gone in another direction currently.

The Scorpion P938 is the only version of the P938 line that comes fully cerakoted from factory with SIGLITE night sights and G10 grips. The pistol also includes 2 magazines; one 6rd flush-fit mag and one 7rd mag with pinky extension. 

This is an EXCELLENT CCW pistol that combines the quality feel and accuracy of a 1911 but without the reliability issues that come along with subcompact 1911's. You won't be disappointed with it.

Included:
* Sig P938 Scorpion
* Sig Sauer Case
* Small Carry Holster
* (1) 7rd Mag w/ Pinky Extension
* (1) 6rd Flush-Fit Mag
* All standard box goodies

The straight-line construction, coupled with the low recoil of 9mm ammunition, provides highly accurate fire with less muzzle climb. Less recoil also facilitates ease of training and improves accuracy. Finally, operation and training for the Colt 9mm is similar to that for the Colt AR-15 rifle, simplifying user training substantially.

Face to Face only must have Pistol Purchase Permit or CCW - We can meet at Blackstone Shooting Range if you're serious about buying it you can shoot it there and we'l make a deal. I would like to move this quickly but I can't give it away, 4 Genuine HK Mags are $$$

Price is pretty firm but I'd like this to go to a good home, it has never had a malfunction aside from a bad primer. Of course it's an HK. I think that says enough.

Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

The Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories.

The famous Winchester Model 1912 pump shotgun was designed by Winchester's Thomas C. Johnson. Introduced in 20 gauge in 1912, 16 and 12 gauge guns followed in 1914. From its debut until the end of the 1950's, the Winchester Model 1912 was the pump shotgun, long known as ""the perfect repeater."" After 1919, the model designation was shortened to ""Model 12,"" but the gun remained the same. Oh, sure, Ithaca, Stevens and Remington guns had their fans, but it was Winchester's Model 12 that dominated both the market and the public consciousness for decades. However, by the beginning of the 1960's, the times were a changin', to paraphrase Bob Dylan.

This is why the pre-64s are so sought after especially when you have a Georgia Peach this sweet my 12 boasts the 28 inch barrel, Full Choke, beutifull wood no scatches or knicks, the finish has been well kept and the blueing is phenomanal.
I have never held a Model 12 in my hand that is over 50 years old almost 60 years old and looks and feels as if it was just made. This with out a doubt a safe queen the bore and action are spotless and tight there are no flaws or no suprises when looking/getting this gun in your hands this is the Winchester of a lifetime and will be a prize in anyones collection. The SN# is 150XXXX Which dates it at 1954/55 production right inbetween there, sorry this is a NO TRADE SALE, I will ship to FFL one must be provided to me before i ship and i will only accept a POSTAL MONEY ORDER if your out of state no exceptions. ALL OTHER LAWS APPLY please email me for more pics or any questions whatsoever!! Thanks for looking please ck my other listings."

In the late 1920s Police wanted more power in a handgun. S&W chambered their large N-frame revolver in .38 Special and Remington developed a high velocity .38 Special cartridge firing a 158gr LRN bullet at 1180 fps. The ammunition was known by several names: .38 Hi-Speed, .38 High Velocity, .38 Super Police depending on who made it. In 1935 the case was slightly lengthen and the .357 Magnum was born. These large frame revolvers are a pleasure to shoot with standard .38 Special ammunition and the S&W .38/44 HD was a popular seller right up until it was discontinued as the Model 20 in 1966.
This is a nice example of the Pre-War Heavy Duty Made in 1934. The bore and chambers are excellent and as well as timing and lock up. The gun was refinished at some point and the new finish does show some wear from normal use. The stocks are not original and are of later manufacture. If not for the refinish and stocks, this gun would be worth twice what I'm asking. 
This gun has NOT been altered to chamber .357 magnum ammunition.
Its still an excellent example of an early Heavy Duty and a fine shooter.

Firm on the price. 

As you can see it has a very good utility blade shape, and will perform equally well in a diverse selection of uses. Although not a geometric Tanto shape, this modern tip design is among the strongest configurations available today.

The 4.5"" full-tang blade is ground from 154CM stainless steel and features a false edge that lightens the blade without sacrificing tip strength. The Blades are BK1 coated - Benchmade's proprietary blade coating offering excellent corrosion resistance, which exceeds the ASTM-117 specification for saltwater corrosion resistance. BK1 is a poly-ceramic coating (a blend of polymers and ceramic). It's thinner than the previous blade coating BT2, has equal to or better corrosion resistance (exceeding the ASTM salt spray standard) and unlike BT2 has much better wear resistance due to the ceramic. Additionally they have integrated a series of positive indexing notches in the spine for sure-grip blade control.

One of the most important features of any fixed blade should be the sheath, and this one is no exception. The sheath may also be carried inside, or outside, the waistband. The versatility of the knife and its sheath design allows for carry and use in nearly any application that warrants a tough, mid-sized fixed blade."

Colt Defense - Roll Mark Change
.
August 5, 2011 at 1:38pm

Colt Defense is discontinuing the use of the LE “restricted to Military and Law Enforcement” roll mark. As soon as existing production runs are complete, models previously roll marked as LE6920 and LE6940 will be roll marked as SP6920 and SP6940. This change applies immediately to all new orders. In addition, existing orders will be filled with rifles marked with the new model numbers as soon as the LE roll marked inventory has been manufactured and shipped.
Accordingly, proceeding from this date forward, all orders for LE6920’s and LE6940’s will be entered as SP6920’s and SP6940’s respectively.

called it the ""finest defensive handgun in the world today"" that was long ago

I have installed once, perfect fit, perfect cheek weld, very good quality. Took the stock off and changed the whole AR15 to Magpul gear.
This stock is a quick swap for your AR15 fixed rifle length stock. No additional parts are needed. It just slips over your already installed buffer tube and comes with its own appropriately sized screws. Ace states this stock is made for Commercial and Mil-Spec buffer tubes, I installed it on my Bushmaster AR15 and it was a perfect fit. The stock is still new, basically, it was installed and then the rifle was bagged, never taken outside or shot. Pulled it back out of the bag 90 days later and changed all the furniture to Magpul. They are $90 plus dollars shipped, I will take $50.00 cash."

New, Unfired -- The Beowulf ""Thumper"" ... I got it but have not had a chance to fire it and need to pass it on to someone who'll use it.  I have the AA tags, papers, one factory mag (still in the wrapper) and all.

The pictures show what you're getting.  This is an upgraded Alexander Arms upper with a threaded barrel and a AA installed ""tank baffle"" flash hider / suppressor already installed ... reduces the recoil of this beast and adds to the sexy look.  The tank baffle on the Wulf is exactly what everybody wants and took me months to order from AA.  I ordered this from AA but, while I was waiting for it, I bought another Wulf from a dealer so I'm going to sell this one.  Literally, it arrived today ... AA inspection tag still on it.

It comes with a completely Magpul dressed PSA multi-caliber lower ... all dressed in black ... with MagPul pop-up sights installed.  I also installed a single-point sling mount on the lower.

AA books and I can throw in a couple of mags, it helps.  I even have a four-round mag that you'll need in most places to legally hunt, and I'll throw that in too.  I also have some AA Wulf ammo that I can help you with separately, because no one local carries it ... it must be mail ordered.

So ... Let's make a deal.  Prefer FTF and cash but will ship via my FFL at costs.  Local ... VA ID, 21+, and BoS paperwork required."

Selling my Colt Sistema. It dates to 1959. A nice solid post war copy. Probably used in an Argentine poilce force as well as it has the secondary serial next to the main one. Typical re-arsenaled finish from when it was imported. Has normal wear. Frame matches slide. Barrel is unmarked. 
Slide sits slightly forward on frame, so it might need to be fitted/checked for headspace. But the slidelock/safety work fine.

I have not fired this gun.

Barrel is ""dark"" but shouldn't effect accuracy.
