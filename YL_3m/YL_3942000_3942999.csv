Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance.

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately."

Up for sale today is a complete 10.5 Hardened Arms Upper. This upper is in flawless condition, and was only used for 5 rounds as a test. My current builds use the 16 inch and a 7.5 inch version. Which I can show pictures if you would like or videos of it in action. In addition I still have the invoice of when I purchase it if that is of any importance. 

This upper can shoot 5.56 and of course the .223 rifle caliber. 

-Hardened Arms M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
-Black anodized mil-spec finished upper receiver
-Feed ramps for increased feeding reliability on barrel and upper
-High End Chrome Moly Barrel
-Melonited barrel finish (harder and more durable than chrome)
-Chambered in 5.56 (will also fire .223 ammo)
-10.5"" M4 Profile barrel with M4 Extension
-1/7 Barrel Twist
-.750"" diameter at gas block
-1/2x28 threaded muzzle/barrel
-Low profile gas block
-Barrel dimpled to secure gas block

I am asking for 280 for this complete upper. 

Since this is not a firearm, I would be able to sell it to just about any resident in the state of Virginia, just because this advertising service is meant to be for residents in the state of Virginia. 

Also I will NOT ship to you. Sorry, I just want a fast and quick transfer of parts. 

EXTRAS:

In addition, if you are looking for a Bolt Carrier Group and a Charge Handle, I do have them somewhere in my house. I will be asking for 100 for these. The Bolt Carrier Group is an AIM surplus product which runs about 100 itself and the Charge Handle is just a basic Rock River rifle charge handle. 

Another service I can provide is a complete lower if needed. For 210 I can make you a complete pistol lower that can work with this. It will be an Anderson Manufacturing Lower, Spikes Lower Parts Kit and Basic Pistol Buffer Tube."

Yes...it has double hammers, and double triggers. Apparently designed for SASS or other Old West Tactical Operations, where one fast follow up shot is required...like stopping stampedes, and calming rowdy saloons and whatnot.

 I bought it in a whim at a gun shop in Tombstone (Spangenberg's) and discovered that I have absolutely NO use for it. The steel is really good, and the hardwood stocks feel like iron. It's amazingly high quality...but after exactly one trip to the PD range, and 12 rounds through it, it went back into the dust collection box (the gun safe) and it has remained there for over TWO years. Honestly, I have no use for it. I will throw in between 50 and 100 rounds of 12Ga.

Product Information:

CCI is known for making some of the best rimfire ammunition on the market and the Quiet-22 ammunition is no exception. This quiet round produces a report that is 1/4 the perceived noise level compared to standard velocity 22 Long Rifle rounds; making this round perfect for backyard plinking, youth shooting, or shooting in areas where noise may be a concern. This round is ideal for shooters using bolt-actions or single shot rifles (but is perfectly safe in semi-automatics although it might not completely cycle the action). This subsonic ammunition is a perfect choice for shooting through your favorite rimfire suppressor. CCI Quiet ammunition is new production and non-corrosive.

Kimber Tactical Pro II.

I purchased this new a few years back and haven't used it enough to justify keeping it.
I am concentrating on long guns now. In excellent condition. Comes in original box with all the original paperwork, and the original factory magazine.
I prefer cash face to face with a bill of sale, but if you need me to ship it we can do an ffl transfer through my local gun shop to yours.
You pay for the shipping and the ffl transfer.

Call me if you have any more questions.

 The SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.
The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.

This 1911 is a 3inch model. It comes from the Kimber custom shop with a match trigger, barrel, digital cammo crimson trace grips, night sights, aluminum alloy frame, etc. It is a smooth piece. top of the line from Kimber 's custom shop. I have about 1500 rounds of high quality ammo through this one, including federal hydrashox as it is one of my edc guns. 

Pros: The MSRP is 1,657, SAS in Bakersfield is selling one now for 1525, if you are lucky you might find a new one on the internet for about 1300. So if you wanted one but couldn't afford it, this is your chance.
It is in functionally good shape, slight cosmetic issues described below.
as this is my edc gun I have never molested any internal parts. No polishing feed ramps etc. It is factory.
tritium still glows

Cons: I carry this gun frequently in a crossbreed holster and after many draws, it is showing holster wear on the front of the slide (see pics)
The mag well has a few small chips in the coating from magazine reloading. 
I had a couple failures to go into battery on break in with the stock mag. I have since purchased a kimber tac mag that works much better. Since then I don't trust the stock mag. But it comes with the gun anyway.

This really is a neat gun at an excellent price. Selling due to my excessive need in wanting to purchase other guns. 800.00 OBO

Will consider trading for a next to new  glock 26 (plus 200 cash or goodies) or M&P 9c plus cash or goodies). Might consider a railed full sized sig 1911 unmolested in comparable condition to my Kimber.

I'm selling it to pay off some debt before my girlfriend and I buy into a house. I am the second owner of this pistol. It has 300 rounds through and is in excellent shape. Aside from the fact that this pistol is visually attractive, it has a very unique history. I have a very close friend that worked as a higher up at Sig Sauer and worked with new models and did TE with them. This pistol (according to him) is one of 5 used as a prototype for the scorpion series of pistols. Which I though was really cool. I have more information on it, but I'm trying not to write a book here. This pistol has one of the nicest double action/single action triggers I've ever felt on a sig. It will come with two magazines, a manuel and lock. I don't have a box since this pistol wasn't supposed to have been sold to the general public. Thos is your chance to own a really sweet shooter with a little bit of sig history. Don't miss out, it will go quick. price is non negotiable. I'm NOT interested in trades. Cash only.

This carbine has zero rust, excellent rifling, and has only been shot by one owner (me) about 100 times to sight it in. It has been recently expertly restored, there isn't a drop of cosmoline on it. All parts matching. Functions flawlessly, it has been sighted in to 100 yards via iron sights. Comes with sling and bayonet. NO RUST. The bore is bright, the lands and grooves look great, no pitting. Bolt works outstandingly, very crisp trigger and smooth bolt action, whole rifle in excellent condition. Bore is shiny and rifling great. Has not been counter bored. ALL PARTS ARE MATCHING.

TL;DR, this is a fantastic, POWERFUL rifle. These rifles are hard to find with Russian import bans, so get a great Mosin Nagant carbine!

I am also willing to sell as much surplus 7.62x54R ammo as you want with it at a reasonable price. Up to a crate. That's 880 rounds ready to go.

Why spend money on a modern hunting rifle, I.e. a bolt action in .308, 30-06, etc where the rifle costs 599 and the ammo is a dollar a round when you can have a Mosin Nagant for half the price and shoot all day with ammo that is ballistically identical to .308 but a third the price?!

They were first exported in 1938 when Brazil ordered 25,000 pistols and there were many more US 1917 models produced. The bore is excellent and has the original wood grips. There are no visible import marks but there may be one under the grips, which I have never removed. Some shooters prefer the Brazilian model because the rear sight has a squared off cross section, rather than an arched one like the US 1917, and has a better sight picture. It is chambered for the venerable 45 ACP cartridge utilizing moon clips. One can also fire it without clips as the cylinder has a shoulder for head space. Thank you for your interest.

Some of the features include:

* Smoothed and rounded edges on the slide which helps with reholstering and defends against snagging.

* A loaded chamber indicator which shows you that there's a round in the chamber. 

* A fully adjustable for windage and elevation 3 dot sight system.

* A Glock like tigger Safe Action trigger safety.

* A manual thumb safety.

* An accessory rail (should you choose to add a flashlight and/or laser).

* An aggressively textured grips that aid in keeping the pistol in your hand.

* Restrike capability which allows you to pull the trigger a second time without the slide needed to be racked. This gives to option to attempt to fire a bullet for a second time if there was a light primer strike. 

* Has restrike capability. It normally operates as a conventional Single Action system e.g. every time the slide cycles it pre-cocks the firing pin. If an ammunition failure occurs and a misfire happens, the system automatically goes to a double action condition allowing you to fire again by pulling the trigger (double action), with no need to cycle the slide manually.

*  Disassembly/reassembly  is also extremely quick, easy, and does not require any tools or elbow grease. 

* 12 + 1 round capacity in a compact light 22 once frame.  The PT111 G2 is a double stack magazine that's similar in sight and weighs only 3 more ounces than the M&P Shield, but gives you 4-5 extra rounds compared to the Shield.  IMHO, excellent ergonomics are also excellent.

* Comes standard with magazine pinky extension which gives you a full 3 finger grip.

* Comes with a lifetime factory warranty.

This gun is slightly used and in excellent condition. 
The first of the many recent additions to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 and incorporate features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” model.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.

Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.

With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 – 8.5 pounds (27.5 – 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7N).

The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.

A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.

Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines.

A limited edition P2000 German Police Model features a “closed” accessory mounting rail system and a tapered trigger guard.
