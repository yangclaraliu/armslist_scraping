Looking to sell my Ruger GP-100. Stainless steel polished throughout to a nice shine. Original pebbled rubber grips. 3"" barrel, 6 shot, .357 magnum, fixed sights. Box, lock, and manual.

It has a Wolff Reduced Power #10 hammer spring and 8# trigger return spring installed, as well as internal contact/friction points honed and polished. Far smoother DA trigger pull than the factory 14# and a crisp ""hair trigger"" in single action. I estimate it at about 1.5-2.5# but have not had it guaged. Original springs as well as the rest of the Wolff kit (9#, 12# hammer & 10# trigger return) will be included so you can change it to your liking or go back to factory weight.

Also, including in the sale is my ammo for it.
   200rds - 38spl Winchester (white box) 150gr LRN
   144rds - 38spl Winchester (white box) 130gr FMJ (sorry, shot a couple, but the cases are back in the box for any reloaders)
   250rds - .357mag Federal 158gr LSP
   80rds - .357mag PMC Gold Starfire 150gr SFHP Hollow Points

There's over $400 worth of ammo (current retail value) and the gun alone is roughly worth $600+. I was thinking around the $900 range. Feel free to give a reasonable offer, considering what you're getting.

Back story:

Purchased from an older gentleman who was a collector and not a shooter. I bought it as a deer rifle and have only owned it for two years. I have only shot about 40 rounds through it, enough to put groups of 1"" at 200 yards. Once I got it sighted and had a little fun with it I put it away in the closet and have not had a chance to take it out again. Very rarely handled and in great shape. Paint is removable.

Looking to sell entire package but will separate rifle individually for the right offer.

Make offer, more pictures are available. Available to show and meet if not too unreasonable.

Rifle has all original sights and has never been repaired or refinished. Functions properly and shoots like a dream, almost impossible to ever find one in this condition. 1932 Model year yet it retains very strong original blue and wood finish and has an excellent shiny bore. There are a few bumps from handling and a couple random scratches but nothing notable enough to mention separately. I have seen many of these over the years but never one this nice that hasn't been refinished. Included with this auction is an original ad from Hunting and Fishing Magazine, Feb. 1934, just an awesome compliment to such a rare rifle. 

 Note I am very particular about my photos and the gun does honestly look better in person, I use the most revealing lighting so there isn't any surprises. Don't let this one get away. 

I am really wanting a Tavor, SCAR 17s, SCAR 16, FS2000, 5.7x28 (either five seven pistol or any variant of the rifle) or a MSAR or Steyr Aug, but I am truly open to hear all offers. I would consider a high end AK47 or multiple guns. Quality night vision is always a plus such as AN/PVS-22 , AN/PVS-18 , AN/PVS-14 or similar. I am also specifically looking for thermal such as PAS/23, MTM-IR or PAS/13G. I can add cash or other items, please look at my listings if interested and please do not be afraid to offer, if I am interested I will let you know, I don't blow smoke.

Its had about 10 rounds through it, taken to the range once to sight in the scope, and has been sitting in a rifle bag in the closet since then.  Paid $700 for the combo (gun and scope) new. It was for my wife and she has authorized me to sell it and buy something I would use.  Was going to give it to my son but we moved West were hunting SUCKS.  Its basically a new rifle, and a new scope. Has a sling and rifle bag.

It has a fluted bolt for speed and smoothness, a pillar bedded stock for accuracy and recessed ""target style"" muzzle crown. I mean this felt almost as good on my shoulder and finger as my classic Remington 700 that I won’t ever betray.  Recoil is great with the Soft-Tech™ recoil pad, and it has an adjustable trigger (PRO FIRE tm) but I felt like adjustments were not necessary.  It also has a 2 position safety and red cocking indicator.  Reviews for the rifle are outstanding.. best budget gun you can buy."

You can make the pistol into a full size, compact or subcompact.  You can make it a .45, 40, .357 Sig, 9mm, or .380.   Best of all, it is a Sig to its core.  It is solid, well designed and accurate. In the late 80's, I fired an early DAO pistol from another company and immediately swore I would never own one.  The P250 changed my mind in 10 rounds.

You can put a compact slide on a subcompact frame and make a really good sized carry gun. 

I have other parts for the P250 and if you have a fire-control module, I have an entire gun worth of parts for you to build a pistol around.  I even have a spare old-style floorplate and a digital camo grip module that was cut down by a previous owner so it would fit a subcompact slide.  It does still fit the compact slide without looking ungainly.  The rail on the old style grips is not standard, so it won't take regular accessories, but I found it much less likely to snag on the holster.

I can send photos of this selection as a completed gun on my Fire Control Module, but this sale WILL NOT INCLUDE the FCM at this price.  If I have not sold the subcompact pistol, we can make a deal, though.  

I'm  open to trades, but I prefer to trade up.  I can add cash, .999 silver or reloading powder."

Clean green OK title, tag good through March 2015. 65,000 miles and serviced regularly. Never wrecked, no damage of any kind except a few minor scratches from just riding and enjoying it. Tires are real good on it, full service was done less than 6 months ago including a new K&N air filter, valve adjustment, carbs cleaned and synced and new rear brake pads. It runs great and the miles are low for the year model. It handles excellent and very light and neutral but firmly planted feel to the front end.

Gasket is a few bucks and easy to replace, but I don't have the time, ABSOLUTELY does not effect anything, this bike is supremely reliable to ride anywhere right now.

 These pistols are popular because the collectors value is low so you can mod them if you want and are made with few MIM parts. This trigger is nice... Not sure if it was cost on work done or from colt but I think ot has a Wilson match trigger, hammer, bushing, and beavertail grip safety. Comes with 2 colt mags the colt hard case and colt box. Park finish, and o think its rubber grips. Oh and a extended slide release

I understand that you personally may have no interest in it but someone else may. So my suggestion to you is that maybe you should just skip right over my post and go on to the next one.

1926 Savage in the rare Takedown configuration. This rifle has a removable barrel to allow for storage in a pack. The rifle features a rotary internal magazine with built in round counter visible on the side of the receiver.

Rifle is in perfect working order and could be used for hunting immediately if desired. Rifle has some surface rust on one side of the receiver and barrel. Stock has minor damage at the buttstock.

For hunting North American game the Savage 99 is still one of the finest hunting rifles of all time. In fact, it was a solid performer well into the later part of the last century, nearly one hundred years after its creation. It was manufactured for nearly a century with over a million rifles produced before the Savage 99 was discontinued due to decrepit machinery and increased cost.

The design of the 99 is superior to lever actions such as the Winchester 94 and the Marlin 336, because it can handle high intensity cartridges. It has several superior design features that make it more comparable to the Browning BLR and even modern bolt actions like the Winchester Model 70. The rotary spool magazine allows for the use of pointed bullets, which retain greater velocity downrange than the flat point bullets required by lever guns with tubular magazines. Its strong action allowed it to be chambered in many modern, short-action, high intensity cartridges.

For a rifle designed in the last decade of the 1800's, it had many modern day features that are still prevalent on currently produced rifles. It has a cocking indicator on top of the tang and it ejected spent cartridges at an angle, which made it easily adaptable to the use of telescopic sights."

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1943 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped to Springfield Armory in February of 1943. It was Issued to an enlisted serviceman at the time. (Trying to find out who it was issued to now through different channels.) There are specific clues on the gun that tell you who it MIGHT have gone to.. There is AA inscribed (Not stamped) on the ivory grips and on the frame Next to GHD. GHD is significant because Col. Guy H. Drewry inspected ordnance from June 17, 1942 to July 15, 1945 For COLT.

After having multiple collectors and Colt dealers at the gun show look at it. ""AA"" is believed to stand for ""All American"" 82nd Airborne. Which would match the dates the gun was issued, and the eagle carved on the Ivory grips. 82 Airborne was the first Airborne division in US Army history and had three major drops, made their first drop in July of 1943 to invade Sicily. Second was Salerno on 13 September 1943. The third was the invasion of Normandy Jun 1944.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by a gunsmith. At some point it was re-blued, and fixtures were 24k gold plated and Ivory grips added. It has been determined the gold was added many many years ago as some has worn off in spots. Bluing and finish is still very nice... Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. I have put 100 rounds through it and drives tacks. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

Up for grabs is this Ruger 10/22 Carbine. The stock has been modified with a textured grip and rattle can paint job along with the floated barrel. There are 2 barrels, one has a 1/2""x28 thread adapter on it w/ a muzzle break, the other has the polymer muzzle break on it. 5 magazines are included with this, 3 factory 10rnd, and 2 butler creek 25rnd. Also I have 1400 rounds of ammo to go with this.
 I just don't shoot a 22 much anymore so I am looking to sell this off to work on my other projects. I'm not looking for any trades at this time (unless you got some crazy deal for me), and am not looking to separate the ammo from this package. I priced everything separate (not retail but the going used rate) and then dropped it 30-40 so if you do have to travel a little it will still be worth it. Can meet up in Smithfield/Selma area if interested"

I have approximately 600 rounds of ammo that I'm looking to sell.

200 WWB FMJ, 100 Prvi FMJ, 100 Brassmaxx FMJ, 50 Perfecta FMJ, partial box of Aguila FMJ, partial box of Tula FMJ. This is about 475 round of FMJ total, which I'll sell for $175

Also have 100 rounds of HPR HPs and 24 round of Federal HPs, loose, for $70.

I think that's beyond fair, and probably a bit cheaper than you could get all of this new. Buy all of it for a total price of $240.

Cash is king, but I'm not opposed to trades. NO JUNK! No offense, but I don't own crap now, and I'm not planning on it in the future. Only interested in pistols in 9mm or 45ACP, or rifles in 5.56/223 or 7.62x39. Would consider a sweet hunting rifle though.

New these handcannons come with a MSRP of $653.32, to me that price is crazy, so the gun in its original box with safety key and 50 odd rounds of ammo can be yours for the very reasonable price of $400. If this ad is up the gun is still for sale, if you have any questions please feel free to ask."

Colt first introduced the use of a lightweight aluminum alloy in a gun frame in 1948. Building on this experience, the Colt Defender model now offers the power and performance of a full sized .45 ACP pistol in a compact, lightweight carry model. Small, lightweight, accurate, reliable, with excellent sights and able to withstand everyday wear and frequent practice sessions without the need for extensive maintenance.
