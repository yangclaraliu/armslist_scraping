Flash Tubes 

You can also buy brass and bullets from…. http://www.cdvs.us/50-CAL-SPOTTER-C46.aspx

This is a pretty cool cartridge the spotter round was used on the 106mm recoilless rifle M-40A1 it can be used with any .50 BMG bolt face. From what I understand State that doesn’t allow .50 BMG for hunting would allow .50 Spotter cartridges. 
Reamers and head space gauge can be located from Pacific Die. Just take an old used .50 BMG barrel and set it back then re-chamber.
This is an amazing cartridge to shoot from a bolt action or semi auto rifle.. You actually stand up and fire it. Plus; as a suppressed .50 cal rifle with subsonic loads it’s unbeatable with bullets weights from 635gr to 1000grs the distance would amaze you.
As a side note: If you buy the forming die for this cartridge you can make your own .50 Spotters cases from .50 BMG

I’d also be interested in trades, let me know what you have hopefully we can work a deal.

I have put maybe 2-300 rounds through it so far. I believe there was only one failure to feed, pretty sure due to ammo. Otherwise its 100 percent reliable. Gun is in perfect condition. Kept really good care of it and cleaned as soon as I came back from shooting. Currently has a Houge grip on it, which I really like. Do have the original grips, made of real wood. I made a little modification to the sight which is, painted a white dot on the front sight post and a white line around the back sight (as seen in 4th picture). Also the trigger has been polished and trigger over travel has been modified, the trigger is no where near a hair trigger. Weight is at factory standards, just a little more smooth. Last of all, the load chamber indicator has been deactivated. All of these modifications, other than polished trigger, can be reverted to stock at your request. I personally believe these modification only make it easier to shoot more precisely. 

I am the original owner and have the box with everything that came with it. Need money for a new gun. Looking to get myself a Glock 35 (40s&w) because I need a carry gun when in the woods.

Never fired Remington 700 SPS Tactical chambered in .308.  It has a 20” heavy barrel, an overmolded hogue stock, X-Mark Pro adjustable trigger, and 4+1 capacity.

I bought this rifle about a year ago before I deployed and set it all up.  I bought a Remington 700P when I got back, so I am selling this one.   I never got around to bringing this out to the range.

The scope has been mounted using the scope and ring/mount manufacturer’s specifications for torque and locked into place with lock-tite.  The scope has been leveled before and after installation to ensure 100% crosshair level.  I have boresighted the scope to 50m for initial zeroing (and barrel break-in if you so choose).

This rifle is completely ready to bring out to the range and zero with minor adjustments.  This rifle has the Remington X-Mark Pro adjustable trigger.   If you do your part, this rifle will shoot sub-MOA groups.

--BSA 6-24x40 Mil Dot Tactical Scope ($165)

Installed $329 LaserMax internal laser, verified reliability, accuracy, and then the firearm has been stored in a biometric single pistol safe next to my bed. Obviously all of the Springfield gear is included (but never even used) along with the factory 13 round and 10 round mags in the correct factory case.  Also included is the original guide rod and spring in addition to the LaserMax version.  Pretty well your best carry or home protection setup. Must have valid IN identification and, preferably, current IN LTCH.  If you've ever priced anything like this, you know I have well over $900 dollars in this package.  First $575.00 cash gets the entire package!  You can't find the internal LaserMax for this pistol anywhere for even $300.  If you take $300 off of the total, you are buying a Springfield XD .45 LNIB for $275!!!  And, no, I'm not willing to break up the sale into parts; it's a package sale. 

I am looking to replace this firearm with a S&W M&P .45c with a thumb safety.  I have seen several places where I can get the M&P .45c I want for under $500 delivered.  However, if someone has a like new (sorry to sound like a jerk, but I just do not have any firearms that are banged up - I know many I own are made to take the abuse, but I just like pristine firearms) M&P .45c with a thumb safety.  If you have one of them WITH a S&W 14 round high cap mag and the grip sleeve, I'd go so far as trading even (and I have a place pulled up right now where I can buy that extra mag with matching sleeve for $39 delivered).

So, yes, if you want to go through the trouble of buying a new S&W M&P .45c with thumb safety at Buds or some of the other places where you'd have about $480 to $490 total in the pistol, then spend $39 for the one additional 14 round M&P .45 with matching sleeve and be out $510-$525 total, yes, I will trade this Springfield I have over $900 of my hard earned cash in for that setup.  I need (well, want) that specific M&P pistol to finish my M&P collection and I'm willing to give someone one hell of a deal on a Springfield XD .45 LNIB, all XD gear, Springfield XD heavy case, the factory 10 round stainless mag, the factory 13 round stainless mag (with matching sleeve), a basically new LaserMax internal laser (original guide rod and original spring) in trade.

There is not even a mark on the bolt face. There are some marks on the wood. The pics show what I could. The receiver and barrel have very little wear or marks. There are some very small rust spots on the gun from sitting in the closet.

This gun is in great condition. It has some handling marks but I don't think it has had more than a box of shells shot out of it. It does need a very thorough cleaning. Leaving a gun in a closet for 30+ years does it no good. My friend has 3 more guns he wants me to sell for him. I will be listing them as I can.

I've only done it by hand, that's a pretty easy way to go IMO. I am the second owner and have had it about 2 years. When I bought it I sent it out to a gun smith that specializes in Grendels(John Torrelli, NJ). He replaced the slide stop. When I first got it, I had a hard time keeping the slide back, but John upgraded the stop and that problems gone. It's a nice little gun at a great price for anyone wanting a sub-compact .380 or who collects Kel-Tec. Thanks for looking. Feel free to text or call"

It will come with everything that came with it (soft case, three 15 round mags, raised night sights, four replaceable back straps, and all of the sight mounting hardware). The red dot shown is the Burris fastfire 3. It is the only micro red dot that doesn't have to be removed to replace the battery. If you have any questions please feel free to ask."

On its cantilever scope mount, I have a Nikon Slughunter scope which features 3-9 variable zoom with an objective lens diameter of 40mm. The Slughunter has a bullet drop compensator specifically for sabot rounds designed to provide aiming points for ballistic holds out to 300 yards, making it much more efficient to shotgun hunt deer or other big game. With the scope mounted on the cantilever, it stays with the barrel if you decide to swap out for a different barrel when you are not hunting and it still retains its zero.

While it is not new in box, it has yet to be fired or taken out of the house since I bought it new in March. I already have a shell holder mounted on the side and can also provide you with a wood stock and foreend if you would prefer that look. Also, I am including a 5 round box of sabot rounds as I wont be needing them. I'm currently looking for cash so I'm not interested in trades, but if you have a reasonable offer, I will consider it.

I originally purchased this rifle when it was put together on a different plastic stock. I purchased it for 400. I installed a bullpup stock that I bought just over 200 and added a buffer recoil pad (to reduce recoil). The barrel still has a lot of life left in it. Shoots very accurately and flawlessly. 

The upgraded bullpup stock shortens the SKS about 5-6 inches from the previous length. I originally built this because I enjoy learning the different weapon platforms and I thought this would be a great shooter. Absolutely no surprises, this rifle shoots beautifully. The few times that I took it to the range, there is always a small audience behind me trying to figure out what I'm shooting. If you have friends or family that shoots, or you just want to show someone up that is different from what everyone else has, then this is the rifle for you. Or if you just like to have fun and blast away with inexpensive steel ammo, then this is also for you.

 Replacement parts for the Norinco are cheap and are plentiful because of U.S. companies making compatible parts between all of the SKS platforms for all the different countries who manufacture it. The overall recoil is very manageable, if you wanted to take someone with a small frame to range they would have a blast without any concerns of injury.

 I decided to charge 800 because although it cost me about a 100 more than what I am asking for, I figure that whoever wants to buy it will have to pay for the transfer and background check fee. So I cut the price down from 900 to 800 to help cover the cost of those transaction fees at whichever local gun shop we commit our transaction.

What is in this packaged deal?

1 Norinco SKS with a custom bullpup stock

800 rounds of ammunition (40 rounds of PDX1 Defender, 40 rounds of winchester white box brass, and the rest of the ammo is Tulammo steel cased)

5 20 round magazines 
3 30 round magazines
2 40 round magazines
(all magazines are reliable)

20 stripper clips (for quick ammo loading)

1 steel ammo can with 7.62 markings.

NOTE: Magazines will be disassembled and provided to purchaser as parts kits, exactly how the gun shops in Colorado sell the magazines. This rifle is 922r compliant the entire stock kit is made in USA as well as the magazines and buffer pad that I installed.

Made in 1876, the pistol was originally sold to the US Military as an “Artillery” SAA. It was rejected by the Military Inspectors, and sent back to Colt. Colt re-worked the gun, and then sent it to J.P Moores Co in New York for resale on the Civilian Market. The pistol comes with a Colt factory letter that shows the shipment in 1876. Rare for an Artillery, the pistol still has a 7 ½” barrel, and the original wooden grips, there is a faint Military Inspector’s marking on the butt of the right grip. The pistol has the Colt Patent Dates, as well as a “US” marking on the left side of the receiver, it also has the # “3351” stamped in that area. The pistol has Colt’s Hartford address on top of the barrel. It also has an interesting 5 notches cut on the left side of the barrel, and also on the butt of the right grip. All the finish is missing, the pistol has patina and areas of very mild freckling, the grips show commensurate wear, the bore is somewhat dark with some visible marking. The cylinder retains all 4 cocks and locks up tightly. This is a excellent Colt SAA that will enhance a great collection! This is an antique firearm – if it is legal for you to own this weapon where you live, and with a copy of your Drivers License, establishing that you are over age 21, I can ship the rifle direct to your home, an FFL License is not required.

Please be sure it is legal for you to own prior to bidding. Buyer to pay $35 shipping/insurance. Payment via cashier bank transfer or USPS money order."

I purchased this P226R back in 2012 as the tacpac. Cost nearly 1200 then. Last year I sent it off to Bruce Gray who does some of the best custom Sig work in the US. He set me up with his short reset and lighter competition trigger and upgraded the extractor spring. I got it back and shot 300 rounds. Loved it but needed more done. So I sent it to TJcustomgunworks. There they did a whole package of reduced recoil spring, shortening the ejector, custom hammer spring, reduced weight, deburred the slide and made it smooth as can possible be to rack the slide. Also polished and deburred the feed ramp. Total cost of work done on the gun with parts close to another 1000. Only 600 rounds shot. Price is firm and no trades will be considered at all. Price is set at $1000. I also have for sale in California since I will be there for mothers day. Pics will be sent only through text in order to make sure buyers are serious. Thanks. Ccw holders will have priority in sale. Available this evening and tomorrow.

I'm selling this one cause i picked up another a few weeks ago and i plan to upgrade it and use for competition. Sale includes custom kydex holster, 3 mags, and the sig tacpac holster. Gun is in great condition with signs of wear on the barrel from shooting 600 rounds.
