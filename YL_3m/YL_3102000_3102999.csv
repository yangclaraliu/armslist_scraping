 This was part of a multi gun trade that I just made, and I'm into 1911s, not double action self defense pistols, so this one is up for sale. The previous owner bought it new, and claims only 150 rounds through it. It has no wear on the rails, the slide is tight, and the finish looks like new, so I believe the low round count. I did shoot one magazine through it to check function, and I was impressed with its accuracy. There was no malfunctions. It drops the casings about a foot from your feet in a pile.
 I prefer cash, but the right 10 mm supported chamber 5"" 1911 could get my attention (For deer hunting). If you have a .460 Rowland kit for a 1911 I'd consider a partial trade and cash.

The Colt is a perfect shooter.  It is, however,  pitted along the left side of the slide and slide release (no mechanical dysfunction,  only aesthetic).  I'd rather have the money from a sale than trade.  This has been my home defense gun and was intended to be a customization project (a slide can go used from 100 to 250).  It's just what you'd expect from a Series 80, which has the added safety feature.  Should you have any questions, please feel free to ask.  Must come to Kenosha or Racine County for pickup.

This is essentially the same gun as the P220 Compact except it is German made, and has a carbon steel slide with contrast sights. This gun is an absolute tack driver, and is great for a CCW. There are some wear marks, but all the springs and screws have recently been replaced, so the gun is very tight and it functions like new.

The gun comes with two standard 6-round magazines and two 8-round magazines with X-Grip extensions. With these extended magazines, the gun becomes dimensionally identical to a P220 Carry (second picture). Also included is the original Sig-Sauer hard case, manual, test-target, and trigger lock. I will also include the old springs and screws as spare parts.

500 rounds of CCI 22 lr Rimfire 40 Grain RN Subsonic Standard Velocity Ammunition consists of 1 bricks of 500 each as (10 new, unopened boxes of 50 in reusable plastic trays).

The CCI Subsonic Standard Velocity 22 Long Rifle Lead Round Nose Bullet designed for: Target, Plinking, and Competition Training.

This ammunition features a 40 Grain Bullet Weight and Muzzle Energy of 102 ft. lbs. These 22 lr rounds are Subsonic Standard Velocity and leave the barrel at the speed of 1070 feet per second, the perfect speed for excellent bullet stabilization along the rifling. As you can see from the pictures they also feature a wide base to the bullet to help the rifling get a solid ""bite"" and therefore increased accuracy. If accuracy and reliability are what you look for in a 22 lr bullet, this is it.

CCI Subsonic Standard Velocity ammunition is loaded to the same velocity as CCI Green Tag and Pistol Match ammunition but priced less to help keep your training budget in line. The clean-burning propellant helps keep semi-automatic actions cleaner. This ammunition is new production and non-corrosive. This ammunition features the sure-fire CCI priming and yields the anticipated reliable cycling expected from CCI.

Complete velocity, energy, and trajectory information can be found at http://www.cci-ammunition.com/products/detail.aspx?use=5&loadNo=0032

We have quite a bit of this ammo.  Each 10 boxes of 50 rounds  are $65 ($6.50 per box of 50).  We are selling this at a loss and have no limit (other than what we have left).  This ammo is being sold elsewhere at reasonable places like Midway USA for 7.39/50 plus shipping and Palmetto State Armory for $73 to $82.49 (depending if it is on sale or not) for 500 after tax and shipping.

Bolt handle and all internals were upgraded through PowerCustoms.com. Trigger is a Timney Target trigger with 3.5 Lb. clean break. Stock is from Bell & Carlson and is a tactical/varmint stock with 3 studs. 2 studs are used for a factory Ruger sling and the third holds a Harris low rise extendable bipod. Factory Ruger scope base and rings hold a factory Ruger scope. Have a factory 10 round Ruger magazine as well as a new manufacture BX-25 magazine. For the right offer I can include all original factory parts to return the rifle to stock + a .22 caliber black bull barrel with threaded end. Looking to trade for tactical/ long range semi-auto/bolt action rifles in a larger caliber however all offers will be considered. I know the money that I have invested in this and the work that went into assembling it. Dont email me and say i can buy a new one for $150 at Walmart because this isnt a stock rifle that you would get from Walmart. I also know the price of a new Mossberg NightTrain 2 and I woulld be taking the loss but my loss is your gain. I just dont get out to shoot this as much as i should and I think it should go to someone that will put it to use ( varmint hunting, squirrel hunting or just long range plinking) If interested email me or send offers and pictured to 1 708 539 597two.

Outstanding accuracy is achieved by the smooth bore, Lancaster style elliptical barrel, which imparts a spin on projectiles, increasing accuracy and exterior threading to accept chokes. The chrome lined barrel, chamber and gas system resist corrosion, making cleaning easier and extending the life of the shotgun. A lightweight, impact resistant polymer Tapco stock. Adjustable forgrip for comfortable control and includes .75” sling mounts. An oversized Billet trigger guard allows use with gloved hands.

Including: MAGPUL AR-10 PRS stock with mono-pod attachment.  Timney single stage trigger.  Hogue grip.  And an extended charging handle release... Over $500 worth of upgrades. 

I'm not sure how many rounds have been through it, I got it used.  The only issue is the the Timney trigger.  I did some adjusting to it after I put it in, which apparently was a bad idea.  Basically, the disconnect does NOT disconnect.  So after each shot you have to push the trigger forward, or cycle the safety to disconnect it.  The trigger could probably be returned to Timney to be repaired, or taken to a gun smith with the proper tools.  Works fine other than that.  I think I have the original trigger somewhere, definitely have the original stock.

Have around 100 rounds of various .308 I am willing to throw in for extra.

There is a pretty nice 24x scope on it at the moment, I am willing to throw that in for extra if it's really wanted. 

I'm not the greatest shooter, but it's definitely a sub moa rifle with heavier bullets, it's favorite ammo seems to be American Eagle 7.62 168gr M1A. It has an 18"" BBL.  

I moved to MO fairly recently and am not a resident, so as far as I know we would have to go through a FFL to transfer the firearm."

This line has been discontinued and replaced with a much cheaper ""TERRA"" version which has lower grade glass and internal components. The Conquest line is now the Middle class range Zeiss Offers that start around $800+. Don't miss this opportunity to get this scope for $$$ less. 
“The Carl Zeiss Conquest MC Riflescope is a moderately priced scope compared to the company’s higher-end offerings but it does not compromise one iota on quality and I have always been mystified as to how Zeiss can offer this optic at this price.” 

One of the oldest names in rifle scopes is also known for being one of the best manufacturers of high end optics. Zeiss of Germany has been making quality optics for over a century and is perhaps the finest crafter of scope lenses in the world. The Carl Zeiss Conquest MC Riflescope represents a moderately priced option when compared to the firm’s other offerings, but is built to the same high standards as the rest of the company’s catalog of scopes. The glass is by far the clearest to ever come from a factory in Europe. Zeiss has been offering this quality of glass since the company’s founding and is a true testament to German craftsmanship.

Build Quality: 
Zeiss scopes may be made for hunters, but are built to exceed military standards to perform in all terrain and weather conditions. The machining quality of the moving parts speaks volumes about precision craftsmanship, as if everything moves on lubricated bearings. In short, this is an indestructible optic.


Carl Zeiss Conquest MC – Build Quality
Reticle – Z-Plex:
The Z-Plex reticle is best referred to as a heavy duplex type; traditionally styled crosshairs for the hunter or target shooter without the clutter of many of the modern reticles. If you cut your teeth on Leupold, Burris, or Bushnell; the reticle will seem like a new and improved version of an old friend.


Z-Plex Reticle
Glass Quality:
The glass on a Zeiss scope is crystal clear and may spoil you for any other scope on the market with the exception of perhaps Schmidt & Bender or Swarovski.

Magnification:
The variable power rating on the Zeiss Conquest is a traditional 3×9. This makes it ideal for short range shooting and just enough magnification for longer ranges or a clear zoom when needed. This is probably the most common variable power setting in the world for the hunter and one of the most versatile.

Pros
Without a doubt, Zeiss lenses are the clearest on the market and can make a Steiner look less than adequate.

Every part of this scope represents high quality. All moving parts have a feel like they were custom made; this is the Rolls Royce of riflescopes.

The build of this scope is nothing short of amazing. Zeiss has been making quality optics for over 100 years and all of their scopes are a testament to that fact.This is a Zeiss and that means quality. Zeiss scopes hold their retail value better than any other scope in their class. Sometimes you need to step up the quality of your optics to match your rifle and a Zeiss is more at home on a custom rifle than just about anything else.

These guns are essentially metric sized clones of Remington 870s, but with heavy duty lifters that won't allow shell-double feeds that 870s can have. 

One gun has sling-swivel forend cap and I installed a Magpul 870 stock on it (fits very well). Has Speedfeed forend, the Speedfeed stock that was on the gun, comes with it (it just didn't fit me). The other gun is virtually identical, except it has a standard forend cap and has Speedfeed stock installed. Guns show handling wear requisite with former police/security guns (plenty of rack wear, but limited shooting wear). Both guns have flat oversized safeties installed - I wish I could find a safety like this for an 870, they are perfect. I have fired both guns with bird, buck, and slugs the guns shoot excellent and are very smooth, as smooth as any worn-in 870. 

In the end I am selling these, because I am already invested in 870s and don't need shotguns outside of that platform. 

Asking $450 for BOTH. I prefer to sell BOTH guns not one individually. Since 3000s aren't made anymore you might as well have a spare. - If you don't want the Magpul stock on the bottom gun, I will reinstall the Speedfeed and sell you both guns for $400. 

Trades - I would consider trading both guns straight across for an excellent condition/new Remington 870 Police, preferably with wood furniture."

I had the dealer checked for me. You welcome to bring a mechanic to check if you want second opinion. Radio are original, but might need a bit fixing. The CD not working, but everything else work fine. If ad still up then it is still available, will delete after sold. I will ignore email or text asking if it is still available. I tried to be clear as much as I can, if you have any questions let me know. Have a great day."

Be very careful when it comes to buying this rifle. Lots of people are not aware that Ruger had made a 10/22 in the WMR and discontinued that rifle for a very good reason. The pressure for the round would cause the bolt to crack and cause failure of the rifle. They had conversion kits for the 10/22 Magnums to convert to .17hmr and stopped making them for the same reason and they have higher chamber pressure then the 22 magnum.  No matter what its still a 10/22 and nothing more. The vendors that sold the conversion kits at one even recommend not to convert your firearm due to known failures. Look it all up if you wont take my word for it. Your fingers, and eyes and life are worth more then some polished up turd."

Overall I love shooting this rifle, I have just gotten all the enjoyment out of it that I can and would like to move onto another project. I can throw in a hard case and some ammo as well. The price may be negotiable, but kep in mind I know what I have and I'm not particularly eager to get rid of this weapon. In other words, lowballing wont work. I will upload pictures shortly, if you'd like more just ask."

Includes a Gould & Goodrich B803-G19 Gold Line Three Slot Pancake Holster which is great for Concealed Carry. 
I have to make sure, but I believe I have 50 rounds of ammo. 
I bought this gun last year and carried for a while, but have replaced it with a Springfield Full-sized XD45. 
The gun is in great condition, has a little holster wear but does not affect the way it performs. Main reason I am considering parting with it is I need some tattoo work done really bad!
I have taken it to the range about 6 times, so it has had about 300 rounds through it. 
The gun has Night sights, 2-13 round magazines, and factory box.
The holster is a black leather Gould, that works great with a retaining snap and strap. 
I need any deals to be a reasonable distance from Cullman, travel is difficult with wife's work schedule. 
I know tattoo work will probably require going to a shop, but any other trades or anything.

Looking for some professional tattoo cover-ups, have had the work appraised and both will run around $600. 
The right arm needs a panther crawling up it (or something similar), the current tattoo is a basic outline tattoo that measures 9""x 5"". This one was appraised at $450. 
The left arm needs a color Taz devil (or similar) with my son's name under it in a ribbon or something to make it look good. This one is about an 1.5"" x 4"", it is also a basic outline. this one was appraised at $150. 
Both are on the upper arms. Mistakes of younger days when I didn't think first.
These estimates came from Ink City in Decatur. 
The gun will have to cover the cost, because I don't have any extra funds (that's the reason I am considering using my Glock as a trade).

If I can't get tattoo work for the gun, I might consider a trade for a revolver of equal value. 
I might consider other guns also, just depends. 
Just shoot me a message and we'll go from there.

Will load stock photos for now, will update with actual photos ASAP."

Some States allows only non-lead ammunition when hunting. Until recently, thousands of California hunters had to shelve their .22 rifles & reach for other types of firearms to chase varmints in the Condor Zone. Winchester announced their .22 Long Rifle Lead Free Ammunition. This ammunition is described as a 26 grain tin hollow point bullet, zipping along at 1650fps. ------------------from internet------------- Another positive was the bullet energy when hitting a ""hard target"". I put that in quotes so you understand what I mean by hard target. Most of the lead free ammunition tends to be harder than lead. This tin ammunition is no different. However, when you hit a medium sized ground squirrel in the head or shoulder area, you will definitely hear a ""crack"" if the bullet hits any bone. Almost all of the hits shown in the video above passed completely through the ground squirrel. This was the case even when they were hit in the head. This was true when I first shot this ammunition back in March. I had to dispatch a skunk at my buddy's house up in the high desert. The skunk had an issue, as it walked up to the house in the middle of the day, bent on getting to the front porch, even with us using a hose and yelling to try and turn it. However, once the hose turned him back away from the house, my buddy asked me to dispatch it. I dropped it immediately with a shot to the shoulder at about 25 yards. It did not have a chance to spray and the bullet did not exit. It was very odd for the skunk to be so aggressive in the middle of the day, but the .22 took care of it. My final thoughts on the Winchester .22 Long Rifle Lead Free Ammunition is this. This is the only rimfire ammunition manufacturers to produce lead free. Price is for 1 box of 50, sealed sent to you with tracking number. Just so you know the California Fine for Leaded bullets including 22 is over $500 in fees & court costs per hunter per Ticket. Can be several tickets per day if you don't remove the ammo and firearm from the hunting group or hunter! -------------------------------------------- Tip without legal advice! With one box you qualify for ""NON-LEAD"" 22LR ammo. Keep the box with your all the time. Once you use up the TIN ammo, you may want to put lead Winchester 22LR in the plastic container just as insurance! I'm not suggesting this, you as an adult could be ""lying"" to law enforcement, but most of the time they look at the box, not test the bullet..."

* Less than 40 available in .38 super for 2014

* All AF2011's come standard with walnut grips. We also offer upgraded grips for additional charge.

* Additional magazines, cases, holsters and accessories available

* The gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .38 super and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate and great fun. The AF2011-A1 holds amazing and surprising target performance for the shooter: in fact, it will group all the 9 double .38 super caliber rounds (18 rounds) held in the duplex, single columns magazines, in a target of the size of an orange at 15 yards and of a water melon at 25. The stopping power of the AF2011-A1 is tremendous: 2 bullets for a total of 260 Grains weight impacting at 1 to 2 inches apart (depending on the distance of the target) will knock down a bull, while the whole 20 rounds, for a payload exceeding 2600 Grains, can be delivered to the target in about 3 seconds. The AF2011-A1 obviously features a number of very special parts, such as the single slide, the single frame, the single spur double hammer, the single grip safety, the single body double mainspring housing and the single double cavity magazine floor plate, the long and double magazine latch, the special barrel bushings and the hold open lever and side lever safety with long shafts: but the most interesting feature of the new pistol which we strived to keep during the development of the project, is the interchangeability of most internal parts, which come as standard 1911 replacement parts. These include the firing pins, the firing pins plates, the sears groups, the triple springs, the inner parts of the mainspring housings, the recoil springs and recoil springs rods, the magazine bodies and inner parts, the sights (including after market adjustable sights) the grips and grips screws and bushings.
