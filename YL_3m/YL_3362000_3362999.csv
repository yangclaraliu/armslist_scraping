I had it stippled, 10-8 sights installed (there is no set screw in the back sight, but it is locktite'd in, 10-8 didn't send it with a set screw, and I felt no need to get one since it's nearly impossible to remove these sights even with a hammer and punch).  I put in an Apex sear and trigger/trigger bar, it really cleans up the trigger with a nice short reset.  I am including the factory trigger/trigger bar and sear as well.

I live on the Eastside (Bellevue area), and work in Seattle, so I can meet anywhere in this area.  Feel free to PM with any questions or offers.  I will ship at buyers expense (fees/shipping, etc), but would much prefer a local deal.

* As you can tell...there is nothing else that this gun needs.  It is completely set up and is actually 2 guns in 1 including the optics.

Feel free to call or text any time.  DO NOT ASK ME IF THE GUN IS STILL AVAILABLE...if the ad is still up, then the gun is still available.  
If you low-ball me, I won't bother responding.  In my eyes, if you're interested in this setup, then you know what you're looking at and what it's all worth in time and money invested.

Thanks,

I am selling 2 nice rifles a Colt 6920 AR-15 and a WASR Romanian AK. I have only shot them a few times each. The AR is in excellent condition, it is exactly as it came out of the box. Never had 1 single problem with the rifle. I bought it brand new and put about 700 rounds through it 

The AK works fine never had a problem with it either when using steel mags. The tapco mags do not feed but I ony tried them once, I think they need to be broken in. In order to get them to fit into the gun I had to shave them down so the edges are chewed up. They fit 100% with absolutely no wobble whatsoever. Steel magazines fit into the WASR perfectly with no wobble. 

Included is :
Colt AR model 6920
13 magazines 
2x bore brushes
original Colt cleaning kit
WASR AK GP-63
14 magazines
cloth case

These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.
TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.
We are a retail store and hold this pistol for sale locally, be sure and call if wanting to buy or if you have questions. Insured shipping is $35 and we will NOT send to CA, or any other place that doesn't recognize the 2nd amendment to the constitution of the United States.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer. MSRP: $466.00

Innovation can take many forms. Sometimes it's a brand new idea – like the XD®. Other times innovation is the fine-tuning of a classic – like the EMP®.
How could the enduring design that is the 1911 be improved? Springfield Armory® answered that question in 2007 with the introduction of the Enhanced Micro Pistol™. The EMP® changes what a compact 1911 can be.
The action of the EMP® is 1/8 inch shorter than that of the original 1911. This translates into several concrete advantages for the shooter. The shorter grip radius produces a shockingly comfortable shooting experience. You have to shoot the EMP® to believe how controllable it is. The shorter dimensions also work to increase reliability – something that’s crucial in a concealed carry pistol. And of course, the overall dimensions are one of the smallest 1911s out there.
The good news doesn’t stop with the innovative design. The EMP® comes loaded with all the features you expect in a 1911 of this class – like low profile 3 dot tritium combat sights and a match grade fully supported and ramped barrel. And with 9+1 rounds of 9mm or 8+1 rounds of .40 S&W, the EMP® packs an amazing amount of punch in one of the smallest 1911s ever.
If you’re looking for a 1911 to carry with you every day, look no further than the Springfield Armory® EMP®. Sometimes innovation changes everything.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer. MSRP: $466.00

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer. MSRP: $466.00

This has the hard to find 26"" barrel instead of the 20"". I've only put 17 rounds through it. The rock River 308 is guaranteed by the manufacturer to shoot 1"" MOA or less at 100yds. It comes standard with the rock river 2 stage match trigger, free floated aluminum tube, hogue pistol grip, cryogenically treated Wilson air gauged stainless bull barrel with a 1:10 twist. I've shot federal match 168gr out of it and the groups are under 1/2 inch. It comes with a Leupold VX-3 6.5-20x50mm scope and sun shade. It has the target reticle, but can be sent to leupold and changed to any reticle of your choice for a very small fee. The scope has a full transferable lifetime warranty. The rifle uses FAL magazines. It comes with two 20rd mags and one 30rd mag. I've owned several AR style rifles and carbines. Rock River is by far the best brand I have known for reliability, customer service, and accuracy. Im not willing to trade on this gun. It is one of my favorite guns, but I have two of them and don't really have a need for both. The scope was $950 and the rifle was $1,750. Asking price is firm. Text or email. 620 two-one-eight 8596. Thanks"

This has the hard to find 26"" barrel instead of the 20"". I've only put 17 rounds through it. The rock River 308 is guaranteed by the manufacturer to shoot 1"" MOA or less at 100yds. It comes standard with the rock river 2 stage match trigger, free floated aluminum tube, hogue pistol grip, cryogenically treated Wilson air gauged stainless bull barrel with a 1:10 twist. I've shot federal match 168gr out of it and the groups are under 1/2 inch. It comes with a Leupold VX-3 6.5-20x50mm scope and sun shade. It has the target reticle, but can be sent to leupold and changed to any reticle of your choice for a very small fee. The scope has a full transferable lifetime warranty. The rifle uses FAL magazines. It comes with two 20rd mags and one 30rd mag. I've owned several AR style rifles and carbines. Rock River is by far the best brand I have known for reliability, customer service, and accuracy. Im not willing to trade on this gun. It is one of my favorite guns, but I have two of them and don't really have a need for both. The scope was $950 and the rifle was $1,750. Asking price is firm. I live in Kansas right along the Oklahoma border.  I would be willing to meet in OK or am willing to ship. Text or email. 620 two-one-eight 8596. Thanks"

The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.
TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
Sometimes performance isn't optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.

Sig P229 (Ser#: AM 94 XXX) in 9mm. I bought it used myself three years ago, and it's been well-taken care of by me, kept in a safe, kept clean, etc. though I can't speak for the previous owner. However, it has never given me any sort of issue, eating everything I've ever fed it, with zero malfunctions of any kind in three years.

It's a DA/SA with decocker. The gun has a rail for accessories, but no E2 grips, no SRT. It is wearing Hogue rubber grips that it came with from the gunstore, and factory night sights.

The gun will come in the original blue box, with 3 magazines: 2x15rd and 1x13rd.

Additionally, I have the .22LR conversion kit with one 10-rd magazine. It really assists in training with the weapon for lower cost (if you can find .22lr ammo, of course, but that continues to get better). Again, it's been gently used, well-cared for, and is basically like new. The retail price new for the conversion kit is $299; I'll sell it for $225 if you purchase it with the gun, and throw in 100 rounds of .22lr ammo as well. I have two extra .22lr conversion magazines for $30 each (they retail for $40).

Since Sigarms sells the ""CPO"" for $639 (if it's in stock at all), given that this is a used gun, I'll price it at $600 firm."

Why choose Brothers N Arms? In a word – Quality. After all, when you squeeze that trigger, quality is what matters. Quality is what keeps you safe on the battlefield and on patrol. Quality is what keeps your rifle running at the range and wins you competitions. We wouldn’t build anything that we wouldn’t shoot or own. With years of military and law enforcement training, our designers and machinists know what it takes to make a quality weapon.

Quality is about the little things. Our uppers, lowers, and bolt carriers groups are all made on the same factory floor right here in America in order to ensure industry leading fit and finish. All of our rifles sport free float hand guards with low profile gas blocks. Our standard triggers set the bar high with a clean, crisp break. Quality rifles like these deserve to go right to the range, so out of the box you are range-ready with a set of Magpul flip up sights (select models vary). There is no need to spend even more money getting set up with sights just so you can go out and enjoy your new quality rifle.

This is a very nice example of a scarce early WWII USMC Model 1941 type sniper rifle as used by the USMC. These were some of the first, true purpose built sniper rifles used only by the USMC. This rifle was built on a 1938 Springfield M1903A1 NM rifle with a Lyman Bridge sight. The Springfield Armory receiver is serial numbered 1,526,xxx; this puts the rifle in the correct range of those used to complete the M1941 Sniper Rifle build. Originally, this rifle was built to compete in NRA Match Competitions. This rifle has the typical features associated with the USMC Sniper program rifles modified by the Ordnance Section of the Marine Corps Depot of Supplies in Philadelphia, PA. These features include: (1) Serial number in the correct range from 900,000 to 1,532,000. (2) Receiver exhibits the post 1936 second gas port as recommended by General Hatcher. Referred to as the ""Hatcher Hole"". (3) The receiver rails are polished in accordance with National Match specifications. (4) Unertl ""O"" and ""E"" scope blocks centered and mounted 7.2 inches center to center. (5) Rear handguard hand finished to afford correct clearance of front scope block. (6) Barrel is marked behind the front sight: ""SA/Flaming Bomb/3-39"" and stamped by Springfield Armory with the small star-gauge mark on the muzzle at the 6 o'clock position. Additionally, the barrel is coded ""A 1242"" under the front sight block. (7) Mounted with the later ""D 1"" marked bright polished Nickel Steel bolt, serial numbered to the rifle receiver (1,526,xxx). The Extractor is marked ""CV"" for Chrome Vanadium. (8) The rifle has an original pre-war walnut ""C"" stock with two reinforcing bolts, a single circled ""P"" proof in the pistol grip area along with the matching serial number and drawing number stamped on the rear underside of the stock. The stock has the correct heavy NRA Match checkered steel buttplate with trapdoor. Mid Band is an early milled type with milled trigger guard and floorplate. (9) This rifle had a NRA MN front sight blade with bead and comes with a P.J. O'Hare brass sight cover. The standard rear ladder sight is missing. (10) The rifle is mounted in a post-1936 ""C"" stock with SA/SPG cartouche. This firearm is a beautiful example of it's kind."

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.
