Last but not least, the A400 action is light and trim, making this shotgun’s balance, swing and pointability an absolute best in its class.

I also have a separate, never opened and factory package sealed, 15 round magazine for this gun. It sells online for $40. I can sell it to you for $20, so you can have 2 magazines total and making the entire deal $460.

You've been asking for a couple +P 45 AUTO RIM loads for a long time, so by popular demand, here they are. Both loads are using high quality Starline brass. We've also incorporated a flash suppressed powder so you can shoot in the dark without blinding yourself and this is important because over 95% of all civilian shootings in the USA occur in low light when the criminal element is at work. Both of these loads are the equivalent of +P+ 45 ACP ammo or as it is also known, 45 Super. These are very stout loads, but will not harm modern 45 ACP revolvers, nor will these loads harm any post war 45 ACP revolvers. Feel free to safely shoot these loads in any post war 45 ACP revolver that is in normal good operating condition.

Check out the below velocities fired from personal real world revolvers, NOT test barrels. You'll notice that the new S&W 4 inch Mt. Gun gives speeds almost as fast as the older S&W revolvers with 5.5 and 6.5 inch barrels. This is NOT a typo. It simply shows that the new S&W revolvers are made to much tighter tolerances than the older S&W revolvers and therefore give higher velocities per inch of barrel. Also, we are aware that the 1937 manufactured model 1917 we used as a test gun, (see below velocity chart) is not post war.

Item # 32B - 200gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet
S&W Mountain Gun, 4 inch bbl = 1197 fps
S&W Model 325 (scandium) 2.5 inch bbl = 1080 FPS
S&W Model 1917 (1937 production) 5.5 inch bbl = 1203 FPS
S&W 1955 Target (25-2) 6.5 inch bbl = 1249 FPS

Item # 32B was designed for expansion and massive terminal damage, with less than 1/2 the penetration of item # 32A in flesh and bone. Expect about 14 inches of penetration from this load on live flesh and bone."

The A400 is a gas-operated action that was built for speed, reliability and versatility. Featuring the Blink technology, it is capable of firing 4 shells in less than 1 second, giving you the fastest follow-up shots of any shotgun on the market. Also, with this shotgun you can safely fire lead and steel shot, as well as chamber the best shell for the job regardless of length (2 ¾” to 3”) or power (mild for target to hard-hitting for hunting). Last but not least, the A400 action is light and trim, making this shotgun’s balance, swing and pointability an absolute best in its class.

The G42 is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42.

It will be time to “reach out and touch them” before we know it. I found a 4 unopened boxes of 22Mag lying around in the shop (200 rounds), and I figured someone could use them: Hornady (30g V-Max), Remington (33g Accutip-V), CCI (40g TMJ), and Fiocchi (40g JSP).

I really don't know what these things are worth, and that is why I put them up for trade. I cannot seem to find any 22mag ammo for sale (anywhere) to do comps for value. I have found some on gunbroker, but I think they are trying to gouge people. I am not trying to do that. I am not planning on breaking up the 4 boxes. All or nothing. I am not interested in selling.

I will trade straight or trade several smaller items for the “LOT” of 22Mag.
So if you would like to pad your stock of 22mag a little bit, shoot me a PM and let’s make a deal.  I might even trade up and kick in other goodies for the right trade item.

I am in Little Rock. Shoot me an email and let’s have a little fun doing some tradin’."

The .22lr AK-47 manufactured by GSG represents much more than a small caliber “knock-off” of a famous rifle. The GSG-AK47 is a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, and the look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection.

Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights."
