The serial number indicates that it was made in 1957.  These guns are known as the “three-screw” model or just “old models.”  It is in very good condition, with a 5 1/2"" barrel, some minor holster wear, but a bright, shiny bore.  There is also a Hunter (brand) holster with the gun.

Strong, durable, dependable, and versatile, the Single-Six revolvers are the perfect small bore single-action revolver for plinking, small game hunting or even serious competition. The Single Six was first produced in June 1953.  Old Model production ended in 1972.

NOTE:  The ""New Model"" update has not been done to this revolver.  This is the Old Model Single Six with the 4 distinct clicks as the hammer is cocked, just like a Colt SAA.  It is recommended that you do not carry the gun with a cartridge under the hammer.  If you are a true Ruger collector, then you need this unmodified one to complete the collection and these are getting more and more scarce. 

This Ruger is mechanically perfect, and has obviously been shot very little.  It's been in storage for years, and is now available for sale.  The price of $350 is fair for an old model Ruger Single Six in this condition.  Don't be bashful.  Contact me and let's talk about this gun.  It would be the perfect Christmas present for someone special."

I have a 1 time used barrel threading kit for 12 gauge. Originally sold for Saiga -12, but can be used for any as long as outside diameter of barrel is the same as Saiga. Bought originally because I shortened my Saiga barrel and wanted to put a muzzelbrake back on it. Worked out GREAT! No longer have a need for this kit so time to pass it along.

Included in the kit is the thread allignment tool, all too important in starting the threads absolutely straight!!

The thread cutting die is Tapco, M22X.75RH. Once you cut these threads, youll be able to put ANY of the crazy scary muzzlebrakes, (and theres a LOT out there) barrel shrouds, etc on the market for Saiga's on YOUR shotgun!!

This is an early 2013 SOCOM configuration with the desirable Knights Armament rail (vs. the cheaper Troy rail that ships now). Other upgrades from the regular 6920 include SOCOM heavy barrel, H2 buffer, ambi safety. Sights are the rugged, accurate MaTech BUIS, the US military standard issue backup sight for M4 carbines. Stock is the standard 4-position collapsible M4 buttstock. ""M4A1 Carbine"" roll mark.

Brand new in box, so includes everything this rifle comes with new (two 30rd magazines, cleaning kit, rail covers, etc). Indeed, I haven't even opened the goodies bag, as the box and the bag went into my closet, and the rifle went into my safe after purchase.

Using an old stock photo from Ratworx, see at https://www.ratworxusa.com/?q=node/329. Happy to take an actual photo, or arrange a face-to-face inspection. 

If you have never owned/fired a Colt AR-15, they are widely considered amongst the best AR rifles you can buy (without getting into the high-cost of the boutique AR market), especially for those of us who just want a good-looking, accurate, reliable AR-15. 

Also, if you are in the market for an AR-15 rifle that is close to a standard military issue Colt M4 carbine, and you don't want to chance buying a brand new SOCOM and risk getting one with a Troy rail, don't miss this opportunity to take out the guesswork.

I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine.

Thanks for looking!"

This rifle still has some cosmoline on it.  This is the best example of a Wasr 10/63 that I have seen.  It was hand selected out of a shipment of 25 rifles that were also hand selected for quality.  The Wasr 10/63 is the premium of the Wasr AK rifles.  These are not made from the military reject parts like the Wasr 10's are, but are built in Romania from actual demilled Romanian Military rifles on new Romanian receivers with new Romanian cold hammer forged and chrome lined barrels.  Most of these like this one came from National Guard type semi-auto only rifles that rarely saw use.  The receiver has a factory rail on the side for mounting optics.  The date on the trunnion is 1970 and has the military triangle with the arrow in it indicating that it was indeed a military rifle.  The stock on this is laminated wood for durability.

This rifle barrel is threaded and has a slant brake, cleaning rod, and cleaning kit in the buttstock, and Romanian leather sling.  The bayonet lug is intact so you can affix a bayonet if you like.  Century did not build this, but did import it and changed out the necessary parts for 922r compliance such as the Tapco G2 trigger set that is now in it.

It will come with a Tapco bakelite colored 30 round magazine as well as the box, manual, and plastic oil bottle.  Included is also a Romanian metal military magazine that was included, but is beat up and non functional.  It came with the rifle but I kept it for parts.

I am asking 675 dollars for this excellent example of a WASR 10/63."

The sp2009 was only made for a few years(1999-2002) and finding a blueline 9mm model is not too easy because at the time most law enforcement was using .40 caliber. The blueline was made for law enforcement and has a cool emblem on the top of the slide. The sp2009 was the non railed predecessor to the sp2022 ,made in Switzerland when sig and sauer were just coming together. I think the non railed model looks much better as it stays more true to that classic sig look. The sig pros are every bit as durable as the p series sigs maybe even more so because the steel slide rides on beefy steel rails vs aluminum as in the p series.  They also have a better da trigger pull than the p series and are just as accurate .

All Matching numbers M48A Yugoslavian Mauser with bayonet and scabbard. [The number on the bayonet does not match the rifle]. Rifling is excellent, very crisp and shiny and I would rate the bluing and metal work as near perfect. It appears the cross bolt has been pushed back into the stock somewhat. I have seen this happen before with Mausers and may warrant some investigation. That said, the wood on the stock is really beautiful. Of note, there is a small arsenal repair on the right hand side near the front. Please call, text or e-mail if you have any questions. I can also e-mail you additional photos if interested.

I have a Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 380 with laser up for sale or for trade.
This gun was bought new and I have not fired it at all yet. The only reason I am selling is because my wife utterly hates the trigger on this thing, and I don't want to have a gun in the house that she is not comfortable with.

This handgun is in factory mint condition, and comes with the box, paperwork, shell casing from the factory -still sealed-, the gun itself, two magazines (one with the finger extension on it), and a black carrying case from Smith & Wesson.

I am open to either sell or trade, just shoot me what you have or what your offer is. I would like something small, for pocket carry or ankle carry, but just shoot me what you have. If need be, I may be able to add some cash for the right offer. The only limitation I have for sure is that the firearm I trade for must have a manual safety.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles. Simple rugged Garand-style action with breech bolt locking system, a fixed-pistol gas system and self cleaning moving gas cylinder gives unparalleled reliability under harsh operating conditions. Heavy , hammer-forged barrel for extra rigidity and accuracy. Accurate sighting system with “ghost ring” adjustable rear aperture sight and a protected, non-glare post front sight. Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings. Eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field. Flat, rifle-style butt pad for recoil reduction.

The Calico M950 is a semi-automatic pistol (also classified as a carbine) manufactured by Calico Light Weapons Systems in the United States. Its main feature, along with all the other guns of the Calico system, is to feed from a proprietary helical magazine mounted on top, available in 50 or 100-rounds capacity.

The Calico has enough barrel to enable attachment of a vertical foregrip, which is more suited to a submachine gun or a rifle. The factory sights enable reasonable accuracy to about 60 meters (197 feet), but 100 meters is a reasonable range."

A few months ago when I first moved to Nashville, I bought a Mossberg 500 for home defense for around $350 (pistol grip with stock included). I never once shot it since then.

Originally I didn't think I'd be doing any deer hunting here since I didn't know any landowners, but I have made friends since then who have offered to take me out this season.

Rather than have my family ship my rifle at home halfway across the country and because I will be going back and hunting over the holidays, I am looking to trade this thing for a 30-06 or 308 rifle (though I would be open to most anything).

I want to be able to get out in the woods next weekend, so looking to trade ASAP! It would be nice if a decent scope was included and you already have it shot in good so that I am ready to rock and roll by Saturday the 29th.

A straight trade would be ideal, though I would trade plus pay a little cash for the right gun.

I love this rifle and don't really need to sell it, but I do not have the time to enjoy it like I should.  I have only taken the rifle out a few times and have only completed a rough zero (I have not even set the zero stop), so it is time to let it go.  I would prefer to sell the rifle as a turn-key unit, but will part it out if need be.  Not really interested in trades... saving for my Vette.

The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases conceal-ability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floor plates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing conceal-ability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified link-less Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, case, three 13 round magazines, night sights and simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Included is a Streamlight TLR 3"
