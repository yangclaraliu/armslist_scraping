Extremely deep serarations on the slide both front and rear. Textured trigger finger placement spot on both sides of frame to place your finger until ready to fire. I think this is a great idea which will utimately help to maintain proper handling of any loaded pistol. Deeply textured side grip panels and nice stipeling both front and rearfor a solid grip.

Here's a great little 22 that I really like, so I’m selling it for a pinch more than the normal amount.

As you probably know, small (pocket) pistols tend to not be very accurate and have problems like failure to feed and/or extract.  This 22 is very accurate and it doesn't jam.  I hear people say 22's are not good for conceal carry, but let me tell you, unless it's a bear, it's not going to continue coming at you if you quickly pump 10 rounds into it.

There are some cheaper out there, but not in the San Antonio area.  And, who knows if they are accurate or if they jam. It will cost you to ship it, then you’ll have to pay the local dealer that it gets shipped to, then you’ll pay the taxes on it.
Here's a picture of me shooting one magazine thru it. I shot a bit high, not it. If I adjust my shots (as I do with more shots), I wipe out the red (3 inches at 10 yards). No other $150 gun can do this.

I then decided to get professional help to solve my problem. After having received many quotations from various companies, I decided to go ahead with Online Tech Repair (www.onlinetechrepairs.com). 

Reasons I chose them over the others:

1) They were extremely friendly and patient with me during my initial discussions and responded promptly to my request.

2) Their prices were extremely reasonable.

3) They were ready and willing to walk me through the entire process step by step and were on call with me till I got it fixed.

How did they do it?

1) They first asked me to state my problem clearly and asked me a few questions. This was done to detect any physical connectivity issues with the printer.

2) After having answered this, they confirmed that the printer and the laptop were functioning correctly.

3) They then, asked me if they could access my laptop remotely to troubleshoot the problem and fix it. I agreed.

4) One of the tech support executives accessed my laptop and started troubleshooting.

5) I sat back and watched as the tech support executive was navigating my laptop to spot the issue. The issue was fixed.

6) I was told that it was due to an older version of the driver that had been installed.

This pistol is chambered in 9mm and comes with two 17 round magazines, speed loader, original box, original paperwork, and original lock and cleaning kit. This particular pistol has only had 55 rounds down the pipe and then cleaned immediately after that single range session where I compared it to my Smith and Wesson M&P 9 Pro. The heavier S120 was much easier to hit with follow up shots due to the reduced recoil from the gun weight. The weapon shoots point of aim with a crisp single action and a slightly heavier, but very quick, double action. The frame cradles the slide, so instead of having four small contact points, the entire length of the frame is the contact point which improves the accuracy of the weapon my limiting any microscopic side to side movement of the slide. Disassembly, operation, and reliability are right up there (if not better than) their Cz75 counterpart. Once these guns are sold, people tend to hang on to them for a very long time, so gun shops run out of this popular model quickly and they don't pop up here or on gunbroker that often. Personally I love the way the gun fires and wouldn't be selling it if I didn't want to finish my AR-15 mid length build.  

I'm asking $475 obo. Please don't mistake this for gouging, but I like to start my prices a bit high so negotiation can occur. Feel free to toss me an offer, plus if you throw in a reason for a lower offer than I'm asking I am more inclined to agree with you.

The gun comes with three 10-round magazines and one 12-round mag. It has factory Meprolight Tritium Night Sights that still glow quite brilliantly, a case, and a really nice Galco Out-of-the-Waistband holster. The gun is also equipped with the LEM trigger system, something not commonly seen on the USP except when used by law enforcement. The trigger pull is a light, long pull for the first shot, where the following shots have a very short, single-action type reset. It's very unique, but once you try it, it is an amazing combination between the simplicity of a Glock but the (in my opinion) better feel of a hammer-fired pistol. It was previously owned by a LEO, but he hardly used it before switching it out for a Glock 22. His round count and mine both total around 500 rounds. In the scheme of things, it has been broken in and ready for you to shoot 20,000 more.

I am asking 680 for the whole package. Magazines for these guns typically run about 40 bucks a pop, night sights are a 100 dollar add-on, and the holster ran me 50. Best deal you can find on here for an amazingly reliable .40. If you would like pictures or have any questions, text me at REDACTED. You can also contact me through Armslist, and I can email you.

It has 8 gas recoil compensation ports.  The rear sight is adjustable for elevation and windage.  This is a beautiful gun in excellent condition.  There have only been 500 rounds of .38 Special and 90 Rounds of .357 Magnum fired through it.  Comes with the original box and literature.  Also comes with a well fitting Bianchi Cordura holster in as new condition, 12 Snap-Caps dummy rounds and a 7 round speed loader.  The gun has an integrated gun lock--and the key is included.  The trigger and hammer metal appear to have case hardened blueing.  Except for the stainless steel barrel insert, the rest of the metal is titanium.  I asked a factory Taurus guy at the 2013 NRA convention why they discontinued the titanium series of guns a number of years back. The reply was that due to the sky rocketing cost of titanium--this gun would have to retail for $1900 for them to sell it today.   This gun has a nice trigger--and in single action mode it is like a glass rod breaking.  It has a fluorescent orange wide blade front sight that is easy to pick up in a hurry.  The gun is incredibily light.  Folks that ask to hold it can't believe how light it is.  The gun will handle up to .357 Magnum +P hollow point loads--but not lead bullets in +P.  This is not a gun to go to the range and put 300 rounds of .357 Magnum through it in one go--it is a gun that is nearly impervious to weather--even salt water spray and is meant to be carried effortlessly and nearly unnoticed all day on your hip  until the time comes that you might need it.  The ribber grip is very comfortable and helps to mitigate perceived recoil.  My only reason for selling is that I'm moving to Canada in a few months and because the barrel is 2 mm too short--it puts it in the same category with flame throwers and bazookas.  This is a rare (the stainless version is somewhat common), discontinued gun, that doesn't come up for sale very often.  

I'm not interested in barter or trades.  Please don't ask if its still available--if the ad is still up it is.  I will only sell face to face, and you will need government issued photo ID that shows you are 21 years old or older."

L5AWM. The reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine. The L5AWM, a lightweight AR rifle magazine, fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs, combining the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine.

Unique to the L5AWM is the one piece wrap‐around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve to maximize feed to the 5.56X45mm NATO round with a non‐tilting follower for trouble‐free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET. The L5AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160, to name a few.

-Hardened steel feed lips

Handguard is a Hogue rubberized full float overmolded, a very comfortable fore grip.
Barrel is air gauged bead blasted stainless steel 1-8 twist with a low profile gas block. 
Rock River guarantees this upper at .75 MOA accuracy with quality ammunition.  I can personally say it will easily shoot dime sized groups at 100 yards.  I have put close to but less than 250 rounds through the barrel.

Scope detail:
See Nikon's website to see what a nice scope this is!   The scope also comes with all original packaging and additional turrents.
http://www.nikonsportoptics.com/Nikon-Products/Riflescopes/MONARCH-3-5-20x44-Side-Focus-BDC.html
I will separate the scope and upper.  Scope $350.  Upper with scope mount included $650  I am only selling to build an ultra light AR that I have always wanted.  
This setup all new is at $1300
May consider trade for Sig P227 carry, or Sig P229 with SRT"

Overall nice condition - no rust, good metal finish.  Handling marks here and there and some finish wear on the mag tube and action bars so this gun was not a safe queen, but was definitely not abused either.

barrel stamp of kxx indicated barrel date is 1951.  I believe this is the original barrel so receiver manufacture date should be very close to that.

super slick action like one would expect from an older wingmaster.

Looking to sell or trade my gently used (maybe 350 rounds fired) Ruger SR9c. I simply have too many handguns and I'm looking to pick up a nice hunting rifle before the season starts. This was my daily carry before I purchased an XDS .45 so there is some minor holster rubbing on the slide lock and release. 

*Suggested MSRP is $529, I'm asking $400 (firm) if purchasing straight up but will consider different options if you have a rifle you're willing to trade. 

*Comes with the original box, sales receipt, Blackhawk paddle holster, (2) magazines, speed loader, and (50) 9mm rounds.

It is apparently designed for commercial sales as a self-defense weapon. All D-series weapons seem to be of approximately the exact same external configuration, with the same length slide and gripframe, a semi-circular front sight and so on. 

Factory anodized model D

The alloy-framed DKI was in .32 (7.65 mm) caliber. Star's intentions with its compact pistols are not entirely clear when you compare the D and S series. The D seems to be simply a slightly smaller gun, but it is actually slightly heavier in weight and bulk, despite its reduced length. Also, the D has a full-legth guide rod, and a different (but still removable) barrel bushing. There are other detail differences in the design that would seem to have led to it being dropped at some point, but instead it was retained for reasons I cannot yet fathom. Since .32 was more common for European compact issue and defense weapons, it may have been intended for a specific export market.

The only visible variations I have seen are in grips, which could be wood, wood with medallions or checkered plastic with the Star logo.

This new 30-30 load was designed as the single 30-30 load for all big game hunting. The Barnes TSX opens fast enough to be brutal on deer sized critters, yet penetrates like TSX bullets normally do, so it gives ample penetration for larger species such as elk. While we feel the 30-30 is marginal for big bull elk, this is the load to use if you choose to pursue elk with a 30-30 and then use the same load to hunt deer, so you don’t have to readjust your sights for differing loads. This is the perfect load to hunt black bear of all sizes with as the bullet will expand fast enough to deliver terminal devastation on smallish bear, but will penetrate deeply enough for 500+ lb bear.



The below velocities were shot from my personal rifles. We believe the industry wide use of extra long laboratory test barrels gives unrealistic high velocities that you’ll never realize in hunting rifles. So, we give you real world velocities from real world rifles, so you know what to expect in the real world, where it matters.

This Zastava AK comes with two 30 round metal magazines (BHO followers), sling, side rail mount, and original box.  The rifle has 200 rounds through it and functions great.  It is definitely a heavier receiver than a WASR, you can feel the weight difference.  These rifles don't come with a rear sling mount or a sling.  I installed the rear mount and added the sling.  I also added a side rail optics mount.  It has a quick detach lever and provides a top rail for an optic and a side rail for whatever else someone might want.  The only minor imperfection on this gun is that the front sight post has to be set more to the left to shoot straight.  You can see it in the third picture.  As it is set right now it shoots perfectly straight and is very accurate.  Since this is a long gun a FTF transaction would be fine, provided the buyer can show they are a legal PA resident and state that they are not prohibited from owning firearms (LTCF preferred).  Really looking to sell, but if you have any trades you are welcome to offer."

Looking to sell my Rock River Arms ar15. I bought it from a friend of a friend a few years ago, and recently built a PSA ar15 pistol, so I want to get rid of this. It has maybe 2,000 rounds through it. It has never malfunctioned at all, even when shooting cheap steel cased ammo. As far as I can tell, it's a RRA LAR-15 Entry Tactical. I'm not entirely sure though, here's the link to that. http://www.rockriverarms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&category_id=217

The modifications to the rifle are an SJC Titan Compensator ($90), Magpul BAD lever ($30), UTG pro quad rails ($60), Magpul AFG2 ($30), a rubbery pistol grip with storage ($15), PSA tactical latch charging handle ($30), and an engraved ejection port cover ($20). It has a PSA flip up aluminum rear sight that is brand new, the one (forgot the brand) I had one before broke, so I ordered the PSA one with my pistol stuff. The comp does really well with controlling the muzzle rise, it shoots great. I also have the 12 rubber UTG rail covers as well, enough to cover left, right, and bottom rails. I will throw in a single 30 round DSC aluminum mag as well.

I'd like to get $750 for it as it sits in the pictures. Without the comp, extended charging handle, quad rails, AFG, and BAD lever, I'd like $650. I don't want any trades, and I won't sell anything off the rifle separately unless the rifle gets sold first. 

Here's a link to an imgur album with more detailed pics, I can also take any more detailed picture requested.
