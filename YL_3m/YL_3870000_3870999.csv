153,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3870153,For Sale:  Incomplete AR Pistol Build,"Springfield / Nashville, Nashville, Tennessee","$ 1,000","Listed On: Thursday, January 1, 2015",Handguns,Springfield,no type,no type,no type,"* EDIT - I have a buyer for the sights and Noveske KX3, if a buyer doesn't want them as part of the package.


I really, really, really, really don't want to do this, but I really, really, really, really want to get into photography. This is probably the most difficult Classifieds ad I've ever had to place.   

Everything listed is brand new. I've yet to finish the build, so nothing has been used. I started this build with a 300 Blackout pistol in mind, but everything can be used for a .223/5.56 build, with the exception of the Noveske KX3 Flash Suppressor. If you don't want to build a 300 BLK, I may be willing to sell the Noveske separately, assuming there's an interested buyer. 

I will be completely honest; I'm not willing to lose much money on this deal. The prices you will see below do not account for transfer fee, background check, taxes, shipping, my time, etc. Please keep that in mind. If you are looking for a budget AR, this probably isn't for you. This wasn't going to be the most expensive build ever, but the build I had planned didn't include much of a budget. With that being said, I did my very best to find the best prices on each item. 

As most of you know, CMT Tactical gave us a steep discount on the group buy for the TGO (TennesseeGunOwners.com) upper and lower receivers. For those of you who weren't around at that time, we paid about $270 for the set. That's about $135 off the regular price. In the figures below, you will see that I am honoring the discounted price we paid.


Build list and Prices I Paid:

CMT Tactical billet upper and lower receivers (TGO logo) - $270

MAS Defense fluted buffer tube, buffer, buffer spring - $60

Phase 5 foam buffer tube cover - $7

Rainier Arms Raptor ambidextrous charging handle - I traded for this, but they are about $90 - Not pictured, but here is a link: http://www.primaryarms.com/Rainier_Arms_Rapto…/raptor556.htm

AIM NiB v2 bolt carrier group- $130 - Not pictured, but here is a link to see what it looks like: http://www.aimsurplus.com/product.aspx?item=XAIMNiBBCGV2&name=AIM+NiB+v2+.223%2f5.56+AR%2fM16+Bolt+Carrier+Group&groupid=929

Noveske  KX3 (PIG) flash suppressor - $125

Engraved dust cover $14

Ironworks Tactical LPK / BAD ASS safety selector / ALG ACT trigger group / KNS anti-rotation pins - $170

Seekins Precision billet magazine release / Seekins Precision enhanced bolt catch - $23

Noveske  QD endplate - $25

Umbrella Corporation grip  $19 

Stippled CMT logo on grip (both sides) to match upper and lower receivers - $40

Magpul MBUS Pro front and rear sights - $140

Total - $1113 (not including transfer fee, background check, taxes, shipping fees, my time, etc.)

I am placing a firm price of $1000 on the entire package. If the buyer doesn't want the Noveske KX3, and there's a buyer for it, I will sell separately. If this is how it works out, I will take $120/shipped for the KX3.

As I said, I'm only selling this to fund a camera and gear. If I were going to trade for anything, that's probably the only thing I'm interested in. 

I live in Springfield, work out of Nashville (Briley Parkway & Elm Hill Pike), but travel all over middle Tennessee during the week. I may be coming to your area soon.

I still have the original box and manual. It is near mint condition, and is no longer made. Beretta made this weapon almost identical to the Benelli Super 90, and some of the parts and accessories will even interchange, that is why they stopped making it, Benelli kind of got upset at their parent company for making it. It is a superb shooter, and will not disappoint in any form or fashion. I have not fired the weapon more than a complete box of shells in its life time. This would make a superb home self defense weapon.

New in the Box, the highly sought after Saiga-762 rifle!  The auto-loader based on the famed Russian AK-47, built in the same factory as Russia’s military weapons.   Imported by RWC, this example does NOT have the old importer’s name dimpled out of the side of the receiver like a lot of these have;  if you’ve seen those it looks like a strip of Velcro on the right side above the trigger.  As you can see in the pictures, that ugly blemish is not present!  Factory fresh, dripping in Russian oil, 2013/2014 production.  This is the tactical model, already converted to true AK fashion with the pistol grip, 2-piece handguard (quad rail with removable rail sections), muzzle device, adjustable AR-15 style stock with storage compartment.  Already set-up by the importer to accept standard AK47 mags, it includes a 30-round magazine from US Palm! (great magazines)"

The Benchmark for 22 Rifles – Experience the Tradition. The Ruger® 10/22® rifle is America’s favorite 22 LR rifle, with proven performance in a wide range of styles for every rimfire application. Ideally suited for informal target shooting, ""plinking,"" small game hunting and action-shooting events, Ruger has sold millions of 10/22 rifles since their introduction in 1964. With its legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged and superbly accurate. With a variety of choices – from the standard 10/22 Carbine, to the tack-driving accuracy of the Target model, the 10/22 is still today’s most popular 22 rifle. It looks right, feels right, shoots right and continues to perform under heavy use - inspiring the most fanatical loyalty from its owners. With proven design, legendary reliability and the modern features demanded by today’s 22 LR shooters, these firearms are priced right to make keeping tradition affordable. 

This Ruger 11129 has a MSRP of $399!  We are offering it for nearly 1/3 off!!  Cheaper than you will find anywhere locally not even factoring in sales tax which is included in the price I am selling it for!

The LaserMax Laser sold separately on the Ruger site retails for $129.95 and I have seen them as high as $153

This model is being sold on the Gander Mountain site for $349.99 and you would need to add tax and FFL fee to that price to get it shipped here.

Bud's Gun Shop has them for $268.83 plus they want you to buy insurance to insure it arrives safely and you will have to pay the FFL fee on top of that.

These are available NOW here in Rio Rancho.  No FFL fee!  No Sales Tax!  No hidden charges.   We also have additional magazines up to 25 round capacity available also.

I bought it in February of 2012 from someone who let it sit in their garage for 10 years. It was not in operable condition when I bought it, but I have been working on restoring it ever since. It was my daily driver during the summer of '13, but I really needed something better for snow driving. Selling it because I can't afford to keep 2 cars on the insurance.

Runs, drives, and stops reliably, but not putting out a lot of power (I don't consider it roadworthy). If I fix this issue, the price will increase. New starter, master cylinder & front wheel cylinders, fuel line, distributor, ignition coil, and newly rebuilt carburetor.

Radio doesn't work, one of the valve covers leaks oil, and some of the weatherstripping is not installed. Also, the blinkers (turn signal and emergency) come on, but don't blink. The horns are not installed, but I have some which (along with several other spare parts) will be included in the sale. Engine is not original--it has a 1.2 L 1965 engine.

This shotgun is in like new condition with only four shells through it. If you are not familiar with this shotgun it is made in Turkey by the same factories that make the Canik CZ75 clones and TP9, Winchester SXP, and many other quality firearms. This is a 5+1 pump action that will chamber 3 inch shells. Has a built in recoil pad and pistol grip, as well as a nice set of fiber optic ghost ring sights, a receiver mounted picatinny rail, a removable breacher choke, and is VERY lightweight. This is a Benelli pattern shotgun and will accept extended benelli magazine tubes. Very similar to a Benelli M3 (sans the semi auto functionality) for a fraction of the cost.

In great shape but Ive had a few shotguns with pistol grips and ring sights and Ive found that I prefer a straight stock with a bead sight. This shotgun retails for $299, Id like to trade it for a similalrly priced 12 gauge shotgun with a straight stock, bead sight, and 18-20 inch cylinder bore barrel, such as a Remington 870, Mossberg 500/maverick 88, winchester sxp, or similar. Only looking for combat/hd style shotguns, absolutely not interested in field guns, sorry.

Marketed as a compact but its really just shy of a full size. Heavy gun, I have carried it with no issues but I'm a big guy and I wear loose clothes. Small framed people may not like it for carrying but I actually just keep it in the car most of the time. I'd rather carry my Sccy.
Haven't fired it since I bought it, I have another gun, bought this one recently to have a backup but I spent too much over the holidays. If you aren't familiar with the Serbian CZ's (not the same as CZ-USA), I encourage you too research them first. Reviews on this particular gun are all good. Asking $280 firm (no less, so please don't offer because I will say no). Must have valid IN license or ID to purchase, prefer you have CCW license too but that's not a deal breaker.
