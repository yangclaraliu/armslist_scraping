I see matching serial number on as much as i am dare to take apart, i have taken it apart, minus the trigger assembly. I'm afraid to go any further that i'm unable to put back together. Even the grips are matching serial #'s to the pistol.
I'm wanting to sell as the ammo is hard to find and to expensive to shoot, to costly for me, to have fun shooting it. I've never shot it.

California: Sorry will not ship to your state, vote those pukes out and get back to being Americans.

FTF is always the safest and the cheapest, shipped to your FFL at your cost. check can take up to 10-12 days when funds are collected.
Also a safe way is using PISOLPAY.COM fee's will be paid buy the buyer on both sides.

If out of NH and come here to pick it up.  It will have to be done through my FFL dealer his cost is $10.00 for transfer. For 1 gun or 10 guns one cost $10, so i would feel better doing it this way. He is closed Sundays. In NH drivers license and a bill of sale."

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1 overall length and an 18.5 cylinder bore barrel. The KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3 rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Shotgun is like new, only on the range 1 day and has only 1 box of shells fired through it. Comes with box, instruction manual and sling.

Price is firm."

M9A1: The Evolution of a Classic Tactical Pistol

The Beretta M9A1 tactical pistol evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the US Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces. Thanks to its accuracy, durability and versatility, it also makes a superb choice for personal or home-defense as well as concealed carry.
Extra-Durable Pistol and Magazines

Just as the US Marines are rightly famous for their reliability and endurance, the M9A1 is built to be ultra-tough and always dependable. Besides the superior steels of which it is constructed, it also features a unique sand-resistant magazine that was developed for the sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan and comes standard only on the M9A1. The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of grit accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 even in the most extreme conditions.

Packed with Features

As you take the M9A1 out of the box, it won’t fail to impress you for the abundance of tactical features it offers. Firstly, there is an integral Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail situated under the barrel, for easy attachment of accessories such as tactical lights and laser aiming devices. The 3-dot sight system on this pistol is optimized for quick acquisition of the target, while the front and backstrap of the frame are checkered to ensure a positive purchase no matter the weather conditions. Also, the magazine well has an aggressive internal bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat as well as competition situations.

Soft-Shooting, Accurate and Easy to Maintain

At the range, the M9A1 will impress you for its low recoil, as well as its accuracy. As one of the ultimate evolutions of a best-in-class military and law-enforcement pistol, it will reliably feed commercial ammo, even with more open hollow-point designs. Maintenance is easy: this pistol requires no tools for disassembly, while the reverse is even faster and easier, with the disassembly lever returning into the locked position automatically. Thanks to all these features, the M9A1 is an ideal tactical pistol that will meet the requirements of the most demanding users.

It is in great condition and we have fired about 200 rounds through it since owning it but it is just too big for my wife's hands. (These are currently selling at ""Bud's Gun Shop"" online for $300)

I also have a Russian 1891/30 7.62x54R Mosin Nagant Rifle with Hex receiver that has a long eye relief scope, bent bolt handle, and a soft buttplate along with around 400 rounds in an ammo can.

The 9MM sells for around $300
The Mosin sells for about $100  
The scope, bolt, and buttplate were $60
The ammo was about $90

I would sell the Arcus 9MM  for $250 and the Mosin Nagant with all accessories and ammo for $180, or will trade both for a Ruger LC9S.

If you're only interested in one of the weapons, I will sell them separately."

A very nice Savage 110 Wood/Blue in .300 Win Mag. Got a few rounds of Ammo to go with it. 3-9X40 Tasco Scope on Weaver bases and rings. This rifle is accurate with a #2 contour 24 inch barrel. No AccuTrigger, but breaks clean at about 50 ounces. $500.
Weatherby Vanguard I in .308 Win. Synthetic camo/blue with 3-9X40 Charles Daly Scope on Leupold bases and rings. Good shooter, easy toter, $500.
OR
For you economy oriented folks, a Savage 110 originally marketed as a Western Auto ""Revelation"" .308 Win. It is ugly as sin, wood stock that someone tried to camo, I stripped it and applied 9 coats of polyurathane. It is stable and shoots well, just ugly. 
NO scope or sights, does have weaver bases. $300.

You may wish to add a Truglo 2X30mm Red Dot sight with a 2.5 MOA dot. Pretty accurate. $90 alone or add $75 to any rifle above or I will swap it for one of the scopes for even money. 
For you tire kickers, PLEASE don't ask what is the least I would take? Make a real offer, back it up by peeling off the Andy Jacksons and you might be surprised.

The barrel has the 25 25 import stamps and the lock plate is a Tower dated 1860.  Nipple protector, chain and ramrod are period reproductions.  These rifles were highly prized and in great demand by both sides for their maneuverability and long-range accuracy also often used by cavalry.

It has a 20"" barrel with a bead sight, the magazine tube holds 8 shells plus one in the chamber,  six shot Tac-star side saddle, and heat shield. The stock was replaced with the mesa tactical LEO telescoping recoil stock kit/adapter that allows for QD mount points. Basically the stock now has a hogue pistol grip with an adjustable M4 stock with a buffer tube that is a hydraulic piston that reduces recoil to next to nothing. This gives you the reliability of a pump action and the softer shooting of a semi-auto. A link to the website is below. Let me know if you have any questions.

INFO: No import marks.
Japanese Arisaka Type 99 Paratrooper Takedown, 7.7 mm cal. bolt action military rifle. Serial #16xxx, mfg. Nagoya Arsenal, Japan. Very good condition. Standard issue to World War II Jap (nip) jumpers - has a turn-bolt mid-section that twists and allows the gun to taken down to half its length for insertion into a jump kit. This rifle is very nice with 94% finish, excellent bore and just a few war hits on the wood. Bolt matches to receiver serial number. '860' is on the barrel and that matches with the takedown piece closest to the breech and the outer takedown piece is serial the same as the receiver. No cleaning rod. Good tight action. Dust cover is serialized '037'. Bayonet lug. Mum is ground - usually the case. Ladder type flip-up rear military sights with aircraft sighting 'wings'. Sling swivels. The bayonet and steel scabbard was also captured - very good condition - mfg. Kokura Arsenal and so marked. Very collectible and one of the 'Holy Grail' of the World War II Jap (nip) trophies. No import marks, Great GI bring back!
