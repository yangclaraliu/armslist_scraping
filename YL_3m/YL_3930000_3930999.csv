DuPont’s Military Plastic Division, MADE IN THE USA.

BUPSWF Features and Functions:

• Low profile snag resistant design

This one is brand new, unused and unfired, in its case as it comes from the factory.

I picked it up recently but was torn between it and a SIG p320, but I went home with the Glock.  Now I kinda regret passing on the SIG, so I thought I'd list the g19 and see if anyone has a p320 in similar condition they'd be interested in trading.  Specifically looking for a 9mm compact/carry model.
Would also be interested in a Walther PPQ in 9mm, but otherwise not really interested in other trades and I'm not looking to sell.

I have my ccl, if interested feel free to call text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3,  texts preferred.

Let's play who is the moron.  Here are your options:1. the idiot that lists on Armslist a used version of this firearm for $$$$ more than what I am asking for BNIB;2. the guy that pays that for the used one; or3. me for selling brand new fireams at such incredibly low prices.My wife picks #3 (but for totally unrelated reasons).Born of the Traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the Legendary Single Action Army Revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22 LR the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic laminated, or white grips, makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome. Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting. Let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. PROUDLY MADE IN OUR USA. All Heritage revolvers combine quality and affordability ... an American tradition. This has consistantly been one of the top selling handguns in the United States for the last 2 decades. They look great, they work great and they are at a great price. This is the perfect glove box or field carry revolver and just tons of fun to shoot.   It's affordable to own and inexpensive to shoot.

Two detention plates for V1 and V9, and extra magazine base plates.

 The V1 plate lets the gun function as follows: DA/SA with safety and decocker on the left hand side.

 The V9 plate causes the gun to function as follows: DA/SA with safety, but no de-cocker.

 These switch out in less than a minute when you field strip the gun to clean it. Just allows the owner to have the choice of having a V1 variant USP or a V9 variant. All about personal preference. V9 functions basically like a 1911.

 Gun is excellent, functions flawlessly, very very light wear. I will not part this out. If the buyer would like to sell off the magazines or some of them at the $50-60 they go for, that is fine with me. Same goes with the holsters.

Looking at and shooting this gun a few times to test it out (have never hunted with it) I expected it was less than ten years old.

MORE INFO if you're curious, my reply to a past inquirer:
     ""Mind if I ask what you didn't like about it?""
I'm a gimp with a bad left elbow (all metal) and believe a lighter, less expensive bolt action could work for me.  Earlier this year I thought my only chance at hunting was an automatic, but after working a Ruger bolt I'm going to focus on a bolt before committing to a semi-auto.  By committing I mean I'd have a gunsmith fit a scope to it.  This is a great gun.  I'm not going to move a dime since if the bolt doesn't work out for my elbow I'd rather keep the BAR as my back up rifle than let it go for less.  A helluva backup."

I bought this to mount on my M4 while in Afghanistan. Given the generally long range nature of engagements in those mountains, the standard M68 CCO just didn't seem to cut it. Ah, to be a young single soldier with an entirely disposable paycheck... It has scuff marks on it after a year of hard use. The glass is immaculate, any blemishes are entirely superficial. However, it holds its zero perfectly and the glass is everything you'd expect from a roughly $2900 optic.

I'm asking $2100 for the optic, which will include shipping anywhere in the contiguous 48. Reasonable offers will be entertained."
