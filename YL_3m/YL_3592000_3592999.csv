I have a NIB, unfired outside of the factory Glock 42 .380.  This was purchased for my wife, and she decided that she did not want to carry a pistol on her person.  It comes in the box with papers and 2 magazines.  As soon as I purchased this pistol, I had a set of TruGlo Tritium Fiber Optic night sights manufactured specifically for the Glock 42 installed.  These sights glow super bright in the daylight due to the fiber optic, and then at night they are super bright due to the tritium backlighting the fiber optic. I have also included a right hand Raven Concealment Phantom holster with belt loops specifically fit for the Glock 42. This package cost me over 600.00  I am willing to sell for 550.00, which is a great deal for anybody looking for a perfect carry pistol at a great price.  This is a turn key set up, as I will also include some .380 defense ammunition.  I have enough to fill the magazines to get you started.  Best to text Nine One Eight 210 Zero Six 51  This package will sell fast."

I am selling my Larue Costa Edition OBR Hybrid for $4000.00 OBO.  The rifle has 60 rounds down the barrel outside of the factory.  Rifle comes in the case with Larue goodies, paperwork, test target, and some extras.  I installed a Magpul BAD Lever, Magpul MOE Plus ""rubberized"" FDE grip, Larue POD on the CTR Stock, and it comes with a Magpul FDE AVG2 not installed.  I installed two Larue OBR rails forward on the hand guard that I had left over from my OBR, so the rifle comes with those two installed already and the 3 rails that came with the Costa still NIW.  The COSTA OWNER's Edition hat has not been worn.  This is one of only 500 to be produced by Larue and thus far only 375 have been manufactured.  This is number 170.  These don't come up for sale very often, so if this is what you want, please contact me.  I know there are always some for sale on here that are scams.  Due to scams, I will be happy to text ""proof of possession"" pictures.  You can tell me what you want to see, or what to write on a paper and I will take a picture with the rifle and text it to you.  I have found that this resolves the concerns about purchasing from Armslist.  You can email through the site here or text me Nine One Eight 210 Zero Six 51.  Will do FTF in Tulsa Oklahoma or ship if you cover shipping and insurance."

This rifle is 30.06 and all American made.  Remington 1903A3 rifles are much more common than Smith-Corona made ones because only just over 200,000 were ever made between 1942-1944.  Smith-Corona was a typewriter company before and during WWII. The bore is in very good condition with strong rifling and grooves. There is no rust in the bore. This rifle will make a great shooting rifle.  The NRA magazine wrote a great article about this exact rifle:

The new, remarkably ergonomic SIG P227™. It’s a .45ACP that holds 10+1 rounds — but you’d hardly know it from the thinness of the grip. Take hold of this high-power, high-capacity pistol and you’ll see first-hand how we’ve stacked the odds in your favor. The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. So it should come as no surprise that the SIG SAUER® P227® Equinox has evolved from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop. The P227 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail.

I have the exact one except for the handguards, the one you will be getting has midlenght. 

For the lower: It has KNS precision anti rotation pins, a Geissele SD-3G trigger, an exile machine hammerhead grip and a magpul moe rifle stock. If you were to buy this rifle, all you would need to do is install a non-flash suppressing muzzle device to be considered featureless and not have that annoying bullet button anymore. Also, use a magazine of any capacity if you happen to legally own some. 
Id prefer to do the transfer at Four Seasons outfitters, as it is very close to me and I am not currently mobile. If your just interested in the upper, we can arrange a pickup. 

Also, I can take more pictures, please feel free to contact me for more.

It was manufactured in 1939 with a low serial number 6xxx.  It has a Lyman 58E peep sight and a Lyman 77R hooded front sight.  Everything is original:  sling swivels, bolt, sights, butt plate, magazine.  The proofmarks match on barrel and receiver are matching.  The rifle is drilled and tapped, but I believe these may be factory drillings based on my research.  There are scope mounts but they are only marked with a 15 on one and a 16 on the other.  

The finish appears to be original factory finish.

This rifle was very likely purchased by the US Government right before or after the US entry into WWII to be used as a trainer rifle for training US Army recruits.  Research on this rifle is difficult as apparently records were not kept by Winchester or the US Army.  I have spent hours researching this rifle and I am fairly certain it was used as a military trainer, despite the fact that there are no markings.  Also, my late father told me the same based on whomever he got the rifle from.

This rifle is definitely collectable.  The condition is good with light scratches.  There is a small bit of stock removed from under the peep sight - unknown origin.

I'd like fair cash value or trade.

I can send more detailed photos if desired."

The model 1917 is an adaptation of the S&W 2nd model hand ejector modified to fire 45 ACP for use by US soldiers at a time when not enough M1911s could be manufactured to meet demand. The weapon utilizes full or half moon clips to allow for use of the rimless cartridge- it can be used without moon clips but fired casings are more difficult to extract, 45 auto rims can also be used. 
In 1937 Brazil ordered 25,000 of the model 1917 to equip their army.

Quantity left:  3

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.

In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit."

It was produced for the Polish Border Guard and Prison Guard (Straż Więzienna) in the 1990's. 
Made in the Z.M. Lucznik factory 11 at Radom Poland. 

These fine pistols feature a ambidextrous decocker safety, steel slide, alloy frame, and serrated trigger guard front strap.
In 1996 the Mag 98 was evaluated for adoption purposes by the Polish Army. It had advantages over its competition such as 
better reliability, durability and safety (better protection against accidental discharge, when dropped). 

Although the quality was deemed superior,  the MAG 98 was rejected by the Army because the frame was slightly larger
than  the contract qualifications called for. That was a shame because most service members prefered it and in fact 
the pistol has a good reputation among users: It is considered a precise, well balanced and durable weapon 
and its mass leads to good stability during firing. 

This double/single action pistol comes with ONE 15rd magazine. 

Condition of Pistol is Surplus Very Good / Excellent... May show some finish rub on sharp edges but overall very nice.

I enjoy many hobbies and after a lot of research I pieced this 10/22 together. My goal for the gun was to be very accurate with high velocity and ""hyper"" velocity ammo such as cci velocitor. I will list what is modified below.

+Entire action and first two inches of the barrel are glass bedded

+After that two inches of glass bedding the rest of the barrel is free floated

+20 inch standard contour green mountain barrel with a chamber that is in between a match chamber and standard chamber

+Heavy bolt handle and higher force bolt spring for slower cycling with ammo similar to cci velocitor. Also a polymer bolt buffer.

+A2 steel extraction claw and higher force spring to ensure extraction with the tighter chamber on this barrel

+Many mods to the trigger assembly, I will have trouble remembering all of these as it was a few years ago that I built this gun. Lower force springs where needed to reduce trigger pull, after market trigger and I polished the parts of it that rub against any metal, set screw.

+Trigger went from the bad 5lb plus factory trigger to an ok trigger. Still isn't a kidd assembly by any means.

+3-9×40 scope. The scope isn't in great condition but it holds zero, has small crosshairs and has a clear view. You can hear something rub and click as you change power but it works fine.

None of what I am about to list are flaws, they are just what comes with making the gun have a more specific purpose.
With the tighter chamber on the barrel some types of ammo don't extract well, I would say 10 percent struggle to cycle reliably because of this. This is why i didn't go with an all out match chamber, and landed on a compromise between standard and match chambers. You just have to find some types that you like and that shoot accurate and stick with them. Low power ammo like subsonics don't cycle the heavier bolt and bolt spring.

I havn't even shot this gun a whole lot because a few months after a put it together the .22 shortage happened.

- Operates in automatic and semi-automatic applications

- Patent pending feed device allows the magazine to run massive spring pressures without effecting the firearm's bolt operation
- Durable body is constructed entirely of aluminum and finished in a friction reducing ceramic coating
- All internal and operating assemblies are made of black oxide steel and aluminum, only the followers are made from a high impact, glass filled nylon
