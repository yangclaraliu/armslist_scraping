Both magazines have the Keltec pinky extender for a better fit for larger hands. Comes with the Kel-tec belt clip to wear the pistol by itself on the inside of blue jeans. Also will include the metal spring rod modification and trigger shoe. The metal rod is supposed to remove some of the felt recoil. I really didn't notice much of a difference. The trigger shoe uses allen headed set screws and screws onto the side of the trigger. This gives the trigger a wider feel and it does make it feel easier to pull the trigger. I will include 50 rounds of 115 grain ball ammo and 10 rounds of Hornady XTP 147 grain self defense rounds. Purchaser must also show valid photo ID.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) Trigger (aka: Combat Defense Action)
Developed especially for the U.S. government, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a USP DAO (Double-Action Only) model with a unique trigger mechanism. This mechanism improves the double action trigger performance and reduces the weight of the DAO trigger pull to 7.5–8.5 pounds-force (33–38 N), uses a stronger hammer spring, and shortens the trigger reset. Aside from the LEM mechanism, it is identical to the USP Variant 7 (DAO) model."

This gun comes with 3 mags (2 flush and 1 extended), a Guardian IWB holster ($70 value) and a kydex Dara IWB holster ($35 value). It also comes with the original box and paperwork. 

The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability

MAKAROV PISTOL MODEL PA-63 CALIBER 9x18mm MAKAROV

The Military standard PA-63 version sports a two-tone polished aluminum frame with black slide, grips, trigger and hammer assembly. 

The FEG PA-63 pistol was developed during early 1960s at the Hungarian FEG arms factory as a compact military sidearm, chambered for the Warsaw pact standard 9x18 Makarov ammunition of Soviet origin. The basic design of the FEG PA-63 pistol was heavily based on the German Walther PP pistol, a copy of which was produced by FEG shortly after the WW2. FEG also produced a number of derivatives of the PA-63, such as 'export commercial' model AP-63, chambered for widely available 9x17 Browning / .380 ACP and 7.65 Browning / .32ACP ammunition. Both PA-63 and AP-63 pistols were similar in design, and differed only in ammunition used and in frame finish - military-issue PA-63 pistols had their aluminum frames left 'in the white', while commercial AP-63 pistols have their aluminum frames finished in same black color as the rest of the gun.
The FEG PA-63 pistol is a simple blowback operated weapon. The return spring is located around the barrel, the trigger is of traditional double-action type with exposed hammer. Manual safety lever, which doubles as a decocker, is located at the left side of the slide. Gun is fed from single stack box magazines, magazine release button is located on the left side of the frame, above and behind the trigger.

Using HK's unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system, the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter are reduced by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance. Variant 1 is a DA/SA with a manual safety/decocking lever) on left side of frame.

If the last round appears impossible to load, for example if the magazine should hold 15 rounds and it will only accept 14, leave it loaded with 14 rounds for several days to allow the spring's tension to decrease. After a short time, the magazine should then accept its full capacity, but it may still be necessary to use the magazine loader. After several cycles of full capacity through empty, the magazine will be easier to load. 

Glock 33-Round Magazines feature a polymer follower, Glock #SP01812-6, MidwayUSA #927957 and a +2 style basepad to allow the magazine to hold 33 rounds."

KEL TEC PISTOL MODEL P-11 CALIBER 9 MM

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members.
The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.

Heavy 10mm Ammo - 200 gr. F.M.J. (1,200fps/M.E. 639 ft.lbs.) - 20 Round Box

The Buffalo Bore Heavy 10 mm ammo is the result of many years of customers requests that we produce several such loads for the 10 mm.

These loads bring out the full potential of the 10mm, but operate at standard pressures and as such, are safe to use in any standard 10mm pistol. Please don't phone us and ask if these loads are safe in your 10mm - THEY ARE - provided your 10mm is a normal operating pistol in good condition.

We are using flash-suppressed powders so your vision will not be materially affected should you be required to drop the hammer in low light.

If you are firing this 10mm ammo from an autoloader and experience high extreme spreads in velocity, it is not the ammo. Here is why and how to remedy the situation.

Full power 10mm ammo has always generated enough recoil and pressure to require a pretty stiff recoil spring in your handgun - this of course depends on several variables such as your slide weight, etc. When the cartridge fires, it generates enough pressure/recoil to prematurely open your breech face in some guns. When this happens, the opening breech face has an effect on the burn rate of the powder. This can result in some fairly high extreme spreads in velocity. If you are experiencing extreme velocity spreads of more than 50 fps, simply install a stiffer recoil spring. For example, I have an original Colt Delta Elite. This gun with the factory spring runs extreme spreads of about 35fps with both of these 10mm loads. I am happy with 35 fps, so I leave the Delta Elite as is. I also have a custom built Para Ordinance with a Nowlin barrel. It runs extreme spreads of about 70 fps with its original recoil spring. When I install a spring that is 4 lbs stiffer, the extreme spread drops to about 35 fps. The new Glock model 20 comes with a recoil spring that allows the breech face to open too soon and my new Glock model 20 will get extreme spreads of about 100fps with the factory spring installed. When I go to a stiffer recoil spring, the extreme spreads drop to about 50 fps in my new Glock model 20. Of course none of this will be an issue in a revolver. None of this will be an issue in real life either, as these high extreme spreads don't hurt accuracy or function. However, I mention this because if you are like me and want things to be as correct as possible, I have outlined the problem and the solution. The industry fixed all these problems initially, by watering down the 10mm ammo over the last several years. The watered down 10mm ammo does not generate the pressure/recoil to open the breech face early. If you want the full powered 10mm ammo we make, you simply need to tweak your pistol. Or just realize that you are getting some fairly high extreme spreads and ignore it or live with it. It's not hurting any thing in reality.

Please understand that we get hundreds of emails per day. If we don't answer your email, it is not because we don't value your patronage, but it is because we simply don't have the manpower to answer so many emails. Thank you for your business. Have fun and be safe.

Please note below, my personal velocities taken from real pistols:
1.       1198 fps - Glock model 20 4.6 inch barrel
2.       1223 fps - Colt Delta Elite 5 inch barrel
3.       1244 fps - Para Ordinance 1911 with Nowlin 5 inch barrel"

This Beretta 8045 F Mini Cougar is a semi-auto pistol which fires the .45 ACP round. It has a matte black finish and a 3-3/4"" barrel. This pistol has an ambidextrous safety / de-cocker and comes with two 8-round grip-extending magazines, one 6-round magazine, its box, manual, lock, cleaning brushes, hardcase and 2 holsters.

The Mini is simply a Cougar with the grip frame cut short. It retains the same length barrel and slide as the regular Cougar, but it’s just easier to conceal. Most handguns out there made for concealment are all just short barreled, and that’s fine for making the gun easier to carry. But a short barrel alone does nothing for the weapon’s concealability. When you carry a handgun concealed under a shirt or jacket, what part is most likely to print and is most likely to be noticeable? It’s the grip. Shortening that grip makes the gun that much easier to conceal because there is that much less grip to print and give you away.

Double action striker fire with numerous internal safeties make for an ideal carry piece -- ready when you need it, safe when you don't. Heavy weight and ideal ergonomics make it shoot like a much larger gun. Accurate and dead reliable. This example has been around a bit. I am not the first owner, but this gun was built to last: all-steel CNC construction. Even the plastic followers in the magazines have a metal slide detent for a lifetime of use. Made with pride in the USA, by Moonies.

I don't really want to sell this piece but an impulse buy of another nine means I could use the money, and I rarely carry it. All reasonable offers entertained -- not looking to get anything like full retail on this thing. MSRP on these is $891.00. I paid $550 for this one in its current used condition.

I fired only 90 rounds out of this rifle before I cleaned it and put it away. The model number is: RA-16-M-TE-556

This rifle also has a VLTOR IMOD collapsible stock, Ergo grip, and a Samson free float quad rail that all came standard from the factory. The only modifications I did to this rifle are that I added a AAC Blackout Flash Hider that is suppressor ready, and a ambi single-point sling attachment.

I purchased this weapon from the CMP in Dec 2005 and have never fired it. I wiped most of the cosmoline off of it, greased it up and stored it in the safe. It is in better than the required minimum condition (see below) for Correct Grade CMP Garand’s. All parts and stock are certified by the CMP to be correct for this manufacturer and date. 

It comes with the original cardboard shipping box and the Certificate of Authenticity for a Correct Grade CMP rifle.

Post war Garand’s are acknowledged to be some of the best ever made. This barrel was made in Sept of 1954 and the serial number indicates the rifle was most probably assembled sometime in late 1954 or early 1955.

CMP now sells Correct Grade Garand’s by auction only. ( www. cmpauction.thecmp.org ) They normally go for a good bit more than my firm price of $1,400 cash. Face to face in middle TN.

From the Civilian Marksmanship Program M-1 Sales Site:

CORRECT GRADE: (Very Good to Excellent) 
AVAILABLE ON THE CMP AUCTION SITE ONLY
Correct Grade Rifles are similar to the Service Grade, but will show less wear and use. Correct Grade rifles will have all correct parts for the date of manufacture with 80% or better overall original metal finish. The stock and handguards will be of walnut and correct for the rifle but will have some dings, dents, scratches and marring of the wood finish. Stocks will have the appropriate original inspector's cartouche. The rifle bore will be very good with no significant defects and with a throat erosion of less than 4 and a muzzle wear of 2 or less. Very good to excellent condition. This grade is rare and is only available occasionally in limited quantities.

I had to install a bullet button and fixed stock make the rifle state complaint; all necessary parts to reverse these changes are included. After the conversion the rifle has only fired to prove function and adherence to the compliance. 

I am not looking for trades and will only transfer the weapon at a FFL of the buyers selection, in which the buyer pays all necessary duties and taxes of the transfer. I can be available anywhere to meet anywhere within north or south bay to conduct the transfer."

Built early this year with less than 500 rounds down range.  Special edition Aero Precision lower has selector markings ""NO PEW"", ""PEW"", and ""PEW PEW PEW""; instead of regular ""safe"" and ""fire"".

Mid-length gas system along with ST-T2 buffer and muzzle break make for an exceptionally smooth shooting rifle with negligible recoil.  Very easy for fast follow up shots.

Extended handguard reaches to the end of the barrel allowing the maximum sight radius for accurate shots.

Comes equipped with a set of Troy folding sights with dual diamond apertures.  Diamond shape allows for fast target acquisition.  Switch between dual rear sights with a flick of the finger.  Use large sight for 0-200 meters and smaller sight for 200+ meters.  Sights alone retail for $200.

Magpul ACS-L collapsible stock locks up tight and gives a great platform to rest your face on compared to cheaper stocks.

Overall a very fun rifle to shoot.  Would be great for a three gun competition.  Selling to finance a different build that I've really wanted to do.  Comes with 2 Magpul window mags.
