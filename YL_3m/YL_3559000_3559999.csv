The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

Perfect for semi-sniping addition to a red dot. Verifiable Aimpoint serial number. This is the real deal and not a cheap knock-off. The Flip to Side mount is a perfect co-witness mount. Will not separate, package deal.

Aimpoint Description:

The Aimpoint 3XMag Magnifying Module is specially designed for compatibility with Aimpoint red dot sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field. The Aimpoint 3XMag Handheld Monocular isimage a revolutionary tool for military personnel, law enforcement, sport shooters and hunters. When combined with the patented Aimpoint TwistMount, the Aimpoint 3XMag Magnifier gives the user something never before possible - the ability to switch in a split second from CQB (Close Quarters Battle) to semi-sniping and vice versa. Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their scopes on their firearm. The versatile Aimpoint 3X Mag Magnifier Monocular also can be used as a handheld magnifying glass monocular for discrete observation and identification. 

Samson Quick Flip SC Mount Description: 
Quick-transition mount combines secure, correct-height attachment of an Aimpoint 3XMag behind a compatible red dot sight with a spring-loaded mechanism that flips the magnifier aside for instant return to unmagnified operation of sight. Lets you shift from long-range to short-range targeting almost instantly. Heavy-duty machined-aluminum construction ensures solid, wobble-free mounting on MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny receiver rail, so the magnifier stays correctly positioned behind the sight. Mount bolts directly to the factory holes in the bottom of the 3XMag (machine screws included)no gunsmithing required. Ambi design allows installation with lever and flip path on the left or right side. Quick-flip tab has deep, grooves for easy activation with a flick of your thumb. Bolt-On model clamps to rail with a robust locking bar and bolt system. Bolt serves as a recoil lug that locks into one rail slot to prevent unwanted movement under recoil. Also available with A.R.M.S. quick-release throw-lever base that lets you remove the magnifier and mount as a unit in seconds; re-mount just as fast without loss of zero. Steel lever system combines a cam and locking foot with a robust recoil lug to clamp the mount to the rail as tightly as the bolt-on base. Lever closes securely against the side of the mount to prevent snagging on other objects, yet releases easily when needed."

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

Other information: Hey guys, here is my Les Baer Stinger Tactical that I need to sell asap!  I am only selling this because I have to pay off a NH Falcon that I ordered that came into my LGS!  Here is the info on it!

I bought this to use as an EDC gun, and I did for a while...  I have only shot it a small amount but, I can tell you I am the second owner of the pistol but, this pistol is still in amazing condition.  Its been so long since I took it out, I actually thought it had way more wear that it really did!!  Based off what the original owner told me, its got around 750 rounds on her.  It's tight but, smooth!  I hope that makes sense...

I will include everything pictured with the package...  Pistol, original box, paper work, patch, Les Baer bag that I make for all my Baers, 3 mags, and 3 sets of grips!  The pistol actually only has a few wear marks on it... you will see an idiot mark (not from me), some light wear on the front of the slide, and a small spot up front to... The times I have shot this pistol, its been flawless!

Anyway, I need to move it fairly quick and am not sure if my asking price is to high... or pretty fair?  If its high, please let me know, I will not take offense!  Again, I do need to move this soon but, am not gonna give her away!

Lastly, this is an IL gun which I have read seem to be the best Baers made (but, I have also read thats a crock of shit as well... lol).  If anyone has questions, please feel free to ask up front, Ill do my best to answer them for you guys!"

COLT 1850 Second Model Dragoon .44 caliber. Very nice antique revolver with all matching serial numbers. Overall I would rate this gun at least Fair to Good Condition. This is a family heirloom, never before on the market. 

This Second Model Dragoon features the rectangular cylinder-stop notches and square back trigger guard. This Dragoon is serial number 9428 in the series from 8000 - 10700, for a total production of approximately 2700 revolvers manufactured in 1850 and 1851.

Action is tight, smooth  and indexes properly. Exterior is worn but has good surface with no visible pitting. Shows minor ding from usage but no major damage. Very near original finish on frame but only traces of blueing. Grips are solid but worn and have small chip on each side at the inside bottom. Screw is missing from inside bottom of handgrip. Loading lever locks and functions properly but appears to be slightly out of alignment. Should be easily adjusted with proper skill and equipment. Good bore and barrel address ""-ADDRESS SAM'L COLT NEW YORK CITY-"". Cylinder engraving shows serial number but only faint traces of scene. Cylinder to frame tolerance indicates cylinder has never been turned. 

It has an ""M"" stamp next to ""COLTS PATENT"" on the frame, on left side of hammer and on trigger guard below serial number. 

Many other photos available on request. 

If you have questions or would like additional pictures, please ask.

Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 18oz in the Blued version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today."

It was manufactured in 1942.

The history behind these guns is pretty interesting. The United States wanted to remain neutral early during WWII, so we couldn't sell Britain any weapons. Instead, we ""leased"" them American-made Enfield rifles.

I bought this gun at the Denver gun show in August. Unfortunately, I need to sell it to pay some unexpected bills. Haven't even gotten to take it to the range, but I guess that's life... Rifle looks fine. Shows some wear but still has almost all of its blueing intact. Rifle will come with a Savage Lee-Enfield bayonet and a sling.

Best part: since this is a C&R firearm and I am not a licensed gun dealer, according to Colorado law you can purchase this firearm from me without a background check.

If you would rather go through an FFL for the transfer, I am more than happy to oblige but you will have to pay any related transfer/background check costs."

There's one unopened box I want to say that's a 500count of 230g bullets. 4 different types of powder each at least half full. Have a box full of large pistol plus about 10 or so packs. You can see all the tools and assecories in the pics that's with it. Sorry I have no brass. I forgot the tumbler and media in pics that comes with it as well.

The RTS2 is one of C-MORE Systems smallest reflex sights. Just like our competition sights, the RTS2 head up display provides an unobstructed sight picture in which the red dot hovers on the sight line, illuminating the point of impact on the target, creating the fastest target acquisition in existence, and unlimited eye relief.
