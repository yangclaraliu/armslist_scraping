 All guns are NEW, WE DO NOT SELL/DEAL in USED GUNS.
 Sorry, but WE DO NOT ACCEPT TRADES. WE are in the business of selling guns..

 Cash is preferred, but if you insist on credit cards THEY charge a 3.65% FEE on top of the total price.
 We do accept Personal Checks/Bank Checks or Postal/Bank Money orders..Items will ship after check clears bank.
 WE DO OFFER NO-INTEREST LAY-A -WAY. 20% down gets you started.
 Ohio residents MUST add 6.50% sales tax (sorry not our rules)
 WE DO FFL Transfers..typically 10$ per Gun..Guns costing over a thousand 20$. NFA transfers are 30$ per item.
 WE DO OFFER E-File for NFA items and as ALWAYS ALL NFA RULES APPLY>

Browning BDA 9mm ( Sig Sauer P220) Sig Sauer BDA 9mm/ Euro P220
Manufactured in West Germany by Sig Sauer imported by Browning
Manufactured in 1977 with around 2500 total production.
The gun is in Excellent Condition.comes with one magazine, no box or papers.
Before SIG got its US import license, they used Browning's import license and brought the original P-series pistols into America as the Browning BDA. SIG only did this for three years - 1977 through 1979 and that was it. So these pistols are fairly rare.
The BDA was basically the same pistol that the Swiss Army adopted and was the first SIG P-series pistol. Later on, SIG expanded this line and we saw the P220, P225, P228 and P226 come out of this line up. this pistol was the basis for the W. German SIGs that built SIG's reputation.
The BDA or P220 Euro was a very well made pistol. It is very accurate and mine has been a 100% reliable shooter that will put the bullets where you want them.

(EMERSON) There was a time when I was building knives almost exclusively for the U.S. Navy SEAL Teams.  I was spending almost as much time in Coronado as I was at home.  I was also teaching and training with the Command Master Chief who ran the entire SEAL, BUD’s training program.  As a result of that, one of the best knives that I ever designed was for them.  And it was one of my favorite designs.  It was a simple, raw, powerful design called the SPECWAR.

We have found 3 boxes of SPECWAR Blades that had been lost in our move a couple of years back in a recent clean up and shuffle to make room for more machinery one of the guys moving some dusty boxes said, “What are these?” And there they were.  Some of the blades were logoed, marked and even sharpened.  Some were blanks waiting to be ground.  And some of the blades were in the original Hard Chrome coating.  I think some of the dates actually go back to 2001.  So, we are now re-issuing SPECWAR knives in both Model A (Clip point) and Model B (Chisel ground Tanto).  Since we were building new handles we changed them to stand-offs and we made some color variations never before used on the original SPECWAR Models.  Of course we have the Basic Black, but in addition we have Afghan Tan, OD Green and a few Dark Woodland Green.  I forgot how good they feel in your hand until I picked one up off the assembly table. These knives are awesome.

Do not miss this one of a kind opportunity to own one of these rare, vintage, retro knives.  They are as good now, today as they were when I was putting them into the hands of the warriors who were willfully heading into harms way.  You too can own a piece of Emerson military history by picking up one of these SPECWAR re-issue knives today.  The supply is extremely limited so don’t delay.  They won’t last for long."

New bullets, box opened to show for pictures. Retail for $82 on Midway.

The bullet has a superb ballistic coefficient compared to other 50 caliber bullets that have separately formed driving bands. This clean Bullex-N profile helps maintain velocity at longer ranges, and the cartridge overall length can be based on the rifle's chamber dimension rather than driving band placement. The bullet is made using CNC (Computer Numeric Controlled) technology to assure extreme accuracy. Lapua's unique Silver Jacket coating helps achieve higher muzzle velocities without excessive chamber pressures.

Technical Information

Ballistic Coefficient: 0.960

Notes:
Specifically designed for long-range target shooting.
Rebated boat tail construction.
Moly Coated bullet.

Stock has aluminum bedding in block in standard VS configuration.
At the core of the 700 with 5-R Rifling is the machined stainless steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design ensuring uniformity, strength and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 24-inch stainless steel, heavy barrel featuring 5-R Tactical Rifling -- the same hammer-forged barrel used on the M-24 sniper rifles.
 The 5-R Rifling barrel features five lands with a right hand twist which allows for less bearing surface on the bullet for slightly increased velocity.
As a result of less bullet drag, copper fouling in the bore is reduced ensuring long-term accuracy and consistency. The barrel is offered with a 110 target-style crown and a 1 in 11.25-inch twist.
The rock-solid barreled action is full-length, aluminum bedded into a well-designed H-S Precision stock for enhanced stability and shot-to-shot consistency. Add Remington's X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger, designed to ""break-like-glass"" and set at 3.5 pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical-like accuracy.

The downside to the 338 Lapua is that it is based on the .416 Rigby case which has a larger case head diameter (.590 in ) than the standard magnum cases (.532 in ) and unfortunately, many of the commercial actions and bolts are not large enough to easily handle the larger case head diameter. Because of this, popular actions like the Remington 700 require special work to be done to them in order to fit the .338 Lapua, and anytime you mention special work, it means more money and also lower production numbers. As such, there are not a lot of lower priced precision 338 Lapua rifles on the market. That is where the Savage 110 BA comes in. Savage actions are built on a modular design, so instead of them having to make major modifications to a bolt design, they simply had to make a new bolt head and they were pretty much there. Of course some other details such as magazine design needed to be performed as well."

God'A Grip introduces the new Ammo Grip. This innovative shell carrier attaches to rifles and shotguns and keeps ammo in place without shifting, sagging or moving around. The Ammo Grip attaches to the stock of a rifle by first installing the hook/loop backing pad. Then 5- to 10-shot carriers can be firmly attached while staying out of the way of the shooter's actions. Ammo comes out when needed by simply pushing up on the bullet. When a carrier is empty, simply remove it and replace it with another preloaded carrier.

Made with 100% polyester to withstand UV and outdoor weather. Tried and true 3m technology, will stay and not harm wood or synthetic stock. Stays in place, makes your gun look good and your ammo will come out easily when needed. Innovative flap guards against bullets falling out, quickly folds under casings allowing you to roll up and store in pocket. ** All Ammo Grips include Adhesive/Velcro back **  Made in the U.S.A. 

God' A Grip products are compatible with the following firearms:

Browning, Remington, Winchester, Ruger, Sauage, Colt, DPMA, Knight, Thompson Center Arms, Steyr, Weatherby, New England Firearms (NEF), Harrington and Richards (H&R), Mossberg, Magpul, Advanced Technology (ATI), Marlin, Barrett, Tapco, Rockriver Arms, Brownells, Tippman, Command Arms and many others!

Spare bolts and carriers have always been hard to find for the Saiga rifles and they are not interchangeable with standard AK parts. Kvar sells the bolt alone for $140. Please use the ""Listing by user"" link above to see the other stuff I have for sale.
 Payment is money order, cash or discreet online payment. I AM LOCATED BETWEEN CLARKSVILLE AND DICKSON TN. SEND ME A MESSAGE IF YOU WANT MORE PICS. THANKS FOR LOOKING. JAY"

I put this set together to start a mobile gun smithing, barrel shortening, threading and crowning business. The kit cost me about $600 to put together.
I imagined having a gunshow booth and threading barrels there on the spot, or advertising locally as (the first ever) ""will come to you"" barrel threading, crowning and facing service.

These tools allow you to thread a barrel and cut a precision crown by hand, without a lathe and without even having to remove the barrel from the stock. A hand operation that’s complete in less than five minutes, these tools can save and make you money while restoring a gun’s accuracy lost due to a damaged crown. The carbide inserts cut smoothly and last indefinitely and the self truing pilots align the carbide cutters precisely to the bore.

With this kit you can...
*Shorten barrels.
*Thread barrels.
*Crown barrels, with a 90º target crown or a two angle 11º recessed crown.
*Increase a firearms accuracy.
*Go mobile (try taking a lathe with you somewhere ; )
*Hold all of your equipment in one hand. You will want to get a cordless drill though. 

The kit includes...
*2 High quality adjustable Carbide cutters (90º and 11º).
*1 Annular cutter (to cut the outside diameter down to proper threading specs).
*1 Annular cutter adaptor (adapts any annular cutter to a cordless drill).
*3 Barrel/cutter Pilots that are specially designed to align (true) to the barrel bore from .22 caliber to .270 to .30 caliber (others available). 
     These pilots also have bristles that keep the barrel clean by pulling out any chips or debris when removed.
*6 die pilots (.22lr, .223, .224. .270 .308, .311,) others available.
*Threading die for 1/2x28 (AR's, 9mm, 22lr and whatever else you want to have 1/2-28 threads on).
*Threading die for M14x1LH (AK's, Mosin Nagants and other 7.62mm/.308/.311 applications of your choice).
*Add any die to this kit (example 5/8-24 for an AR-10's since you already have .308 pilots).
*Cutter driver adaptor with ball-end hex bit to adapt the cutter driver to any cordless drill.
*Barrel blueing compound to re-blue the crown and touch up finishes.
*Gun oil (to oil guns obviously but also to treat surfaces after re-blueing).
*Tap Magic (tapping and cutting fluid).
*Cleaning brush (keep your threads and cutters clean and free of chips).
*A Glock pistol carrying case that everything (but the die handle) fits in. I thought about modifying the die handle or getting a breakdown one that fits in the box but haven't.
*Instructions.

And of course extra, other size or replacement pilots and dies from other manufacturers are compatible with this kit.

Review by Old Tree Dude on 5/19/14
Quality	
I have owned two of these for about 3 years now. Easy to conceal, easy to carry, easy to shoot. I have had two friends of mine look at them that are both long time gunsmiths. They were both impressed on how well they were built. The cost is very reasonable. You can pay a lot more and not get better quality. All my grandkids, nieces and nephews kids have fired these with 158 grain 38's and they all love the pistol.
Shooting the Range 
Review by mike on 2/15/14
Quality	
Took the Windicator .357 to the range today and fired 100 rounds. First 3 of 6 hit dead center of bulls eye center.This revolver is well balanced, with very little recoil. and accurate right out of the box. I plan to paint a white dot on front sight post to help me see and aim better, but it is accurate and fun to shoot. EAA has sold me on their quality for the money! gun magazine gun of year

 If your like me who hates the original stocks included with most ARs (with exception to high end models), and have a budget, then you will really appreciate this R.A.T. Stock from LaRue. I originally purchased it unknown to my wife, who ended up buyingt it on my birthday a month later. Suffice it t say i just kept the new one and this one has just been sitting in my closet.
