Scope is not included at the $750 price, but can be purchased seperately if wanted. Decent bushnell trophy. Not a Leupold, but does the trick. I can round up some 223 shells cheap for the buyer if wanted.

The gun is very accurate and once you get it ""tuned"" in to the load you are shooting, it is surprisingly accurate. Beautiful gun, gets compliments everytime I've taken it anywhere. Less than 200 rounds and it shows. Stated in manual and on net by Ruger, only meant to fire .223's.

Pricing: $420 + $20 FFL Fee.  I checked gunbroker and other online sources, and the lowest I could find a comparable gun was $470, after shipping/transfer.  Brick/Mortar shops priced this gun at $550, although I believe that is excessive.  I'd like to politely decline negotiating as the price is firm, and am not interested in trades at this time.

It's worth noting that I am a private collector, and not a dealer.  I realize that going through an FFL for a private sale is not necessary, but for documentation purposes, and safety concerns for both parties, I am requiring this as part of the sale.  I also realize that this requirement may not be viewed favorably by many people, and I'd politely request that you do not contact me if you are opposed to transferring through an FFL.  No cash would change hands until the actual time of transfer, after you've been able to see the actual firearm."

(MARKINGS) Very hard to read, but:

•""ASIER"" and then the rest is illegible (left side of barrel)
•""GUYOT RUE DE LYON 48 PARIS"" (bottom pistol grip)
•""GUYOT PARIS"" but if you look inside that mark you also see what looks like additional lettering, looks like a ""P"" inside the U of GUYOT and a ""R"" in the space between the U & Y (top of barrel)

From what research I've done GUYOT was a collective of highly skilled craftsmen who did extremely high end and ornate pieces (rifles, shotguns, and pistols) for the nobility of the time.  Often these pieces were 1 of 1's.  

This piece has superior scroll work on every part of the metal from top to bottom, front to back, side to side.  It is very rare to find any piece with this much scroll work.  It was recommended that this piece be professionally cleaned as it would definitely be an auction piece."

Sights:  Novak night sights that are around 40-45% bright.  They still noticeably glow in dark, but I want to be upfront about their condition.

This pistol comes with one stainless, factory magazine.

Pricing: $425 + $20 FFL transfer fee. I checked gunbroker and other online sources, and the lowest I could find a comparable pistol was $475 after shipping/transfer.  Brick/mortar shops priced this pistol at $525-550.  I believe my price is fair, and would like to politely decline negotiating, or trade offers.  

It's worth noting that I am a private collector, and not a dealer.  I realize that going through an FFL for a private sale is not necessary, but for documentation purposes, and safety concerns for both parties, I am requiring this as part of the sale.  I also realize that this requirement may not be viewed favorably by many people, and I'd politely request that you do not contact me if you are opposed to transferring through an FFL.  No cash would change hands until the actual time of transfer, after you've been able to see the actual firearm."

It's worth noting that I am a private collector, and not a dealer.  I realize that going through an FFL for a private sale is not necessary, but for documentation purposes, and safety concerns for both parties, I am requiring this as part of the sale.  I also realize that this requirement may not be viewed favorably by many people, and I'd politely request that you do not contact me if you are opposed to transferring through an FFL.  No cash would change hands until the actual time of transfer, after you've been able to see the actual firearm."

This is a compact frame, with a 4.25"" barrel/slide, from the factory.  This particular pistol is new in box, never fired.

Includes 2 factory magazines, box, manual, fired casing, and all other accessories.

Price: $700.  I checked online, and this is about what these are going for.  The promotional ""buy a 1911 and get a .22 free"" offer for the C3 went for around $1000.  For this reason, I'm assigning a $725 value to the C3.  Gunbroker prices appear to be in that range before shipping/transfer.  That's where my pricing logic comes from, and I'm not interested in negotiating or trade offers.

It's worth noting that I am a private collector, and not a dealer.  I realize that going through an FFL for a private sale is not necessary, but for documentation purposes, and safety concerns for both parties, I am requiring this as part of the sale.  I also realize that this requirement may not be viewed favorably by many people, and I'd politely request that you do not contact me if you are opposed to transferring through an FFL.  No cash would change hands until the actual time of transfer, after you've been able to see the actual firearm."

- Has been kept in storage for a few years. Selling it for extra money to move.

- Great condition, only a few scratches. 
- This gun has not been upgraded internally.
- It comes with an aluminum heat shield RIS rail that I modified so it could fit on the G&G rifle so you can mount accessories. Two rail covers are included. The stock heat shield is included in case you want a more classic look.
- Shoots ~300 FPS Last fielded with .23 gram bbs, spring was reset and gearbox lubed after every game and before storage.
- Standard Large Tamiya battery connector.
- You get 2 Hi-Cap magazines.
- Stock orange color painted tip is still on the rifle along with the bright orange barrel shroud.
- Battery is NOT included.

Being a G&G Airsoft gun, the internals and externals are high quality. 
It has an internal spring release mechanism so you can be sure the spring is released of tension after every game to preserve it's strength. 

This gun was a blast to use in games and definitely draws positive attention due to being so unique. Just be aware it is heavy and takes some getting used to. 

Other pictures of the rifle can be taken upon request. Feel free to ask any questions.
I'm open to reasonable price negotiations.
*I will only sell to people who are 18+ with a valid drivers license or other government issue ID.*"

Mossberg was attempting to enter the high-end shotgun market by hand making these shotguns in a small building behind the Mossberg factory. These shotguns are rare and of extremely high quality. This gun I would rate at 80+%. Blueing is good and the barrels are mirror shiny. The gun still locks up very tight. Few dings and scratches on the stock. This gun has been used but not abused.

Quality	
I have owned two of these for about 3 years now. Easy to conceal, easy to carry, easy to shoot. I have had two friends of mine look at them that are both long time gunsmiths. They were both impressed on how well they were built. The cost is very reasonable. You can pay a lot more and not get better quality. All my grandkids, nieces and nephews kids have fired these with 158 grain 38's and they all love the pistol.
Shooting the Range

Took the Windicator .357 to the range today and fired 100 rounds. First 3 of 6 hit dead center of bulls eye center.This revolver is well balanced, with very little recoil. and accurate right out of the box. I plan to paint a white dot on front sight post to help me see and aim better, but it is accurate and fun to shoot. EAA has sold me on their quality for the money!"

Made in 1989 Ruger 10/22 Carbine. New scope rings and Tasco 3-9x40 scope. Brown recoil pad for added length of pull. Good clean barrel,  overall condition is a solid 9/10.  I'll even include 100 rounds of CCI ammo to go along with it. 

I picked this up recently and have decided I'm more of a marlin 60 fan than a Ruger. There is NOTHING at all wrong with this one, just not my flavor if you follow my meaning.

It fired perfectly for the 250 rounds I shot through it.

Used Tan WE Scar MK16 Gas Blow Back Gen 1
- Has been kept in storage for a few years. Selling it for extra money to move.
- It has been fielded twice and is in excellent condition, except the built in tool went missing.
- Shoots ~350 FPS Last fielded with .23 gram bbs.
- This is a gas powered AirSoft gun. It can use either Co2 or green gas depending on magazine style. This is the Co2 version so it can withstand the pressure, but it can still use the green gas magazines perfectly fine!
- You get four 30 round Co2 mags 2 tan 2 black. (Some Co2 cartridges are included).
- The orange paint from the tip has been removed. Orange barrel cover is included.
- Hand grip has been upgraded.

This gun is great for people who want something a bit more realistic airsoft. The 30 round Co2 mags and mild kick definitely give you that. Sounds very intimidating when down range from it. It's was a blast to use during games. 

Other pictures of the rifle can be taken upon request. Feel free to ask any questions.
I'm open to reasonable price negotiations.

It has been polished for that custom two tone look.  Slide is stainless steel. 
The grip is fully stippled to give it a real aggressive grip making it easier to hold on to. It  noticeably improved my accuracy. 

This gun is a true double action which makes it much better (in my opinion) for  ankle carry.  It has a long trigger pull like most pocket .380s but because it's a true double action if there is a misfire you can keep pulling the trigger on the same round until it goes off. I've never had it misfire but in an emergency situation you don't want to have to rack the slide to reset the firing pin before shooting again.  

I owned the Ruger LCP and I hated it. I love this gun and would trust my life with it over an lcp any day.  The biggest differences is the trigger pull, the double action,  slide lock, and safety. All these things make it a better gun.  

This gun has been my daily carry but has only seen a couple hundred rounds. And I clean it regularly. It shoots flawlessly and the laser functions well. 

Comes with two magazines. One has an extended tail piece so you can get all three figures on it.   Ankle holster  included. 

Also has a clip installed making it very easy to clip it on anything. I've even carried it in a pair of gym shorts.

A mere twenty (20) rounds suggests this .44 magnum is just too much gun for me: there isn't much recoil but the very loud BOOM makes me flinch. And my bills were more than I'd expected so...

It's in great shape, with a cross-bar safety, a blued finish, the standard walnut stock, a hammer extension I see no need to remove, and a vaunted Micro-Groove barrel. (Wikipedia says ""in the mid-1990s, Marlin changed the .357 and .44 barrels from 12-groove-or-more 'Micro-Groove' rifling to 6-groove 'Ballard' style rifling."") 

The only things wrong with this gun are cosmetic: there are a couple of superficial scratches and a tiny ding or two in the wood finish, and now there are a couple ugly but not fatal scratches on the sight base from my recent first attempt to replace a broken rear sight folding leaf (see photo), which by the way has been replaced and installed. Otherwise it's a fine, barely used example of a model Marlin doesn't make anymore. If those scratches in the rear sight base matter to you feel free to buy yourself one from Midway for $12.99 +S&H; the main reason I'm selling this rifle is that I'm broke enough for such small sums to count.

Of course I'm open to partial trades and best offers, but as anybody old enough to buy a firearm knows there's a difference between ""broke"" and ""desperate."" If it was that bad I'd have taken Bud's offer last week. You know what I'm saying?"

The MBUS® Pro is a corrosion resistant all-steel back-up sighting solution that delivers maximum functionality and strength with minimum bulk at a price that's even smaller than its size.
