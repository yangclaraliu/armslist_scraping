The underfolding stock locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, the stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it."

Self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines. Bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. Main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16x7 inches to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. Rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

The Just Right Carbine is semi automatic pistol caliber carbine. Designed to be completely ambidextrous, the JRC provides you with the ability to configure which side you would like the charging handle to be on as well as which side you prefer the brass to eject. Utilizing standard M4/AR-15 parts allows you to easily maintain the rifle, or customize it as you see fit. The buttstock sits atop a standard buffer tube to allow for quick switching, and the fire control group components are also AR-15 standard parts.

It offers you the freedom to use optics or a peep sight perfect for the tree stand. This is a Ruger Gunsite Scout which is chambered in .308 Win. This rifle is right handed bolt-action. The rifle features a removable 10 round magazine. This rifle comes with many options for sighting, on top is a rear peep sight with a front blade sight, there are 2 scope rings that come with the rifle, as well as a picatinny rail mount for mounting a red dot sight or an ACOG style sight. The gun has a wood stock colored as a green/gray laminate and the stock has very nice checkering on it as well. The stock also features the option to adjust the length, it comes with 3 different sizes. I have owned the gun since it was new, I purchased it in December of last year and have only shot maybe 20 rounds through it, I really have no use for it, it was definitely an impulse purchase because I love Ruger Products. I paid over $1,000 for this gun new including taxes, but I am only asking $800 or best offer. I also have a Redfield 3-9x40 scope that I bought new just for this rifle. I would be willing to sell it separately if interested just email me for the price. Thanks for looking!"

I have barely used it. It's ran pretty good with bird shot and 100% with 00 buckshot. The nice thing about this model is that it came setup this way from the factory, and there are no frilly engravings on huge receiver or bolt. Has a large D shaped charging handle. It's setup to be a defensive gun from the factory, and Remington did an excellent job with this model. 

I have some spare fiber optics in different diameters and colors, and some spare O-rings I'll try to find. 

I'd like to keep it local, but I'll ship on your dime. I have lots of + feedback on several forums."

Weighing in at just 7.3 pounds and only 19 7/8"" axle to axle, the Barnett Crossbow Ghost 410 crossbow is no doubt a game changer. It may be lighter and faster than its predecessor, the Ghost 400, but the 410 has maintained some of its most impressive features. Like the 400, the 410 features Barnett's proprietary Carbonlite Riser Technology (CRT), which shifts the balance point away from the riser and back to the shoulder of the shooter. Barnett's unique patent protected, ultra light, super strong Carbonlite riser boasts an incredible 5 to 1 safety factor and provides the perfect balance of weight and speed.

From what I can tell, it's from the original production run by Lewis as it includes the Knights Armament Company 20-round magazine instead of the Magpul.  It's the SR-25 lower that is compatible with Magpul Magazines, KACs, and most others.  It's the quad-railed monolithic upper with chrome-lined barrel, LMT detachable iron sights, rail covers, and Ergo grip with LMT SOPMOD stock.  Gun is solid, incredibly accurate, and runs flawlessly.

Item Description:

This is a brand new Anschutz MSR RX22 rifle chambered for .22 LR. It has a striking resemblence to FN's SCAR. ANSCHÜTZ target rifles are known worldwide for their accuracy, precise construction and unmatched shooting performance. The excellent characteristics that allowed ANSCHÜTZ sporting equipment to dominate national and international competitions such as the biathlon since 1856 can also be found in the new ANSCHÜTZ semi-automatic MSR RX22. The goal of this cooperation was to develop and produce a highly accurate semi-automatic rifle with excellent shooting performance that is suitable for the dynamic disciplines as well as precision shooting at the shooting clubs BDS, BDMP, DSB, DSU and VdRBw. The resulting product is an all-round sports device for discerning customers.

The barrels are manufactured according to the same ANSCHÜTZ special button-rifled process, used for the manufacture of the world-famous ANSCHÜTZ target barrels. The ANSCHÜTZ small bore target precision barrel has a recessed muzzle, just like the other world-famous ANSCHÜTZ target barrels. The target single stage trigger has always set the standard for quality, reliability and precision. The light weight, hardened and finely ground trigger components facilitate fast and consistent trigger release. The trigger can be adjusted from 3.3 to 5.5 pounds, and is set from the factory at 4 pounds. Controls are ambidextrous for any operator.

Caliber: .22 LR

Capacity: One 10 round magazine included

Barrel: 16.5""

Overall Length: 32.3""

Weight: ~7 pounds

This is the best target 22 you will own."

Common questions:
""Is the price negotiable""
-Of course!  That's half the fun!

""Will you take (insert gun here) as a trade?""
-Maybe.  Review the trade section and let me know what you have.  I DO need a bit of cash, so figure in at least $150 in paper money plus what you have to offer.

""Will you deliver to (insert destination here)""
- If it's ""face to face"" I'd like to keep it pretty local to Tacoma.  I have a toddler, wife, and a job that keep me pretty busy and broke.  If it's in the mail, you pay all the costs first (to include shipping) and the gun gets sent to your FFL second.

""I don't have any ID and I'm wanted for (insert crime here) in 30 states, will you sell it to me?""
- No.  Buyer and anyone else present during the transaction must have WA DL and some sort of ""good guy card""  CCL and Washington Arms Collector accepted.  If you don't have either, don't fret.  We can meet and do the FFL transfer at a mutually agreed upon gun shop at your cost.

I would prefer to sell the gun to someone with their CCL, but it's not necessary.

It is simply a magnificent and handsome handgun with clean lines which lend a no-nonsense, strictly business look. 

Ruger honored it with the reintroduction on its 50th birthday in 2006. This is one of the few of that first year production as evidenced by the ""50 Years of .44 Magnum"" inscription on the barrel . This is a very scarce Ruger as the Anniversary model was only made for one year in 2006. 

This one is Unfired and includes the 50th Anniversary case and all paperwork and accessories that are part of the Anniversary package. It is a great collectable or an even better shooter for the modern Nevada cowpoke or outdoorsman.

Also available is a set of oil finished custom walnut grips and a Hunter holster.

I've had this rifle for about 6 months and have put 250 rounds through it with zero malfunctions.  I like it a lot but need to sell it for financial reasons.  The rifle itself is in good condition with minimal scratches here and there but nothing major. The aimpoint has zero scratches on the glass and the housing  (the rear clear lens protector has a couple light scratches, but not he optic itself). It is CA legal registered and has a bullet button.  Buyer pays transfer fees.  If you would like to meet up at on target shooting range and test fire the rifle before you buy it that is okay with me (bring ammo). Otherwise I would prefer to meet up at OC armory. 

$1300 OR BEST OFFER.  No low ballers.  Email me name and phone number and I will get back to you. No interested in any trades at the moment. 

Also included is a knights armament verticle foregrip, grip pod systems bi pod, and a 30mm kill flash ""honey comb"" for the aimpoint.   Rifle is sold as is and looks exactly like in photos.  Thanks for looking"

THIS GUN HAS BEEN SOLD! BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!


This is a great handgun for concealed carry and has surprising power! This weapon is absolutely perfect for someone who wants to carry a weapon at all times comfortably and have the element of surprise in their corner! 

LOOK AT MY DEAL...If you bought this weapon new it retails WITHOUT the Crimson Trace laser for $340 to $389.00 plus tax. The Crimson Trace Laser would be an additional $179.00 accessory plus tax. I'm INCLUDING IT in my entire selling price of $400.00!!!! But that's not all as you'll see down below!

UNLIKE OTHER LASERS the Crimson Trace laser is activated when the gun is gripped...and wherever the red dot is...that's where the bullet is going! No more worrying about hitting your target! There are cheaper manual on-off switch lasers like LaserMax and LaserLyte out there for around $100-$150, but they are not even close to the product quality of Crimson Trace. 

I'm also including an Elite ""inside the pocket"" holster which makes the weapon completely unnoticeable while carrying it in your pocket and so comfortable you can actually forget that you have a weapon in your pocket. If you went out and purchased an Elite pocket holster it retails for $27 plus tax. Again...I'M INCLUDING IT!

And finally...the Golden Saber +P ammo is a personal favorite ammo choice of mine for the shear ballistic power. It's an additional $25 if you went out and purchased it...but I'M INCLUDING IT free of charge in the deal! 

Weapon comes in the original box with a Ruger logo nylon zipper pouch.

That makes MY entire package valued at nearly $600 retail when adding everything up. 

BUT I'M SELLING IT ALL TO THE FIRST $400 FIRM! THAT'S RIGHT...$400 FIRM!!!
