Very comfortable. Removable insole.

There were two models of this boot made. The earlier model had issues. This is the version that is good to go.
I bought one pair and liked them so much, I bought a second pair which is up for sale to fund other purchases.
I believe these were $300 boots back in the day. I see they are currently selling for $120 on eBay with a wait, shipping, and no clue what you're actually getting.
These would be good for hunting, paintball, hiking, chores, or keep them with your bug out gear, etc."

This will be a limited offer as tax refund season is soon upon us which means we will be getting swamped with appointments. I am a 22 year professional of the tattoo industry. I consider myself to have a well rounded art background which ranges from black and grey shading to in your face bright color work. I tried to post some pics of my recent work but the files were too bi. So if you would like me to send you reference pictures i would be glad to do so. My number is 316-28eight-0932.

Originally manufactured in Berlin by Mauser Werke, Borsigwalde in Cal 7.92x57mm. Somewhere along the line, it was sent to Norway with the German Army where it was either captured or Surrendered to the Norwegian Military. Taken in hand post war, the stocks of captured Model 98k rifles was so large it was economical for the Norwegian military to rebarrel them in 7.62x63mm (30.06) which was their newly adopted national military caliber. This particular one was issued to the Norwegian Army and was re-serialed with the HAER prefix.

Over $200 in upgrades.  A few superficial scuffs from holstering, otherwise looks and functions as new.  Cleaned and oiled, ready to go.

All Buffalo Bore Heavy 40 S&W +P loads use flash suppressed powders that give high velocities at low pressures. Since over 90% of all human shootings in the USA happen in low light, we believe that flash suppressed powders are a potentially life saving advantage - you don't want to be blind after you fire one shot in a life threatening, high stress situation.

There is such a variety of 40 S&W pistols in public use that we will not determine what pistols are compatible with which 40 S&W +P loads - this is your responsibility! We will add that this ammo is safe in pistols that use a fully supported chamber. Please read the safety notices below. The first one is taken form the Speer #13 loading manual. The second is taken from Hodgdons #27 loading manual.

SAFETY NOTICE

""Some pistols chambered for the 40 S&W cartridge may not provide complete support of the case head. If this condition exists, normal pressure loads such as those shown here can cause the case wall to bulge or rupture at the unsupported point. Contact your firearm manufacturer to determine if your pistol completely supports the case head, or ask a gunsmith to inspect your pistol before using it with ANY ammunition. It is the gun owners responsibility to know his firearm and its capabilities and limitations.""

40 S&W WARNING

""This data is intended for use in firearms which fully support the cartridge in the chamber. Use of this data in firearms which do not fully support the cartridge may result in bulged cases, ruptured cases, case head separation, or other conditions which may result in damage to the firearm and/or result in injury or death of the shooter or bystanders.""

Glock happens to chamber their 40 S&W pistols without a fully supported chamber and both of those above safety notices are likely aimed at Glock. I know of no other 40 S&W handguns being sold in the US that don't have fully supported chambers. If you really want to shoot our 40S&W ammo in your Glock, have an after market barrel that uses a supported chamber, dropped into it. This is a fairly common practice and will give you the safety margin needed to fire our ammo in your Glock. It will also likely give you more velocity that the factory Glock barrel. I personally own two Glock Model 23's. Both of mine are going to get after market barrels dropped in so that I can use this excellent ammo in them.

Check out the velocities below that I shot with these loads in several modern pistols that I own. We don't believe that test barrels are a very real way of determining real life velocities out of real life guns that you will be using. So, as with all of our ammo, we use real firearms to determine real velocities.

I am not that type of guy; but boy/girl is it fun.  This gun is as tricked out as any one could wish.  The 45 ACP caliber is Hi Points top of the line carbine.  This carbine is used, I put about 100 rounds through it.  Before that it did not see much use.  I love it, it is fun.   The major set back for me is feeding the beast.  I like feeding this animal.  I made the mistake of purchasing 1000 rounds of 40 cal. S&W, so I am going to be changing my toy.

The  standard Hi Point carbines come ready to accessorize or they can be used out of the box and they are great fun carbines.  The small build of the rifle (32 inches) makes it great for non basketball players and average size people.  The only thing this baby lacks is a sling, which would be no problem to add.  It comes with a forward grip with attached laser.  The laser has a pressure switch on the forward grip.  The forward grip has a storage compartment (I have not figured out what I would use it for).  This Tactical Stock (TS) has a duel magazine holder on the butt stock.  The beauty comes with three 45 ACP 10 round magazines.  That is 30 rounds before you need to reload.  

I went out to the range twice with the carbine.  Free Standing at about 15 yards, I was hitting 3 to 5 inch medicine bottles.   Last time out I used the back of a steel chair as a rest and at 45 to 50 yards I hit 5 out of 5 dog food cans.  First, I am not a super great shot, I am average.  I was hitting targets with this Hi Point’s open sights.  The gun rear ghost site can be adjusted for wind and elevation.  I did not have a need to make any adjustments. As for the laser, the first time out I had to wait until just before dusk to use the laser sight.  I was impressed as it was sighted in at 25 yards.   I did not stay around to test how far out the accuracy of the guns laser.  Over all in great shape, if you are a fair or better shot, this is a firearm you can pickup and hit your target.  Another great advantage of this firearm is with the combination of the built in recoil pad I did not notice any kick while shooting.

M400E which has a tensioner in the lower receiver to apply pressure to the upper which creates a tight fit that increases accuracy and cuts out the wiggle of the upper receiver. It also has an ambi mag release and QD ports on both sides of the back of the lower. 

Enough of what the rifle is, lets talk about what i have added to it. I have added a Midwest Industries 2 piece rail, BCM medium charging handle, Sightmark sight that is really nice for what most will use it for, Stark Industries grip which has a QD port in the back, Magpul MS4 sling, which is the QD style to go with the multitude of QD ports on the lower, rail, and grip. There is a total of 8 magazines that all have self leveling followers. A MOLLE Otis cleaning kit for the rifle, in my opinion it is excellent because it has a tool to clean everything you need to with the exception of a gas tube brush. A condor bag that comes with 3 MOLLE pouches, and to top it all off... 400 rounds of federal ammo."

This is M6A2-S not a regular M6A2. LWRC M6A2™ Stretch rifle in black is a standard carbine with a longer gas block system that offers softer recoil impulse. The M6A2™ Stretch rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low-profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 ""real estate"" to mount your accessories.

BRAND NEW 

The Daniel Defense adjustable buttstock is constructed of a proprietary blend of glass infused polymers and finished off with soft touch rubber overmolding in strategic points.  The new buttstock is precision formed for mil-spec receiver extensions to have very little forward or lateral play that is so common in many other buttstocks.  This eliminates the need for a tensioning device or friction lock.  All of this results in a durable buttstock that will give the shooter a comfortable and repeatable cheek weld and unprecedented control of the firearm.  The buttstock can be run with one of two included buttpads or without any buttpad at all to custom fit the rifle to whatever gear the operator must wear.  The buttpads come in two sizes: a thicker convex shape (0.8”), and a thinner concave shape (0.5”); designed to keep from snagging when shouldering the rifle.  Limited rotation QD swivel attachment points are integrated on both sides of the buttstock for ambidextrous sling connection. Kit includes ncludes Mil-Spec receiver extension,  end plate,  castle nut, buffer spring and standard CAR buffer. Kit includes 6 position mil-spec buffer tube, castle nut, stock plate, carbine buffer and spring. 
 Options available for buffer upgrades.

The new Daniel Defense pistol grip is an improvement to the old standby A2.  We designed our grip with ergonomics and controllability in mind.  Our grip shares the angle of the classic 1911 pistol for the most natural hand position and comfortable feel.  This pistol grip incorporates an oversized trigger guard covering the gap between grip and lower receiver which can wear on the shooters hand and easily accommodates for gloves.  Installation is simplified by the fact the integral trigger guard doesn’t require a roll pin so there is a reduced chance of damaging the lower receiver.  A soft touch overmolding section enhances grip, wet or dry.

Updated in 2014, the improved vertical grip now includes soft touch rubber overmolding for enhanced grip, wet or dry.  Inside the grip is a Dual O-Ring, water tight storage compartment capable of storing small parts or 1 AA battery or 2 CR123 batteries.  This vert grip is extremely lightweight and utilizes a simple yet durable mounting method.

It has 259k miles on it. I have had it for 10 years, I am the third owner. I bought it off my older sister who had bought it from an elderly couple. This car has been serviced at the Honda dealership all its life and well taken care of. I am selling it because we have too many cars in the driveway. Sadly my Wife wanted a mini van this year and my beloved Accord has to go. Most of the miles are highway miles when I used to commute on I-5, has just been used to drive back and forth to work locally since. This vehicle has never let me down. Very little has gone wrong mechanically with it because I kept up on oil changes and regular servicing (timing belt was last done at around 220,000 miles). Car has nearly new tires from Costco, new title and registration (2016 tags), and has an Alpine aftermarket stereo with MP3 AUX cord (never upgraded the speakers, always meant to). It has leather and a moon roof plus automatic windows and locks. I priced it at $1,400 because there is an issue with the ABS light coming on and the car is 19 years old so there are some quirks here and there. Drives and corners great, always has.

M400E which has a tensioner in the lower receiver to apply pressure to the upper which creates a tight fit that increases accuracy and cuts out the wiggle of the upper receiver. It also has an ambi mag release and QD ports on both sides of the back of the lower. I have added a Midwest Industries 2 piece rail, BCM medium charging handle, Sightmark sight that is really nice for what most will use it for, Stark Industries grip which has a QD port in the back, Magpul MS4 sling, which is the QD style to go with the multitude of QD ports on the lower, rail, and grip. There is a total of 8 magazines that all have self leveling followers. A MOLLE Otis cleaning kit for the rifle, in my opinion it is excellent because it has a tool to clean everything you need to with the exception of a gas tube brush. A condor bag that comes with 3 MOLLE pouches, and to top it all off... 500 rounds of federal ammo."

There are some cosmetic blemishes.  The slide is originally stainless but was krylon'd black because I was too cheap for cerakote.  It's not hard to remove if you prefer the stainless slide look or want to refinish it.

The M37 was the last of the .30 caliber air-cooled Brownings adopted by the US military. After WW2 the Army needed an improved tank machine gun. The 1919A4 had some drawbacks as a coaxial tank MG, so work began around 1950 to produce a serviceable weapon. The M37 can be fed from either side and has a link chute opposite the feed side. The bolt has dual tracks for alternate operation of the belt feeding pawl. The pawl can be reversed and the pawl lever moved to the other side. Two wedge shaped switches close off the unused track, and the ejector can be reversed. The top cover can easily be opened from either side by rotating a winged knob. The gun is charged from the rear via a retracting slide. The driving spring is captive and is secured to the right side plate at the rear by sliding a conical block into a dovetailed slot. There is no driving spring rod protruding through the back plate. The back plate envelopes the receiver sides and can be easily removed by depressing a latch at the top. There is a horizontal trigger safety, and the left side sight base has been eliminated. The rear sight base is integral to the top plate. The M37 was primarily a tank gun and was used on both the M48 & M60 Patton medium tanks. The fixed version, the M37C was also used on the OH-13 Sioux and OH-23 Raven helicopter gunships on the skid-mounted M1 armament sub-system. For the most part the M37 is a highly modified (and improved) Browning 1919 which can feed from the right or left. . Major credit cards accepted +3.5%"

I bought this for my ex in 1993 (92?) because she 'wanted some protection' when we lived in the boonies. Not certain if it was ever fired, I know it wasn't as of 1999, I came back into possession of the rifle in 2002 and know it has not been fired since I regained ownership. She kept this in a wall rack for years and there is very light speckling on the top of the barrel only. Otherwise, it is just about like new. I don't believe the stock has a nick or scratch on it . . . 

Rifle comes with 5 OEM 10-rnd Marlin mags, has two sling attachment points, hard rubber butt plate, and comes with original Tasco scope (cheapie 4x15 scope not currently mounted)

The CX4 is a semiauto pistol-caliber carbine designed to give you the familiar controls of your favorite Beretta combat handgun. It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies aross the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.

The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.

This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.

The CX4 jsut begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization.
