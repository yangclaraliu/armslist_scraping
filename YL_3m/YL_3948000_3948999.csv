The P320 is a polymer-framed service pistol designed from the ground up with the input of law enforcement officers. The P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by Sig Sauer, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a full-size to a carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. With a partially pretensioned striker, it has a crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset. The P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw.The reversible magazine release makes this pistol completely ambidextrous. Pistol ships with 2 magazines and paddle holster.

 it has been carried a lot, and the finish has turned into a nice gun metal gray that I find rather attractive. That being said, no real rust issues.
The 1st gen p32 has a more robust extractor than the newer ones. And better steel than the second gen also.
I love this gun and it has protected me many,many days. Shoots straight, Goes bang every time, and I would continue to carry it of I did not need some cash.
No excessive play in the slide. 
Comes with 67 rounds of privi partizan jacketed hollow points, and 2 rounds hornady critical defense JHP. Also a worthless little holster.

Offers less than $400 will be ignored.  Sorry, this is a hard to find model and worth at least that in my opinion.  Thanks for looking.

Here's some info on it:

http://chinesesks.weebly.com/k-sports-composite.html

Parkerized, has an OD colored polymer stock.  Good looking rifle but is older and has some finish wear and slight discoloration (nothing major, just looks like a used gun).  Rifling is crisp and clear, bore shows no signs of corrosive ammo use and neglect.  Finally got to shoot a few rounds out of it to verify function and it works flawlessly.  I'd comment on the accuracy, but shooting a rifle at 15 yards is hardly worthy of any accuracy talk.  

Only thing that doesn't appear factory based on what I've found is the 20-round magazine.  This magazine is metal and non-detachable (not one of the Tapco or Promag American ones).  Designed like the standard 10-round SKS mags.  Everything else appears just like it was imported.  Like the length, but would prefer a standard configuration Paratrooper SKS instead of this one.  Please email me with questions and I'll do my best to answer.

Kurt's Kustom Firearms (FL), TechniCarbon Dynamics ""TEK2000"" stock, dual pillar bedded, full floating barrel, adjustable aluminum recoil pad and adjustable cheek rest. Unfortunately you can't get these stocks anymore as Kurt Wala passed away in 2009. Excellent quality stock from a real craftsman.

Tasco Tactical 8-40x56mm scope, made in Hakko, Japan. These are the good ones, super clear glass, good light transmittance. They mount these on 50BMGs when you really want to reach out and touch someone. Includes 2 sun shades and Leupold rings/bases.

Harris type bipod included.

Will also include an SKB foam padded plastic/metal hard case with roller wheels and laser bore sight (unopened).

I only have 20 rds through it. I was just starting to break in the barrel, cleaned it but then got into other things and this has been sitting in the closet unused. It's basically brand new. The stock is weighted so with the scope this setup is hefty at 15lbs. It's more of a bench rest rifle. This model is before the AccuTrigger so no adjustable trigger. Not sure what the pull weight is. No issues whatsoever with anything I've listed. Prefer FFL/PPT at local dealer in the Los Angeles/OC area. I would consider trades (or trades + cash) of equal value for Glocks 19, 26 or 27 or other 9mm and 40 cal semi auto handguns. Please be reasonable with your trade offers and not lowball. I have over $1500 into this setup.
Thanks for looking.

A bit more info on the scope pulled from other forums...

Tasco Tactical TAC840x56 scope made in Japan by Hakko. This is a military contract scope for the US NAVY and has excellent optics. Hakko also made scopes for Israeli Military. This scope has a 30MM tube with 2 sunshades. This is a High Quality scope Great for tactical, targer or sniper. 8 To 40 Power and 10 YDS - 400 YDS to infinity.

This is a very good scope if it is the mil dot reticle. I ran into one years ago when looking for a target scope for a Remington 700 PSS. Hakko made some very nice scopes including the Springfield model I ended up getting for that rifle. Back then it was about 800 dollars. Back when 800 bucks bought you a high end scope. I don't know how much it is being sold for, I am assuming you have seen one advertised? I know the military contracted with Hakko to make some sniper scopes which I believe were this model. I believe it was the Navy that ordered some. I know the Israeli military also contracted with this manufacturer. They are rugged and reliable. They were used on Barrett .50 cal rifles. They had glass etched reticles and were built to take abuse. The optics were superb for long range shooting. I doubt you are looking to shoot that 1000 yard shot but you can with this scope. I don't remember exactly but the parallax may only adjust down to 10 meters. Hakko was a good manufacturer so if the price is cheap enough it may be a great buy."

This pistol has a low round count and is equipped with XS Big Dot tritium night sights which are the best night sights available today in my opinion.
The pistol is totally reliable and quite accurate. Barrel length is 3 1/2"", empty weight is 20.5 oz and capacity is 7 rounds of .45ACP firepower. This is an excellent concealed carry pistol.
The pistol comes with 3 magazines (2 used and 1 new), plastic case, papers and a new Alien Gear OWB holster. 
The gun has a few minor scratches and handling marks and overall condition is 95%+.
MSRP on this pistol new without night sights is $829. The XS sights cost $120 plus gunsmith labor to install.
I am asking $475 cash. No trades. You must be 21, have valid photo ID, be legally able to buy a handgun and be willing to sign a simple bill of sale for my records.
I prefer a local FTF sale but will ship this pistol anywhere in Oregon for $25 to your FFL."

Yet another stunning breakthrough in the tactical laser market, the Triad™ C1 combines both a covert eye safe IR aiming laser for tactical night vision operations and the very latest advanced generation Green aiming laser for dim light or daytime targeting applications. Specifically designed for the civilian market, the aiming lasers are controlled with a single set of low-profile windage and elevation dials that greatly simplify bore-sighting and adjustment manipulations. Infrared “mode” offers an eye safe laser pointer with an effective range at night of 200 meters, while the green laser has an effective range of 400 meters. Both aiming lasers can be operated individually or in combination. Activation is controlled with either the included remote cable pressure pad or built–in single tap button located on top of the housing body. Despite all of its many advanced features the Triad™ C1 is remarkably compact and maintains a low profile when weapon mounted. The ruggedized design of the Triad™ C1 ensures continued operation when submerged or when subjected to repeated heavy recoil. The system also includes an integral Picatinny rail for additional accessories as well as an adjustable quick detach throw lever mount with lock to prevent accidental detachment in the field. http://www.usnightvision.com/TriadC1CivilianLegalVisibleGreenLaser/IRLaser.aspx"

I got this boat as a partial payment for some landscaping work my company did. At the time I thought I would have the time to fix it up. I was told that it just has some carburetor issues. We got a carb kit and replaced the carb float valve assembly (and a few other things in the kit), but couldn't seem to get it running.

I'm not a mechanic and have no desire to ticker with it. I have enough on my plate with running my business.

Right now it's in my garage, and I would like to free up the space. I'm asking $700, which I think is fair, and is just a little bit more that what I'm into it from the work I did. I might start messing with it again in the next couple of days and see if I can figure it out. If I get it running I will be more firm on the price, or might pull the ad down and keep it.

I've just decided to go a different direction & use my ARs for coyote/varmint hunting & not big game. It's an Advanced Armament 16"" barrel lightweight profile with carbine length gas system. It's sold as a tuned system by AAC, the gas port is slightly larger & it comes with a tuned low profile gas block & gas tube. This allows it to cycle both supersonic & subsonic rounds reliably. The barrel & gas block & gas tube was $425.00 plus $10 shipping from them, I ordered it new from AAC. I put it on a new Anderson A3 upper that I had & ordered a new Hogue Knurled free float tube for it. It currently doesn't have a flash hider or muzzle brake on it, just a standard thread protector. I've never fired this upper, it took me several months to get the parts & save up the cash to order everything. I planned on using this upper on my coyote hunting AR, and planned on using my BCG/CH from it so I don't have a BCG/CH to include with it. I've got just over $550 in everything, but I'd take $500 cash for the upper. I would consider removing the barrel from the upper & selling the barrel/gas block/gas tube setup that way if someone wanted it that way. This setup has never been fired, all new parts."

Black finish. This is Type F config which functions the same as the Model 92FS. Can be modified easily to a Type G with Beretta's factory kit, so that it becomes a decocker only pistol instead of a decocker/safety pistol.

Comes with the two factory 17 round mags, plus an additional two 20 rounders that I bought (they are a very nice fit and don't extend much, makes a great mag to have loaded in for the nightstand) valued at 50 dollars each. The Storm mags are extremely high quality like most any Beretta handgun mags, made by MecGar in Italy.

This pistol has hardly any recoil with the rotating barrel design. Everything about it is just very smooth and well made, the slide racks very easily, it recoils extremely softly, it is lights out accurate and the DA/SA trigger on it is superb and easily compares to the DA/SA on a Sig Sauer. Single action is very light and crisp, lends itself very well to fast and accurate fire. Double action is about 10 pounds, but feels ridiculously smooth, it is very easy to keep it on target during the DA pull.

I love everything about this gun and I regret feeling the need to sell it at this point in time, so I hope it goes to a good owner. Asking 500 firm for the package, that is a great price given the expensive 20 round mags are included. Has original case and everything, all three backstraps included, mag loader included, Beretta factory paperwork. This is essentially still a new gun.

I know everyone watches Pawn Stars and Dickerin' these days so let me just say it again: price is 500 firm, I've already haggled ahead of time and am giving you a fair market price for the package. I won't debundle the mags and sell you just the pistol by itself or anything like that. 500 gets the gun, all four mags, all original Beretta factory 'stuff'."

First off, 4 German-made Flecktarn frag vests. They were available for a while but the surplus is now dried up (they probably sent what was left as aid to the middle east). These vests are relatively light, comfortable and have great coverage. Ballistic protection is surprisingly good, perhaps about IIa equivalent based upon some less-than-scientific testing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA-A_i3pJGc
People have also used them as plate carriers, sewing pouches on the inside. That way you get AR500 front and back with fragmentation protection on your sides and neck.
They're also good for airsofting, costumes, collecting, etc.

Of the 4 I have, 2 are """"Large"" and 2 are ""Extra Large"". All have 1995 production dates except one of the XLs is 1996.

Asking 60$ each. Can ship for extra.

Item #2 is a Vietnam War-era M69 frag vest. It's made of ballistic nylon so it is quite heavy. I couldn't recommend using it for your SHTF stash, but people do collect these things and use them for re-enactments. The outer vest is in pretty good shape with only very small rips. The Nylon itself looks to be in great shape.

Asking 150$

Item #3 is a pair of E. German M59 Stalhelms. These are post-war examples with heavily sloped edges to increase the chance of deflecting incoming fire. As far as steel helmets go they offer the best ballistic protection. PASGTs are still better, but aren't as cheap.
