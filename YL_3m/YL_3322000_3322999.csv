Please Text 479 four four 5 zero 361.   
This gun has less than 50 rds run thru it and is in excellent condition.  
The MSRP with only 2 mags is $509.   
This Cougar has several beneficial features, such as its barrel and recoil system.  
A departure from the prevalent tilt-style system that dominates most semi-autos today, the 8045 F sports something different under its sleek, Bruniton-coated hide. 
A quick field strip reveals a locked-breech system utilizing a rotating barrel. 
The rotating design keeps the bore axis better aligned with the target, providing greater accuracy.
 What’s more, the mechanism reduces felt recoil and muzzle flip.
In addition to its compact size, all the edges on the Cougar’s non-glare steel slide are beveled to get rid of any sharp edges, which promote a snag-free draw while also preventing the pistol from shredding a shooter’s clothing, carry gear or hands with feline-like fury.
The Cougar feels good in hand due to the grip indent and being well balanced and points extremely well. 
The frame also contains a heavy-duty dust cover with an integral rail for mounting lights or lasers.
The Cougar 8045F has ambidextrous decocking/safety levers, making weak hand shooting easier."

Precious few were made with the shorter 7 1/2 inch barrels and those that exist are worth their weight in 'gold'. If you own a Virginian Dragoon and have the longer barrel, you will want to snap this original barrel up for your revolver. Owning this will make it a one of a kind and the price goes off the charts. I am asking 150.00 and will accept this price if purchased the first 10 days of posting or after that will accept the highest bid. I can send several pictures of the stamping marks, the entire barrel, etc. I have some pictures posted on www.gunlistings.org that you can view. This is a once in a life time chance for anyone out there owning a .41 Dragoon with the 12 inch barrel. Seller pays postage/shipping.

Revolver is gone, Muff Pistol remains. I've owned this since 1995. Bought on a lark in New Orleans. If memory serves its about circa 1848. Don't remember the type of wood. German Silver medallion on back strap. Dolphin Hammer. Drop Trigger, drops when hammer is cocked. Barrel is about 2"" long. The caliber is thought to be about .50. Whole thing is about 6.5"" long. The barrel unscrews for cleaning. Everything functions as it should. But if you want to shoot it I would refer you to a gunsmith first. Printed on left side is ""Wm Jeffery"" and below that ""Plymouth."" There is a proof mark on the bottom in front of the trigger. Has scroll work on both sides top and bottom. That's about it.
The story is that British women in need of protection would hide this type of gun in their Hand Muff. Which is a hand warmer. I've heard all the jokes.

If you know hard use rifles, you know that I spared no expense building this one. The sights and trigger alone were well over $500. I have well over $2k in the rifle as it sits. Round count is sub-1k and probably more like 800. The rifle has been painted with a base coat of tan and a light green Krylon. Which can be removed. I was going to go with a multi-cam but quit any further progress as soon as I got my SCAR 17. Any questions feel free to text or call before 21:30/9:30 PM @ 619-30one-one977 and yes I live in Austin despite the area code. Price is $1700 OBO. $1500 w/o folding sights.

It is a more rare early Sile import with the blued bolt carrier that came on earlier models and came with the optional mount.   As you can see from pics the finish and wood looks great.

I will consider cash and trade offers around $2,000, definitely no hurry to move this one, so not jumping on the first offer unless it is a really good deal or something(s) I think I can put to use.  The Norinco will likely just sit in the safe as long as I own it or until a SHTF scenario, then it would be my first choice, lol.

The Jimenez Arms J.A. .380 is quite possibly one of the simplest, easiest to use and most comfortable compact .380's on the market today. Jimenez Arms includes such features as: a comfortable stance and an extended finger rest located at the bottom of the magazine. Other manufacturers offer this feature only on specialty clips at higher prices. Jimenez Arms, however, includes this feature at no extra cost. If you're in the market for a compact .380 and price, accuracy and comfort is a factor- the Jimenez Arms J.A. 380 is your solution.

Gun is in excellent condition, has had about 50 rounds through it. 

Comes with 2 HKS speed loaders, 2 Fobus holsters (ankle and right handed paddle) and the S&W hard case the weapon came in new. The gun is a great shooter, I'm only selling it to help fund a tree house project. 

Asking for the best offer around $350, not really interested in trades right now, although I'd possibly take some bulk .22 LR as partial trade. 

Text Jon at REDACTED if interested, or feel welcome to email me through Armslist. 

Picked this up new at a gunshow in Texas several years back.

I prefer an unmodified gun with 'honest' wear - something that may have some holster wear but no real signs of abuse. My preference is a 4"" barrel but would also consider other calibers and barrel lengths.  And while I'm mostly thinking of something like a Security Six, Service Six, or a Speed Six, I also have an affection for the single action cowboy guns.

I'm not necessarily looking for a showpiece or collectors item - just a nice shooter at a reasonable (non-retail) price.  I'm also not opposed to a project, if the function is good but the appearance is a little rough.

Please send me pics and approximate round count (and most importantly price).  I'll respond to all emails and will remove this ad when I've bought the gun that I'm looking for.

Thanks for your time.

(Also looking for affordable full- or mid-size Glock  in 9mm or .40)."

The frame was detail stripped and painted in a Flat Dark Earth color.  There is no paint on the internals.  For folks worried about the paint job I can assure you it's tough.  It's Rust-Oleum enamel and it's held up very well for two hunting seasons.  Under normal use and reasonable care it will not come off.  You have to be very rough to damage this finish.  I've tried to scratch the finish off with fingernails and I can't.  Comes with four 15rd magazines. I can provide more pictures if needed.

I have up for your consideration a collector grade S&W 39-2 (9 mm single stack semi-auto) in great shape.  Forum members on the S&W forum have put the production date at mid to late 1971 but S&W can give you a firmer date if you call customer service.  Not sure if it has been shot. If it has, can't be more than a box through it considering the condition (notice no wear on the rails on the slide). Comes with clip, original box, manual, tool set (still sealed in the plastic baggy), extra clip wrapped in the S&W waxed paper, warranty card and manual. This 39-2 is one of the early ones that had the best features of the 39 and 39-2. One tell tale sign of a unmolested gun is the grip screw and these grip screws have not ever seen a screwdriver.
Blueing in in great shape.  What looks like blueing loss on the LH side of the slide serations is a reflection from my camera flash.
Only downsides are a very light scratch on the RH side of the slide and a light mark above the Smith (probably from sitting in the box and having the drawer it was in for 40 years opened and closed.
This is a really great collector firearm but it would also make a great conversation piece at the range if you were to decide  to turn this into a shooter.  
39-2s in this shape with all the original gear are going in the $800 range (+shipping) on GunBroker and the collectability of these is only going up.  Would prefer to sell FTF (following all IL and ATF laws) and have this collector grade 39-2 go to someone local.  If you want this shipped to you, it'd be an additional $40 shipped from my FFL to your FFL.   
Price dropped from 800 to 700."

The FNH has given a old piece of technology more than just an interesting facelift. The FN TPS is a essentially a highly modified and updated Winchester 1300 pump shotgun. The modifications & updates have resulted in a very modern-looking 12 gauge pump-action shotgun that ""borrows"" various tactical features from the AR-15/M16. This FN Tactical Police Shotgun features a Back-Ported 18"" Barrel, the GLR16-S Super Recoil Reduction Multi-position Collapsible Buttstock, the M16 pistol grip, the M1913 picatinny rail, and iron sights (including the cut-down rear sight) that are utilized by all current ""A3"" type AR-15/M16's and M4's. Basically, FN has managed to design a pump shotgun with the same ergonomic and handling characteristics as the AR-15/M16. The TPS also features what FN calls an Internal Tactical Choke (ITC), which controls the spread of (lead or steel) buckshot loads. The TPS weighs 6.5 lbs empty, and has an ammunition capacity of 7 + 1. The FN Tactical Police Shotgun (TPS) is a well put together package. This weapon is extremely popular in both the law enforcement & civilian home defense market."

I'm looking to trade or buy where as I only need the rail and not the barrel nut and bolt ring, because I cannot remove mine bc of the pinned comp. so I would be willing to trade just rails in anyone is interested in a shorter quad rail.  I have other items to trade as well if you're interested:

Complete lower with magpul str stock, grip and trigger guard in fde
18"" cold hammer forged upper with wylde chamber, rifle gas, 1:8"" twist, 15"" MI ssk Free float handguard

And I also have a trijicon rmr, dual illuminated, 9moa amber dot with low rail mount included"

The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

The barrels are lightweight-profiled with rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.

About LaRue Firearm Accuracy:

LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm.  LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results."

CDMAG - .223 POLYMER 30 ROUND COUNTDOWN MAGAZINE

U.S. patent # US 8,186,086 B2

This unique magazine provides a visual indicator showing the exact number of remaining rounds in the magazine. The visual indicator has a colored background for easier  and quicker round determinations, 30 - 21 rounds show a green background, 20 -11 rounds show a yellow background and 10 - 0 rounds show a red background.  The visual indicator can be viewed without losing the sight picture.
To make a 100% reliable polymer magazine, we start with a magazine body made from a high impact polymer strong enough to be run over by a truck and still function.  The interior of the magazine body is formed with contours in the shape of the round to prevent jams and misfeeds.  A non-tilting follower and stainless steel spring produces a magazine you can count on for 100% reliability.  With the round counting windows showing you the remaining rounds at a glance, you now have a  superior design, executed flawlessly, resulting in your tactical advantage.

Added a Ranier Arms Raptor ambidextrous charging handle and an enhanced chrome silicon buffer spring estimated to last 750,000 cycles.

What is unique about the 300 Blackout is that apart from the barrel (due to larger caliber) the rifle uses the exact parts as an AR-15 .223/5.56. Same magazines, same buffer, same bolt and bolt carrier group. Same stock. Same hand guard and Picattiny rails. So by changing out the barrel you can have two rifles in one. An AR-15 .223/5.56 or a 300 Blackout. 

Excellent condition. Only 3 rounds fired. Beautiful Flat Dark Earth upper, lower, stock and hand guard. Pictures attached. Comes with foam lined hard plastic carry case. Must sell in 24-48 hrs.

I have a massive stash of .22 hollow point rounds made by Remington; the ones that come in that classic green box we're all familiar with.

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.
