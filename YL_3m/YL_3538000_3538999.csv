Heckler & Koch M700009-A5 VP9 9mm Pistol, Striker Fired, 4.09 Inch Barrel, 15 Rd, Night Sights
In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.
Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitor’s. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
VP9 pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

The M1903 Springfield, formally the United States Rifle, Caliber .30-06, Model 1903, is an American clip-loaded, 5-round magazine fed, bolt-action service rifle used primarily during the first half of the 20th century.

It was officially adopted as a United States military bolt-action rifle on June 19, 1903, and saw service in World War I. It was officially replaced as the standard infantry rifle by the faster-firing semi-automatic 8 round M1 Garand starting in 1937. However, the M1903 Springfield remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during World War II, since the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm all troops. It also remained in service as a sniper rifle during World War II, the Korean War, and even in the early stages of the Vietnam War. It remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector's piece, and as a military drill rifle."

In the end I ended up putting through less than ~750 rounds (estimating by how many boxes of ammo I used) and it has been in storage ever since. It was stored in a soft shell case and from what I can see has sustained NO damage during storage. The original Ruger branded lock had to be cut off because I left the gun in my parent's care for a few months when I was moving around and they lost the keys. 

The gun also has a automatic bolt release. The gun was the red dot laser sight package and as such comes with that. Laser sight works, but has never been used other than to confirm it works. It does NOT however come with a battery.

Still tight, and needs many, many more rounds to break in. No issues with this handgun. The only thing I didn't really like is that the spring is pretty tight, and you have to cock it fairly swiftly. This is a design aspect of the gun. No blemishes, no problems, and I will truly hate to see this go, but such is life when you put the dough down on a couple SIG's!

I want to move this Smith and Wesson Shield in decent order, so I have put an aggressive price on this as you will see.

Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

3 Position Safety Decocker
Try the ambidextrous Three-Position Safety on any Taurus pistol capable of firing in both single action and double action. It's easily operated and provided at no additional charge. Depress with your thumb and safely drop the hammer to de-cock the pistol. The safety returns to the OFF position, ready for double action shooting. Push the safety up and your cocked pistol is safe to carry in the single action mode. When applied to a de-cocked pistol, safety is ON and the first shot is double action.

Taurus Security System (TSS)a
All the Taurus family of revolvers features the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your firearm and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

I have done the research and everything here is 922r compliant and with all these parts you will be able to build a legal AK-74 from Saiga, with all the US made parts required for a converted AK-74, with a Saiga rifle platform, arguably the highest quality AK manufacturer. 

The best part? This will be done via private sale, so not only do you get a now banned AK-74 straight from Russia, but you also get the parts to make a formidable AK-74 without requiring to do a registration (before I-594 passes)

Why am I selling/trading this rifle? I recently moved and don't have access to tools and the only place I can get them is hours away. I just don't have the time so I'd either like cash or a functioning AK in 5.45x39.

This isn't some WASR or polish tantal AK this is the top of the line of AK's and if you look up reviews you will see why.

Features:

1. 1:7 twist 16"" M4 barrel profile with carbine length gas block, A2 front sight and M4 feed ramp.

2. PSA lower with mil spec trigger, mag release etc.

3. PSA BCG, nothing fancy

4. MagPul folding rear back up sight.

5. PSA lower, multi caliber.  The rear part of the lower was milled by me to clear a takedown pin issue.  M4 stock, standard buffer tube.  Rear not staked because I hadn't decided what I wanted in a rear stock. 

6. MagPul MOE hand guards.

There is a bit of a mar near the flash hider, I've included a photo.  It's purely cosmetic.

The rifle is 700 firm, but for an extra 30 bucks I'll throw in 2 MagPul 30 round magazines and 1 aluminum 30 round magazine.  Throw in another 40 bucks and I'll toss in 100 rounds of Wolf 5.56 62gr and 40 rounds of PMC Bronze 55gr. And finally, although I hate to do it, for 20 bucks more, I'll throw in 20 rounds of Hornady Zombie Max.  

I built this just to see if I could, so I don't have to sell it, it's a good rifle that shoots straight and I think I have less than 500 rounds through it.   I will require a photo ID, I do not ship out of state and if I think you're sketchy, no deal.  Oh, and cash in hand before I even open the case."

When I took it out it fed CCI Minimags and CCI Standard pretty reliably.  It choked on pretty much all of the cheap bulk ""bricks"" (Federal Automatch and Winchester 550 pack) that I tried in it but honestly I only fired a few mags of bulk ammo through it.  Comes with one six round magazine.  

It's a pretty concealable gun but it seems picky about ammo and they are cheaply manufactured but may be a good ""fun gun"" or good for somebody who collects them.

Thanks for looking.  If interested just use the site's contact function or text and I'll get back to you quickly.  

Will consider reasonable offers and trades.

Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

3 Position Safety Decocker
Try the ambidextrous Three-Position Safety on any Taurus pistol capable of firing in both single action and double action. It's easily operated and provided at no additional charge. Depress with your thumb and safely drop the hammer to de-cock the pistol. The safety returns to the OFF position, ready for double action shooting. Push the safety up and your cocked pistol is safe to carry in the single action mode. When applied to a de-cocked pistol, safety is ON and the first shot is double action.

Taurus Security System (TSS)a
All the Taurus family of revolvers features the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your firearm and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

This is the Pro, or Commander sized 1911. Full size magazine well so you can fit any standard 7 or 8 round mag, while having a slightly shorter and more maneuverable 4"" barrel.

It does have 3-dot night sights, however they are pretty dim. This pistol is in great shape with no faults or big scratches. I have only taken it to the range once (no malfuntions, including various hollowpoint ammunition) and it was promptly cleaned afterwards.

As you might know, this is the earlier generation Kimber 1911 when they actually built a nicer pistol than the II series of today. The slide got a better carry melt treatment, no bothersome Swartz firing pin safety, and generally a superior build quality. Do your research, these are sought after more than the current line of Kimbers and not many come up for sale.

First $800 gets the pistol along with an 8rd magazine. Additional magazines and/or leather holsters also available for extra (depending if they sell on cross listed sites).

This is not a CMP build 308. This gun was custom built.

The rifle is all USGI parts, most of the later 65 or 77 series parts, with the exception of the barrel. The barrel is a Criterion M1 Garand contour barrel with a 1:10 twist which should allow you to shoot any ammo from surplus to match with excellent accuracy. It is NOT chrome lined. I have been able to consistently paper 1 ¼ in groups and I am quite sure it is capable of shooting better than I can.

The receiver was a purchase from the CMP and IS NOT A RE-WELD

All USGI parts were hand selected and are either new old stock or newer parts well within acceptable tolerance. The stock is in excellent shape, again a USGI item with a nice DAS stamp. The rifle has fired for me without a single problem.

It has National Match front and rear sights and is an excellent shooting rifle. The trigger group has been tuned and polished to National Match standards by Master Gunsmith Jeff Shapiro. It also features an adjustable gas plug which will allow you to adjust gas blow back for any round you may be shooting. The receiver and op rod have been nicely laser engraved with the words “NATO 7.62 mm”

I am in Marysville and would prefer a face to face and I am willing to split driving if in a reasonable distance. If you adopt to do it by mail I will need a money order or bank check plus an FFL to send to. It is C&R eligible. SHIPPING COST WOULD NEED TO BE DETERMINED.

Email me at REDACTED or send text message to REDACTED. I work night shift so if possible include a time which would be best to respond. Also, considering the night shift I may not be able to respond immediately but I will respond.

Asking $1600 OBO or a Springfield M1A

It’s a truly awesome piece and is in flawless condition but I have a couple of bills that need to be paid and I’m wanting to start a new project.  This is the TA31RMR.  https://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=TA31RMR  The main Trijicon scope (4x32) provides a dual-illuminated reticle using fiber optics and tritium for bright aiming point in any light condition.  The ranging reticle allows for bullet drop compensation out to 600 meters without any manual adjustments.  A Trijicon RMR® sits on top with a 3.25 MOA aiming dot.  I’ve also added the LaRue Tactical LT681 quick detach mount to it.  http://www.laruetactical.com/larue-tactical-acog-rco-mount  Designed by request, these mounts position a Trijicon ACOG further to the rear for use with M16A2-length stocks, and are especially useful to users wearing body armor. The contoured aft-section allows easy access to charging handle. This mount was designed specifically for the Trijicon ACOG RCO (Rifle Combat Optic), but works with all ACOG models.  It will also come with a Scopecoat and a set of TA71E ACOG External Adjuster Caps & Lanyard Assembly and the original caps.  I also have all the original parts/pieces to include.  This retails for $2,266.00 at Trijicon.  I think I paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $1,800 for it.  I’m asking $1,450 OBO shipped to CONUS with tracking and insurance.  Payment by Paypal gift only.  Feel free to send REASONABLE offers or ask questions.  If the price is right, I have a few extra Trijicon and LaRue goodies I’ll throw in.  Thanks.

Product Information

Shop more Leupold products  The Leupold Zero Point Boresighter has a unique lens aperture system that eliminates point of aim errors from parallax due to extreme misalignment and allows you to get your riflescope on target fast. Precise collimation of the prismatic optical system provides accurate measurement of where your riflescope is aimed, regardless of where the boresighter is placed on the muzzle. The powerful neodymium magnetic attachment works for nearly all firearms and all calibers without the need for separate arbors. The Leupold boresighter also includes natural backlighting of the target, LED illumination for use in low light settings and an inch scale for measuring approximate riflescope height and target group sizes. The Leupold Zero Point Boresighter has an energy efficient design which yields approximately 25 hours of battery life. Includes range cards for recording sight-in information.

Seriously, if you have a used gun, it's not worth more than new.  You might find some moron that buys it but that's because you sold it to a moron and you're that kind of used car salesman.  Ok fine.  

But if you really want to move your weapon, stop over-pricing it and expect to lose a $100 every now and then.  It's not the end of the world.  Move your product and stop spamming armslist with your same add every day.  There's a bump-button on the listing for a reason."
