Its a real nice rifle! Comes with a redfield fixed 4 power scope and a nice leather sling. Make an offer!

From 1964-80, the Model 110P (Premier Grade) was produced; it was a deluxe version of the Model 110E. It was chambered only in a few calibers, used a 24-inch barrel for the 7mm Magnum version, and had a French walnut stock with a half-length fore-end and a roll-over Monte Carlo comb. The fore-end had a rosewood endcap, and the checkering on the pistol grip wrist and fore-end had a skip-line pattern. The Model 110PE Presentation Grade model is even more fancy than the Model 110P, with engraving on the receiver, trigger guard, magazine floorplate, and stock; and they rarely were fitted with iron sights (though they were always drilled and tapped). They are otherwise identical for game purposes to the Model 110P. While the Model 110PE is rare, the Model 110PEL left-handed version is virtually never seen. The Model 110P also had a left-handed version, the Model 110PL.         Must abide by all rules, ispc check and waiting period! Please don't waste my time!"

Utilizing our proven long stroke piston system, the MK1 series greatly reduces fouling in the action of the weapon making it as reliable as the AK47 that it was designed after. 

The MK1 series has been used in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has gained wide popularity with security personnel, law enforcement and civilians alike. 

The origins of the MK1 series began with the fascination in the simplicity and reliability of the AK47 combined with a deep-rooted appreciation for the ergonomics of the M4/M16 platform. Having a significant understanding of the deficiencies in the direct gas impingement operating system found on conventional M4/M16-style weapons, PWS developed the MK1 series with the professional in mind. 

Significant improvements have been made over both the direct gas impingement operating system and previous offerings of piston-driven operating systems. The product improvements made by PWS have addressed reliability and performance issues as well as reduced carrier tilt, cam pin wear and carrier bounce. In addition, we have one of the lightest systems on the market today! 

An innovative hand guard system utilizes a proprietary non-free float system that allows the end user or unit armorer to replace individual rails as needed without removing the barrel, barrel nut or even other rails. This system allows the user to attach numerous Picatinny rail-mounted devices such as sights, lights, and laser aiming devices. 

The PWS proprietary operating system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating head piston that is attached to the operating rod. The MK1 series is built to be a true combat carbine. With no unnecessary gas adjustments and only one moving assembly, this is the most rugged, simple and versatile piston operating system available. 


The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2” sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER™ charging handle, and the PWS enhanced buffer tube."

I also installed the rubberized talon grips for a better feel.
The holster is a HBE Leatherworks pro TL, rough side out for better retention.

I have a perfect-shooting Hi-Point JHP in .45 ACP, with two extra magazines, ammo, and a paddle holster.  As anyone who looks up Hi-Point reviews knows, this is a very reliable, accurate, powerful, made-in-the-USA gun with a lifetime warranty.  It's just ugly, heavy, and clunky.

I'll include 50 rounds of hollowpoint .45 ammo.

I got it for a bedside gun, and I'm not in a hurry to part with it, but I'm interested to see what's out there.  I'd probably be interested in a basic Taurus like a 738 TCP or an early Millennium, another TTC, or maybe something that would need cash on my end.

I'll also sell for cash, so please consider what's included and make me an offer.

As a striker-fired blowback design, it's surprisingly fun to shoot and doesn't have much recoil for a .45.  The sights make quick aim easy.  I usually keep it in condition 1 (with a round in the chamber) by my bed or when I carry, so that it's ready for duty immediately.

Thanks for looking!"

It's had around 200 rounds through it. It has 1 week old Truglo TFO night sights installed by Guns and Leather. It also has a new Remora pocket holster and a box of Hornady Critical Defense ammo included. Comes with 2 mags ( one has the Pearce pinky extension ). Also have the box and paperwork included. It's in new condition and an awesome little pocket gun. I'm just looking to see what kind of trades there may be out there. Really wanting a Kahr PM9 or a nice auto 12 gauge maybe. Or other intersting toys perhaps. Nothing wrong with the gun,  I just like to trade. I need to find a cheaper hobby though.. Lol... The gun was $429, sights $125, holster $20, ammo $25.. As you can see that's $600 before tax so I think $550 trade value is fair."

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.




Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols.

For sale or trade today is a Bersa Thunder .380 duo-tone.  This is a fun-shooting gun with lots of safety, making it an excellent choice for an intermediate shooter.  The design is very similar to the Walther PPKS, but the controls are in a more Western configuration, making it more comfortable for most American shooters.  It includes pleasant rubber grips, a single-stack 7-round magazine, fixed white-dot sights, carry box, and a key for the internal lock.

This sale includes a small amount of ammo, including some hollow-point rounds.

The Bersa Thunder .380 is a blowback-operated semi-auto hammer-fired double/single action handgun.  The fixed barrel design is extremely accurate and reliable, and field-strip for cleaning is a breeze.

Safety features abound!  If you want a good gun for pocket or purse, but you don't want to worry about accidentally shooting it when looking for your phone, then this is an excellent choice.  It includes a safety lever with trigger disconnect, hammer block, and decocker.  It also includes a magazine disconnect safety.  I would confidently carry it with a round in the chamber and the hammer dropped, knowing that in a crisis I can switch the safety off and squeeze the trigger.

This Semi Auto Rifle has the highly desirabled 20in fluted barrel. This rifle has been banned from import so when these are sold there will be no more new imports from Russia. Built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

This is the model that is most desirable, being the early Mark II, all steel and is great condition.   The serial number is 212-20XXX, so it was manufactured in 1986.  

The gun retains 90 or 95% of it's blueing, and is in great condition.  It's always cleaned after shooting, and looks just a year or two old (not 28 years!)  Never carried or left outside; no rust or corrosion anywhere.  The gun looks better in person in my opinion; in the pictures it's hard to tell if the blueing is worn off all over it.  (it is not!)

The grips are in great condition, and it comes with one magazine.  I believe I also have the box; I'll have to check on that.

I'll need to see ID and I'd prefer to see a CWP.  I might be interested in trades - I'm mostly interested in antique and interested firearms.  I can add cash to the deal if needed.
Price on the Ruger is firm.

Built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel. Vepr in 5.45x39 caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined Fluted barrel is 20” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope. Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage. They are shipped with one 10-round magazine and one 5 round magazine, a cleaning rod, and a cleaning kit.

I'm the third owner and have only had for a few months. Recently acquired a full size so I'm getting rid of this one. It's in very good shape for the year 169,000 miles. No rips in seats, no cracks in dash. Very good tires and is tag, insured, and inspected. Motor had new timing chain and gear by previous owner. I've put  some new vacuum lines on it, air filter, changed oil and trans fluid, plugs, wires distributor cap, rotor button, new coolant temperature sensor, pcv valve, egr solinoid, and probably some more general tune up things. I had brand new 2 1/2 exhaust put on from the y pipe back and cleaned out the cat. All new lenses all the way around, new mirrors (still have all the stuff I pulled off.) I can drive it daily and it is dependable. The bad-- rust on outside above rear wheels only on outer shell of bed. The transmission if put in overdrive from start won't go to first gear, it must be put in drive and when you get going you can put it in over drive if you like with no problem. If it is bone cold you must let it warm up for 5 min or so before you can engage reverse but that is only after it sets overnight. The guy that sold it to me told me about it before I bought it and said it has been doing this for three years he owned it and since it never went out he never replaced it. It could be as simple as some kind of vacuum for the trans or even the kickdown/detent cable. 
I can drive it anywhere and for however long and it does great. Willing to prove so before sale. Also have tool box that came on it. I took it off so I could haul my four wheeler.

Its in good shape and is less than a year old with a fairly low round count. Has some light holster wear across the top of the slide but is otherwise in good shape. Will come with its case and three 15 round magazines, and it also has night sights.

I havent had any problems with it but its a bit too long for my preferred carry style, so Id be interested in trading it for something a bit more compact in .40. Primarily interested in a similarly equipped M&P40c, XD40 subcompact, XDm 3.8 compact in .40, M&P Shield .40+a little cash, or other similar .40 caliber handguns. Really only looking for that caliber and not interested in rifles or shotguns at this time. No Kel Tecs or Tauruses please..
