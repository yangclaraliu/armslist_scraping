 Lets all start flagging as overpriced any 22LR ammo that is greater than 10 cents a round.  That way we can set our own ceiling and maybe discourage some of the more outrageous resellers.  The only way we are going to see ammo on a regular basis is to discuourage the heavy gougers.

You can view it there if you like. Sorry for the terrible photos. It Looks so much nicer in real life!!!! You will be looking at my Safe Queen. I bought this gun in 2001 for $639.00. It is the Rare Titanium Cylinder with Scandium and Aluminum frame. It has Never been fired, and Comes with a Crimson Trace  laser sight which at the time was over $200.00. I am looking to get what I paid for it! I checked the Online gun sites and there are currently none for sale. This Gun has spent most of it's life in my safe, and never has been out of my house! With the Crimson Trace grips it weighs 13 oz. The Original grips are included and in Like New condition also. Great Carry Piece for the Pocket, or Purse. With the new reduced recoil Personal Protection ammunition this is very manageable for the ladies.  If you want Hot loads it will handle the +P ammo. There are very few of these available, so if you like it don't pass it up. All FOID requirements will be fulfilled, and a BOS is required. I did see one S&W 342PD which was used and it sold for $899.00. I will include a DeSantis holster for it also! We can talk about some ammo if wanted. IF YOU WANT ME TO SEND YOU MORE, AND CLEARER PICTURES PLEASE ASK Please send email address! Thx, Jim  text: 847-2zero7-576zero"

It's the 12.5 inch barrel version. I've only put 300 rounds through it. The previous owner was a family friend. They never fired it, so it only has the 300 down the tube. I put up a picture of some damage to the finish near the windage drum. I bought a cheap NC Star sighting tool and the hole wasn't big enough for the windage drum to move into. I thought the drum was just stiff from being new-ish. Me being an idiot, I gave the tool a couple extra whacks with a hammer and made it clamp even harder on the finish. That's what happened there. Besides that, the gun has always shot very reliably and is a fun gun to shoot. I'll include at least a steel mag and a tapco mag. If you have any questions or want a pic of anything else, just shoot me a message. Thanks!"

Whether you are just learning how to shoot or you've been shooting for years, shooting a 22LR is a great way to spend an afternoon as the cost of the ammunition can run as low as $.04/round making it a great target practice rifle.

Mossberg's 702 Plinkster chambered in 22 LR is an ideal entry level semi-automatic rifle with a natural fit into your shoulder, limited recoil, durable construction, and accuracy. With a 12.25"" stock and an 18"" long barrel, this rifle is ideal for young shooters or smaller stature adults. With a 3/8"" dovetail receiver, many standard scopes can be mounted on the rail system.
This rifle includes a 10 round magazine. For 150 I will add a simmons 3-9 x39 scope or a Soft Case. for 175 I'll add scope and soft case."

More MAK-90 rifles were imported from China than any other model of semi automatic AK type rifle from any other country. The model name MAK-90 stands for Modified AK-1990.This was because AK rifles with pistol grips, folding stocks, threaded muzzles and bayonets were banned from importation to the USA in 1989. The first AK rifles imported in 1990 after the ban were modified by replacing the the pistol grip and stock with a one piece wooden thumbhole stock. The threaded end of the barrel had a muzzle nut screwed on to cover the threads and some were tack welded on. The bayonet lug was ground down so a bayonet wouldn't lock on. The model name was ground off and the modified rifle had the new model name MAK-90 stamped on them. Some had 90 added to the serial number that denoted the year of import. The MAK-90 rifles imported after 1990 had the threads on the muzzle turned off and a 2 digit year of import stamped in front of or in back of the serial number. Some have a space or dash between the serial number and 2 digit year of import stamping. There were a half dozen or so companies that imported MAK-90 rifles. The importers company name, city and state will be stamped on one side or the bottom of the receiver.  Some had it stamped on the barrel between the gas block and front sight.

All MAK-90 rifles have stamped sheet metal receivers except for one lot of rifles imported in 1993 that had receivers milled from a solid block of steel. The two types of receivers can be distinguished from each other easily because the stamped receiver has rivets holding it together and the milled receiver has no rivets.


The MAK-90 has a larger diameter barrel,1.5mm thick stamped sheet metal receiver and the double hook disconector of the Ak-47. Other models of AK rifles imported from other countries with the same length barrel have smaller diameter barrels,1mm thick stamped sheet metal receivers, and the single hook disconector of the AKM rifle.  The front sight of the MAK-90 has a fully enclosed hood/sight protector with a hole in the top and a smooth receiver cover of the AK-47 Vs. the sight protector that is open on the top and ribbed receiver cover of the AKM.


Set comes with 2-5Rd. mags, 2-30Rd. mags, 75Rd drum, cleaning kit, plus original factory cleaning kit in metal tube, original book, sling, and over 100Rds  of 7.62x39. Rifle has only had about 400Rds. through it, and is in very good

Please NO TRADES! Only selling this Gun because I need the money!

I've had several questions about the receiver end (angled/straight) This rifle has the straight receiver. The import name is: Interstate Arms, Billerica MA  SN# 9371685 It is stamped as 71685 two other places, so I believe that means this gun is 1993 Post Ban.

Its the base model AR-15 from Smith & Wesson. I bought it new for $1150 (probably not the best deal) from a gun dealer in Pacifica, in late summer of 2013.

I've fired maybe 350 rounds through it, and honestly haven't even taken it the range once this year. I've kept it clean, maintained.

Here's the thing. I also had Cerakote applied to this rifle. You can find out all about Cerakote here (http://www.cerakoteguncoatings.com/), but essentially it is professional grade finish for guns. I was living in Daly City at the time and I knew rust was going to form from the foggy climate so I had this applied as a pre-emptive strike against rust. It works great, had it done by a certified Cerakote applicator who is also an ex-cop.. go figure.

The color of cerakote is called ""Burnt Bronze."" Honestly I love the look of this gun, but I need to sell it. Sadly a lot of folks want an untouched, or black unfinished rifle.. so I am dropping the price to $850 which is a steal for how good of condition this is in. The rifle is rust proof and looks awesome... its just not black.

You must see in person how perfectly manufactured this beautiful piece of weaponry is.

SIG SAUER'S BEST KEPT SECRET

The P250 was designed for future military modularity needs. Its designed to change both caliber and size within minutes. it can be transformed from a Full Size, to a Compact, even down to a Subcompact with ease. The p250 can also be changed from a 9mm, to a .357 SIG, to a .40 S&W , up to a .45 ACP.

I will update the text in the post as it sells so it should stay current. I have priced it fairly in my opinion when you factor in no taxes and it is brand new.

The scope mount means you will not lose your zero when you remove the barrel from the gun, this makes barrel swapping very easy! This barrel is made by Mossberg for Remington 870's, it is lightly used and does show some light scratches from normal field use - no rust.  

http://www.walmart.com/ip/Mossberg-Barrel-Scope-Combo-For-Remington-12-guage-870-Shotguns/4956493

This would make an excellent home defense barrel!!! A little known side effect of shooting buck or birdshot through a rifled barrel is that it causes it to spread at a rate of about 1in per 1ft. So at home defense distances it will give you a 10-20in spread at 10-20ft! This rapid spread would cover the entire vital area of the target and very likely cause Central Nervous System (CNS) hit which is the only way to immediately stop a threat. I used this barrel so my wife didn't have to aim our shotgun, just point at shoot it! 

I have done a lot of researched and have patterned this barrel with various loads. It will shoot Cloverleaf to 1 hole groups at 50-75yds. The 1in per foot rule applies to both bird and buckshot. 

Will meet at E Lake Sammamish Fred Meyer. Please feel  free to ask any questions.  

P.S. I also have some Sabot Slugs (Accutips) for this barrel in another listing for $14. They are good for this barrel."

Manufacture: 1937 – 1963 (probably early 1950s). Photos are of this rifle.  The following inscribes are found:

MADE IN NEW HAVEN. CONN.
WINCHESTER ----MODEL 69A----
---22 S.L. OR L.R.---
On the butt: WINCHESTER REPEATING ARMS CO

The 69 Model was designed by Winchester to answer the demand for a medium-priced hunting and target .22 rimfire bolt-action rifle. The rifle had a detachable box magazine, and many were offered with factory-installed telescopes in 2-3/4 and 5 power. The stock was plain walnut with pistol grip and plain fore-end. This model was not serial numbered. 
The 69A version was introduced in 1937 and featured an improved cocking mechanism. The bolt was redesigned to cock on opening, the safety was changed to a sliding lever on the right-hand side of the receiver, the prominent rear cocking piece was eliminated, and the barrel was given a constant-diameter round contour rather than the previous slightly tapered contour, increasing the weight of the rifle slightly.
The trigger mechanism also incorporated an internal screw adjustment, allowing the owner to adjust the trigger pull weight to some degree. This gun was dropped in 1963 with sales of about 355,000 guns."

This is a very neat rifle. It is a Browning BAR-22 (Browning Automatic Rifle) just like it's big brother BAR, but in the 22LR caliber. This is a pretty unique find. And it is even more rare to find it in this English straight stock. The only ones I have seen like it have sold for $900-$1000 (Check Gunbroker Auction # 420806049) 

I am selling this on here for $875, it will go on GunBroker. I can provide more photos upon request.

I will only sell to a legal firearm buyer on a bill of sale or we can do the transfer through an FFL. I prefer not to ship.
