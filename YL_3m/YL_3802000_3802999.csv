Its a relatively rare gun, with fewer than 10,000 being produced. While the finish is a quite worn, probably due to the previous owner carrying it, there is no rust and it appears to have been shot very little. I've put about 100 rounds through the gun myself, with no issue. Its a great gun for a collector to clean up and have a piece of Walther history that few have.

Comes with belt clip for concealment and grip extension.  Comes with original box and manual.

The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.  The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.

The P-32 has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

I'm considering trading away my Colt Delta Elite 10mm. Before I get any more into it, here's a little history. The 10mm was developed after an incident happened which led the FBI to decide they needed a more effective round. However, it was replaced by the .40 S&W when shooting them actually resulted in the Earth being thrown slightly out of its normal orbit. In short, this baby is made to shoot one of the baddest rounds ever made.


Anyway, this one has had 120 rounds through it, and is a monster! I had my gunsmith install a set of Trijicon HD night sights on it when I bought it. It will come with two mags, the original box all the paperwork, and some FMJ ammo as well as some nasty DoubleTap HP's.

I'm not in a huge hurry to part with it or anything, but I am up to make a deal. Interested in M1A's, AR10's, other 1911's, high end piston driven and DI AR's, and other nice weapons. We'll call the trade value $1,400 since I'm required to put a number on here. Located in west Houston.

The leather IWB holster, mag holster, and Magpul slim grips can possibly be included, depending on the deal.

 No scratches, this beauty is flawless.

n the 1990s Spyderco was approached by a specialized branch of U.S. law enforcement about making a knife for their undercover agents. These plain-clothes LEOs found themselves in situations where they often could not carry a firearm but carrying a knife was not a problem. Most had no formal training in self-defense tactics or MBC but as a last resort could use a blade to protect or extricate themselves from a life-threatening situation. This was how the Civilian model came to be.

The Civilian has a patented reverse ""S"" blade that's intended to be used like an oversized claw. The tip is ground to an ultra-thin profile. Deeply curved and full at the belly, the VG-10 ground blade excels in slicing and is available fully SpyderEdged. Because of its distinctly specialized features it is not intended or designed for general utility or everyday use. Curved in all the right places for ergonomic use and retention of the knife, the handle is black G-10. A two position cliip supports discreet tip-up or tip down carry on the right side.  One of the most specialized CLIPITS in the Spyderco line-up, the Civilian is available in limited quantities."

The vz. 58 (model 58) is a 7.62mm assault rifle designed and manufactured in Czechoslovakia and accepted into service in the late 1950s as the 7,62 mm samopal vzor 58 (""7.62mm submachine gun model 1958""), replacing the vz. 52 self-loading rifle and the 7.62×25mm Tokarev vz. 24 and vz. 26 submachine guns. The vz. 58 externally resembles the Soviet AK-47 but is internally a substantially different design based on a short-stroke gas piston, which shares no parts with the Kalashnikov design - including the magazines.[2]

All parts are include to use both large & small primers.

Each pull of the handle produces a completed round.

This gun has very low round count. Less than 100 rounds down the tube.  Has always been thoroughly cleaned and well taken care of. Has only been in the field a few times. I would prefer to keep the scope which is a vortex viper PST 4-16 but for the right price it could maybe stay. Also has a timney trigger that I would probably switch back to original rock river trigger. I don't need to sell this gun just seeing what is out there. Definitely open to trades. I like ar platform guns in other calibers than 223. I like smith pistols, especially the PD models. 1911s. Springfield emp. Small autos like Sig p238. Really looking for a christensen rifle, possibly an ar in 308. Really open to anything. Let me know what you have.  Cash price for the gun minus scope and timney trigger would be 1100.

It does have a different screw in the stock in one place and some black tape in another spot I haven't removed.  The trigger guard is cracked at the front but still there.  The butt holds 4 shells and has the original cover.  I got this in a trade a while ago and took it to the range once.  It shoots good.  It is approximately 28"" overall with an 18 1/8"" barrel.  It is fun to shoot and has light recoil for how small it is.  It is more of a long handgun than a shotgun.  You really can't fire it from the shoulder.  I already have a .410 pistol and am looking for something different."
