I'm very familiar with gun store prices on new ones and I will expect any offers to be below new gun cost. I will be more than happy to give fair used value on any extras and current prices for current production ammo. No corrosive surplus ammo will be considered. I might consider AK rifles as well but I already have one so I'm far more interested in pistols. I am not interested in selling for cash, if I were I would have listed my ad as such. If you would like to make a cash offer go right on ahead but if it's not enough to go to the store and buy what I want including tax and travel cost you won't be buying from me. Now that you know what I'm looking for here is what I have to offer.

 First is my Remington 7400 chambered in 30-06 springfield with premium wood furniture set and topped with a Nikon pro-staff 3-9x40 scope mounted with see through rings. This rifle is beautiful and the only flaw is a very light scratch on the left side of the receiver. This thing is very accurate and every bit as reliable. I really like this rifle but you know how it goes, sometimes you just have to cut something loose to get something else you want.

 Next one in the pot is my Ithaca 37 clone 12ga pump with 18"" barrel. This one is not so pretty. It shows plenty of use, it has a crack in the stock behind the trigger, and its missing one of the shell elevator screws. Despite the flaws though it does shoot really well. I had no problems jumping a can around with slugs and busted a couple clays with bird shot. It would make a great bush gun or loaner this deer season. Thats my plan if it doesn't go in trade.

 Last but not least is my Kel-tec P-11. It's 9mm double stack pocket gun. Already had fluff and buff. Has one mag with pinkey extension. I got this in a trade but I have to admit I'm very pleased with the accuracy and it eats steel case ammo and wide mouth hollow points without a problem.  This is another that I would like to keep but since I prefer to carry my 45 or 357 this ones is sweating on the chopping block.

 I value this entire package at $900. I would like to make a 3 for 1 deal but if your offer doesn't have a equal value we can discuss splitting up the lot. I'm a pretty easy guy to deal with but I will not travel more than 30 minutes from Danville due to the fake low life no shows. I will also insist that if you cannot produce a valid carry permit you will be required to sign a bill of sale with a valid DL to show age and residency. I know thats not the law but it's my terms of sale and if you don't like it take a hike. Your more than likely a felon that shouldn't have a firearm anyway. I will be more than happy to answer any questions you may have that are not answered within this ad.

These are complexly sold out and was converted by the importer, so you know it was done right; this is not some home done hack job. Get yourself a real Russian AK while you still can. 

Brutus' Description
U.S. parts count meets full 922r Compliance - Russian Saiga AK-47 configuration rifle.  One of the smoothest operating, best looking Russian AK-47 rifles available. Fully 922r compliant, accepts all standard high capacity AK-47 mags and drums.  Integral scope mount on receiver. These rifles have been converted from the original Saiga configuration, to a more standardized military style AK-47 rifle configuration.

The U.S. parts count on the rifle itself meets full 922r Compliance.
This allows the rifle to legally use any high cap AK mag or drum regardless of its country of origin.  
The compliance conversion on these rifles was done on site by the importer and they were really done right. 
The workmanship is flawless with no sign that these are converted as opposed to a factory finished rifle.

Compliance parts include Buttstock, Pistol grip and 3 piece G-2 No Slap trigger set by Tapco. 

I absolutely believe that the conversion on these rifles leaves them in a condition that is of superior quality to the original rifle configuration. 

This rifle quite possibly has the best fit and feel of any AK-47 on the market today and accepts and feeds 
flawlessly from all high cap AK-47 mags and drums regardless of their country of origin.  

Each Rifle ships complete with one 30rd mag, cleaning kit and manual.

We Have...

1 RED, yes I said RED! Marshall 4x12 B as in Bottom/ Square  Cab.  I've had the cab 20 years 
                so it's got  to be a 70's or 80's Original Red Cab. It does NOT have GreenBacks in it-
               this was the era of Heavy Metal and GreenBacks didn't stand a chance so I think they
               are the BlackBack 75 watters Marshall was using in the JCM series. The Cab is Mono
                 and Stereo 
                  whole life (the time with me) in a  3/4 inch ATA apprvd. Road Case w/ Lrg casters
                  and double handles on both sides- I had it made for it and it wasn't cheap. The Road
                  Case, should I decide to sell  WILL be included. 
                  The amp rack has front and Back pieces that cover everything.


1 6-space rack w/a Marshall All-Tube 9100 series, Basically two Stand Alone 50-watt tube amps in 
                 One Package- VERY FREAKIN' LOUD! And ultra clean- Two Knobs: Gain and Presence. 
                     These series are PURE power and thats all- No effects or  pre-amps on the 9100.

**Top of the Rack is a Korg rack Tuner- The best one they make.

** Your Distortion will be provided by a RockTron Pro G.A.P Rack unit w/ the best 
                         ""Hush"" system ever put on a piece of outboard gear- Dead Quiet!  DimeBag 
                           Darrell distortion with 0 feedback- swear.. 0 feedback; no matter  how loud you 
                          turn it up.

** Your Flangers, Choruses, Delays, Rooms, Reverbs, reverse Reverbs, ect will be 
                       provided via an Old School  DigiTech  DSP 128. Awesome Digitally converted
                       Analog rack gear- not shown in pic.  

**  ALL OF THIS IS CONTROLED  BY A ""Ground Control"" Unit... Basically a pedal board that 
           controls the two effects processors- Super Simple and easy to get it to the way you like 
           it. 
       ** Here's the best part of the GC Unit... it hooks up to the Rocktron via a 7 pin Midi cable-
             Whats that you say?? What are the 2 extra pins for???  Power And Ground. That's right 
             Boys and Girls- no more having to plug in your ""whatever"" at the front of the stage 
            where there are no plugs- Phantom Power from the Rocktron runs to the GC via the 7
              pin Midi cable, firing up the GC and giving you control of your effects from WHERE
             EVER you wanna put the pedal board down at- No more standin on the side of the
             stage near the power. And everything is included- you'll just need a guitar and a chord
             and some killer chops.. this rig ain't for Beginners.  Enjoy. 


** Please Lowballers and AssJacks- use your brains, your manners, and your common sense- Thank You***


Everyone else... have a blessed day!

Info:

The Smith & Wesson Model 500 is a five-shot, single action/double-action large caliberrevolver produced by Smith & Wesson, firing the .500 S&W Magnum cartridge, a .50 caliber bullet.
It is built on S&W's largest frame, the X-Frame, which was developed because none of S&W's existing double-action frame designs could handle the muzzle energy and pressures generated by the .500 S&W cartridge.[2] It is the most powerful production revolver in the world today, and it is being marketed as being ""the world's most powerful handgun"" by the manufacturer.[3] There are a few other larger revolvers like for instance the Pfeifer Zeliska .600 Nitro Express revolver, however none of them are a ""production"" revolver. The Model 500 can fire a bullet weighing 350 gr ( 22.7 g; 0.8 oz) at 1975 feet per second (602 m/s) generating a muzzle energy of over 3,030 foot-pounds force (4.1 kJ).
Articles, statements, and opinions vary widely on this firearm. Any of the available bullet weights can be relied on to take game at a range in excess of 200 yards (183 m), a feat matched by only a handful of other handguns.[citation needed] The advanced design of the firearm helps in counteracting recoil felt by the shooter. This includes the sheer weight of the firearm, use of rubber grips, the forward balance, and the use of a compensator. On certain S&W Performance Center models the compensator is replaced with a full muzzle brake.
Like most big caliber handguns the Model 500 is suitable for sport and hunting applications. The high energy of these rounds make it possible to hunt extremely large African game successfully.[4"

 HK VP9 Striker Fire 9mm - M700009-A5

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs.

The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accomodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous longterm durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And the VP is remarkably value priced.Mention the name Heckler & Koch in knowledgeable circles and immediately eyebrows raise and heads nod in recognition.

HK has earned the respect and admiration of the world’s most elite military and law enforcement operators through its “no compromise” commitment to firearms innovation and performance. But what really makes an HK pistol different from other pistols? Maybe the fact that Heckler & Koch maintains the most thorough testing regimen for new products in the firearms industry. Little known outside of Heckler & Koch facilities and offices throughout the world is a highly structured HK testing program that strictly follows well-established company protocols and procedures. Under development for more than four years, the HK VP9 has been subject to just about every test imaginable — NATO AC/225 and U.S. NIJ drop tests, water, dust, mud, and sand tests that duplicate the most extreme environments and harshest operational conditions in the world.
VP pistol function and abuse tests included firing more than 10,000 rounds of a wide variety of international ammuntion types through sample pistols. During these tests — accuracy, wear, and tolerance readings are taken to establish the capabilities, performance, and realistic service life of the new VP9 pistol in all environments. Unlike some manufacturers, HK test fires all VP9 pistols for accuracy, function, and proofing (for international and German industrial certification) before they leave the factory. This passion for testing is just one more part of what separates HK from the pack.

Has been very lightly used and is in almost new condition, less than a year old. I'm not 100% sure but I believe it may have had a spring kit installed, trigger is very smooth and lighter than other models I have felt, feels a lot like a Kahr trigger. Basically a budget priced glock 23. This is the new model SD40VE, NOT a sigma. Will come with its box, two 14 round magazines, and depending on what you have to trade I can also include a Blackhawk holster and 100 rounds of .40.

I like snub revolvers, so I would like to trade it for a Taurus M85 or Poly Protector in .38. May consider other snub revolvers but must be in .38 special. No charters please and I'm only interested in a .38 snub, no rifles or shotguns please.

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR15/M16 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock."

 Read below for manufacturers specs:

 The Daniel Defense MK18 Complete AR-15 Pistol Upper Assembly is a faithful recreation of the US Navy's Mk18 Mod 1 platform, and features a Premium 10.3"" Cold Hammer Forged Barrel made from Mil-Spec 4150 Chrome-Moly Vanadium Steel that is Chrome Lined for durability and corrosion resistance. M4 feed ramps are incorporated into the barrel extension and upper to enhance reliable feeding, while a true 5.56x45 NATO chamber ensures that both commercial and higher pressure surplus mil-spec ammunition may be safely used. The bolt and carrier both pass a thorough Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) test for guaranteed structural integrity, and the gas key is properly staked to its mil-spec bolt carrier. All steel parts feature a heavy Mil-Spec Phosphate finish for superior corrosion resistance and durability, while aluminum parts are Type III Hard Coat Anodized. 

 This upper comes equipped with a 9.5"" Flat Dark Earth RIS II Mk18 Quad-Rail Handguard that covers a pinned, low profile gas block at the carbine gas port position and Free Floats the barrel for increased accuracy potential. The RIS II provides ample room for adding tactical accessories, while also creating a full length, uninterrupted top rail surface with the A4 Flat-Top receiver that can accommodate a shooter's chosen optic and/or iron sight arrangement. Complete with charging handle assembly and Daniel Defense Flash Hider, the MK18 upper is ready to drop onto any pistol or registered SBR small pin lower receiver.

Because you requested it, Buffalo Bore is now producing two full power 357 Sig. loads. These loads are full power 357 Sig. Not the watered down stuff that other factories are already producing. Why is it that a new cartridge gets developed with touted ballistics in the media, only to have the ammo manufacturers ""water"" it down after a few years on the market? (The same thing happened with the original 10MM) The 357 Sig. was designed to blast a 125gr. bullet at 1,425 FPS out of a four inch carry gun barrel. (Not a much longer test barrel) So, that is what both our loadings do.

We use flash suppressed powder so that you wont be blinded by your own gun fire should you be required to drop the hammer in low light. Since over 90% of civilian shootings in America happen in low light, flash suppressed ammunition is a huge tactical advantage.

Item 25A utilizes the 125gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet. It is designed to open radically and penetrate roughly 12 to 14 inches in human tissue. Note my velocities from my real world pistol, (not a test barrel) below.

a. Sig. Mod. 229, 4 inch barrel - 1,430 fps (567 ft. lbs.)

Item 25B utilizes a 124gr. FMJ flat nose bullet at 1,425 fps. This bullet will smash through typical stick frame walls, car doors and a bears skull or shoulder bones. It is designed for those who need deep penetration. It should penetrate 24+ inches in human tissue. If I were carrying a 357 Sig. for defense, I would carry my pistol with our 125gr. JHC (jacketed hollow cavity) loaded in the chamber and the top 4 or 5 rounds in the magazine. The remaining rounds in the magazine would be these FMJ flat nose loads. Why? After the first few rounds are fired in a fight, most opponents will be dead or behind cover. The FMJ flat nose loads will penetrate many types of cover that would stop a hollow nose bullet. Note my velocities, from my real world pistol, (not a test barrel) below.

The bolt and carrier both pass a thorough Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) test for guaranteed structural integrity, and the gas key is properly staked to its mil-spec bolt carrier. All steel parts feature a heavy Mil-Spec Phosphate finish for superior corrosion resistance and durability, while aluminum parts are Type III Hard Coat Anodized.

Topics Include: - Practical Applications of Concealed Carry - Weapons Retention - Handgun Manipulation and Firing Techniques - Legal Aspects of Firearms Storage and Transport - Concealed Carry Gear Selection and Consideration - Firearms Safety Concerns While Carrying Concealed - Low Light Shooting Considerations - Drawing / Weapons Presentation from Concealed Carry - Search and Seizure - Modern Defensive Ammunition Selection - Court Proceedings and What to Expect - Defensive and Tactical Reloading - Your Legal Rights - Firearms Safety at Home, In Vehicles, and at Work - Legal Aspects in the Aftermath of Use of Force Participants are better prepared to deal with the real-life implications faced by legally armed citizens. While we do teach avoidance, mindset, and handgun skills, we don't just focus on pre-incident factors. Unlike other Concealed Carry Courses, PatriotTAC instructors also explain in great detail what to expect if you use deadly force. PatriotTAC hosts Concealed Carry Handgun Courses in Holly Ridge; south of MCAS New River, or 8 miles from Sneads Ferry / Stone Bay area, and in Swansboro. PatriotTAC's lead instructor first entered the law enforcement community in 1988, has a degree in Criminal Justice, and can provide personal and professional insight into the inner workings of the legal system, court processes, and what you should expect to happen if you had to use deadly force. Class sizes are kept at optimal sizes to prevent unnecessary waiting around and the instructor to student ratios are closely considered to ensure the safety and training value of each student. Register now as this class is likely to fill quickly.

Great, reliable pistol for home or personal defense, but we recently purchased a full-sized M&P to replace it.

This sight is in brand new condition. I had it on my AR and shot maybe 50 rounds with the sight on the gun. It has seen almost no use, maybe 2 hours of use total, therefore the battery life has barely been affected.

This is the only reflex sight I am aware of that has no on/off switch. It comes on automatically, when it senses movement. A rubber hood that cancels the ""on"" signal, comes with it, to use when the sight is not in use and movement is necessary. This sight fits a standard picatinny rail, and comes with the adjustment tool, hood, box, and all paperwork.

Leupold is a top-rated optics company. This sight sells for $564.99. I will take $425.00 cash. You save $139.99 + tax on an amazing sight.

This is a discontinued model and are increasingly hard to find. The Concept IX is a commander sized 1911 and has an aluminum frame and Stainless slide. These guns are all hand fitted similar to Wilson Combats and Nighthawk just at HALF the price. The front night sight still works but is admittedly a little dim. The gun functions flawlessly as only a hand-fit 1911 can. It has also been treated to the Robar NP3 coating, which i basically a teflon impregnated metallic coating. It feels slick to the touch and look amazing in my worthless opinion.

The grips are VZs. I don't have the originals or the original tactical cardboard box Les Baer is famous for. I personally have put around 400 rounds through it but as I got it used I can't guarantee the total round count. Being a Baer if you were to eve have an issue you can call them and they will happily take care of you. I'm only selling/trading because I have the itch for something new and am more partial to 5"" 1911s.

Included will be two blued magazines, a Kelly Gunleather C Flex holster, and a generic soft case.

I'd be interested in trades for USGI M1 Carbines, possibly Garands, a Les Baer Concept IV, .30 Carbine ammo or HXP .30-06. Perhaps a 20 ga O/U; I'm partial to CZs. Might also be interested in a Marlin levergun chambered in .450 Marlin.

Thanks for looking!"

I hate to do it, but I need to sell my Sig p250 Compact in 9mm. It's been duracoated in Magpul FDE and is in great shape. The duracoat could use a little touch-up in spots, but overall the gun is in fantastic shape, with maybe a 400 hundreds through it. It includes the firearm itself, two magazines, Fobus paddle holster, case, lock, etc. $350. No trades, please, as I need the cash right now. I'm in Winchester and would be willing to meet someone a reasonable distance. Please have two forms of ID, including driver's license and either concealed carry permit or voter ID card. Will do a bill of sale as well. Can send additional pics as well if need be.

Type 99

Successor to the Type 38 rifle. Chambered in 7.7×58mm Type 99, later rimless variants of the Type 92 and 97 cartridges also usable.

Designed in 1939, then produced and fielded from 1941 to 1945, the Type 99 was the most common Imperial Japanese service rifle of World War II and second most produced Imperial rifle with 2,500,000 built. Significant changes are the improvement of the rear sight form transitioning from a V-notch type like those on a Type 38, to an aperture, the front sight blade was renewed to a triangular shape, chrome-lined barrels were used, and on earlier productions, the rear sight was equipped with anti-aircraft calipers.

Sub-variations included a long rifle (approximately only 38,000 made), and short rifle; former being 1258 mm in total and latter being 1118 mm. The short rifle also varied in quality from initial, intermediate, to last-ditch.

This is a 25.5"" barrel, and is commonly called a ""suitcase rife"" as when soldiers captured them they cut off the stock under the band and unscrewed the barrels so they would fit in their returning suitcases.
