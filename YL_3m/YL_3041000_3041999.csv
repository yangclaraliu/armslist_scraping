SIG SAUER® introduces the SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace, a shooter’s aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols.

A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

Features:

- Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.
- ATF approved
- Veteran designed
- Made in USA

Some scalpers claim it's a waste of time, but I think it has some positive effect. If nothing else it just seems like the right thing to do. Immoral ripoff scalpers need help from the Armslist community, to understand that their immoral activity, may technically be legal, but makes the ripoff scalpers as bad as the garbage that sells food and gas for triple the value during emergency situations.

Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control.

330,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3041330,For Trade:  Weapons cannot be seized from your car during traffic stops,"Moncks Corner, Charleston, South Carolina",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, June 9, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Berkeley County needs a new sheriff. Election TOMORROW, Tuesday June 10
I have brought this up again because it is time for elections in Berkeley County and the Sherirff's office is at stake. Know your rights when it comes to legally storing your weapon in your vehicles according to state law and while carrying/ or not with your valid CWP.
1) State Law prohibits local municipalities from taking your weapon from your vehicle.
""Officer safety"" is satisfied when you are standing outside your vehicle or seperated from your weapon. 
2) Officers cannot seize your property unless you are under arrest.
SC code section 23-31-520
This article denies any county, municipality, or political subdivision the power to confiscate a firearm or ammunition unless incident to an arrest. 
3) If you are a CWP holder and your gun is not on your person, you do not have to present your CWP in a traffic stop. This has been mistaught in many CWP classes. If your gun is stored legally in accordance with state then you are not carrying a concealed weapon. This has been corrected my CWP instructor and was verified with the SLED head of CWP program.
4) See MIchigan v. Long, 103 S. Ct. 3469 (1983)
Search the above court ruling to read where they denied the right to search for and seize weapons for ""offer safety""unless certain criteria were met. I wasn't even so much as patted down even after presenting a cwp so the officer certainly wasn't afraid as he turned his back on me to enter my vehicle with me directly behind him.
Since I did not pose a threat to the officer and I was not under arrest, he can not enter my truck and confiscate my property. 
To satisfy ""Officer Safety"" criteria the officer must feel that the person is DANGEROUS and may elude the officer during a stop in order to retrieve a weapon and use it. Typically officers would have ""dangerous"" people in cuffs and have backup during the stop.
Three lawyers agreed that my civil rights were violated but there was no financial loss substantial enough for them to sue unless I shelled out cash. And honestly, I am not the sueing type. I just don't want bad cops, or bad departments with ""unspoken or unwritten policies"" patrolling Berkeley County or anywhere else I may roam.
I kept an arrest journal of every contact I had with the officer and his supervisor. It is lengthy and pasted below in the trade section. The supervisors comments are the most shocking, especially when posed a question about entering my house. I have asked for recordings of all of the interactions but was told none of them were recorded.
I contacted Sheriff DeWitt about this and spoke with him twice. I can only assume that his inaction on this matter means 1) he supports the actions taken, 2) made this unspoken policy, or 3) has no control over his department.
This interaction coupled with statements made by DeWitt after Sandy Hook leads me to the conclusion that our Sheirff and his department's philosophy on gun control when dealing with law abiding citizens does not match that of his constituents. 
What do you think? Have you kept up with the frequent mishandling of gun control issues across the country by local municipalities and the militarization of local enforcement agencies with federal monies? We need a pro-2nd (and 4th) ammendment sheriff who will see to it that his deputies operate in accordance with state law and the mandates of the Supreme Court. It is election time. This is an important election at an important time.

FYI-
I have MANY friends in law enforcement and all agree with my position on this. Not one offered an argument in favor of the officer or supervisor especially after learning that 1) the officer did not check me for weapons after presenting a card saying that I have one on my person 2) knowing that I am 235lbs of scary looking redneck and the officer turned his back on me while I hovered over his shoulder 3) The officers unfamiliarity with my SERPA holster leading to him repeatedly (and laughably) yanking on a loaded weapon.
Number one comment from cop buddies(and gun buddies) is officers are not trained on how to operate every firearm system and it is unreasonable to assume that they can all clear every weapon without incident. Many guns can be stored in vehicles and they can all function differently or even malfunction because of miscare by the owner and officers take a risk in handling unknown weapons. 
Ever tried to check a Phoenix HP-22 to see if it is loaded(total pain in the ass)? Ever pulled a slide back and have an unintended discharge due to a broken firing pin? Ever seen a cop mishandle a weapon and shoot himself in the foot (youtube)? Ever seen anyone accidentally shot while standing next to someone who is trained in firearms mishandling a weapon?

This is n't a national issue on Glenn Beck or The Blaze. This is something you can handle right here in your own town. I have heard back from others who have had similiar issues. Pass it on to friends who vote and carry. Post it on your facebook pages. Too many folks like us who just want to live our lives and enjoy our freedoms skip these local elections. I suggest you make this one."

I have a nice 14' fiberglass fishing boat with a 40HP Johnson outboard. This is essentially the whole package. The engine has been fired up this year...it just needs new fuel. The boat comes with fresh carpet floors, new wiring, and a new bilge pump. There are no soft spots in the floor so the stringers are good, and the transom is strong. The trailer is included and all lights work on both boat and trailer. If you want a decent and reliable boat, this is it.

Also comes with fish finder, anchor, new battery and plastic fuel tank.

Might accept partial trades with cash, run it by me and lets talk.

425,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3041425,For Sale:  Colt Junior Factory Walnut Grips Astra Cub FIE A27 Best Old Stock 1970s Production for .22 Short or .25 ACP Variants,"Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 39,"Listed On: Wednesday, August 27, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Our # GRCJR

From years of packaged storage in a very old Southern Warehouse come these very attractive and original factory grips for the Colt Junior series pistols, chambered in .22 Short and .25 ACP Caliber. Manufacturer was probably an Italian subcontractor to Colt’s Patent Firearms manufacturing company. Construction is cut checkered dark European Walnut, with Nickel plated brass factory Colt Logo Medallions on each panel. Note that these do NOT come with screws, and we do not have any screws for the Colts they fit. Final distributor, or attempted distributor, was a company known as Bingham Ltd. of Atlanta, and that is whose packaging these grips come in. The distributor received substantial notoriety during the Reagan Era for some of its products. We believe these grips were overruns from Colt’s production of the Junior Pistols that ceased in the early 1970s. They will only fit a Colt Junior Pistol, or one of its ancestors or descendants, chambered in .22 Short or .25 ACP calibers. The pistol should have an external hammer and should have its magazine release located on the left side of the grip frame. Direct ancestor to the Colt Junior was the Astra Cub; and its brief-lived descendant was the FIE model A27 Best. These grips will not fit a Colt 1908 Vest Pocket .25 Pistol. They will not fit an Astra Constable .380 Pistol. They will not fit an FIE E27 pistol. They will not fit the chain handle of a 19th Century Italian Bidet. They will only fit the Colt Junior, and the Astra Cub, and the FIE A27 Best pistols chambered in .22 Short or .25 ACP calibers. This is the first time in 40 some odd years we have run across any of these grips for sale, and our supply of them is limited. We’re offering the set in the photos, or their substantially identical mates from the same batch, each set for only $ 39.00.

It is so much easier to shoot with less felt recoil than the new ""light weight"" .38s that seem to be the latest fad. 

I don't have to sell or trade it, but figured I'd put it up here and see if I get any interesting offers. If nothing compelling comes along, I'm happy to keep it. 

Shortly after purchasing it I had a Wolf spring kit installed to reduce the trigger pull a bit. I still have the factory springs and the spring kit documentation. I upgraded rubber grips and will include the original wood grips, manuals, and box with the sale/trade.

Price for the gun, spring kit, grips, manuals & box is $299.
Just saw this gun at Dunham's in Burlington for $399.99, and that is without the spring improvements and a less ergonomic grip. Those add another $50. Making mine $150 below what it would cost to buy this setup new.

Other stuff I have for this gun that could be worked into the deal for additional $ or the right trade:
-carbide reloading dies, brass (175), projectiles (~300 lead match and 100 Hornady XTP) & powder (~3/4Lb) for .38 Special, 
-a brand new leather + kydex hybrid IWB holster,

Light wear on the barrel, and on the slide.

This is a great gun, but I have 2 guns in 9x18. One was inherited, so I can't sell it. This one will just save me the trouble of registering another gun when I move.
Makarov's have a fixed barrel. So, unlike most other pistols out there, the barrel doesn't move at all. Which makes it inherently more accurate than other pistols its size. I've gone toe to toe against Baby Glocks in 9mm and .40, and came out on top in accuracy. 

9x18 is a bit of a middle ground between .380, and 9mm. And it was used since its development as a military and police round. The Russians still use it, but are only now developing alternatives.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealedWith dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine included. Holster. Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look."

This is an excellent rifle that boasts manufacturer-guaranteed 1 M.O.A. accuracy at 100 yds. It has been fully treated with Frog Lube, and comes with spare mags and ammo at an extra cost. This is probably the best AR-type rifle I have owned, there is no rattle of the upper and lower receivers, the RRA match-grade trigger is outstanding and breaks cleanly at right about 4 lbs, with very little over-travel and a really short reset. The solid aluminum handguard/rail is extremely sturdy, and the 16"" heavy barrel makes this a very stable shooter. The custom  RRA breaching muzzlebrake is really nice, too. All in all, this is a great package for anyone looking to buy a premium rifle at a great price."

Test fired only to function test the RMR. 
Comes with all factory accessories, 3 mags, and Trijicon RMR02 (also comes with its box). 

Due to the hardness of the Glock slide, there was some bluing that occurred as a result of heating up during the milling process. This does not affect functionality in any way, shape, or form. I can refer you to a reputable painter who does excellent cerakote work, or I can have the slide painted the color or your choice for an additional 80 dollars. Or just leave it as-is, and shoot the heck out of it! 

The work, gun, and sight were nearly 1,500 dollars. I don't expect to get that out of it, so make a REASONABLE cash offer.
Or, I'd like to trade for interesting firearms (prefer rifles) of equal value.

Despite its small size, the P224® maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of
 10 rounds of .40S&W giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.
Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in most subcompacts.

New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.

The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns.

As part of the Extreme family of handguns, the P224 will feature the distinctive black and grey Hogue Piranha grips, SIGLITE Night Sights and the SRT (in the DA/SA version).

In these cases you will need to switch to a blowback style hammer.  The blowback style hammer, once installed, will run all rimfire and pistol uppers, and still work fine with standard mil-spec rifle uppers.

Constructed of lightweight steel with triple handles for easy tie-down. The narrow profile allows multiple cans to be stacked or tied on the bumper of a truck or Humvee. Lever-lock spill-proof lid with rubber gasket. Fuel can measures approximately 18""x13""x6.5"" A thick enamel coating on the inside makes this fuel can superior to all other.

Made for years and years of rough use with any fuel, these are the gold standard for current militaries all over the world. Never before have we seen these in brand new, unissued condition and supplies are extremely limited.

Customer Reviews:
Cans arrived in new condition, as advertised. I bought used ones previously when offered and wasn't dissapointed either. These have good paint inside, worth the extra money. Additionally I find them much better than the plastic junk with the akward EPA spill prone nozzles. 

I hate the new CARB compliant cans so much that I bought these. These are the BEST! Brand new, solid, they pour beautifully, seal air tight, and are heavy duty. You cannot go wrong with these. Get them before they are sold out.

These are the best metal gas cans I have ever seen. I have traveled with several of these cans fully loaded with gasoline in the trunk of my compact car. I never once detected the odor of gasoline. I drive with the windows up and the air conditioning on. The sealing lid on these cans is incredibly effective and I easily learned how to open and close the lid with one hand, while pumping gas with the other. Because these are 20 liter cans, you are easily able to put five full gallons of gasoline into the can without having to fight with the EPA nozzles and adapters on the gas pumps. I have a number of these cans and I will be getting more of them soon.

High quality fuel can. This is NOT the cheap Chinese junk. This is the real deal with solid welds, quality coating, and a positive seal. If you purchase one of these I recommend also getting the fuel spout that is made for this can. I got one for each fuel can I purchased and they are just as high quality as the cans.

Selling for $75 for both! I only have (2) left - so, get them fast!"
