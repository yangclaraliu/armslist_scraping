I thought I would keep them both and go back and forth but the blackfeather is too much of a pain to get apart. I bought this from a Gunnery Sargent in the Marines who told me it was a USMC take off he got when working on comp rifles. Several people have suggested it might actually be a Navy M25 takeoff, but I really dont know. It is a McMillan, with the camo that is in the fiberglass, not painted on and comes with appropriate heat shield. I am looking for cool stuff, what have you got? Always interested in cool stuff, not really looking for anything. Will take less value in a trade if it involves 1911 or M1A parts. I always need .308 projectiles and reloading stuff. I can add cash if needed but am currently not putting it up for sale. 
I put a post with a pic of it up on m14forum.com to find the value and could not really get a definitive answer, but several people send me private messages offering between $350 and $400. I can meet up in Eugene or Portland if needed."

Below is manufacturer info:

The “Baby” of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. 
Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free."

This pistol comes with original HK plastic case, paperwork, lock, takedown tool, side panels, back and front straps and two 15 round magazines. 

This pistol is beautiful and one of the most ergonomic hand guns you will ever hold. It is a single/double action pistol with decocker. German style mag release that is ambidextrous for both left and right handed shooters. 

Manufacturer info below:

P30
A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures."

230,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3336230,For Sale:  do not buy these siaga's for double the price. your getting ripped,"ohio, Akron, Ohio",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, July 31, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,Sorry fellas. But your siaga are not the best of the best. They are stamped receivers. The bestwould be considered a russian milled ak which your 399.00 siaga is not. There gas piston tubing is different from regular ak converted or not that is why its called a siaga not anak. Amd techniclly there is no ban yet of russian supplys. Your siagas are crap and are not ak's they are siagas. And non match up to a bulgarian ak. Your converted siaga are simply a stock from flordia gun works with a grip on it that you paid just as much for a bump fire so why npt get a pump fire. Same set up. Now the ones that are truly converted meaning relocating pistol grip assembaly closer to the mag release which causes for new rivet job for the trigger guard and some drilling have a bit more value. But unless ypu have the trigger guard bumped up to the mag well like a regular ak does amd installed new gas tube and installed retainer slot on your barrwl for the retainer pin for the real ak lower handguard mount and like i said put new upper gas tube with of course real russian wood thwn your siaga is nlw an ak. But just because you got a stock that has a pistol grip on it does not turn your siaga into an ak. People go with a milled bulgarian or polish ak. Stamp is cheap they work great but for 1000 plus you deserve a milled. Thank you if anyone read tgis. But these jokers selling there crap siagas saying they are the best of the best are garbage and noobs. They see russian and tgink o god its russian ot has to be the best cause thats were they weremade. They have no clue its all about your receiver and barrel. If you have a milled russian receiver and barrel you have a piece of gold. If you have a stamped russian receiver and russian barrel its sub par. Bulgarian aks are the best. Expecially the arsenal circle 10 milled receiver and there barrels yes way better. Just stop lettings these noobs bump the lrice up because they have the money. You wamt a nice ak build one. And again siagas are nlt aks

As you may of heard several months back sellers looking to make a dime or actually hundreds have been telling everyone ammunition from russia will be banned so they jacked the prices up and told you it is the last shipment. Well as we all found out that was just a hoax on the the greedy gun sellers lart. My walmart is stocled to the rim of tula amd other places have wolf on stock and plenty of shipments still comming over seas. Well the same is goimg on with these saigas. I can honestly say they are still being made in the izshmiz factory in russia as huntimg rifles and are being imported as we speak. For one classic fkrearms nust got about 500 of course they bumped there prices up as well why not there are idiots conspiricy theriest that are buying them at top dollar. Atlantic firearms also got a huge shipment. And so have hundreds others withinvoices ove hundreds more to be shipped in november. Remember a year ago guys this stuff happends in the gun world were all out here to make a buck. But were all also trting to enjoy a sport that ourselvesis destroying because of greed and well jist straight idiots that love drama.

$980 for gun, 2 magazines, original manual and test target.

Factory case (not original to the gun) $100 additional

As an older model, this gun has no magazine activated hold open (unless the magazine is modified). Any AW93 magazine (one designed for hold open, or not) will work with the gun. The hold-open lever is on the right side.

Additional magazines available with the gun (up to 4) at $120 each.

A similar gun, but with magazine activated hold open also is available, at higher price. The older AW93 tend to be more accurate than the current production. They have a hammer block safety that serves as a dry fire device, and use the same recoil buffers (See first image, for the hammer block and dry fire function). The grip for these original AW93 are slightly different due to the side activated hold open. The more recent AW93 grips require some modification to fit this gun.

The AW93 is not well suited for small hands. Rink however does make grips that are downsized as much as possible for smaller hands or shorter fingers.

Shipping is extra, usually around $30.

FFL transfer only.

The case is large enough for 3 handguns or 1-2 free pistols. It has 2 plastic latches, holes for paddle locks, and a combination lock that is setable.

Looking to barter and trade to obtain a nice Belgium made Browning Hi Power 9mm T series 1960's to 1970's with the red backed grips.

This is the info I got from a browning expert. In summary, I dont want to go past 1983...................

For a NICE ""T"" series, expect to pay around the $1000 range. These pistols were built between 1964 and 1970ish.

For a NICE ""C"" series (directly after the ""T"" series, you could probably find a nice example for the $800 range. Built from 1969 to 1975.

For a NICE post ""C"" series, still MADE AND ASSEMBLED in Belgium (recommended), I've seen them go for as little as $750 with a few slipping through for even less. These start with a 245 on the serial number and have an alpha code after the 245 that will tell you the year. So if you find a Made in Belgium HP with a S/N that starts 245PX, it was built in 1983.

The Dragunov was designed as a squad support weapon since, according to Soviet and Soviet-derived military doctrines, the long-range engagement ability was lost to ordinary troops when submachine guns and assault rifles (which are optimized for close-range and medium-range, rapid-fire combat) were adopted. For that reason, it was originally named Самозарядная Винтовка системы Драгунова образца 1963 года ""Self-Loading Rifle, System of Dragunov, Model of the Year 1963.""

It was selected as the winner of a contest that included three competing designs: by Sergei Simonov, Aleksandr Konstantinov and Yevgeny Dragunov. Extensive field testing of the rifles conducted in a wide range of environmental conditions resulted in Dragunov’s proposal being accepted into service in 1963. An initial pre-production batch consisting of 200 rifles was assembled for evaluation purposes, and from 1964 serial production was carried out by Izhmash."

Please see the photo below and know what to look for.  This was suppose to be a custom build with quality parts.

Make sure you buy one with the barrel marked with the calibers its made for.  You can shoot 223 through a 5.56, but should not shoot 5.56 through a 223 barrel due to pressure differences.

Also, if you are selling your lowers to these GARAGE FFL'S without doing a transfer form you are crazy.  They are building cheap AR's on your lower and selling them.  If the lower ends up in a crime or in Mexico it will be traced back to you, if you don't have something showing who you sold it to you will be under suspicion.  But wait.......the U.S. doesn't register firearms, it cant be traced back to me!

When PSA makes a lower, it has a serial number on it.  They sell it to you and you fill out a transfer form that is required by law to be maintained.  The lower is used in a crime.  They call PSA, PSA says that lower was sold to John Doe.  

One more thing.  It is not against the law to build your own firearm as long as it is a legal firearm, but building with the sole purpose of selling without the proper licenses is a federal law.  So you garage FFL's will get caught one day, if you think that these sites are not monitored you are dead wrong."

It uses a smaller intermediate cartridge, the 5.45×39mm, replacing the 7.62×39mm chambering of earlier Kalashnikov-pattern weapons.

The rifle first saw service with Soviet forces engaged in the 1979 Afghanistan conflict.[4] Presently, the rifle continues to be used by the majority of countries of the former USSR. Additionally, licensed copies were produced in Bulgaria (AK-74, AKS-74 and AKS-74U), the former East Germany (MPi-AK-74N, MPi-AKS-74N, MPi-AKS-74NK) and Romania (PA md. 86).[4][5][6] Besides former Soviet republics and eastern European countries, Mongolia, North Korean Special Forces, and Vietnamese People's Naval infantry use AK-74s.

The rifle was originally developed, in 1974, by Russian designer Mikhail Kalashnikov."

I'm still looking for a pocket 9 but haven't been happy so far (Nano, LC9, Shield). I've seen some great reviews of the CPX-2 and read some personal reviews by folks who really like them. I don't want to pay full retail since I don't know if I'll be pleased with it, and I'm just not finding any listings for used models locally - I don't want to add $30-$60 for shipping and FFL transfer for an out of state listing.

I'm only interested in a GEN2 CPX-2 - preferred if it's black/black, but I might be interested in stainless/black. Please no GEN1 or CPX-1 models.

I can find them new for $250, so I'd be willing to go as high as $225 if it's in great condition. Oh, and I have a Mosin M91/30 I'm planning to sell soon, so if you are interested in a partial trade for the Mosin, let me know.

If you have one and would like to part with it, please PM (conversation) me with what you have. Photos showing the condition would be a good start.

Thanks for looking!"

Barrel: Barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN Manufacturing using their proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system. The barrel has an A2 style profile, is mil-spec phosphate coated, and MP/HP tested. The upper is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.

Bolt: Bolt is made of Mil-spec shot-peened Carpenter 158 steel. Gas key is secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked per mil-spec. Bolt carrier is parkerized outside, and chrome lined inside.

I bought this knife at the Denver Gun Show over 2 years ago, I carried it for a while and I never use it for anything except to cut open the tape on boxes.

This is heavy duty construction with 6 very small brass screws holding it together, and a pocket clip for easy access when needed.

All you need to do is slide the lever on the side to open & close it, it opens and closes very fast, please use with caution.

I have three of these knifes, one is lighter, the other is heaver but all are smiler in design, one is a better quality knife, this one is $100 firm, no pocket clip. 

This knife is approximately 4 & 5/8"" long closed, 1/2"" thick, 1"" wide, the blade is 3 & 3/8"" long with a weight of 3.9 ounces, this is a heaver than the plastic knifes but it will last 100 times longer, with the pocket clip it is not noticeably heavy in your pocket.

This knife could save your life if you find yourself in a dangers position in our dally activities especially at night.

If interested, please reply by email or call REDACTED for more information. My price not firm, so feel free to make a reasonable offer or trade, you never know, I may accept it.

Who are these classes for?
New gun owners, recreational shooters, seasonal hunters, and teambuilding groups!

Whether you're a hunter, recreational shooter, or just a group of friends or co-workers looking for something out of the ordinary to do, take some time to consider taking a class.

Why bother with classes?
Formal instruction will give you the tools you need to safely and effectively employ your shotgun. Learn the tactics, techniques, and procedures that will get novices off to a great start, and help experienced shooters excel and improve!

Shotgun shooting is one of the most under-appreciated shooting disciplines, and also the one that has the most misinformation, misunderstanding, and misconceptions attached to it. And that's a shame, because the shotgun is the most versatile platform available, not to mention the most FUN.

Who's teaching?
As an NRA Certified Instructor, I have taught hundreds of students the NRA Basic shotgun course, and also have extensive experience working one-on-one and in groups with amateurs, hunters, and shooting sports enthusiasts alike.

Aside from NRA Certifications, my military experience has given me the skills necessary to both employ, operate, maintain, and most importantly, effectively teach the use of small arms, including the shotgun.

What is it good for?
Trap, skeet, sporting clays, three-gun, tactical drills, and more! Whether you want to take the NRA Basic course, get some coaching before hunting season starts, or feel like you could use some professional tuning for your three gun or tactical course skills, I can help.

What about business groups?
Are you a business customer looking for an awesome team building exercise? I can also offer all-inclusive rates which include classroom time for safety and shooting academics instruction, range time, shotguns, and ammo!

What does it cost?
Prices vary based on course, group size, and location. Let me know what you're looking for, and I'll work with you to make sure you get the absolute best training, and have the absolute most FUN possible!"

FROM THE HK WEB SITE: Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers — only in a smaller, more concealable design. The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 - 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 - 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact. The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter's hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters. A set of abbreviated ""industry standard"" mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines.
