I am selling my Sig 522 rifle. The Sig 522 is a .22 LR Rifle that uses a 25 round magazine and has a folding stock. This rifle has roughly 2,000 rounds through it. I custom painted the rifle with a really cool pattern that not only helps to camoflauge the rifle, but just looks really cool. The rifle comes with 5 magazines, and I will also throw in 150 rounds of CCI .22 LR. 

***RIFLE DOES NOT COME WITH SILENCER*** Instead, I will reattach the A2 style flash hider on the rifle. 

Finally, the rear sight on this rifle fell off. Because I do not have the rear sight, I will throw in the micro dot clone pictured on the rifle. This is a quality micro dot made by the same people that make the Primary Arms micro dots.

The purchase of this gun includes the gun, scope (3-9x40 w/ caps), 28 rounds of ammo, stock ammo carrier, soft case, and bore snake.  I am open to trades, but will be particular on what I am willing to trade for.  If you are interested, or have any questions, please call or text me at (317)500-228zero.

Info:Beretta designed its 1301 Competition model specifically for 3-Gun and Practical shooting matches. Right out of the box, the 1301 Competition comes with features that will increase shooter's scores. The oversized charging handle makes sure it does not slip out of your hand; and an oversized crossbolt safety button, which reverses for lefties, ensures solid finger engagement. A large, serrated bolt release and enlarged loading port optimize rapid reloading. And, the 1301 shoots fast. Beretta's rotating bolt design combined with the BLINK™ gas operating system make the 1301 one of the fastest cycling shotguns ever designed, capable of firing up to 4 shots in a second. Both the gas operating system and the generous recoil pad reduce felt recoil, allowing you to stay on target during rapid fire. Aggressive checkering on the stock provides a solid, non-slip grip under stressful conditions, while the length of pull, cast, and drop adjust to shooters preference. The 1301 Competition also utilizes Beretta's Optima Bore HP™ interchangeable choke system and features a drilled and tapped receiver for rail mounted sight options."

I took it to the range but realized that my AK sight tool was missing to sight it in, so I fired one box of 20 rounds to ensure it functioned properly, and it has sat in the safe since. This has the much sought after Zastava Crest on the stock, only the early models came with this. One 10/30 Mag is included along with the original box and I believe the paperwork as well.

Currently I do not have a mag release lock on it, so the pistol grip has been removed as to not trigger an AW status. You can purchase one from Amazon for $11."

The CZ 75 B Stainless is the first stainless steel firearm to bear the CZ name. With the exception of an ambidextrous manual safety and rubber grips, the stainless version is functionally identical to the CZ-75B. The only difference is an improvement in corrosion resistance, though many will argue that there is an improvement in appearance as well.

The CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line. The CZ-75B features the short recoil, tilt barrel with radial locking lugs. Characteristic features of all versions include: all steel construction, fixed sights, a double column magazine, and a slide stays open after last cartridge has been fired. The 'B' designation is an indicator that the model is equipped with a firing pin block safety. The CZ 75 B SA (single action) is identical to the CZ 75 B in all aspects except that it has a single action trigger mechanism and a drop-free magazine.

This is Crimson Trace Information: 
Green just got good™. Crimson Trace presents the MVF-515 Green; a revolutionary, patent-pending concept that combines three tactical tools for your AR style rifle into a single modular package. With a rock-solid 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum hard-anodized tang as the foundation of the foregrip, the unit also features a green laser sight and a 150/200-Lumen LED light module. The MVF-515 Green leverages advanced technology to ensure long battery life and rugged durability through a wider range of conditions than consumer grade green lasers. Hot or cold, light or dark, the MVF-515 Green readily provides the most complete sighting and target identification system available anywhere. The laser and light are instinctively activated as you hold the weapon, and activation switches are ambidextrous. This allows operators to select the light or the laser individually or simultaneously. Both laser and light functions are programmable with three illumination modes to select from including: independent momentary, strobe or constant beam. A master on/off switch permits complete shutdown of either laser or light."

I have original sig plastic case, two magazines and it will come with original grips (NOT the VZgrips that are on it) 2 holsters IWB kydex ( 1 is PJ holster other is Gcode)

Go to the sig website and lookup the 1911 C3 model to get specs and more info but it is 4.25 barrel with a officer frame.  So, commander slide, officer frame and it is great for everyday carry.


Breakdown:
Gun 750$ around that if bought brand new now, mine is great condition (add your tax and FFL transfer, shipping if you buy it new 50-75$) 825-850$ if you bought it new
Holsters $80 and $80 (what i paid for them) this gun is hard to find a holster for, but viola! I have two that are custom made for this so I eliminated your problem.  

I will transfer the grips off the gun and try to post picture back on but they are the same grips on the sig website

Over $950 worth of gun here and I am asking for 845$ (if you did math you get gun with about 200 rounds thru it for the price it might cost you to buy it brand new and I'm giving you the holsters for free basically

Very similar to the James Bond knife in the new movie Quantum of Solace--this version has a serrated blade.
The famous custom knife maker J.A. Harkins designed this outstanding tacitcal knife. Harkins has been evolutionary in the design of OTF's (Out-The-Front automatics) for several years and has literally put OTF's back on the proverbially map for knife collectors and users worldwide. He has lent his talent to the MOD team and has come up with the definitive tactical OTF on the market today, the Triton. The 3.75 inch, 154CM blade rapidly ""fires"" from the top of the handle with the side actuating lever and just as easily redeploys into the handle with the opposite movement of the with the lever in the reverse direction. The blade is coated with a subdued black DLC finish, which allows no shine from the blade, with the exception of the edges on either side. A perfect complement to any professional's accouterment or OTF collector."

A self-defense handgun does no good if it is miles away when you need it. The PPS is a concealed carry firearm that is slim, light and comfortable to wear all day long. Yet it is fast to bring into action, pleasant to fire and easy to shoot accurately. With Walther, performance comes in small packages.

  1942 round receiver made in Izhevsk armory. Its in pretty darn good shape. The scope is a 2x7x32 Hammers EER scout scope. The scope mount attaches to the dovetail of the rear sight. ( so the iron sights have been removed) This is NOT a floppy one bolt mount. Nor did I use ANY heat to remove the sight pins to drift them out (I cringe when I see guys do that to a gun)! In a nice vacuum sealed bag thats not shown, are the original sights and pins (in case you can see better than a 7 power scope). Good dog collars and heavy canvas sling. You do not have to be a gorilla to either fix, or unmount bayonet. Yep, good riflings too!! Mosin Nagant accurate. 17 million of these have dominated battlefields since 1891, and is the longest combat rifle production run in the world. It is the rifle the Germans feared. Simple, strong and a killin' machine. It shoots 7.62x54r ammo. I have one full spam can, yep you get the can opener too, so you won't have to pound on 440 rounds of live ammo to get the can open. There is also a 20 battle pack and about 10 loose rounds in an ammo pouch. So about 470 rounds total. It also has the GO/ NO GO wrench with it too. The trigger has been shimmed to improve performance.  It was religiously cleaned every time it was fired.You don't get my shooting bags, and I'll want Oregon ID and a bill of sale.  $500"

Bi-tone Springfield Armory NRA Limited Edition, #158 of 650. I recently came into possession of this firearm and am wanting to see if there is a market for this beautiful handgun. I cannot verify positively that it has never been fired, but there are absolutely no indications that it has. The only imperfection I can identify is a small break down scratch just under the slide stop lever. Otherwise it's in perfect condition. 

It is a 1911 ultra compact .45 ACP with a 3.3 inch ported barrel. It comes with the original owners manual and one 6 round magazine. The grips are finger grooved rubber wrap around. The slide is blued and the receiver is stainless steel. 

I have never fired this gun, but my sister owns one and it's a lot of fun to shoot. She did have some initial feed problems, but once she had the feed ramp polished it worked like a little race gun. The porting really dampens a LOT of the recoil. 

I hope someone will see what a find this firearm is and will realize the asking price is quite reasonable. I am asking $980 firm. If you are local there will be no shipping costs. If you are not local it will have to be shipped from and to an FFL dealer. I will calculate those costs and allow you to approve them before shipment is made."
