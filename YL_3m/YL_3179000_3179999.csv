I bought it in the early 1980's from a retired neighbor who's full time  hobby and passion was restoring old military firearms. Especially those from WWI & WWII. 

It's a French MLE 1907/15 rifle chambered in the 8mm Lebel round. 

The care and attention to detail used in restoring was fantastic and this rifle looks absolutely beautiful. 

Finish on metal and wood are near perfect.

The wood appears to have been done in hand rubbed oil that's likely similar to it's original finish. It's not a high gloss finish but rather more of a deep sheen. I'm not 100% sure what was used on the metal, but its a low gloss deep black that really looks quite nice. 

Everything functions mechanically and the bore is in nice shape without any rust, pitting or corrosion. 

I have never shot this rifle although I feel that you could. That said you must always have a firearm this old inspected by a competent gunsmith before shooting it. Rifle was made in 1927 so it's 87 years old. 

Rifle comes with leather sling, original Lebel brass handle needle bayonet and 4 clips of original 8mm French Lebel ammo that came with the rifle. 

All in all its a darn fine specimen of a firearm that's just not much seen anymore. 

Asking $500 local sale only with pickup in the Brandon area. I'm not going to ship this rifle so please don't ask. Buyer must be a Florida resident at least 18 years old.

Thanks for looking."

The gun has seen a couple hundred rounds through it and always cleaned and stored properly.  It still looks new.  

It has the magazine eject button on the right side of the pistol which, along with the ambidextrous slide release lever, makes it about as left handed as you can get without spending a lot on a custom job.  The changeover was done properly, so there's none of the issues with loading, feeding, or ejecting that so many homemade jobs complain about online.  However, you can swap the magazine eject button over pretty easily if you're right handed.  Also, if you're right handed I can include a brand new Blade-Tech kydex OWB holster with it for extra.

**Please Note: the fiber optic sights on the gun in the picture are NOT included. The standard M&P sights have been reinstalled by Fletcher's Arms, who had replaced them originally.  No garage gun smithing on this piece!

Do NOT ask me what my lowest price is or if this is still available - I won't respond.  Feel free to ask any legitimate questions but please don't waste my time unless you're actually interested in handing over cash for this.  No trades unless you have something worth significantly more that I can sell to get the cash.

Mint unfired NDM-86 Dragunov. The much rarer .308 version. <500 were imported before import ended under executive order in 1993.

Not a fake. Not a Romanian gun or AK based forgery.

All serials match. Includes original hard case. Matching optic with case. All accessories. Manual. Cleaning kit. Sling. It's all there.


 The Two extra magazines shown are sold and the gun has been reduced in price accordingly. .  

Typically .75"" to 1"" MOA guns. Norinco made the only .308 variant that ever existed. 

I won't trade. FFL transfer required. FOID required for IL residents. 

Please don't be a weirdo and ask me odd militant questions as they will go unanswered. This is a collector gun of the rarest order. Decide if you want to buy it, make an appointment for a viewing, we drive over to the FFL and you pick up your gun after the mandatory wait. Or I'll ship to your out of state FFL.

Not many had matching serial numbers. Not many were from the better California imports. This has every check box marked when it comes to rarity and collectibility.

Price is firm. A used one went for $7025 on gunbroker."

From what I found online, they only imported about 2,000 of these rifles to the United States some many years ago. My father never shot this firearm as I haven’t either. I took it to two different gun shops and they both said that it doesn’t appear to have ever been fired. It shows that it was form arsenal 016 and all numbers match throughout the firearm. There are a few nicks and dings from going from one safe to another and maybe touching other firearms but is in otherwise excellent condition.

Action comics,Superman,batman,green lantern,flash,sad sack,Archie,Sargent rock,hulk,amazing spider-man, spider-woman,unknown soldier,Blondie,Flintstones,Dagwood,super friends,X-men,sleepwalker,moonknight, spitfire,transformer,lone ranger,dark shadows,westerns and many others. 
Shipping additional, approx $150.00-$200.00 because of weight. I can drop them of at a mailing service,but from their on it's your doing. The cost was an estimate i ask from a shipping service when i brought in 10 and multiply them, so again it's all ball park price."

The lessons learned in the field have been added to our lesson-plan to assist in delivering the curriculum in a unique and beneficial manner. Attending any of our courses will send you out the door with the mental tools you will need to be prepared, ""beat the bad guys,"" and/or stay out of jail. Our Instructors will make sure you receive an education that puts you significantly ahead of other Illinois residents who have the same Certificates, but not the same training.

What I want is a 12 to 16 foot camp trailer. Nothing bigger than 16 foot. It has to be in good useable condition with everything working. Good interior and good exterior. Good tires. Good brakes if it has them and good wheel bearings. No broken or cracked glass. Has to have a clear title and currently registered and tagged. I don’t want any surprises once I get it home so please be ready to put water in the tank so I can see the water system works. If it’s out of propane then get some because I’ll want to see everything working that works off propane. No leaks because I will ask to use your garden hose to use on the roof and sides to check for possible leaks. I’ll kick tires and I will check all 12 volt systems and also will want you to plug it into a 110 outlet to show me that the regular electric works too. Some things I would be okay having fixed. I just need you to be honest about the trailer and any problems it may have or has had already so it will be prepared for a 90 year old woman to be able to use without any problem. No I am not a 90 year old woman but my mom is and she is the one that would stay in it on weekends here at the coast. 
            Now what I have to trade for this is the following. I have a RUGER New Model Super Blackhawk 44 magnum revolver pistol with a ported 10 inch barrel along with a Leopold scope. It also comes with a custom made shoulder holster and travel case. Over $1,200.00 invested in gun and accessories. 
            I have no cash on my end of trade. Just the pistol and accessories. So if you have a good trailer that meets what I want and you are willing to trade it for my pistol then email me some pictures of what you have and basic information on it."

S&W 3rd Gen 4506-1. One of the final full size 5"" Stainless Steel 45's S&W made before switching to the Polymer guns. Most think this is by far the best generation of S&W 45's, with the 4506-1 specifically being possibly the best version of any full size S&W semi-auto pistols, having proven reliability and accuracy. 

Seems a few of the 4506-1's were built with tighter tolerances for even better accuracy, and are known as 4506-1 ""R4"". Based on info from S&W forum, the one offered for sale here seems to look like one of these ""special"" versions: Has the larger barrel hood, roll marks on the slide and frame, ""VA"" serial prefixes, fixed Novak sights, and the roll marks on the frame were two lines - serial number and ""MOD 4506-1"".

Comes with two 8 round factory magazines, and Hogue grips installed, as well as original grips. Operates in either Single action or Double action (SA/DA). Ambidextrous safety and decocker lever.

$700 firm, FTF West Central Florida (might travel a little ways), must be over 21, and legally allowed to own a firearm.

Finances forces me to thin the herd. Have two S&W 3rd Gen 45's and cannot determine which one to keep, so both are offered, with you deciding. Both are capable of sub 2"" groups at 25 yards. Do I keep the famous 4506-1 model that most LEO's wish they still had, and that Detective Sonny Crockett used in Miami Vice, as well as current TV Detective Vic Mackey uses in the Shield? Or do I keep the rarer 4513 TSW. Both excellent shooters. First one sells, I keep the other one. Thanks for helping.

It didn't take. 
I put a ton of money into this gun and shot it 200 rounds or less. 

Here is a list of the parts I put into it:
* $200 fulcrum trigger system from Glock Parts store
* $80 tungsten guide rod
*$140 Dawson precision fiber optic adjustable match sights
* A total of 6 mags, 3 with +5 arredondo mag extensions (These were $40 a piece) I also have 2 of the +2 pearce extensions.
* I've got one mag setup with the 30 round extention from Kriss. It's pretty damn cool. 

So as you can see, I've got way too much money into a Glock, probably closer to $1300 or more. I shoot wide-body STI's, so I think I'm spoiled and just can't get used to the grip angle on the glocks. 
My loss is your gain as this is setup, ready to go, with top-shelf parts. 

I'd like to sell this as a package, but I will consider separating the mags or other parts. Shoot me an email with an offer on something, worse I can say is no. 

Please include a phone number with your email so I know you're not some Nigerian scammer trying to give me $2.5M of somebody else's inheritance. (Who falls for that anymore?) 

Thanks!"

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy."

This is the 40 S&W caliber equivalent of the 9 mm 17L, the longest slide and barrel combinations made by Glock, for maximum velocity, and with the longest sight radius for accuracy. It comes just the way I got it, with the correct box, indicating a 3.5 pound trigger, but it feels more like 2.5, and factory adjustable sights, and one 15 round original mag. This is not a parts built gun, it is an original, all numbers matching gun.

This model is not yet offered in Gen 4, and is hard to find in Gen 3. 

I have researched these, and my research says that Glock had discontinued the 17L and 24, and then set back up and made 1,000 of each in 2011. Apparently none have been made since then. I believe this is one of the 1,000. My price is firm.

Face to face local area cash transaction, Alabama resident only, or I might consider a local trade only for a like new Gen 4 Glock 35 FDE or OD with all of the stuff for this rare and hard to find model. I will make a bill of sale for you and for me either way. For any other trade offers, I put my trade value at $850.00."

-Ruger 10/22 Takedown- I'm only intersted in the Takedown models, I can buy one of these new for $280-$299 these days so please keep that in mind when offering a trade (meaning I expect some cash thrown in from your end or a good amt of accessories/ammo to go along with the 10/22)

-I prefer to take back another firearm in trade so you can try me with various 9mm pistols (not really interested in any Kahr, Taurus, Bersa, etc. or DA/SA guns) or .40s or .45s, but keep in mind please that I don't really care for 1911s (not that I think a Shield is worth a quality 1911) and I don't want something like a police trade in g22. I have my long gun needs fairly well addressed at the moment, but you can try if you dare with an offer, just know that I'm not in the market for any shotguns right now.

Cleaned Dad's shed and found these shells as-is.  Reluctant to toss in trash as may result in undesired outcome and official visits.  Perhaps someone can find a use for them.

Reloaders may be interested in salvaging powder and / or shot, perhaps even brass.

All show some corrosion on brass due to poor storage conditions; severity of corrosion varies shell to shell.  Clean, just variously corroded.  Most if not all primers are clear and clean, just the brass bases are corroded.

I consider these non-fireable as corrosion may result in stuck hull.  May work in  your slingshot or potato gun.

No known reloads; all were in apparently new factory boxes.  Boxes didn't survive.  You'll receive these shells loose in a double WM sack.

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.
The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional. LNIB with all factory papers, test casing, bushing wrench etc. serious inquiries only, no trades.

It's a mossberg 500 pistol grip shot gun. It's not a show piece ..it's been used. I've only put 4 rounds through it, it works like a shot gun should.i just have no need of it. I want a handgun to throw in my glove box. Just in case something happens in my travels. I'm not asking for retail value or even close. I have done some looking around and know what prices some of the low priced hand guns go for brand new. US Patriot Arms here in Jacksonvile has a good selection. Rather than go through the paperwork I figured if swap it with someone who has a cheap pistol that wanted a scatter gun..so if someone is interested today would be the day..I'm tired of messing with ads ..so if it doesn't go soon I'll just put it back in the closet and let it collect dust..just hate to see a decent gun doing nothing..so shoot me your offers ..you might be surprised at what I'd take for it."
