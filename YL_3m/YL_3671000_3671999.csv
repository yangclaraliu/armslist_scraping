With it you get 70 rounds of hallow point ammo, 250 rounds of target ammo, a custom fit leather holster, a airtight custom fit Pelican case, 5 steel bottom Wilson Combat 8 round clips, the original Hogue G10 Sig grips and original Sig box. This pistol has been well kept and has only had 300 rounds put through it. I've logged every shot. This is the most bang for your buck. Very accurate and ultra reliable. This pistol retails at $1195.00 new. I'm asking $1000.00 for everything you see. $100 in ammo, $90 pelican case, $90 holster,$39 each ×5 Wilson Combat mags. For this price I'm losing money.

Lower is a match grade Colt. The trigger has been tuned at about 5.5lbs with NO take up and an extremely short reset. I had it set up for speed since I'm a 1911 shooter.

Buffer tube is Bravo Company with an H2 buffer- $75 retail

Stock is Magpul ACS- $90

Includes Colt A2 stock and rifle buffer. roughly $90. 

BCM gunfighter grip installed, will also supply A2 grip.

I would put the worth of the upper at about 600 and roughly 450 for the lower without stock and buffer tube.


BCG is Colt- $250-$300


I am asking $2500 or best offer. I am flexible on the price, but extreme lowballs will be ridiculed.

Located in Daytona, price agreed upon will increase based on how far I have to travel. If the buyer meets within a reasonable distance, the price agreed upon will not change."

This gun is the factory Black finish with the 6"" barrel, made in Israel by IMI (Israel Military Industries) for the American Magnum Research company, and it comes with 2, that's right 2 mags! The pistol comes in the factory cardboard box with the original owners manual and takedown tool. The action on the DE is unique and between the rotating M-16 style bolt and the 4 lb weight it makes shooting .44 Mags a breeze; the Mark XIX models can also be quickly and easily converted to fire other calibers off the same receiver if you choose to buy other bolts and uppers! This particular gun dates to the early 1990s and has been fired a total of less than 120 rds---I simply don't shoot it enough and I have plans for the money if it sells. $1200, I'm located in Myrtle Beach, SC.

I found that the tapco mags are the best fit ,but all the mags I have used with it are reliable .It is still an ak after all...I have around 1000 rounds through it. I decided to get rid of it to see what else I could get for it. I would prefer a trade because I'M not really cash strapped at this point in time.

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

486,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3671486,"For Sale:  26.5mm Flare Pistol Outfit - German Suhl, Really Nice","Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 300,"Listed On: Sunday, November 9, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here's a very nice and complete setup featuring a 26.5mm flare pistol made by Suhl (East Germany). I believe this pistol is designated the LP-1 and it's a post war product that was made from the late 40's up through the early 60's. This will shoot any of 26.5mm flare, starburst or smoke rounds available at Sportsman's Guide, Military Shooters, UNAMMO, etc..

This is one of the nicest examples I've seen with most of it's original finish intact. There is a little wear around the muzzle and on the sharp edges from holster use but not much. Overall I'd say that at least 90% of the original finish remains. Many times with these the finish is badly worn or the pistol has been painted. So finding one with it's original factory finish in this good of shape is not the norm.

The bore is in great shape too with no rust or pitting and it functions perfectly including the rather unusual safety lever feature.

Also included is a correct East German military black leather holster in very good shape that has a shoulder carry strap and a matching leather lanyard for the pistol. Then there is a complete cleaning kit that includes a stiff bristle nylon brush for normal cleaning. A brass bristle brush for heavy duty cleaning, and a felt tip rod that fits the bore snuggly and eliminates the need for cleaning patches.

Finally there is a sub-caliber adapter that allows you to shoot any .22 Short, Long or Long Rifle ammo from the flare pistol safely which makes a great combination for emergency and survival situations. There is also another adapter for firing the less expensive 12 gauge flares that are sold by BASS PRO, most boating supply houses, and even at some Walmart's.

$300 with pick up in the Brandon area. You must be at least 21 to purchase this flare gun with the .22 adapter. I can ship for $16 to any non-restrictive state. I won't ship to AK, HI or CA, NY, NJ, CT, DC, MA or any other place where it is prohibited."

Field & Stream®  gave the red ring the Best-of-the-Best Award for 2013 Hunting Gear in the optical field. The Redring shotgun sight was developed to help hunters and target shooters to hit more moving targets successfully. For hunters, the Redring limits damage to game and provides the hunter with the confidence to bag more game.
“Once you try the Redring shotgun sight, you’ll wonder why you haven’t been using it all along,” Robert Walzer, US representative for Redring USA. “You’ll instantly improve your game. Hunters will have less than zero collateral damage to birds and small game and efficiently increase their harvest. For shooters with eye issues or new shooters, the Redring helps to not only hit more targets, but helps the shooter to achieve better aim and keep both eyes open. This is a new item, never been placed on a gun, retails for over $600.00 This is a very nice optic! I would trade or sell outright.

Secondly, for those asking to buy the chassis only. That would be a painful separation, as I would have to-additionally-recoup my cost on the barrel and action by itself. 
Thus, if only the chassis is desired then...the ~firm~ price is $1,000, and buyer pays all shipping costs."

Unbelievable accuracy! (RARE) DPMS made 7.62x39 upper not a Frankenstein mashed rifle. Does have New Frontier lower. The AR platform is the only platform ill ever fire 7.62x39 ammo out of again, puts an AK to shame. Devours ammo, magazines feed amazingly (AR-Stoner, I highly recommend them 17$). Because of their being cheap/poorly made/dysfunctional magazines on the market I have not bought any other brands. hundreds of rounds through with proper cleaning and maintenance.

ACTION:  Please get to the polls by tonight.  There are a multitude of pro-gun candidates on the ballot this Election Day.  So please make sure you check out GOA's 2014 Election Guide and share it with all your pro-gun friends and family.

Prospects Look Good on this Election Eve

Dear michael,

It's no understatement that tomorrow is a big election.

Anti-gun billionaire Michael Bloomberg has committed to spend $50 million to help advance gun control nationwide.  And he's already made good on his threat, spending millions of dollars on anti-gun candidates and ballot initiatives around the country.

Not surprisingly, there are reports of voter fraud surfacing in certain localities -- given that many state laws make it difficult to prevent illegal aliens from voting, and the current White House has sued states which have tried to put up barriers to such illegalities.

But all of that will not matter if America's pro-gun majority gets out and votes tomorrow.

Opinion polls indicate that Americans are disgusted with the direction our country is going, and so by Tuesday's end, we expect that there will be a huge change in the Senate.

Even the liberal Washington Post estimates there is a 96% chance that Harry Reid will be dethroned from his position of power.  But again, this won't happen unless pro-gun voters around the country get to the polls and change the make-up of the U.S. Senate.

The opinion polls are encouraging to be sure, but NO CHANGE will occur if good people don't actually get out and vote.

So please utilize and circulate GOA's 2014 Election Guide -- and encourage your pro-gun family and friends to get to the polls.

Have a Happy Election Day!"
