I would prefer to sell this by 10 box units if possible, but will sell individual boxes at $15 each.
If you want the ammo and NO cans, the ammo box price is $14.00 each for 10 or more boxes.
For 9 or less boxes, no ammo can, price is $15 each box.

Examination of its lines and workmanship demonstrate the impressive expertise of Turkish Gunmakers who, after all, have been at the trade for as long as their Italian teachers and counterparts. Not only Mossberg, but also Remington, Smith & Wesson, and Weatherby have all indulged their lines with shotguns made in Turkey; and this is the most attractive of the entire lot. The Silver Reserve Field, of which this is a specimen, is equipped with five interchangeable choke tubes and wrench, providing the ultimate in versatility with lead, steel and other non-toxic loads. Manufacturer is Kayhan Art, or Khan, of Konya, Turkey. Importer is Mossberg International of New Haven, CT. Mossberg Int’l SKU is 75410. At the heart of every Reserve Series Over-and-Under is an underlock design, box lock action for superior strength and low profile. So says Mossberg. The photos show the attractively blued barrel, 3 inch chambered 28 inch Vent Rib with a total of five Benelli/Beretta thread choke tubes: two each .708 Improved Cylinder; and one each .701 Modified, one each .691 Improved Modified, and one each .683 Full. Stock and forend are satin finished European Walnut with cut checkering. Receiver is engraved satin nickel with gold inlay. Trigger is gold plated, and the tang safety serves as barrel selector. Barrels have single block extractor, and the extractor and chamber sides are nicely jeweled. Buttstock measures for a 14 inch length of pull including the Decelerator type buttpad; 1 1/2 inch drop at comb and 2 1/4 inch drop at heel with about a 3 degree right hand cant from the frame,  Weight empty is a well balanced 7.7 pounds with center of gravity at the back of the forend. Firing selection is by mechanical transfer, not by recoil.  These Silver Reserves command prices upwards of $650.00 at Gander PLUS Tax..... I would like $575 for this one with the extra chokes , original box. I am not a trap shooter, just a varmint slayer so dead rabbit or crow does not warrant an expensive gun like this"

This is a Ruger Mk III 22/45 bull barrel in excellent condition.  It has had little use.  It comes with everything from the factory: box, 2 magazines, papers, etc.  Perfect for target practice, saving money on ammo, and teaching new shooters.  I have taken it apart and adjusted the trigger for a great pull without any over-travel.  I have also taken the bolt stop apart and modified it with a spring.  This is called the ""sling shot mod"" and allows the Ruger to behave like any other modern firearm.

RCBS Case Trimmers are designed to be user friendly and provide very accurate results, the Trim Pro-2 Power Case Trimmer Kit is no different. The low RPM motor delivers plenty of torque and the spring fed cutter requires no pushing or feeding pressure so ,em>cases are trimmed accurately and squarely. The spring fed cutter also allows reloaders to have their hands free while trimming so they can deburr cases or do other tasks helping to speed up the reloading process. Trimmer works with standard pilots and features a micrometer fine adjustment bushing calibrated for setting exact trim length. The positive locking handle and integral power switch make this unit simple and safe to use. One of the other great features of the Trim Pro-2 is that RCBS has eliminated the need for the reloader to purchase different shellplates, the trimmer will hold cases with rim diameters of .250"" to .625"".

They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

436,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3425436,For Sale:  Ultra Compact Adjustable Stock (UCAS) - MP5 style stock similar to NEA PDW or M231 stock,"Bellevue, Seattle, Washington",$ 225,"Listed On: Sunday, September 7, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"After having searched for a stock like this some time with little success except for a few very overpriced options, I finally approached a manufacturer to see just what was possible.  Ultimately, this stock is what we landed on. You can see how this stock looks in the pic of my SBR below. 

Enabling the stock to function properly is a very short buffer assembly that allows for a buffer tube of just 3""-4"".  I have always used and recommended the Gen 1 buffer assembly made by GSE Inc.  At this point, I do not maintain a large inventory on hand and this posting is essentially a way to test the market in order to determine if there is sufficient demand to justify pursuing further.  

Up until recently, I had included the buffer assembly with purchase, simply factoring in that additional cost and ordering the assembly.  However, having had a number of individuals commit to purchase, only to no-show or go MIA once I had received both their stock and buffer assembly, I am no longer including the buffer assembly with the purchase of the stock.  Instead, I am providing prospective buyers with the link to GSE's buffer assembly and leaving the acquisition of that item up to the buyer.  This reduces my exposure and allows for those who may know of and/or favor an alternative buffer system to go that route instead.  GSE also has a Gen 2 buffer assembly that is very nice and also works well with this stock, but due to the cost and the fact that it requires their custom shortened BCG, I have tended to favor their Gen 1 buffer assembly.  The links below will direct you to both of these.

http://www.gunsmokeenterprises.net/product.sc?productId=3&categoryId=2
http://www.gunsmokeenterprises.net/product.sc?productId=5&categoryId=2

Should the demand for this stock prove to be sufficient to continue, I would certainly anticipate that we either develop our own shortened 3""-4"" buffer assembly in-house, or at the very least, approach GSE Inc. in order to try to negotiate some sort of pricing agreement.  If you know of other buffer assemblies that may work with this stock or if you have questions about a specific alternative, please let me know.

Included with purchase is the stock, castle nut, receiver end plate, two different sized shoulder rests. Regarding the two shoulder rests that may be attached to the stock, one is larger one and the other is just over half that size small (very similar in size to that of the NEA). The larger one is pictured on my SBR while the smaller one may be pictured in other pics or I’m happy to provide additional photos. 

Please contact me if you're interested or if you would like any additional information about this stock, potential buffer systems, or other similar stocks. I'm happy to ship within the U.S."

When I moved here I decided to start two hobbies; shooting and fishing. Fishing is more easily available in Myrtle Beach as opposed to finding rifle ranges, so I will be selling all of my firearms.  

These are ALL TACK DRIVERS. The 50cal can be a bit finicky, but keep it at 100-125 grains and you can touch holes.

-Rifled Slug Barrel (shot 3x): Weaver Rail, Fiber Optic Sights, and gas ported top for compensation
-50Cal Inline Muzzleloader (shot 7x): Weaver Rail, Fiber Optic Sights, Easy-off breach plug for thorough cleaning.
-Rifle Hard Case: Fits everything mentioned above in a single case, so VERY convenient  when going to the range. Not pictured; you see one you’ve seen them all.
-2 Rifle 3x-9x scopes; Bushnel and a Simmons. Not pictured; you see one you’ve seen them all.
-North American Arms 22LR 5 shot revolver (shot 10x): Outstanding pocket and “get off me” gun!!!! Especially in flip-flop and tank top land. Consistent pie-plate hits from 10 yards, but I’m a little shakey
-2 boxes: 308
-Bulk: 223
-1 box: 223 Polymer tips for hunting

***Selling off rounds goes against my better judgment, but they will be sold with the firearms. The items have been shot very few times; in all reality they are practically brand new. Matter in fact, I will repackage everything in its original bubble wrap an boxes. 

I have receipts from all the items listed. They totaled $1,659.86. I am selling everything for $850! For those who like to haggle please don’t embarrass yourself. Just read this sentence and do the math again. Price is firm. These will not be piece-mealed. Its buyer take-all.

The only trade I will consider is with Kel Tec KSG.

Tired of the same old same old? Mass produced guns halfheartedly thrown together with the biggest concern being simply the bottom line?

Welcome to something different.

  Based here in San Antonio, we pride ourselves on providing true one-on-one personal service, and weapons built to a higher standard of quality. Whether you choose one of our standard models or have something special in mind, each carbine is hand-built to order one at a time, specifically for each client. Our builds put to rest the myth that an AR has to be spotlessly clean & drenched in oil. Internal clearances, spring seat-pressures, and gas systems are set to not only run fast, flat & accurate... but to do so regardless of filth, grime, or substandard ammo.


The RTA 14.5"" carbine line

   The backbone of our LE duty carbines ride in the RTA carbine. Built to be easy to manage & maintain, flat-running, and able to withstand whatever abuse you can throw at it. At the heart is our unstoppable RTA full-auto-spec BCG & SOCOM-D profile barrel. Available in 3 different furniture packages, the 14.5"" RTA starts @ $1,170. All feature the following;

    Lower - Forged 7075t6, mil-spec, hardcoat anodized typeIII
    Bolt Carrier Group - RTA full-auto-spec
    Upper - Forged 7075 T-6, flat top, M4 feedramps
    Barrel - HP/MPI 4150 steel, chrome lined, 14.5"" 1:7 twist, SOCOM-D
    Gas system - carbine
    M/D - extended A2 flash-hider pinned/welded per NFA regs
    Buffer tube - Forged/mil-spec
    Buffer - H1
    Stock - Magpul MOE
    Trigger Guard - Magpul enhanced
    Trigger - Std M4 6.5lb
    Charging Handle - Mod4 Gunfighter
    Sights - A2 Front
    Magazine - 30rd Pmag

Reliable. Tough. Accurate.
Every time, no excuses.

   A variety of options are available for all our builds. Triggers, optics, finishes & more! Any optional sights/optics chosen will be zeroed to your weapon, it will arrive 100% ready to rock. There is no ""break-in"" required on our weapons, and all feature our No-BS Lifetime Warranty.

   New to the AR platform, looking for a quality basic 16"" AR that will last & provide you with a solid foundation? Dubbing it the ""RTA Classic"", we've taken the Stag Arms Model2 & ""hot-rodded"" the internals! Custom spring set & buffer, tuned & polished trigger, along with a few other tweaks allow us to bring you a solid, smooth-running AR that comes in at just $975!

  We ship nation-wide, and accept trade-ins & consignment firearms shipped directly to our main office. And of course, you can also come on by to see our toys in person! Our primary work is our unrivalled AR-platform builds in 5.56 & .308, as well as our custom modified 1911s, and we also keep a moderate inventory of quality used firearms on hand.

Seeing unfired condition didn't want to lower collectability by shooting it because I have other shooters and enjoy shooting them.I have done a lot of research on sites like Yooper John's and many claim unfired unrearsenaled but are not.I am convinced by details like no XXXXX'd out serial number on stock and not a force matched stock ,no square with line thru it symbol on receiver cover or stock(which would indicate rearsenaled),bright and shiney bayonet,bright bolt and bolt carrier with no powder residue,no powder residue on gas rod,traces of cosmoline still apparent on bolt face and other places,clean matching serial number strikes on all metal parts,unmolested inspection symbols and numbers on wood stock,number 1 struck on front of front sight base indicates best accuracy rating for the barrel's rifling,and solid wood buttstock and handguards like original( not laminated stock which all rearsenaled guns have).All these details ,missing in most all  Rusky's out there on the market,convince me this is the real deal and will only go up in price.Russian SKS's like this are a very very small percentage of the guns which have been imported over the years.Do the research,this is the holy grail of collectable SKS's.More photos to show some of these details on request."

The rifle is in decent condition with all matching serial numbers. Pre-war 1938 vintage with round receiver.  The stock is solid and has no cracks.  The rifling is strong and visible but the bore is dark.  It's not fancy, but the rifle is a solid shooter.  At 200 yards, the rifle easily shoots ""minute of torso"" using ""spam-can"" ammo.  I've not shot the rifle with commercial ammo.  

Included are the bayonet, an oiler can, an ammo pouch and the bolt adjustment tool.  The sling is *not* included. 

All reasonable offers will be considered.  I'll toss in a three packs of surplus ammo so you can immediately get to the range.

Looking to sell only and local London Ky pickup is all I can do.  You need to have CCDW or be able to legally own a firearm in the state of Kentucky to purchase my gun.

Shot-peened bolt, 16"" stainless barrel with 1:7 twist to stabilize range or match grade projectiles.

Assembled, test fired, and shelved until now. Stainless barrels are well known to be the most accurate, and the mating between upper and lower on this rig is as perfect as I've seen, no slop but the takedown pin moved easily.
Add to that the mid-length gas system which reduces recoil and muzzle rise to get follow up shots on target faster.

Comes as shown packed in a PSA eggshell foam shipping box. No additional fees, taxes, etc.
