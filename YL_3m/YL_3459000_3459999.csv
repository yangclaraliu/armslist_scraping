As far as build quality, the FNS is outstanding. I, at one time, wanted to have a polymer framed pistol from every manufacturer, but have come to realize some guns ""fit"" you and some don't. 
I also have an FNP-45 and have shot one of their rifles; FNS Herstal doesn't make anything but a great firearm.

Cylnder timing is great, and they are pretty accurate. They are not sequential serials, I had picked them both up out of a desire to have them reworked into carry guns by Cylinder & Slide since no one really makes a small frame snub six shooter anymore. The grips are original on both guns and so is the bluing on the bottom gun. The top one was re-blued at some point. These are excellent guns and work great, they are just older, not really what I would call collectors grade. Let me know if you have questions. $700 for the pair, $400 for a single if I haven't had a buyer for the lot.

NIB Contour Roam 2 Camera (Black)
Still the simplest camera to use on the market, the locking Instant On- Record switch makes it easy to get the perfect shot. And while black is always in style, Contour has spiced it up by offering the ContourROAM2 in two additional colors: red and blue. They've also upped the frame rate to 60fps at 720p, and fine- tuned the picture giving the video quality incredible clarity. 

•	Locking Instant On-Record Switch: No power button, no problem. Simply slide the Instant On-Record switch into its locking position to ensure you shoot exactly when you're ready. 

•	Vibrant color options: Contour understands that style matters and color can make or break a look. Match your kit, or bring in a little contrast by adding a ContourROAM2 in one of three colors: red, blue or traditional black. 

•	60fps: As requested, Contour has bumped up the frames per second to 60 when shooting at 720p, meaning you can now get that smooth video quality you've come to expect from Contour cameras. 

•	Waterproof without a case: Good things come in small packages. The ContourROAM2 sheds bulk by working underwater without an extra case. Minimalism is a good thing. 

•	Low-profile design: Contour cameras have won numerous awards for their stylish, yet functional, low-profile design. The ContourROAM2 is exceptionally designed and lightweight. With the ContourROAM2, less really is more. 

•	Versatility: Whether snorkeling, snowboarding, or tearing up single track, the ContourROAM2 is ready for any adventure. It's compatible with every Contour mount giving you unlimited angles. The 270° rotating lens means no matter where the camera is mounted, you'll always get the perfect, level shot. 

•	Laser Alignment: Get the correct angle any time with the built-in laser level. 

•	Long Battery Life: Shoot up to 3.5 hours of footage. The Instant On-Record switch means there is no standby mode. The battery is only in use when shooting, giving you more bang per charge. MicroSD Card Included: Contour added a 4GB MicroSD card so your camera is ready to use right out of the box."

Everything else on this one is totally bone stock and original right down to the beautiful grips. 

After installing the new barrel ($200) I fired 55 rounds total from it and them out it in my safe. So this one has only seen 55 rounds total since 1981!

388,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3459388,For Sale:  Leupold Mark 4 LR/T Illuminated TMR 4.5-14x50mm,"Vancouver, Southwest Washington, Washington",FREE,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 3, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hi Im selling my Leupold Mark 4 illuminated TMR reticle 4.5-14x50mm (30mm main tube). I had this scope for a little over a month (still have box). Reason Im selling is that I was planning on doing more long range shooting than I actually have time for (or the money). This scope was going to be used as duel use for long range shooting and (long range) hunting. The fact that it is illuminated helps with the first and last minutes of hunting when it is still dark outside. Each level of illumination has an off between each level of brightness (which is much better than Nightforce scopes that have a preset level of brightness which cant be changed quickly). The glass on this scope is as clear as you will ever see. This is almost the best scope that I have owned, but when you get into such high-end quality scopes, the difference in quality is hard to tell. I need the money right now for another project and because I am not using this scope to its fullest potential. 

The scope is in like brand new condition. It is currently held by Burris extreme tactical rings (low), that have been lapped. Lapping reduces any pressure points the rings can put on the scope from any manufacture imperfections on the rings. This translates into a better secured scope and equal pressure all around the body of the scope. 

The anti-cant is a Holland Signature Series. I believe this is the best anti cant as it is very clear and strong yet not bulky. 

The rail is an EGW 20 MOA rail for a Remington 700 Long Action.  A small part of the rail was cut off (by a gun smith) on the front end so the scope would not be so close to the end of the rail. 

I paid:
Scope $1400
Rings $63
Anti cant $65
Rail $45
----------------------------
Total $1573

Asking $1425 for all (will sell without rail so itll be minus $45 from asking price)
This is a package deal of a minimum of the scope, rings, and anti-cant. My loss is your gain!

You are more than welcome to check out the scope but only serious inquiries. 
Scope will remain on rifle until I have cash in hand. I have no other scopes for my rifle so for the time being I need this one on it. 

Will only trade for Smith and Wesson M&P 40 C.O.R.E. Long Slide (5” barrel) or Glock 40 S&W or 10mm that have a Leupold Deltapoint or Trijicon RMR on it or can accept it (by that I mean the slide is already drilled and tapped) or an FNP-40 that accepts red dots. NO TRADES FOR RIFLES, SCOPES, ACCESSORIES, ETC!

433,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3459433,For Sale:  Leupold Mark 4 LR/T Illuminated TMR 4.5-14x50mm,"Vancouver,WA, Portland, Oregon",FREE,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 3, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hi Im selling my Leupold Mark 4 illuminated TMR reticle 4.5-14x50mm (30mm main tube). I had this scope for a little over a month (still have box). Reason Im selling is that I was planning on doing more long range shooting than I actually have time for (or the money). This scope was going to be used as duel use for long range shooting and (long range) hunting. The fact that it is illuminated helps with the first and last minutes of hunting when it is still dark outside. Each level of illumination has an off between each level of brightness (which is much better than Nightforce scopes that have a preset level of brightness which cant be changed quickly). The glass on this scope is as clear as you will ever see. This is almost the best scope that I have owned, but when you get into such high-end quality scopes, the difference in quality is hard to tell. I need the money right now for another project and because I am not using this scope to its fullest potential. 

The scope is in like brand new condition. It is currently held by Burris extreme tactical rings (low), that have been lapped. Lapping reduces any pressure points the rings can put on the scope from any manufacture imperfections on the rings. This translates into a better secured scope and equal pressure all around the body of the scope. 

The anti-cant is a Holland Signature Series. I believe this is the best anti cant as it is very clear and strong yet not bulky. 

The rail is an EGW 20 MOA rail for a Remington 700 Long Action.  A small part of the rail was cut off (by a gun smith) on the front end so the scope would not be so close to the end of the rail. 

I paid:
Scope $1400
Rings $63
Anti cant $65
Rail $45
----------------------------
Total $1573

Asking $1425 for all (will sell without rail so itll be minus $45 from asking price)
This is a package deal of a minimum of the scope, rings, and anti-cant. My loss is your gain!

You are more than welcome to check out the scope but only serious inquiries. 
Scope will remain on rifle until I have cash in hand. I have no other scopes for my rifle so for the time being I need this one on it. 

Will only trade for Smith and Wesson M&P 40 C.O.R.E. Long Slide (5” barrel) or Glock 40 S&W or 10mm that have a Leupold Deltapoint or Trijicon RMR on it or can accept it (by that I mean the slide is already drilled and tapped) or an FNP-40 that accepts red dots.

It's chambered in 7.62x54r which is a powerful, yet extremely inexpensive rifle round. As far as I can tell, all of the parts of the rifle are matching. The wood is fairly good, considering the age, and is auburn with a few various markings, most notably the etched russian character Ж near the sling and an Izhevesk manufacture print in a large star on the buttstock. Though it's only a Ishevsk made in 1943, I'd very much like the person I sell it to not irreparably damage by it trying to make some sort of fugly sporterized gun. If you wanna do that sort of thing, they sell an archangel stock with an attachable magazine at Cabelas, and you won't have to damage the wood, or weld anything to the metal. Included are roughly 40 rounds of surplus/modern steel production, and 14 rounds of winchester white box JSP. Also contains the original issued sling, a dis-assembly tool, and a stripper clip.

This an Excellent Condition Pre-Lock Model 10-11.  It was manufactured between 1997 and 2002 when S&W introduced the models with the internal key-lock.  It has a low round-count and proper lock-up and timing.  Finish is 97-98%.  It is a Four-Inch Heavy Barrel and weighs 36 oz. empty.  It is chambered for the popular .38 Special Cartridge and is rated for +P ammunition.  Also included is a Holster, Hard Case and Speed Loader.  Smith & Wessons without the built-in lock are very desirable and increasingly difficult to find.   Thank You for Looking.

This an Excellent, Like-New Condition S&W Model 442-1 without the internal key lock.  It was manufactured in November 2013.  It has a low round-count and proper lock-up and timing.  Finish is 99%.  It has a 1 7/ inch Barrel and weighs 15 oz. empty.  It is chambered for the popular .38 Special Cartridge and is rated for +P ammunition.  It has a shrouded internal hammer so that it does not snag on the draw.  It is an excellent concealed carry firearm.  It comes in the S&W factory hard case with all paperwork.   Smith & Wessons without the built-in lock are very desirable and increasingly difficult to find.  Thank You for Looking.

It is a 3rd model with a 26 inch octogan barrel and is serial # 204XXX.  I would say that the finish is probably 40 to 50% and the stock is in nice condition.  This gun should bring a premium due to it's octogan barrel and being in 44-40 caliber.  I have actually fired this rifle twice and it shoots fine for a 125 year old gun.

In the world of combat tested and approved firearms SIG Sauer is among the top of any short list. SIG Sauer firearms are used by law enforcement, military elite military units, and lawful citizens with concealed handgun permits. If you are not familiar with SIG Sauer the next logical question is where have you been? Since 1853 SIG Sauer has been providing shooters with firearms with the unquestionable reliability and durability they demand. After all SIG Sauer was born for defense with German precision and attention to detail.

SOMETIMES THE BUZZ IS GOOD. The buzz about the SIG Sauer Mosquito, is that-this scaled down, Rimfire version of the company's popular P226 reduces the noise, recoil and expense of centerfire shooting but keeps the accuracy, precision and exhilaration the same. The polymer frame, blowback-operated pistol is offered in a wide range of configurations.

From a ""Ruger Collector"" article:

In 1997 Ruger began marketing the first models of their engraved Vaquero series. Offered initially only in .45 Long Colt Caliber, engraved Vaqueros were eventually produced in 12 different models, blue/case color or high polish stainless, 4-5/8"" or 5-1/2"" barrel lengths and in additional calibers of .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum. The guns featured a gold filled triangle of machine cut scroll engraving between each of the cylinder flutes as well as simulated ivory grips. Transfer at FFL or CCP w/NH drives license required"

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

The below description is from the website:

Built to the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, this Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each one has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

Vepr in 7.62x39 caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 16” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a scope.

Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight that is windage adjustable."

This firearm has 5 boxes (100 rnds) fired through it. I installed a brand new Ultimak rail in place of the original dust cover. Gives you a continuous rail at the 12 o'clock position for a red dot or a scout scope. Would also have room for a tactical light. This entire package comes with the original boxes and paperwork. Also part of the package is 15 magazines. 10-20 rounders, 2-10 rounders, 2-5 rounders, and 1-25 rounder. These are all high quality check mate magazines. They are the ones that make the mags for Springfield. $2400.00 invested. By slightly used and save big $$$$."
