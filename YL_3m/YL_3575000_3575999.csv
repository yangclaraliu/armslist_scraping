contains a loaded chamber viewport for quick status inspection. Rear slide
serrations are equipped for non-slip grip and classic Walther styling. A
manual safety engages a firing pin block for confident, safe handling. The

classic Walther checkered grip panels. The double action trigger has a 13
lb. pull while the single action has a 6 lb. pull. The magazine finger

The 7mm-08 can be loaded to 3,000 fps with 120gr bullets for long-range deer and antelope hunting, or shot with factory 140gr-150gr bullets for bear and elk. Recoil is MUCH lighter than a 30-06, even lighter than a .270, but effectiveness on game is superb.

Ballistics are a notch above the legendary 7x57 Mauser, which has been used all over the world with proven results - the legendary WDM (Karamojo) Bell took more than 800 elephants in his long ivory-hunting career using a 7x57 and military ammunition.

Condition of this rifle is very good - excellent, with a 1 inch mar in the barrel bluing near the receiver. Excellent trigger pull and a smooth action demonstrate the well-known Winchester Model 70 quality.

Leupold rings and bases are included for the low price of $625."

273,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3575273,Want To Buy:  or Trade for Sig P250C 9mm X-Change,"London, Columbus, Ohio",$ 275,"Listed On: Monday, October 6, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a P250C in .40 S&W.  It is a good gun and a good caliber.  It is my nightstand gun (just in case someone gets past the massive dog).  My wife's nightstand gun is a P250SC. 

Anybody familiar with the P250 doesn't need to read this paragraph.  He or she knows that the Fire Control Group is the numbered part of the gun.  A shooter can change the slide/barrel combination anywhere from .380, 9mm, .40 S&W or .45 ACP in profiles ranging from a subcompact through a full size.  The same with the grip assembly.  

I'd like to trade the .40 slide, barrel, grip and 2 magazines (The gun is usually sold with one).  The mags are marked with glow-in-the-dark paint so they can be located in the dark and to make sure I don't drop a 9mm mag in my .40.

As a trade, Since we are exchanging two things of roughly equal value, it should be pretty close to an even trade.  If you only have one mag for your 9mm kit, I'd like some sort of consideration for the fact that you'll be receiving two.  If there is something that makes your 9mm kit better in some way (holster, or something), I could make the difference up in ammo that you're going to want so you can get to the range as soon as possible.  If we end up making this deal on a Sunday afternoon while the weather's still nice, I'll pay for a day pass at the Deer-Creek shooting range so you can get shooting that day.

I have looked for these kits and they are around.  If somebody bought a 2-Sum kit and would like a second, more powerful caliber, this deal's for you!  I know what the price of one of these kits would be if I was to buy it new.  have a kit you'd like to sell, please let me know how much you want and we'll go from there."

I don't NEED one that's battered, I simply say that because that's the best way to lower my cost of purchase. If you have a less used or even new one that you are willing to part with for cheap, I'm all ears, but that doesn't seem too likely. 

Caliber isn't too important, though I would prefer not in .45acp or .357 sig. All I need/want is the gun and two magazines, anything else is just icing for me."

Bad:
Gauge pod has water damage from being hit with a power washer.
No front lower headlights, wires are there and have power but no lenses
Needs a $40 brake line to stop. 
The brake line is the only thing that effects the performance of the bike and I'll fix it if a deal is struck. It's a Honda, you don't need to see the hours and miles because it will in fact run forever, and the speedo is off anyway because it came with 25's from the factory. That paired with the fact that the handlebar headlight is fantastic, the only real issue is stopping, which if you know how to downshift that's actually all good too.


Good:
Disk brakes
Foreman 500 handlebars to make it rider friendly
F500 choke setup
Fan on a switch
2"" lift, you can have a 5"" that came with it
2 new front axles

Hey all,
So I just picked up a little lot of this 25 acp ammo yesterday and was just planning on shooting it or sticking it in the ammo can. However, i noticed that a few of these are really old boxes and actually still have the ammo inside (only one of them isn’t full and it has rounds in it as well. So, Being as i am not a collector of the older boxes, I would rather get them to someone who does want them for their history rather than they “bang” effect. So I am offering these up for trade for 25 auto ammo. That being said, I will not trade for aluminum cased ammo unless it is a little better in my favor. I would also trade for jhp 25 ammo. I do not have a brand preference per se, but i just want them to be “newer” and in good condition (IE I’m not going to trade for your old corroded coffee can ammo). This is for pickup in Norman only. These all are pre “keep out of reach of children” as well
Here is what I have and their quantity of bullets contained inside. Please refer to pictures for the designs and appearances of the boxes:
2- 50 round boxes of Remington Dupont ""Kleanbore Priming"" 25 auto, both boxes are full and the ammo still looks great and shiny
1- 50 round box of Winchester “OilProof” 25 auto, box is full and ammo looks good
2- 25 round boxes of Geco “OilProof” 25 auto all are shiny and look good (the whole box looks to be in german, so i can’t tell the specific type)
1- 8rd box of Peters Dupont “Rustless” 25 auto, cartridges are “dingy” in appearance but not overly corroded. (wanting to trade this one for a full box of 25, given its greater ago)
To arrange a meet up shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

The scope is in a very very nice American Defense Manufacturing quick release mount.  These hold zero like no other and return to zero if you remount it.  This mount is roughly $160.  

I am selling this setup because I recently purchased a GAP-10 in the same caliber and I want some cash.  I'm sad to see it go, but I get to shoot a lot otherwise and I could use the funds.

Any other questions please ask away.  I am always able to take pictures of any part of the rifle that you need me to.  This is a perfect hunting setup and it is ready to go!!!!  Price is OBO, so feel free to ask me about a realistic offer.  No low ballers, no felons, no ""I want the rifle but I have to wait 5 months for my paycheck to come through"" please."

This rifle has fired ONE ROUND through it.  ONE round.  So it isn't 'new', but is as close to new as you can get.  ONE single round.  It is like new, no nicks or scratches.  It has sat in the safe since I owned it.  USA made in Phoenix, Arizona.

Go HERE for all the specs:  http://www.pof-usa.com/16.5-p415-np3.html

The rifle retails for $2349 according to their website.  It has the NP3 coating which is state of the art, and is a piston driven setup, not gas impingement.  The POF rifles run extremely clean and cool.  Various police departments have tested these rifles for over 20,000 rounds without fail.  POF rifles come with fluted Rock Creek barrels, which are well known for being extremely accurate!!!!  

This rifle will ship with one pmag magazine.  

$1500 for the rifle alone.  Bipod is NOT included.  

If you want the 'ready to go' setup, I also have mounted on the rifle a US Optics SN-4 scope.  It has 1.5-6 magnification.  Red illuminated reticle.  US Optics is a very expensive and very high end scope manufacturer.  It is in a US Optics Posa Slide and Lock mount.  You can view the mount here:  http://www.midwayusa.com/product/114321/us-optics-posa-slide-and-lock-mk1-scope-

limline-or-erek-knobs.html

It has the knob on the left for illumination, which is red in color.  The scope is like new, and I have the build information from US Optics if anyone would like to view it.  

With the optic AND the rifle, I am asking $2500.  If the rifle sells without the optic I have no problem keeping it.  It's very very nice and I can throw it on something else."

I bought this gun new & while it has not had a lot of ammo put through it, it has seen a lot of time on my hip. It has a few little (lite) scratches, in my opinion nothing significant for a carry gun. The gun is very accurate, I’m a pretty decent shot & while I had a Leupold 4X scope on it I could shoot a 3” group from a rest at 100 yards! One of the real nice things about the .460 is that you have so many ammunition choices!  You can shoot .45 Colt, which is a pretty tame round in this revolver, or you can step it up to .454 Casull, or go all the way to the .460 S&W MAGNUM! You are looking at “The Worlds Most Versatile Big Bore Revolver!” The sights are fully adjustable for Windage & Elevation! This is a real sweet gun, it’s powerful enough to keep you safe in the woods & to do what ever you ask of it in that area, yet small enough so as not to get in the way of everyday activities when out in the bush. And really, if you can’t kill it with a .460, you probably won’t be able to kill it with a .500! Also you have so many more ammo options within each bullet group, plink with the 45 colt & if the recoil of the the .460 S&W MAGNUM leaves you wondering why you bought such a monster, then you can always step it down to the .454 Casull which is by no means a slouch!  I don’t know why anyone would even look at a .500, if you buy a .500 you shoot .500’s & nothing else, and if the recoil is to much for you, then that’s just tough, that’s what your stuck with!  This gun is not registered anywhere & I figure that should be a selling point. Also comes with another muzzle brake that came with it, but I’ve never used it. The case has been used for other things & is pretty beat up & I don’t have it with me anyway, so that's not part of the deal.  I really love this gun & I know you will too!  The only reason I’m selling it is because the transmission in my truck crapped out on me & I have to raise some cash, so I’m sorry but I can’t consider any trades.  The first one that shows up with $850..00 cash is going to get a real sweet deal.  Thank you for your interest! Sincerely, Gary..."

They are offbrand magazines, but I have had them more than 20 years, and they work just fine.  Long before China/taiwan/BS mfg imports were allowed here.  It works.  It works good.  It does not jam.  All it ever fed was ammo labeled .223 Remington.  Later in it's life when boxes started being labeled 5.56- it ate them up too,  then when brass became scarce- it ate all the commie steel case ammo I fed it.  In 20 years or so, I have fed it about 7-800 rounds at my best estimate.  It has been loved on, cared for, oiled, sit for months on end in a closet, rediscovered by a son who later decided an AR is ""cool"", but it is what it is.
