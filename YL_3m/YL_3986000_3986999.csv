So Up for sale are several surplus items I am trying to part ways with for the right dollar amount of course. I have several Items which are all for sale, so rather than go in depth  about the features and specs of each and every item I will just copy and paste this text along with the proper photos and titles to each item(s). I figure if someone is actually going to buy something then they probably already know quite a bit about it to begin with so I will be kind to my fingers and give them a little break. 

I know approximately how much I am looking to sell each item for, so NO LOW BALERS! That being said, an object is only worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it. So hit me with your BEST REASONABLE offer and odds are you will get what you are looking for!

Also comes with 75 or so FMJ target rounds and a box of hornady critical defense 110gr +P JHP's which are thr best round for these J frames through thorough testing along with being less punishing in your hands in comparison to the 158gr +P rounds, the ballistics are very comparable to most 115gr +p 9mm rounds, so they pack quite a punch and shoot POA. The shrouded hammer gives you the best of both worlds - snag free like the 642 but you can still manually cock the hammer for 'precision' work. This gun also has had a professional trigger job with Wolff springs installed (tested it with the hardest primers out there, Sellier & Bellot) to ensure that it has no reliability issues - I also have the stock springs, it has a great trigger, especially the single action, I would estimate 8-9lb DA and 2lb or under SA, the DA is very, very smooth. I estimate the round count to be about 150.

The barrel has 0 rounds through it and is new. This will be a lot softer shooter then the carbine barrel that was with the rifle. I also replaced the CH with a BCM GF Mod 4 medium CH. I replaced the ugly DD furniture with a new Magpul FDE CTR stock and FDE K2 grip. With the BCM barrel install, I replaced the handguard with a BCM KMR13 that was professionally dipped by Tarjac in multicam. The multicam finish on the rail has some marks, chips in the finish from mounting accessories. Mainly under the front sight from it clamping down on the rail. The factory DD trigger was replaced with a brand new ALG ACT combat trigger that also has 0 rounds through it. Also included a brand new Noveske QD sling swivel. Also included is a Troy FDE HK style front sight. The sight came from another rifle and is not brand new like the other items, but is with the package. It comes in the factory DD case with manual, plastic, and the brand new in package PMAG that came with the rifle. All of the packages are all included from the new parts.. minus the K2 grip. The rifle shows some very minor normal use wear on the deflector, and the from where the dust cover hits the lower. Buyer is responsible for knowing his or her local laws. Pmag will be not shipped to banned areas. If kits are allowed, the mag will be disassembled. I have all positive feedback on Gunbroker, Ebay, and M4Carbine.  Will ship for 30 dollars.

Certainly one of the most unusual-looking guns to come out is the Mossberg 500 Chainsaw. Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper (not included). The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

I bought this during the panic and wasn't able to find ammo for it. When I finally found some 22, it was so expensive that it hurt to shoot. I have exactly 100 rounds through this gun and am now looking to try something else.

It's the perfect bugout bag, survival kit, or just range toy. It comes with the custom carry case, the factory 10 round mag, a factory clear 10 round mag, and two 25 round ""banana clip"" BX-25 mags. One is unused, but loaded with some rounds.

I did the modification where you can pull back on the bolt to release the slide. You can keep the cheap Tasco scope if you want. 

I never even took the stickers off.

There are even engravings from the factory on both sides, everything is in spectacular shape functionally. It slides like butter. There is slight surface rust, from the previous owner keeping it in a bag I figure, but nothing that is off the bat noticeable. The actual wear of the gun is remarkably little. You can tell it was kept in the open position, but the slide pump arm has very little wear on it. I've kept it very clean, and only shot a box through it, and of course cleaned it after. It'd be a great gun to show off, hunt with, fun shoot with, anything really.

A cut-down, modified version of repeating rifle, this recognizable shootin iron could be holstered like a pistol but fired with the speed of lever-action rifle. Nicknamed the Mare's Leg, this innovative weapon swiftly brought outlaws to justice every week and rose to fame as the real star of the short-lived show. Now fans of those classic Westerns and collectors of innovative firearms can holster a replica of that famous made-for-TV sidearm. Both calibers are equipped with an easy-loading tubular magazine design. These guns are not New York Compliant.

Looking to sell my Ruger GP-100. Stainless steel polished throughout to a nice shine. Original pebbled rubber grips. 3"" barrel, 6 shot, .357 magnum, fixed sights. Box, lock, and manual.

It has a Wolff Reduced Power #10 hammer spring and 8# trigger return spring installed, as well as internal contact/friction points honed and polished. Far smoother DA trigger pull than the factory 14# and a crisp ""hair trigger"" in single action. I estimate it at about 1.5-2.5# but have not had it guaged. Original springs as well as the rest of the Wolff kit (9#, 12# hammer & 10# trigger return) will be included so you can change it to your liking or go back to factory weight.

Also, including in the sale is my ammo for it.

$15/box, 4 boxes (80rds) - .357mag PMC Gold Starfire 150gr SFHP Hollow Points

There's over $400 worth of ammo (current retail value) and the gun alone is roughly worth $600+. I was thinking around the $900 range. Feel free to give a reasonable offer, considering what you're getting.

It's in amazing condition for its age. It looks like a brand new pistol to be honest. It's an unissued PA63, which is very hard to come by. You don't see these in like-new condition. The de-cocking feature does function properly (Whjch is also a major plus, as a lot of them do not work). This is the cleanest 63 I've ever owned, and I've had four of them. This is the last of the group, so it's time for something new. I have 250 rounds of factory loaded 9x18 Makarov ammo to go with it, as well as the leather holster that most people end up losing and don't include. I also have an IWB holster for concealed carry. This makes for a perfect CCW - It's lightweight, the decocker still works so you can carry one in the chamber with no worries, and it shoots phenomenally. It is very accurate. The best and most accurate shooting, nicest condition PA63 out of the ones that I've owned.

The listed price ($425 OBO) is for the entire package - The pistol, all five boxes of ammunition, and both holsters. With that being said, I may negotiate with serious buyers that have cash in hand. So feel free to make a reasonable offer. Will meet within reasonable distance, or deliver for a fee depending on distance.

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1942 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped in May of 1942. It is stamped with WB inside a Box for Colonel Waldemar S. Broberg, Hartford/Springfield Ordnance District, Army Inspector of Ordnance: July 1, 1941 - June 16, 1942. The WB inspected pistols are a little more rare for that time frame.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by the military, as the barrel has been re-stamped. This gun is in its original time frame finish (parkerized). All Proof markings to fit era. Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. It is amazingly tight and special fitted for accuracy. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

The ""P"" proof mark is located near the magazine release and on top of the slide, in front of the rear sight. Cross cannons ordnance mark on the right rear of the frame, to the right of the hammer pin. ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY"" over the serial number with ""M1911A1 U.S. ARMY"" to the right of the slide stop pin. Also has the G marking on top of the frame next to the disconnector and P proof mark on top of the slide, in front of the rear sight. HS marked barrel. HS is the marking of High Standard.

This gun is all original, and a wartime piece, as you can tell by the blood spots on the slide and grip. It also comes with original U.S. marked Military issued Holster.
