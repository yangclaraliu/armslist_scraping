Selling to Cabelas this Friday if I don't get any takers here.

Production date is 1897, so it is considered an antique and as such can be shipped through regular mail and sold with no FFL involved. This is the very scarce cousin to the Russian Nagant revolver. Under 25,000 were produced and many were converted to .22lr in the 1960's by importers making the original caliber guns a rarity. This revolver was used by the Swedish Army until the 1930's when they were replaced and then reissued to the home guard during WWII. Most were imported to the US in the late 1960's.

It shoots the 7.5mm Swedish black powder cartridge which has not been produced in over 50 years. The round is identical in size and pressure to the smokeless 7.5mm Swiss Ordinance (not the rifle round) and this round can be found online at specialty retailers. However where this revolver shines, is that you can reload ammo for it at $0.05 a round, the cost of .22lr. Reloading data is identical to .32 S+W Long and the rounds are nearly identical in dimensions.

Many people shoot .32 S+W Long with CAST LEAD BULLETS ONLY (jacked bullets will get lodged in the barrel) without any troubles, but I have not tried this.

Included are 300 new production 7.5 Swiss Ordinance cases that can be reloaded up to 10-15 times each. Also included is the correct .314 caliber Lee bullet mould, unused. All you need are a set of 7.5 Swiss Ordinance dies (substitutions available) and a casting/loading setup to make your own ammo.

I have never fired this gun, but it is 100% functional. It is a standard double/single action revolver with a heavy double action pull and a very crisp single action.

Condition is pretty good for a gun that is 118 years old. Bluing is at 70% with some light pitting. Strawing is at 40%. Bore is bright with no pitting and strong rifling. 

Price of the revolver and loading supplies is $500 OBO which is a fair market value. These revolvers typically sell on Gunbroker in the $430 range. Feel free to make an offer, I'm looking to move this out soon. I have $100 in the cases and mould alone. I would consider trading for cases of ammo in .223, 9mm, .30-06, etc.

I have a CPL. Will meet in the parking lot of the Tulalip Cabelas. I-594 exempt as an antique, no FFL required.

I don't respond to gibberish, phone numbers, or lowball offers. All communication via email so everything is in writing and well understood. More pictures available upon request.

Springfield Loaded 1911-
Springfield 1911 with their nicer trigger and Trijicon night sights. this gun is GREAT for someone who is looking for a great shooting 1911, but prefers to not waste money on the aesthetics of something like a Kimber. I bought this gun new and have pit exactly 350 rounds through it. condition is 95%, with one small scratch in the finish. comes with the stock kit, plus a kimber mag and a Wilson Combat mag. asking 700 for it.http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/1911-loaded-45-acp/

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

About melonite treating:

""Meloniting (nitro-carburizing) is a heat treat process for barrels that hardens the barrel to apx. 70 Rockwell so they last longer, are more corrosion resistant inside and out, and also decreases friction in the barrel which can increase velocity. Chrome lined barrels can decrease accuracy, as it is a built-up layer of material inside the barrel. Nitro-carburizing changes the structure of the metal itself without building a layer in the bore, therefore increasing performance but not decreasing accuracy. Melonite treated barrels have proven to last 30% longer than chromelined barrels, and are more accurate.""

Rifle sells for $700, cash. Located in Henry County, and will only sell to individuals legal to own this firearm. Please feel free to contact for inquiries. I can be reached at REDACTED or phoned at REDACTED. If by phone, text is preferred due to complex work schedule."

Glock became the first manufacturer to make this popular and effective round accessible to law enforcement agencies.

I refinished the wood cut the barrel down to 16.5 flattened all the 1942 machine marks on the barrel and receiver ( you know what I'm talking about if you've ever held a mosin) polished and reblued all metal surfaces except for the bolt obviously which I polished. Removed and reblued the top of globe to make the front sight have a carbine look to match the shortened barrel which was done right on a band saw and finished to 90 degrees. I also took a small amount off the but stock and made a new buttplate. The result was a handy sized rifle that's surprisingly repeatable as far as accuracy with enough 762x54 firepower to drop most anything. Nice to sling up while working in the woods and a great trail gun or saddle bag gun. Everyone loves it the range lol sounds like a grenade and looks like a flamethrower. Sad to sell it but need funds elsewhere. (College loans). Asking 300 if you want I'll throw in some stripper clips a pouch for them a sling and a decent amount of ammo.

It's a in prefect condition and has been reliable and great fun, I'm looking into another purchase and need cash to do so.. Mainly looking towards cash or cash gun trade.

*I have the original box,1st round fired and the speed loader.

*Also has the 2 original mags plus I have purchased (2) more g27 mags for a total of 4.
 (1)g23 mag with x grip spacer extention 
 (1) G19 mag 9mm and all are factory mags. 

All g27 mags come with peirce grip pinky extention but one isn't Installed but I have in original packaging and also have original Glock plates for others.

*It has the grip force adapter installed  (Can be removed I have original pin also.)

*I have the original recoil spring, it's fine just upgraded to a stainless steel one So comes with both.

*I have in the original box a Lone wolf 40/9mm conversion barrel threaded and in stainless steel match grade also with a thread protector.(Also have factory g27 barrel included in package )

*It has installed Trijicon night sights 3 dot glow in the dark quality night sights. All (green )
I have original sights also included.

*Will come with  250 rds of factory Remington 
and 50rds blazer brass.. .S&W .40 ammo

*I have 10rd of Buffalo bore strictly business rds. Some were tested but a solid 9mm +p+ penetrator low flash round in deed.

And will sell package for 750$ OBO cash only and a good price at that for a big package like this. Most G27 sell for around 500$ without high end night sights.. so priced to sell and Lowballers don't waste your time here.

It has never been fired, since the factory. This has only very minor handling marks and would rate a 98% or better grade. It comes with the booklet, sling and in the original box.The stock has aged nicely in the 40 years to a darker brown. It was a honey color in the late 90's when I bought it. There is NO cleaning kit.  The factory mag was never in the gun. It requires dropping the trigger group to install it. If you prefer it installed, buy it and do so. Turning pins would leave marks..
