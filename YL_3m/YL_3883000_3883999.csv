The Model 36 was designed in the era just after World War II, when Smith & Wesson stopped producing war materials and resumed normal production. For the Model 36, they sought to design a weapon that could fire the more powerful .38 Special round in a small, concealable package. Since the older I-frame was not able to handle this load, a new frame was designed, which became the Smith & Wesson J-frame.

The new design was introduced at the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) convention in 1950, and was favorably received. A vote was held to name the new revolver, and the name ""Chiefs Special"" won.  A three inch barreled version of this design went into production immediately, due to high demand. It was available in either a blued or nickel plated finish.  It was produced as the ""Chiefs Special"" until 1957, when it then became the Model 36. The ""Chiefs Special"" continued to be manufactured as a separate variant. (Wikipedia)

This particular gun is a 36-1, manufactured in 1982 per verbal confirmation from the S&W Customer Service, and was potentially a Police Service - duty revolver (I don’t know entire history but it did spend part of its life with a Police department, and came to me as the result of a Dept trade-in).  It features the less commonly seen 3” Barrel with Square butt frame, combat sights, aftermarket soft rubber Pachmeyer Compac –type grips (again, designed for use with square butt j-frame design), and “bobbed” hammer (I do not know if the bobbed hammer was factory for this gun or if it replaced the factory spurred hammer, but it does not appear to have been a hack-job, it appears to be a S&W factory bobbed hammer, and may have been mandatory if it was issued for service duty).

So technically this is classified as a pistol. As most of you know it's legal to make a pistol into a rifle & not the other way around. (Ya I heard about SBR's blah blah) always been told to buy the ""pistol"" frame over the rifle frame (they are exactly the same just how T/C ran the # with the ATF) so no matter where you were it was legal to swap from pistol to rifle barrels & so on & so forth. 
This is brand new still have receipt from 30 days ago. Ordered a Boyds custom laminate stock & fore end. The color is called pepper. Crappy cell phone picture doesn't do it justice, very nice color. 
All of it together- pistol grip & pistol forend- rifle stock & forend - receiver.

From Burris:
For AR and carbine shooters, Burris bundles a 3 MOA FastFire III with the rugged AR-F3 mount. It’s the simplest and most effective way to mount any FastFire on an AR flattop as a stand-alone sight or as a co-witness for iron sights. The FastFire sits low in the mount and a pair of metal wings on each side of the lenses protects the sight from impact or unintentional abuse. For added convenience, a lower compartment offers storage for a spare battery, open-end wrench and Torx® wrench. Fits any Weaver or Picatinny-style base."

Based on the theory, Law of action and reaction, Strike Industries created a large reflecting area to enlarge great ""reaction"" to eliminate recoil force. 
The COOKIE CUTTER COMP is, hands down, the Best muzzle brake for compensating muzzle rise and recoil on Short Barrel Rifles (SBR's) and AR-Pistols. It is NOT a flash suppressor. There will be significant side concussion so the shooter needs to be aware of hand placement and surrounding personnel!!!
It is designed as a single chamber muzzle break with a large surface area, which minimizes recoil substantially and at the same time compensates muzzle rise. 
Additionally the CC-COMP also happens to make a great glass breaker!

The barrel is 5.56 NATO 1/9 and is a great length for pistols and SBRs.
Shoots smooth and without issues the few times I have shot it.
Selling because I usually shoot other guns and do not need it sitting in the safe, want to use the money for something else.
Eotech in picture is not included, but I could add another red dot if the price is right.
I bought the gun after the horrible days of really high prices, but before normal prices, so I have a lot invested, esp after adding on all the extra items such as the Sig Brace etc.
I understand I will lose some on the gun, but will just keep it before getting low balled.
Feel free to make an offer if you are interested. I have over $1350 in the gun not including the Eotech, but am willing to consider fair offers."

I have never had any of the problems that some people say the have with the PF9. But I also don't buy shitty steal cased ammo. It comes with two magazines, with a plus one extension on one mag. I did a stipple job on it for better grip because the gun is a little snappy. it just kind of fancied up the already cool looking Kel Tec grip. Also has a Hogue grip, and a Uncle Mikes IWB holster. The barrel and feed ramps are polished. The only thing wrong with the gun is some cosmetic wearing on the slide from the holster.

The mower only has 56 hours on it, and is in mint condition. The only problem I have ever had with it was the battery losing charge over the winter one year, and that was my fault. I recently bought a new house with a really small yard, so don't need this big mower anymore. At the previous house I had about an acre lot. I could only use the rider on a quarter of the lawn, and that was for about ten minutes. The rest of the yard was a huge hill and landscape beds, so I used the push mower. That is why there is such few hours on the rider. I have changed the oil, oil filter, and air filter frequently. I'm not joking when I say this mower needs nothing! Tires show no signs of wear, you would be set to go with this mower!! I will include a couple extra air filters, and have brand new chains for the tires that have never been used. I am the first only owner, I paid $1800 for it new. This mower has always been garaged, and has never been in the rain or snow. I could possibly meet somewhere if needed to pick up, depending on how far. If you have any questions feel free to ask. You can call or text me at REDACTED, if you call please leave a message. I have more pictures also. I look forward to speaking with you, and thanks for checking out the mower. 1000 OBO"

It's brand new and has only been test fired. Assembled using Troy's version of the Navy's MK18 upper completed in their factory using their 10.5 inch chrome lined, 1x7 twist barrel, M16 carrier with staked key and bolt. They also used their FDE Bravo rail and Medieval muzzle device. All I did was to mate the upper with PSA's pistol lower and added the Troy control grip as well as Magpul BAD lever. I did not ""build"" these from parts.  The uppers and lowers fit together great and the rear pin takes a light tap with a punch to open up. These were only function fired to make sure the uppers and lowers were compatible. Function was perfect and the BAD levers worked great. The Troy grip angle is an improvement for these pistols and would serve well if these were ever converted to SBRs. These would be perfect for that. Recoil is very mild and the muzzle device reduced flash to the point I didn't notice it.
I believe these uppers were a limited run from Troy as I haven't seen them before.

All work done by me with my gunsmiths help. Im doing some apprenticeship work with him. The grip was shaved down, trigger guard rounded out, and finger grooves cut in, then a custom grip texture added. This is not stippling. This is done by adding material to the frame. Then the frame wass cerakoted. I milled into the slide to add the burris fastfire. The fit is perfect and solid as a rock. Then the slide was re-parkerized where it was milled.

Pistol comes as pictured, with the burris fastfire, one 13 rd mag, and two 15 rd mags. As well as the kit that comes with the pistol when bought new.

This is a new custom made floating Oak Wall shelf with a drop down hidden compartment.It's great for hiding handguns or valuables in plain sight yet have fast easy access to them.It's great for mounting next to your bed for hiding a hand gun,jewelry,or other valuables It's much safer than storing a gun in your nightstand or under a mattress.It also works great for storing jewelry,valuables.or anything else you don't want someone to find.Plus someone can't steal what they can't find. It is not meant to take the place of a safe.

It features a felt lined compartment,a gas strut,nickle plated euro hinges and a secret magnetic lock.The lock works by placing the 2 inch decorative magnetic wooden barrel key with a felt bottom over the lock to open it.The barrel is stained to match the shelf and simply look like a decoration when left on the shelf and it only takes seconds to open the shelf. You can easily remove the rare earth magnets from the barrel if you choose and place them under any item you choose that you can drill a shallow hole to use as a key.The top trim closely overlaps the bottom trim to hide the seam where the shelf opens.
The felt lined compartment helps keep items from sliding around too much and the straight interior trim walls prevent items from falling out when opened. However if you would like a black trim- able foam insert to go in the shelf that you can cut out to hold guns,etc I can include one for $10.

This shelf has a Mahogany stain, finished with a high quality lacquer and measures 23""L X12""XW4""H Outside by 21""L X10""W X2.5""H inside

Comes with installation kit which includes :2 Heavy duty toggle bolt wall anchors,wood template to mark holes on the wall, and a 2 inch decorative wooden barrel key stained to match the shelf.

These shelves are made to order by me in my shop, please allow 5-7 days to ship or can be picked up locally.Shipping is $20 or less to most places.
Need a different size or finish contact me,I can finish these is just about any stain or paint color you choose.I also make a 48"" shelf long enough to hold rifles and a 42"" perfect size for a AR and 35"" mid-size shelf a perfect size for several hand guns,accessories . I love to do custom orders.

The bluing on the 20"" barrel & receiver is 99% and the bore is brilliant with crisp rifling. The 2 tone Laminated stock shows only light use impressions that didn't break the finish and are very hard to photograph. I'd estimate this gun saw only 1 or 2 hunts. I have the original boxes for both the gun & scope.  Face to face or FFL to FFL at your expense."

You can easily remove the rare earth magnets from the barrel if you choose and place them under any item you choose that you can drill a shallow hole to use as a key.The top trim closely overlaps the bottom trim to hide the seam where the shelf opens.
The felt lined compartment helps keep items from sliding around too much and the straight interior trim walls prevent items from falling out when opened. However if you would like a black trim- able foam insert to go in the shelf that you can cut out to hold guns,etc I can include one for $10.

I've had all the springs replaced, trigger work, plus the SRT (short reset trigger) and Siglites night sights have been installed.  I had been running with a lighter mainspring for a lighter trigger pull, I have since ordered a new factory 18# mainspring and installed it, returning the trigger to 4 lbs. in single action and about 8 lbs in double action.  Sig Sauer customer service lists the manufacture date as 2008, it was a law enforcement issue that was completely reconditioned by the factory prior to resale. 
The P239 is a solid aluminum frame under a stainless steel slide, adding some weight and recoil absorption over its polymer counterparts.  The exterior nitron finish is in good shape, I do not see any obvious flaws  or wear anywhere other than wear in the interior finish on the barrel and other contact surfaces from use.

Included is the gun, four 7-round magazines, newer factory case,  the original sights, mainspring, and standard reset trigger left from the upgrade, plus a Shepherd Leather IWB holster.

Priced reduced to a firm $600 out the door.

It is not meant to take the place of a safe.

It features a felt lined compartment,a gas strut,nickle plated euro hinges and a secret magnetic lock.The lock works by placing the 2 inch decorative magnetic wooden barrel key with a felt bottom over the lock to open it.The barrel is stained to match the shelf and simply look like a decoration when left on the shelf and it only takes seconds to open the shelf. You can easily remove the rare earth magnets from the barrel if you choose and place them under any item you choose that you can drill a shallow hole to use as a key.The top trim closely overlaps the bottom trim to hide the seam where the shelf opens.
The felt lined compartment helps keep items from sliding around too much and the straight interior trim walls prevent items from falling out when opened. However if you would like a black trim- able foam insert to go in the shelf that you can cut out to hold guns,etc I can include one for $10.

This shelf has a Ebony stain and was lightly sanded on the edges to give it a distressed look and is finished with a high quality lacquer. Measures 23""L X12""XW4""H Outside by 21""L X10""W X2.5""H inside

Comes with installation kit which includes :2 Heavy duty toggle bolt wall anchors,wood template to mark holes on the wall, and a 2 inch decorative wooden barrel key stained to match the shelf.

It is not meant to take the place of a safe.

It features a felt lined compartment,two gas struts,nickle plated euro hinges and two magnetic locks.The locks works by placing the 2 inch decorative magnetic wooden barrel key with a felt bottom over the lock to open it.The barrel is stained to match the shelf and simply look like a decoration when left on the shelf and it only takes seconds to open the shelf. You can easily remove the rare earth magnets from the barrel if you choose and place them under any item you choose that you can drill a shallow hole to use as a key.The top trim closely overlaps the bottom trim to hide the seam where the shelf opens.
The felt lined compartment helps keep items from sliding around too much and the straight interior trim walls prevent items from falling out when opened. However if you would like a black trim- able foam insert to go in the shelf that you can cut out to hold guns,etc I can include one for $15.

This shelf has a Mahogany stain, finished with a high quality polyurethane and measures 35""L X12""XW4""H Outside by 30.5""L between the struts X10""W X2.5""H inside.

Two tone Colt Combat Elite, I would say it is about 85%.  The following modifications have been done to it (I do not know the gunsmith as I bought this used);

- Bar -Sto barrel fitted
- Briley bushing installed
- SA mag well installed and blended
- STI adjustable night sights, (they do work, looks like 2012 is the made on date)
- ambidextrous safety installed
- Beavertail grip safety (not sure if this aftermarket but it des not look like a colt OEM)
- Front grip checkered (looks like 20 LPI)
- Hammer has been replaced (not sure of make)
- VZ grips added

Trigger is quite light, I do not have a scale but I would say at the very most it is 4lb.

As you can imagine with the barrel and bushing the gun is very accurate.  I have shot it with various JHP, Corbon 185gr, Federal, Remington, and it has not choked.  

Included is a Wilson 8rnd mag and an Andrews IWB holster
