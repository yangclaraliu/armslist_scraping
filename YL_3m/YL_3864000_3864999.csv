  I actually really  like the gun a lot; carries very comfy and perfect size and versatility, but am the type who just wants to try something different and I have my sights set elsewhere.  140 rnds of factory fmj and 30 rnds of hornady/ TAP hollow points, very nice and gently used desantis OWB holster.

Sorry but the price is firm at present; I really want to avoid the tone of so many jerks who include their snide ""don't waste my time"" -type comments, but I am convinced the price is fair and if you disagree, I invite you to seek out and pay the better price rather than ask. 

 If my mind changes, so will the ad.  (It's not like I am one of these guys selling 5.56 ammo or a mid-level AK for 2-3 times the value of that online or anywhere else - and that is before the ammo ban is even certain and when you can buy an american-made AK for reasonable prices...just sayin)  for the right trade I am willing to negotiate."

I am a 1911 lover and this tops all of the 1911s that I have ever fired!  I bought the pistol for $1200 last year.  The only reason I'm selling it is because I am moving to Germany next summer and it is a hassle to take firearms with me.  I decided to sell this and I will buy a new one when I move back to the states.  I have the original hard plastic box that it came in and everything that came with it.  There is a low profile laser that goes on the rail.  Unfortunately Sig Sauer didn't think to make a holster that it fits in with the laser on it so it won't fit in the TAC holster with the laser on.  I bought an extra magazine for it so now there are 3 mags.  I've fired approximately 600 rounds through it.  I clean it after every time it goes to the range and regularly during times of not being used.  It is a full sized 1911 so it's bulky for concealed carry but it can be done.  I also have a little over 500 rounds of ammo for it and 15 JHP rounds also.  I'm pretty firm on the price because of the condition it is in, the extra mag for it, and the amount of ammunition that I am providing with it.  I included the link to the pistol on the Sig Sauer website.  The one on the website is the updated version which has a skeletonized trigger which mine does not have.  It also doesn't say anything about the laser that comes with it.

Sure you can.
It's ugly, like your mom, but I'm willing to bet it kicks harder.

Despite firing the .308 cartridge, this gun has little felt recoil. Similar to an AK47, maybe even an AR15 with bad stance. 
Why? This particular gun's ONLY function is to fire .308 rounds. It was built accordingly.

If you really want to punch through thick foliage or multiple walls...
THIS is your gun. 

Can't afford a G3 or PT-whatever?
THIS is your gun.

Yes, you can fire both the .308 WIN cartridge and the 7.62x51mm NATO.
Yes, again, it is ugly.
Yes, you can beat the hell out of it.
Yes, Scarlett Johansson is smokin' hot.

I, personally, love this monstrosity, but want to keep my ammo variety to a minimum for now. Which means no more .308...
Before I forget or you buy/trade this and get pissed. Here's the part no one tells you.

This gun WILL need work. I've put some time and research into it, but this isn't a priority. Thus, it sits AS IS.

The good:
1)It fires
2)The sights are inline (many CAI CETME sights are canted, not this one)
3)From barrel to butt stock, alignment is good (Otherwise, BCG and all fail to function properly)

Here's the problem:
The bolt head will not always lock into the trunnion. Typically, after firing the first round, the rollers will stop at the trunnion face. This can also happen after the infamous ""HK slap"" on the charging handle prior to shooting.

Diagnosis:
I believe it is a combination of two things. 
1) Bolt Head. For whatever reason, CAI shaved part of the bolt head to create proper ""bolt gap.""
2) Rollers. They tend to wear out on roller-delayed blowback systems.

The fix:
1) Replace the bolt head ($35 Apexgunparts.com)
2) Replace the rollers (~$15)

I am, by no means, a gunsmith. I could be wrong, but the internet allows us to learn for ""free"" that which we do not already know. And I believe I am on spot with the problem.  (How the hell did I fix my vehicles all these years? Oh right, the internet.)

Gun goes anywhere from $550 (parts gun) to a ridiculous $1000.
Considering the fact that this gun actually fires, I'll take $600. No more, no less.

In closing, the consensus says these rifles are amazing once all the kinks are worked out. Worse case scenario, I keep it, fix it, and have a really fun time at the range.

Any input is welcome. Thanks for looking."

I bought this after getting my CCW permit and I am thoroughly impressed.  It is extremely accurate and amazing for concealment.  The only reason that I am selling it is because I am moving to Germany in August and it is not very easy to bring firearms so I've decided I will purchase a new one when I move back to the states.  I paid $575 for this pistol in March 2014.  I have a Blackhawk In-the-pants holster that I use for when I carry it.  I bought an extra mag for it as well so there are now 3.  Only 1 mag comes with the pinky extension plate so I bought some and now all 3 mags have them.  It makes a huge difference when shooting.  I also have a few extra that will go with the pistol in case you want to get more mags.  It comes with 3 different sized backstrap plates.  There is a rail underneath the barrel to put a laser or small pistol light.  I am including about 220 rounds of ammo and 15 rounds of JHP as well.  I have fired about 500 rounds through it.  I have always cleaned it after firing it and regularly when it hasn't been fired.  It is in perfect condition and could be boxed and you would never know it had been fired.  I have the original hard plastic box that it came in and everything that came with it.  I am pretty firm on the price given its condition, the extra mags, extra pinky plates, and the ammunition I am including with it.  I have included the link to the S&W website for this pistol.

The PSL is chambered for the same venerable 7.62x54mmR (rimmed) cartridge as the Dragunov, and feeds from a ten-round detachable box magazine . The magazine used on the PSL differs from that of Dragunov models in that it is stamped with an X shaped pattern on the side, rather than the waffle style stamp found on the Russian and Chinese magazines. The magazines, though they are similar in shape and size, are not interchangeable between the Dragunov and PSL without modification.

The PSL has been in service in Romania since the 1970s and is widely sold on the world market. They are frequently encountered in Iraq where they appear to be quite popular. The simplicity of the rifle makes it ideal for soldiers to use and maintain. The action, being a variant of the AKM's, is extremely reliable despite lack of maintenance, and is particularly forgiving of sand and other debris. The scope's reticle pattern is easy to use and makes range estimation quick and reasonably accurate without any mathematical calculations necessary. With some simple instruction an average individual can be issued a PSL and successfully engage targets at ranges that far exceed the accurate capabilities of non-scoped assault rifles like the AKM, AK-47, etc. Accuracy varies greatly, however, between individual rifles to a greater extent to other rifles in its class, probably due to insufficient quality control during the manufacturing process. In the hands of a capable shooter and with quality ammunition such as 7N1 and 7N14 a PSL is capable of 1 Minute of angle (approximately 1"" at 100 yards) or less while the rifles on the other end of the spectrum are only capable of about 3 MOA.

PSL rifles have some notable features, the skeleton stock is somewhat similar to the Dragunov's but includes an interesting corrugated and spring-loaded stamped steel buttplate. When the rifle is fired this helps reduce the felt recoil to a degree. The cheek riser on the comb of the stock is angled to benefit the right-handed shooter primarily. Some owners feel the cheek pad is not high enough to adequately attain a rigid cheek weld and have to make do with a chin weld.

The butt stock is much shorter than most Western shooters are used to. This is because Romanian soldiers often operate in very cold climates and wear thick winter coats while operating. In theory, a rubber stock extender is to be fitted during warm weather but one is not issued with the rifle.

The PSL's telescopic sight is made by the Romanian Optical Enterprise (IOR) in Bucharest. IOR is a Romanian company which has been making optics since 1936. They currently use German made Schott glass coated with the Carl Zeiss T-3 system to eliminate glare and maximize light transmission. It is unknown what glass and coatings they used at the time they produced the PSL's scope, however IOR had a long association with western European optics manufacturers and maintained these despite being caught within the Iron Curtain. In 1967 IOR collaborated with various German manufacturers and in 1975 an association was established with Carl Zeiss which led to even more expansion and modernization.



The PSL rifle is typically issued with a 4x24 optical sight called LPS 4x6° TIP2 (Lunetă Puṣcă Semiautomată Tip 2, or ""Scope, Semi-Automatic Rifle, Type #2"") which is a simplified version of the Russian PSO-1 telescopic weapon sight. This optical sight features 4x magnification , a 6° field of view , and the objective lens is 24 mm in diameter. It shares the basic design and stadiametric rangefinder found in the reticle of the original Russian PSO-1 scope. The LPS 4x6° TIP2 elevation turret features bullet drop compensation (BDC) in 50 m increments for engaging point and area targets at ranges from 100 m up to 1,000 m. The BDC feature must be tuned at the factory for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of rifle and cartridge at a predefined air density. Inevitable BDC induced errors will occur if the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the circumstances the BDC was calibrated for. Marksmen can be trained to compensate for these errors. Besides the BDC elevation or vertical adjustment control of the reticle, the windage or horizontal adjustment control of the reticle can also be easily dialed in by the user without having to remove turret caps etc."

Serial number 1 1,0XX. Take down model for easy carry/storage! It's barrel length is 19 3/8"" and holds about 12 cartridges. It looks like it was a gun that they didn't get the T in the serial number because there is a space between the 1's for another symbol. If it had the T for 22 long rifle between the roll marked 1 1060 it shows to be a 1961 because that way the serial number would be correct and everything else would go with the unnumbered receiver which would also be correct for that year. That was about the last year they didn't stamp the serial numbers on the receiver's there about because this one also isn't stamped. This rifle left the factory without the T in the roll marked serial number but not sure if it was the only one that got out of the factory that way or there was more, so it may be one of one but I doubt it?? Interesting Rifle!! Someone emailed me that said it looks like the adjusting barrel locking ring may have been replaced with a newer one. Even though the rifle looks to have been meticulously cared for, being it's age and it has been enjoyed I could see where something could have been replaced through the years as these were the go to gun for accuracy/dependability! The firearm absolutely has to be transferred to you and the paper work done as I Prefer to sell FTF at an FFL only.

As far as I know, it was my great grandfather or great uncles. Family doesnt really know whose it was. According to http://www.bowersweapons.com/US%20MODEL%201903%20RIFLE%20SERIAL%20NUMBER%20RANGES.htm, the Serial Number 1376485 means this gun was made in 1931! This gun lived through the great depression.

It does have its blemishes here and there. The barrel used to have a fixed front sight, but it was removed long before I ever saw the gun for the first time. This is shown in the pictures. However, the stock is great shape.

Over the years, modern scope rings mounts were installed. The gun also has a bushnell 2.5-10x40 scope. If the buyer would like, I am willing to include a modern bushnell 3-9x42 instead. 

They dont make guns like this anymore, and the quality really shows. Even after all these years the bolt still slides like it should and everything works. 

Prices for these guns seem to be all over the board. Anywhere from $500 for beat up models to $2000 for more rare ww1 versions. I have the gun listed at $1000, but that is OBO. Overall the gun is definitely in good shape. I wouldn't hesitate to hunt with it right now.

#2. I also have a LaRue Tactical LT110 QD mount for EOTech weapon sights. More info here - http://www.laruetactical.com/larue-tactical-eotech-qd-mount-lt-110.  Mount is like new.  I purchased it new when I bought the EOTech.  $95 shipped

#3. Surefire M600P Fury Scout Light (Flat Dark Earth). Brand new and came from FNH USA as part of their ""Power up your SCAR"" promotion that just ended. - http://www.fnhusa.com/r/promotions/.  I took it out of the packaging just to make sure it works (and it does), but don't really have a need for it on my SCAR 17S.  $295 shipped

Description
When long run-times are required, the EOTech 556 is the sight to have. The Model 556 operates on the same CR123 lithium batteries manufacturers commonly use in law enforcement and military gear. The extended battery life and run-time of the 556, make it ideal when battery replacement is an issue. Used with an EOTech magnifier, this optic is mission-ready and perfect for mid to long-range shooting applications.  It offers both speed and all-purpose versatility.  The 556 holographic weapon sight is also night vision-compatible.

Some of these may be what is called two toned and after 1940ish they will be full blued.  The base markings are important on the post 1950 mags as many marked ""COLT 45 AUTO"" are aftermarket.  Look for the squashed ""C"" in colt on the 45 mags.  Most 25, 32, and 380 mags for the hammerless guns were two toned, but some were made after 1940 in full blue.  I will pay fair market value depending on condition.  There were hundreds of thousands of these made so most are not rare, but some are.  If they are rusty or cracked they aren't worth salvaging.
