I'm selling this, minus the lower, because I'm working on a new build. If you have an assembled lower waiting to go, then slap it together and you're good to go. 

It's a PSA 16"" M4 profile, 1:7, 5.56 NATO. Chrome-lined, pressure- and mag-tested, .750"" gas block, M4 feedramps, forged t-marked upper. Full auto carrier, MPI/HP bolt. Single stage trigger, 6-position Cerakoted mil-spec buffer tube. Also carry handle and Magpul MOE grip.

I painted the stock and front handguard a foliage (but not ""The"" Foliage) green, and they match the Magpul FG grip pretty nicely. I don't think this even has 1000 rounds through it. It's worked flawlessly with the EOTech 512 I had mounted on it that I'm selling in a different post.

The Flambeau case is included as well. Thanks for looking."

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward. We can only accept cash, we no longer accept CC's."

I bought this Springfield Range Officer brand new less than a year ago. I've put less than 200 rounds through it, and cleaned it thoroughly after use. Comes with the original Springfield plastic box with a few factory accessories, as well as FIVE Springfield factory magazines. 3 have never been used. 

I used the Springfield plastic holster that the gun came with at the range and carried it in the holster for about a week, and realized that the holster is absolutely terrible. Drawing and re-holstering from it made the marks on the slide that are shown in the photos, which is why I'm selling it at a discount for what it's worth. Despite the slide markings, you're getting a near-brand-new 1911 with 5 extra mags for $700...hard to beat that.

It is an ak74 pattern rifle. It has the original factory finish which isn’t anything spectacular and can be left as is or can be recoated with whatever you choose. There are some scratches in the finish here and there from normal use but nothing severe. No rust at all. The sights are nice and straight, which is hard to find in the ak world. I have pulled the bolt hold open but that can easily be re-installed. I have had approximately half of a spam can through this gun so it’s seen no more than 580 rounds, and always cleaned as soon as possible to avoid corrosion.  You can look at the bore and rifling and see that this rifle is still basically new.  I drilled the factory handguard to both lighten and vent the front of the gun.  It has a two tone look with the FDE furniture. It includes 18 magazines total, most still brand new, 1 original 10 rounder, 2 unloaded tapco mags, and 15 loaded tapco mags downloaded 2.  Included in the full asking price is an unopened spam can of Russian 7n6 ammunition complete with the can opener. That’s 1,500 rounds of 7n6 total. I can split the ammo and sell with another saiga 5.45 we have which is also for sale. If you would like more details on that just ask. We can always come up with a price for a package deal. They both have original owner’s manuals and factory proof paperwork. It’s clean, frog lubed, and ready to go shooting! The asking price is $1,500 OBO.

It is built on a Remington 870.

The nation's leading defender. For a half century the Remington Model 870 has been the pump shotgun of choice for government agencies. With over 10 million produced to date, it remains the standard by which all pump actions are measured. Its dual, non-binding action bars deliver ultra-smooth, reliable cycling. The ultimate pump shotgun, the Model 870 stands the test of time, extreme conditions and duty.
•Non-binding twin action bars provide smoothest/surest pump operation
•Receiver milled from solid block of steel
•3"" chamber accepts all 2 ¾"" and 3"" 12-gauge shells
•Steel-lined/grooved fore-end for a stronger grip
•Breech block locks into barrel extension for strength and consistent head space
•Balanced sear and inertia firing pin prevents discharge unless action is closed and trigger is pulled
•Flexitab feeding system prevents a misfeed from jamming the shotgun
•Cross-bolt safety

The Modifications to the firearm are as follows.

It has a Knoxx Specops stock on it. It is adjustable to fit any person or can accommodate body armor. This is NOT a cheap stock like an ATI. This is meant for serious duty use.

The forend is a Surefire Remington 870 Weaponlight. This light is blindingly bright and great to easily identify anything that goes bump in the night. The forend alone retails for $300 dollars and they rarely come on the used market. It has buttons for continuous light and a pressure pad for momentary light.

The Firearm is coated in Ceracote H baked on finish. It is extremely durable and abrasive and chemical resistant. To have a long gun refinished in this coating runs about $200. The process is very labor intensive but results in the most durable firearm finish available and is well worth the money.

There is a single point sling mount between the stock and receiver for carrying the firearm with a single point sling but there are also mounts included to run a 2 point sling as well.

It has a side saddle on the side of the receiver that can hold 6 shotgun shells. This allows the firearm to have 13 rounds of ammunition carried on it before adding extra with your preferred method of carrying shells.

The magazine extension allows the firearm to have 7 shots including one in the chamber to allow for the most firepower before a reload possible. It functions reliably and is very heavy duty. The magazine spring is extra power to ensure that even under the most demanding conditions, the firearm will always reliably feed a new shell.

All of the internals were upgraded to new extreme duty police parts. This includes heavier springs for the hammer, shell lifter, and tigger sear and upgraded parts that are all machined and not MIM.

The barrel is an 18 inch factory Remington barrel with a cylinder bore. That means that the barrel has the optimal spread for close quarter combat and can fire any ammunition you put in it from birdshot to buckshot and slugs. It is the shortest barrel that can be legally fitted to the firearm. It can handle both 2 3/4"" and 3"" ammunition and has functioned flawlessly with both.

This is the ultimate combat shotgun and it is a shotgun you can trust your life to. I would not hesitate to grab this gun if I was having a home invasion. This shotgun will more than exceed your expectations for a shotgun and is the best that money can buy. All the parts and work for this shotgun total more than $1200. I am asking $650 for this shotgun. Compare to any similar shotgun on gunbroker and you will see that this is a good deal. Email me or text 3one3five4nine9nine5one.  I am open to trades of equal value (preferably handguns or AR15)."

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

The downsides to this gun are that it has the sporter thumbhole stock, and that I broke the little hinge on trigger guard. New trigger guard is about $8-$10 last time I checked. Also a couple options to get rid of thumbhole and go back to original would be a new lower housing from DSA(around $150), or a complete imbel parts kit from enterprise arms for $299. With the parts kit you could swap out lowers and have extra parts and barrel for gun. With DSA lower you could drop that in with your trigger parts and add stock and pistol grip.

I also put a red LED light kit on it to make it super bright for nighttime driving. It looks amazing and turns lots of heads! It glows really nice and has multiple settings for brightness and strobe effects. It has 1450 miles on it now. I owe $5600 so that is what I need to take for it. It's a great bike and handles really well. The ride is nice and smooth and there's no questioning it's ability to get up some speed. Definitely a good starter bike.

But I thought that I would post it up here and see what kind of a response that I get. This is an absolutely beautiful rifle, pictures do not do it justice.

For those of you who don't know who Hal Hartley was, do a little research. This was THE top rifle maker for years and years, during the 50's and through the 70's. His craftsmanship is not only unmistakably beautiful but is also tremendously rare and valuable. His works graced the cover of Gun Digest many times and he has been recognized in modern publication for his work with Tiger Maple, his signature design preference. Mr. Hartley's work is few and far between nowadays; It is unfortunate that time destroys so much of past beauty. Luckily, my rifle has been kept in pristine condition as the pictures will reflect.

As I have already mentioned in the title, this is a signature tiger maple stock built on a jeweled FN 1950 Columbian action chambered in 30-06. This is not a re barreled Mauser, this is an original 1950 FN 30-06. The barrel is nicely blued and all bluing is 99%. The stock features ivory inlay as well as a 4 carat tanzanite stone embedded in the grip of the rifle. The tanzanite stone by itself is very valuable; the cut is clean and the clarity is very good. The stock also features a gorgeous hand checkering job done by Mr. Hartley. The trigger is a gold plated Timney which pulls very light. This rifle will come with the original sling, scope, and scope rings. Scope is a Bushnell Command Post Chief 2. Weaver rings. 

Some of the pictures make this rifle look a little darker than it actually is. I apologize for the poor picture quality. More pictures available upon request. As far as my price, I am OBO, and willing to hear any and all offers for the rifle based on your evaluation of its value. Please be reasonable. I will accept trades. I've said it once but I will say it again, I do not have to sell this, I am not convinced that I want to. But I am willing to see all offers.

Very low round count, runs perfectly, recently cleaned and oiled.  This is practically a new gun with the box and everything it came with, and the vintage ""pearl"" grips were NOS still in the package.  

This is something you don't see everyday, a Taurus ""IB-17"", which is essentially a factory custom Model 94 with a stainless finish that has been modified to fire .17 Mach2 with a DAO factory bobbed hammer.  Beautiful gun, like new in box, exactly 100 rounds down the pipe, recently cleaned and oiled.  Looks great, runs perfectly.  Low noise, zero recoil, and unlike an automatic will not jam.  9 guaranteed shots that hit a lot harder than a .22 LR.

Comes with plenty of extras!  4 unopened boxes of V-Max ammo, vintage Ajax ""pearl"" grips (in addition to the original rubber boot grip), and a 17 cal cleaning brush.  But wait, there's more!  If you ACT NOW I'll even throw in a set of 9 mismatched and nearly worn out Snap Caps for dry fire practice!

This revolver will accept any grips for the small framed Taurus 94, will fit in any J-frame holster, and speedloaders for the 9 shot H&R 999 will work in this (I do not have a speedloader).  If you need a holster, I can even throw in an old black leather Bianchi IWB clip-on that is in decent shape.  If you do not have a cleaning kit I can probably even throw together some half empty bottles of Hoppes and RemOil for you.

I am working lots of overtime this month, and my schedule keeps changing, but I do have some availability from late morning to mid afternoon.  Asking for $350 CASH, which is a great deal for this.  The only trade I'd have any interest in would be 45 ACP 230gr WWB or Fiocchi range ammo (in the factory boxes), or possibly a .38 Special snub or a .22WMR Single Six with 6"" or longer barrel.  Serious inquiries only.  No tirekickers or lowballers.  No trades other than specified.  Very unusual and rare gun.  I was told less than 5,000 were made one year only, and between just the gun and grips alone I have 450 into this.  I may accept 45ACP ammo, 38 Special ammo, or pocketknives (Microtech or Spyderco ONLY) as a partial trade.  

Absolutely will not ship.  Need to meet close to Denver.  CASH only.  Please include phone number with reply.  If this does not sell before Christmas it is going back into the safe because maybe my next girlfriend will appreciate this.  Thank you.

NOTE:  This is chambered for .17 Mach2, not 17 HMR."

The Redfield Battlezone™ 3-9x42mm riflescope provides all the
features tactical shooters need, in an economical package. The
Battlezone features an advanced fully multicoated lens system
for the ultimate in brightness, clarity and resolution. A fast focus
eyepiece provides unmatched field of view and makes reticle
focus easy to achieve and maintain in the field. Aggressive pop-
up resettable 1/4MOA windage and elevation adjustments feature
tactile and audible clicks, and assure precision, repeatability and
a wide range of adjustment travel. The new TAC-MOA reticle
features stadia lines on the horizontal and vertical crosshairs set
at two minute of angle (MOA) increments. This allows the shooter
to quickly compensate for wind or bullet drop and can be used
for range estimation on objects of known size. Each Battlezone
comes with two elevation BDC (Bullet Drop Compensation) dials
calibrated in two of the most popular calibers for tactical rifles. The
.223/5.56mm NATO dial is set up for 55gr bullets at 3,100 FPS,
while the second dial is calibrated for .308/7.62mm NATO 168 grain
bullets at 2650 fps. Each dial is marked in 50-yard increments.
Like all Redfield riflescopes, the Battlezone is Nitrogen filled for a
lifetime of waterproof, fog proof and shockproof performance and is
covered by Redfield’s No Excuses™ Full Lifetime warranty.

I bought this gun brand new a few months ago from a local FFL dealer. It's an August 2014 production gun. Unfired by me or anyone else except from the factory. Comes (originally from the factory) with 2 mags (1-8rd, 1-7rd), factory box, spent casing, security lock, and owner's manual. But, I'll include an extra brand new factory 8rd magazine (cost me $35) with the deal. Plus, I'll throw in a brand new Tagua IWB/OWB leather holster. In addition, I've installed rubber Talon grips (two of the mags has matching Talon grips trim on it, pictured).This gun is absolutely brand new, and I like it a lot. But I want something else. Must be at least 21 years old +, and be a Kentucky resident, and have proper ID. KY CCDW preferred. No out of state sale or shipping. Local deal/trade only. $425 for all. Price is firm. No low ball please. Got more than that invested on the gun and extras. I'm just trying to recoup some of my money back. Thanks for looking.

I'm selling my Ruger American bolt-action rifle in 308win, because I bought it thinking I'd go hunting with it, but I've been to busy to go out and use it. I use Frog Lube only, it's the only lube I use. Only has 40rds through it, like I said I rarely ever shoot it. 20 of the first rounds were from me zeroing it and just shooting it. The next 20rds were my girlfriend's father shooting it. Other than that it's sat in the back of my safe, it has a few scratches from being move around in there, but can hardly tell.

We met at a gas station in fife but he wanted to go some where with less people to check out the ar better without people looking. He was with a friend, a big guy with 2 gold teeth in the bottom. So I followed him close to the ports and we found a little area to park and inspect each other's weapons before going to a FFL. He showed me his g17 that was in his trunk then I brought my ar to his trunk so he can check it out. At that point a security guard came around and said we gotta leave. He had a battery charger in his trunk which he gave to me and said thanks for the jump so the guard didn't get suspicious. We started driving to another location to continue our transaction. Then he decided to drive recklessly to lose me. I followed him for a little until it got to sketchy to continue. The AR wasn't worth crashing or causing an accident over. I tried to message him but he blocked me and deleted his post. I have screen shots of some of his profile pics. 

ETA: I got my rifle  back after another soldier claiming to be his superior intervened and returned it to me.  He's still lurking around calling himself Dave, Mike, some other alias,  beware when dealing with him."

Must reply with a valid phone#.

I have owned this for just less than 2 years. The optic is the standard one dot 1 MOA. I have used it on two rifles chambered in 5.56/223. 

I will not sell the Eotech 516 alone unless someone offers to buy the magnifier first for $440 (firm). If someone buys the magnifier first, then I will sell the 516 for $360 (firm). 

I have not had any issues with either devices. 

This ad will be updated as soon as a sale becomes pending.

Face to face meet only. Will not ship.

This is a genuine Eotech made in the United States of America. There are a lot of airsoft/China counterfeits out there.
