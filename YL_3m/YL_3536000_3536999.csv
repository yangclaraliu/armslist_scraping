I have fired this on several occasions and like all 1911 Government clones, it shoots ball ammo fine and occasionally will balk with hollow points.  Otherwise, no issues.  A solid, well built gun, parts for any other 1911 A1 should interchange with no problems.  Selling because I've just accumulated too many 1911's, or so my wife tells me.

The model 223P-1 is a thread-attach suppressor for sporting rifles in .223 Remington and 5.56 mm NATO which yields competitive sound suppression levels in a very light weight format.
The 223P-1 was designed primarily for semi-auto use on AR-15s and use on bolt-action .223 rifles. The direct thread-on attachment is best for rifles that will be shot suppressed most of the time.
The 223P-1 is made of titanium and stainless steel to minimize weight added to the weapon while maintaining strength and durability required for sustained semi-auto fire.
Muzzle blast concussion is eliminated. The recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed out over time.
Communication with your spotter is aided and the need for hearing protection is reduced.
The 223P-1 improves the accuracy of most rifles. The suppressor is sealed and requires no maintenance.

The 223P-1 is ideal for: sporting and varmint use on semi-auto and bolt action rifles in .223 Remington and 5.56 mm NATO.

Low price point. Lower profile. Great suppression.
Dynamite comes in small packages, and the B 22 is no exception. Coming in at 3.75 inches and 2.7 ounces, you won't even know it's on your weapon; until you pull the trigger and notice the absence of sound. Designed to be a wet can, put a couple drops of water, white lithium grease, or wire-pulling into the blast chamber, and be amazed at how quiet this tiny monster is.

As with all of our suppressors, the B 22 is fully user serviceable and can be taken apart with a 1"" socket, wrench or crescent wrench."

Purchased at a gun show in the 80's in Jax, this Stoeger ERA had six rounds fired day one and was put into the safe.  Fired two rounds again a few days back when I dug it out of the back corner of the safe.  Safe is heated so everything stays as it should.  I'd like to

EOTech's most popular holographic weapons sight, the Model 512 is perfect for people who want the best in close-quarters-combat speed and versatility but don't need night vision.

When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.
The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings.

The STG-5.56™ rifle is a Gas Operated Rotating Bolt, Short Piston Drive semiautomatic bull pup rifle featuring a quick interchangeable barrel available in various lengths. It is the Microtechnology Small Arms Research clone of the legendary Steyr AUG. 

This rifle is awesome to shoot, 100% reliable and extremely accurate. It is like new with little sign of prior use, despite the 200+ rounds I’ve fired at the range. I am selling this beautiful rifle to make room for a recently acquired Ruger SR762.

This MSAR STG is completely stock except for the addition of the Gear Head low profile charging handle which is a must-have improvement for any AUG or MSAR STG.

The STG stock is Black High Impact Resistant Synthetic material. The STG 5.56™ innovative design feature includes a Forward Assist and Last Round Bolt Hold Open Release. Something never before seen in a rifle of this distinction. This state-of-the-art design and platform has been totally re-engineered by MSAR to bring you absolute function and reliability. Making a 30 year battle proven design bar none above all others.

center of the buttpad is only 13"". This makes the gun easier to shoulder,
quicker to point, lighter and easier to carry. It carries all the fine

Inventory populating - I'll come to your store and take stock of everything you've got, prices, pictures and details, and populate the initial inventory database.
Inventory maintenance - I'll work it out so that you can either send me what you've sold for deduction from inventory OR an easy to use maintenance system that lets you deduct the items with the click of a button.

 bullets to offer double-diameter expansion, maximum weight retention and
 excellent accuracy. The TSX bullets provide maximum tissue and bone
 destruction, pass-through penetration and devastating energy transfer.
 Multiple grooves in the bullet's shank reduce pressure and improve
 accuracy. Bullets open instantly on contact - no other bullet expands as
 quickly. Nose peels back into four sharp-edged copper petals destroying
 tissue, bone and vital organs for a quick, humane kill. Whether you're
 after whitetail deer, elk, antelope or boar, put 'em in the VOR-TX and
 they're going down.

One of the only semi-automatic Kalashnikov imported into the United States, in almost every regard, an exact duplicate of the Russian AKM. During the 1950’s the Soviet Union, as part of its military aid program, established the production of Soviet-pattern small arms in the Arab Republic of Egypt.
AKM rifles were manufactured at the “Factory 54,” the Maadi Company for Engineering Industries in Cairo. Key Egyptian personnel were trained in the Soviet Union, and the plant was supervised by Russians prior to their abrupt expulsion from Egypt at the hands of Anwar Sadat in 1972. Designated as the “ARM” (Automatic Rifle Misr), a semiautomatic-only version of the Egyptian AKM was introduced to the American public in 1982 by the U.S. division of Steyr-Daimler-Punch in Steyr, Austria. For all intents and purposes this is as close as most of us will ever come to a Russian AKM. They were banned in the us by the ATF for they are too close too a real auto AKM. This rifle has been shot 60 times and is like new condition!! Comes with close too 1000 rounds of ammo!! Original 10 and 2 30 round steel mags and a 30 round pmag

Official Description
A portable and durable armor steel target for everyone who loves shooting! The Evil Roy Practice Target is the best thing to happen to shooting in a very long time.

The portable stand folds to less than 3 feet long in just seconds, so it easily fits in the trunk of even the smallest car. The target head is made of AR500 armor steel so you can shoot it with anything from .22 rimfire to .44 magnum with no damage at all. Our ""heavy duty"" version is also built to take appropriate rifle rounds* with no damage.

The beauty of a steel target is that you don't have to waste time changing paper or putting out new tin cans. The head of the Evil Roy Target will ""bounce"" a little when you hit it, so you get instant positive feedback.

The 1x2 Holder Option allows you to switch your steel target head for a simple clamp that holds two 1"" x 2"" wooden strips, allowing you to staple or clamp paper and cardboard targets to the 1x2's.

*Appropriate rifle rounds are rounds with a velocity of less than 3000 fps. Do not shoot at steel targets with rifle rounds at distances less than 100 yards. Please refer to the Action Target Steel Target Resource Guide for more information about shooting on steel."

I've shot groups of 3 touching with this rifle at 300yrds with ease with Hornaday ammo  and this gun has the ability to replicate that up to twice and then some at that length.  This thing is an absolute tac driver.  The SJC comp also gives this gun virtually zero recoil.  I've shot this gun at 200-300 yards and have had my second shot off before the first has hit the paper with rather good accuracy.  This would make for an awesome varmint rifle.  My 10/22 has more recoil then this rifle.

968,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3536968,For Sale:  Blast from the Past - Beretta Mod. 950BS in .25 ACP.,"Palm Harbor, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 235,"Listed On: Thursday, September 25, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Beretta Mod. 950BS in .25 ACP. - Private sale of an older classic Beretta in very good condition. Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much, as the magazine release wasn't working right (actually the problem was with the magazine). 10 seconds of dremel work to the magazine only, and now she functions perfectly. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...). You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. Taurus also makes a small caliber tip barrel design, but has a much heavier trigger (due to being double action). The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. It looks much better than the photos indicate (horrible contrast and hard light). Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $235. Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $140.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven."
