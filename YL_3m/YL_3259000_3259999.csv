Manufacturer's description:
This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

It's a very sturdy M4 style butt stock. Very lightweight since it's polymer but still strong. It came from the factory on my Yugo NPAP but I recently upgraded to an ACE stock so I no longer need it.

It lines up straight with the receiver and barrel for a good cheek weld and eliminates the ""cheek slap"" that the M70's are known for.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals.

204,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3259204,For Sale:  Benjamin Genesis .22 cal Air Rifle w/ Nitro Piston and Silencer,"Gilbert, Arizona, United States",$ 400,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 9, 2014",Air,no type,no type,no type,no type,"2 month old Benjamin Genesis .22 caliber air rifle in immaculate condition with an absolutely top notch Hawke Sport Optics scope. If you have never heard of or never shot/used a Nitro Piston springer, you will be pleasantly surprised. Smoother cocking effort, much more consistent velocity from shot to shot and has much less recoil than a standard springer. I bought this gun 2 months ago from Big 5and then after doing a little research on what scopes work best on springers, I went to AOA and purchased a Hawke Sport Optics 4-16x50mm scope with illuminated mildot reticle. If you ask anybody who knows anything about air rifle optics and their longevity - you will get the same answer every time: and that is if you have an air rifle and want a scope that will stand up to the intense recoil of spring piston rifles, you buy a Hawke Sport scope - period. One really nice advantage of this particular rifle is that instead of an 11mm dovetailed receiver, you have an integrated picatinny rail that accepts any weaver style rings/bases making choices for rings and their availabilty quite a bit easier. 

This rifle is advertised to shoot at 950fps with alloy pellets and 800 fps using a standard lead (14.7 gr). As I have a chrony I set it up and tested the velocity of this bad boy and was surprised yet again at this rifle. With Gamo PBA ammo, I had an average velocity of 970-990 fps and with the Crosman Premiers I was getting between 810-825 fps - so having an air rifle that actually shoots the velocities that it advertises was refreshing to say the least. What was really nice was that the standard deviation being a scant 9 fps! 

In all honesty, I would rather like to keep this rifle but now that I have a Benjamin Discovery (my first PCP) thanks to my fabulous wifes Fathers Day present, I really can't keep them both. First of all, I don't want my wife thinking that I I like the Genesis better than her present; secondly if I sell my Genesis then I can buy a nicer Hawke Sport scope that has a higher power range and side wheel for field target - thirdly as the Disco's report hovers around 110 dB out of the box I can buy a TK suppressor/muzzle break - then order a good amount of pelllets so that I have a wider variety of ammo for breaking in and testing the Discovery. The Genesis is super quiet and absolutely super accurate with a wide variety of pellet types - (though it favors Crosman Premier 14.3 gr bulk pellets) and I shoot those most often. In addition to the Premiers, I have also had very good accuracy results with most all of the Benjamin Discovery pellets especially the pointed hunting version. In addition to the Benjamins, the best hunting pellet that I have tried are the Predator Polymags in the 16 grain version. What really surprised me was that those Polymags were the 2nd most accurate pellets overall - putting 7 rounds in just under 5/8"" at 33 yards (Yes I konw that everybody and their brother shoots either 5 or 10 shot groups and Im sure that I am breaking the unwritten code of target shooting but 7 round groups are the best of both worlds. I primarily use my air rifles for pigeon control but I do shoot the occasional silhouette match or a field target match when its not 145 degrees outside in the valley - for all of the competition shooting that I have done with the Genesis I use the Crosmans but all of my pest control/general small game hunting is done using the Polymags. At my friends dairy where pigeons fly in and out by the thousands I rarely get a pigeon that has a direct hit in the breast area that flys away. I try to keep most of my shots under 50 yards so that I have a much higher chance of making humane kills and all of my shots that are under 30 yards using Polymags go all the way through both Eurasion doves and pigeons too!

If you are interested in an absolutey first rate spring gun package that will wallop pigeons, crows, eurasion doves, squirrels, rats, raccoons or anything of the like - this is the set up for you! The way that this rifle/scope is configured and being a spring rifle, it isnt a walk in the park to shoot accurately but its not rocket science either. I use the artillery hold with all of the springers that I have ever owned/used and the Genesis is no different in that regard, even with the Nitro Piston cylinder. If you have never heard of an artillery hold in reference to air rifles I'll explain it in the easiest way possible; essentially when you are shooting whether from a bench or offhand, keep a loose hold on the rifle with your bridge hand and keep it loose in your shoulder. The only pressure you really want to have on the gun is on the pistol grip. By doing so you really wring out the accuracy of this one. Once you master the artillery hold - man oh man will your hit/kill/X's increase! Anyway - I am in Gilbert AZ so if anyone is local and would like to pickup locally instead of shipping - just text me @ REDACTED. Text is preferred for the first point of contact becasue I will not answer a phone call from anyone that is not in my phone book already.

Carrier is new and flawless.  These are US Army issued. The red ""X"" indicates prior service use. It's like a certified pre-owned BMW.  Any questions or more pics upon request. Thanks for looking!


UPDATE: I got a message from a guy who has a buddy that told him the red ""X"" means the plates are broken.....I'll clarify in case anyone else's buddy  chimes in. I am recently retired US Army infantry, multiple  deployments, and a sniper for more than half my career.  My credentials. Your welcome. 

All plates and armor are turned in post deployment and marked for training. If they are ""broken"" they are unserviceable and destroyed. The ""training plates"" are then distributed to units in garrison or to allied military. Oh, and they are ceramic, so if they are broken, it's rather noticeable. So until I wash the red ""x"" off and ""fix"" the ""broken"" plate I'll leave this information up here for potential buyers and their buddies. 

Please, if you don't research what your buying or don't know the value,then don't waste people's time. Armslist is a great place, keep it clean boys."

Burgundy colored, and it's in decent shape.
 I was the second owner and have owned this vehicle for about 14 years.
 It has nearly 241,000 miles. Part time FWD.
 Well taken care of, oil and service always on time.
 Transmission was replaced 3 years ago.
 Interior is in pretty good shape, a little dusty, dings and scrapes and usual wear.
 Now onto the jeeps issues:
 The driver seat squeeks. I don't know why, it annoys me. It adjusts back and forth just fine.
 The rear wiper does not work.
 The back hatch/door lock is broken, and needs new lifting pistons. The door does however shut and lock with the key fob.
 The rear bumper is missing the top black molding.
 The interior flooring/mats could use a good cleaning, I have vaccumed it, a carpet cleaner would spiff it up.
 The tags are expired, I do have an emission test pass, and probably will renew them this week.
 All in all, it has minor issues, but I upgraded to a newer model and need to get rid of this one.
 $1500 cash, or willing to trade for American silver eagles of equal value. I can meet in the Desmoines area for inspection in the evenings or sundays."

It was imported by RUKO Products of Buffalo, NY. This pistol was purchased from a gun shop but is a bit unique. When it was re-arsenaled and imported the lower was paired with the upper and the serial number was penciled onto the frame to match the slide. Several other of the small internals are also etched to reflect the serial number. I did find some information online that this practice was done, but it is not common, however it is legitimate. You're getting a good solid accurate shooting pistol.

The pistol comes with 2 mags and the traditional brown military holster (not pictured). This EG shoots great. I have never had one failure in the time I've had it. It was purchased five days before qualification for CHL and was used. It performed flawlessly. Does show signs of wear on muzzle and decocker. This is purely cosmetic.

Because this pistol is not truly original from a purist's standpoint I'm willing to do a dance for only $275.  Where else are you going to find a fully functioning East German Makarov for only $275?. Price negotiation is not an option. The price is firm and trades will not be considered, so don't ask. I will NOT SHIP. This is a FTF deal only.

I am not an FFL. I am a gun enthusiast that is thinning the herd and getting down to a minimum number of calibers. (What this means is I have a highly desired 9MM on layaway that I'm anxious to shoot.) You, the buyer, will be a resident of TEXAS, able to legally purchase and posses a handgun and have a current TEXAS ID. CHL is preferred but not necessary. A bill of sale MUST be completed and signed. It's just that simple.

I do have several boxes (5) of Makarov ammo available to sell with this firearm. Let me know if interested. It is Brown Bear/Silver Bear and offered at $13 each box of 50.

Because it is used no warranty is implied or included with this firearm and it is sold ""AS IS"".

Non are matching numbers which is very typical.
The Zastava M48 is a post World War II Yugoslavian version of the German Karabiner 98k designed Mauser and the Belgian/Czech designed m24 series. After World War II, the Yugoslavs took this design and incorporated minor modifications. Although very similar in general appearance to that of the German rifle, many of the parts of these two rifles are not interchangeable, especially the bolt and related action parts. The main difference between the M48 and the K98k is that the M48 uses an intermediate-length receiver. They are usually easily identified by the top handguard, which extends behind the rear sight and ends just in front of the receiver ring, although this feature exists on other models as well. M48's are regarded as a military surplus firearm and can be collected.

MSRP for the rifle is $1689, MSRP for the Eotech is just a bit under $500.  I am asking $1500 for the Rifle, Eotech sight, and all ammo I have for the AR15 (200 - 600? or so rounds).  You can have the rifle itself for $1200. I need to fund a new project, so I don't want to trade or BS. I am looking for cash. I will entertain REASONABLE offers for the rifle single, or as part of the entire package. You will NOT get a response if you offer under 1k for the rifle alone. 

Please email with questions and serious offers. Pictures are from the actual gun, and then a stock photo of the gun to better show the actual color. My shot of the rifle with the sight on it came out a little washed out. But the rifle you see with the sight on top of the range bag, is what you would be getting.

typical heavy double action trigger ,but very smooth.

single action trigger pull is very smooth with a very crisp break.
it is better than any of my stock cz triggers that I have had

it is a pre 88. 

serial number starts with h 03 

I believe it is a first year model, and is a collector item among tanfoglio enthusiast.

this pistol appears to me to be possibly unfired after it left the factory.
if interested you will be able to inspect it,and I believe you will agree with this assessment.
it has no wear that I can see on the extractor. it also show no wear on the barrel ramp.
also the recoil spring guide shows virtually no wear

the pistol is in my opinion to be 99 percent. I am rating it that high because it shows only wear from mayby the factory test shooting. and racking the slide and cleaning over the years.

the machining on this pistol is as good or better than most newer pistols being manufactured today. 
I am askinf 500.00 or first reasonable offer for it. I believe it is well worth it

will consider some trades

The effect on the right to keep and bear arms is obvious. 
The Herculaneum smelter was the only smelter in the United States which produced lead bullion from raw lead ore that was mined nearby in Missouri’s extensive lead deposits, giving the smelter its “primary” designation. The lead bullion produced was then sold to lead product producers, including ammunition manufacturers for use in conventional ammunition components such as projectiles, projectile cores, and primers. 
Without ammunition, a gun is just a club. The government knows this, and in light of the ongoing project of arming federal agencies to the teeth with millions of rounds of ammunition and military-grade weapons and vehicles, the EPA’s closing of the Doe Run plant, although not a direct assault on the right to keep and bear arms, can be seen as another step toward civilian disarmament. 
While a few other media outlets have reported on the closure, none has connected this dot to a couple of others in the overall plan to leave Americans without weapons and ammunition.
First, the EPA’s closing of the country’s last lead smelting facility follows close on the heels (within a little over a month) of Secretary of State John Kerry’s signing of the United Nations’ Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) “on behalf of President Barack Obama and the people of the United States.”
Article 3 of that agreement outlaws the buying, selling, trading, or transferring by civilians of all “ammunition/munitions fired, launched or delivered by the conventional arms.”
By making it impossible to manufacture ammunition, it becomes impossible for civilians to own it. Mind you, such prohibitions do not apply to government. In fact, under the Arms Trade Treaty, the national governments of member countries are given monopoly control of the entire ammunition stockpile of that country.
Hope you are stocking up on ammo."

****PLEASE READ BELOW
Look, I didn't list all the parts prices because I am not trying to be tacky. If you want a cheap AR-15, go to extreme outfitters and buy one of their del ton uppers for $550. This BCM upper is one that you could rely on for your life. There are BCM rifles out there with 20,000 rounds thru them that are showing no signs of barrel and accuracy degradation. This upper has 200 rounds thru it, and I know just how reliable it is. I am looking to start a different project and/or pay some bills. I will entertain reasonable offers and will ignore unreasonable ones. Serious offers only please. Cash in hand, no trades.

Review by Old Tree Dude on 5/19/14
Quality	
I have owned two of these for about 3 years now. Easy to conceal, easy to carry, easy to shoot. I have had two friends of mine look at them that are both long time gunsmiths. They were both impressed on how well they were built. The cost is very reasonable. You can pay a lot more and not get better quality. All my grandkids, nieces and nephews kids have fired these with 158 grain 38's and they all love the pistol.
Shooting the Range 
Review by mike on 2/15/14
Quality	
Took the Windicator .357 to the range today and fired 100 rounds. First 3 of 6 hit dead center of bulls eye center.This revolver is well balanced, with very little recoil. and accurate right out of the box. I plan to paint a white dot on front sight post to help me see and aim better, but it is accurate and fun to shoot. EAA has sold me on their quality for the money!

Item 4A (305gr. Hard Cast gas Checked LFN) is designed for super deep penetration on large game. The big flat nose keeps the bullet penetrating straight and thus deep. You can expect a good three + feet of penetration in normal flesh and bone. The flat nose also does considerably more damage than a round nosed type of bullet as the flat nose cuts and smashes it way through living matter, while round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through matter, doing much less damage along the bullet’s path and achieving more shallow penetration due to getting sideways while “slipping and sliding” through matter.
You’ll note my below velocities from over-the-counter revolvers and rifles.

1.       Ruger Bisley cut down to 6 inches------1328 fps
2.       Ruger Red Hawk 5.5 inch-----------------1331 fps
3.       Marlin 1894 18.5 inch----------------------1779 fps
Item 4A is recommended for all STEEL revolvers and rifles on today’s market. It is not suitable for scandium or aluminum alloy revolvers."
