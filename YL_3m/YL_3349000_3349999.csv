Precision-rifled, chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel ensures accuracy and longevity.

308,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3349308,For Sale:  M1895 Dutch Mannlicher,"Athens, Huntsville, Alabama",$ 400,"Listed On: Sunday, August 3, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm looking to sell my M1895 Dutch Mannlicher made in 1918 at the Hembrug Factory in Luxembourg. It was originally chambered in 6.5x53r, but sometime during it's life, it was rechambered in .303 British. It was made for the Dutch Home Army in 1918, and served with them until it was sent to the Dutch East Indies to be used to arm the indigenous forces and what was left of the Dutch Army in the Pacific Colonies. This rifle doesn't have an import mark so one can speculate how it came into the country. It could have come into the country before 1968 when import marks were required, or brought home by a GI who served in the Pacific, but there's no proof of the latter. I have not fired it, but the bore is clean. Free of pitting, rust, and debris. The rifling is strong for it's age. The wood is beat up, gouged, dinged, scratched, and chipped, but it can be fired safely. It has seen some hard use in its life. The finish above the wood line is rust free, it just has the normal patina for being in the Pacific theater. Below the wood line is a mystery, I can see some pitting, but that is normal, and will not hinder the functionality of the rifle. I cannot get the action screws loose, even after two days of being soaked in Aero Kroil, and it looks as if someone before me has tried to get them loose as well and they began to booger up the screws but they're not destroyed. The action is surprisingly smooth, I wish all my rifles were this smooth! It can be fired, but only in single shot, for it takes a Mannlicher style stripper clip that isn't for the .303 British round. This is a unique, and hard to find rifle. Feel free to ask any questions and I am happy to send specific pictures. Email me, or text me at 256-43one-42five7. I'm asking $400 OBO for this rifle. Again, this is a uncommon rifle.

This is the IDF model which is exactly the same as what is issued to the Israeli Defense Forces except it's semi-auto instead of full-auto.  It includes an integrated Mepro 21 reflex sight with a triangle reticle lit by fiber optics (during the day) & tritium (at night).  The sight itself sells for $475-500, so $1800 is an absolute steal for this rifle.

Check out the details at the IWI website: http://www.iwi.us/TAVOR/TAVOR-TSIDF16

It's in perfect condition (basically new) and comes with everything that came from the factory, including the original box, manuals, unused IWI 30-round magazine, and unused cleaning kit - have plenty of cleaning supplies so didn't even open this one.

I'm not desperate for the cash, not really interested in trades, and won't take less than $1800.  Even at that price, I'm seriously thinking about just keeping it and enjoying it for a few years!

Likely overkill with the Laserlyte but a good cheap addition for any other rail.  You can purchase the built in Flash/Laser units from Rockwell for $219 as well.  UTAS built in the selector switch but gave the option for add-on before or after purchase.  I've  got an email into Rockwell for written proof of its DOB however verified this from the original owner and a Rockwell rep as well.  This is also evident by the magnesium and other later additions which are present throughout the shotgun.  Early reviews weren't real good for the UTAS back about 8 years ago however as of 2012 they've turned a wicked looking shotgun into a wicked performing shotgun as well.  This has been verified by a range test at my local ShootSmart performing various quick fire tests (range allowed) except the 360 angle fire.  I personally wasn't comfortable shooting upside down in an indoor range.  :)

If you have any spec questions feel free to ask or simply Google it.  Other than the early versions they really don't have any differences as UTAS makes required changes as they go so no such thing as ""revisions"".  I'm not much of a shotgun guy only preferring one near by for home defense if necessary.  The UTAS however takes ""home defense"" to a whole new level.  Being more into hand guns and Tactical long guns I'm looking more for a trade than anything however I'll entertain any decent offer.  The worst either party can say is ""no"".  I'm in no hurry to offload so please keep it respectful and I promise to do the same.  I'm open to cash+trade or trade+cash from my end if needed etc.  I enjoy owning and shooting guns and trading is about the best way to accomplish this without going broke.  Have a great day!

Great Pro Trigger System allows for DA/SA Double Action/Single Action. If you don't know what that means. I'll try to explain.  When you shoot double action (picture a revolver's hammer), as you squeeze the trigger, the hammer moves backwards to a point (one action), then when it reaches that point, it slams forward (second action of the Double action) onto the bullet or a fireing pin which then hits the bullet. Trouble is, as you're squeezing to make the hammer go back, you're also moving your aim around the target. When it finally slams forward, you are sometimes off the target.  That's why many people miss or shoot poorly. Now, Single Action is when the hammer is already pulled back and the next slight squeeze of the trigger makes it slam forward and the bullet goes off. If you were on your target, you will probably hit your target.  People around you say ""Wow!"".  Well, maybe not, but it is more fun to shoot well, than not.

Price is $350 and accept cash or bitcoin.

Sale will require a Bill of Sale (which I will bring) and legal ID so will need Florida Drivers License or Florida Carry Conceal Permit. Must currently live in Florida and must be legally allowed to purchase a firearm in the state of Florida. 

This has been my primary conceal carry for about 3 years. I am the original owner and probably only 200 to 300 rounds shot through it. Only time it has been shot is a periodic trip to the range where I shoot maybe 30 or 40 rounds at each visit and cleaned immediately when I got home. Comes with original box, Taurus Security System keys, and all original paperwork Taurus includes with their guns. I have a basic pocket holster that this gun has been in since I bought the gun so it has molded and fits this gun perfectly and will include at no cost if you want it.

This is a perfect conceal carry revolver. Small enough to fit in a jeans pocket but yet powerful enough to stop whatever is unfortunate to be on the other side. It is a .357 but of course also shoots the .38 so gives you the choice of whether you want to shoot a lighter .38 load or the more powerful .357. Whenever I shoot this at the range I always get a few ""oooohhhss and aaaaahhss"". Packs a POWERFUL punch in such a small package!!

The action is buttery smooth, and the fit and finish is just incredible.  I've taken it to the range 3 times and shot less than 200 rounds through it without a single malfunction.  Shoots smooth and straight, really nothing not to like.

I hate to part with it, but need to make room in the safe (and the budget) for some new stuff.

It's in perfect condition (basically new) and comes with everything that came from the factory, including the original box, manual, 10-round magazine, unused sling, oil bottle, cleaning rod, and cleaning kit - don't use a sling and have plenty of cleaning supplies so didn't open any of this stuff.  I'll also throw in a couple of new 30-round ProMag magazines to get you started.

I'm not desperate for the cash, and am in no hurry to sell so no lowball offers please. I live in Holly Springs, but will make the transfer at Fuquay Gun & Gold (where I buy most of my guns)."

Gun is in good shape, shows normal use i.e. rub marks on stock (pictured)  No gouges or cuts anywhere on gun.  It is however missing the front fiber optic sight.

These guns have the Armorlokt coating which basically wraps the gun in polymer, making it extremely resistant to adverse conditions. 

 It has a 28"" forged barrel which shoots a real nice pattern.  It is also aggressively textured on the forearm which was great when wearing gloves last duck season.  Shoots everything from 3.5"" down, and the Supercell recoil pad DEFINITELY takes away a lot of the push from the magnum shells.  Has the original factory Modified choke in it along with the plug, will also come with an extra Full choke ($30 value) purchased last year.  

Im selling this on behalf of my brother who purchased it last year, and is looking to upgrade to a semi auto this year.

It's got all the factory parts (different size back straps, trigger components and barrel) along with an Apex Trigger competition trigger kit installed, and a Storm Lake stainless match barrel.  Comes with 7 magazines, 2 magazine holders, and if you're a lefty - a brand new Praetor Defense OWB holster.  This gun shoots straight and great and is ready for competition.  I got it on a trade and it's just not quite my cup of tea.  

Here's a breakdown:
- Gun new retail is $650 (don't forget tax and FFL!)
https://www.rainierarms.com/?page=shop/detail&product_id=4509
- Storm Lake match barrel - $165
http://www.storm-lake.com/products/barrel#top
- Apex trigger installed - ($100 for the parts alone)
https://apextactical.com/store/product-info.php?pid36.html
- 5 extra magazines ($35 each new, $175) a total of 7 mags
- 2 magazine holders, 1 is Bladetech and the other is Blackhawk I believe ($50)
- 1 left hand Praetor Defense OWB holster ($55)

That's a total of about $1,200 bucks not counting taxes, fees, shipping, etc.  Obviously the gun is used (but still in GREAT condition, no slide marks or anything) and I feel my price reflects that.  

I'm willing to consider trades/partial trades + cash for:
1) 1911 of equal value (I'd really love a SIG Scorpion, must have ambi safety)
2) Glock 17 (preferably a Gen 4, but will consider a Gen 3) + cash
3) EOTech or Aimpoint Pro + cash
4) Left handed bolt gun in .308 (Hell, could I get lucky enough to find a left handed Ruger Gunsite Scout?!)
5) Surprise me... I'm constantly amazed at what I'll say OK to.

***NOTE*** I will require a peek at your WA DL and CPL as well as a DOL pistol transfer form to complete the transaction.

Up for sale is a Russian made, Arsenal SGL-20 AK-47 in 7.62x39. The Russian guns are no longer importable under the new Russian sanctions. I bought this gun new in 2008 and have shot about 1000 non-corrosive rounds through it. Originally it had all plum furniture and retains the plum lower hand guard. I have religiously maintained this gun. People say AK's aren't accurate, but this gun typically shoots 2-3"" groups at 100 yards. The gun does show some signs of use, especially around the mag well, but this is cosmetic only.

This also comes with a lot of accessories:
-Bonesteel folder w/integrated AR tube. Any mil-spec AR stock will work. Folds to the right.(In my opinion, this is the best Folder on the market, bar none)
-Magpul MOE stock
-Tapco SAW grip with storage
-Ultimak gas tube rail
-Bushnell TRS-25 red dot scope with 3moa dot. Sets low enough to get a lower 1/3 co-witness
-45 degree off set mount for flashlight attachment
-CNC warrior Bulgarian style flash hider (US Made)
-6 E. German 30 round, ridge back steel mags in fair to good condition
-2 Chinese flat back steel 30 round magazines in good condition
-1 Bulgarian Circle 10 30 round polymer Waffle mag in good condition 
-1 Magpul 30 round polymer MOE magazine
-Midway USA soft case, Olive Drab, shows some wear but still works well
-IBX Tactical Kydex belt mounted mag carrier for Circle 10 mag in Woodland Digital Camo (MARPAT copy)
-Eagle Industries USA Made, 6-mag AK Chest Rig
-Original US-made K-Var Plum stock with trapdoor, original plum gas tube and muzzle nut thread protector
