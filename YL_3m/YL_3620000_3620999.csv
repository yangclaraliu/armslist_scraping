I will be honest in that the ammo is hard to find, but is available.  The cost od the ammo is not bad, I paid $45 for the box that is included with the rifle.  Adjustable rear sight for longer range shooting.  Not a lot of options for trades for a $300 gun but I will take offers, firearms only. Cash talks !!"

This is a great ultra light carry gun for a .357.. I carried this ultra light powerhouse for about a year or so several years back, and since has become a bedside/nightstand gun.. She needs to be put back into service protecting someone daily..lol.. Also makes a great truck/car gun since it's ultra reliable, cheap, light and powerful. Im the original owner, Comes with everything from factory including two different grips, one is a two finger boot style grip for concealed carry, and the other is a full three finger grip.  This is very easy shooting for the light 16oz weight, the polymer seems to absorb some of the recoil compared to my all steel revolvers. My wife learned to shoot on this with .38spl's, they recoil like .22's in this gun.  I could throw in a custom kydex holster with leather backing, and I also have a couple speed strips and quite a bit of .357 fmj and Hollowpoints if you are interested..for a little more..  I don't need to sell this just wanting another 9mm.. The gun is not in perfect condition as it's been used, but it's in very nice condition and always cleaned and lubed after shooting. The double action is heavy as it should be on a carry gun, but the single action is very light and crisp. Also the fiber optic front sight makes finding the front sight easy. Text with any questions or for more pics... 317-361-zero,five,nine,four....or reply through armslist.. I check it a few times daily...Make me a reasonable cash offer or 9mm trade ( I will add cash for the right trade).."

complete with everything it came with new
I traded for this and some cash at the gun show a couple weeks ago thinking this would be a good gun for my wife, but, it does not fit her hand comfortably .....so, here it is.

it has not been shot at all and is brand new......would keep it myself but I already have a nice snub 38

the cheapest I seen them selling for was  $435 plus taxes
cheapest online price is $415 plus shipping and ffl transfer fees......

so I will sell for  $400 cash -   buyer must have permit to purchase and driver license

Ok, for sale is a vintage Snap On Toolbox Top & Bottom complete with Tons of Mac, Matco, Snap On, Blackhawk & Craftsman tools. I would not even begin to put a price on these tools. However these we're my fathers tools and he has recently passed away. There is too many tools to list. There are every size of socket, wrench, line wrenches, clamps, ratchets, ratchet wrenches as well as many other tools in this box. I wanted to keep these tools as kind of a legacy of my father but have no room. The Boxes alone run from 600-700 for the top box as it is rare and you probably wont even find one on google & bottom box ive seen anywhere from 800 to 1300 without tools of course. Can only post 3 pictures. Txt for more pictures.

Comes with original box, 2 magazines, and rear sight adjustment tool.

The Kel-Tec PF-9 is a 9 mm caliber, recoil operated, locked breech, double action only, semi-automatic pistol based on (and sharing many parts with) Kel-Tec’s earlier P-11 and P-3AT models. Kel-Tec claims the PF-9 is the flattest and lightest 9 mm pistol ever mass-produced. It was designed as a concealment and backup weapon for law enforcement and for civilian concealed carry. 

The PF-9 is manufactured in Cocoa, Florida, by Kel-Tec CNC Industries. Featuring extensive use of CNC manufacturing techniques, its six main components consist of the barrel, slide, frame, grip, trigger group, and magazine. The barrel is manufactured of SAE/AISI 4140 steel hardened to 48 RHC, and the slide is constructed of the same steel. The frame, which houses the trigger group, consists of a solid machined 7075-T56 aluminum billet. A transfer bar system connects the hammer and trigger. A hammer block safety is incorporated which helps prevent accidental discharge if the pistol is dropped. The long double-action-only trigger pull provides an additional safety feature. The pistol includes a slide hold-open feature which locks the slide in its rearmost position after the last round is fired. The grip is made of DuPont ST-8018 polymer and holds the steel, 7-round, single-column magazine. The sights consist of a fixed front blade and a windage-adjustable notched rear sight. Three white dots highlight the sights for optimum visibility in low-light conditions.
