The semi-auto hunting rifles VEPR are designed for medium-sized and big games. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). 

VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market 

The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope. 

All VEPR rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory."

And my bills were more than I'd expected so...

It has a cross-bar safety, a blued finish, the standard walnut stock, and a Micro-Groove barrel. (Wikipedia says ""in the mid-1990s, Marlin changed the .357 and .44 barrels from 12-groove-or-more 'Micro-Groove' rifling to 6-groove 'Ballard' style rifling."") The only things wrong with this gun are that the folding leaf rear sight is broken off, and now there are a couple ugly but not fatal scratches on/near the sight from where I tried and failed to install a replacement (see photo). I figured out how to avoid scratching it again but not how to get the flimsy little plastic thing on without breaking it; then again the forums lead me to think a lot of folks buy yourselves niftier sights or install a scope anyway, so instead of going through that again I'm just asking less than I'd planned. (The rear leaf sight is available online for about $8 +S&H if you want that; I still have the little sight-raiser thing.)

Note that making some cash off this is important but I might accept a trade for an equivalent Marlin 1894 in a more manageable .357 magnum, a .45 ACP 1911 pistol, a .357 magnum revolver with a 4"" barrel, or perhaps an SKS or AK-47 style rifle in good shape. A gun I haven't thought to list, or a partial-value trade with cash, is also worth suggesting. 

I'll want to draw up some document, and I won't be taking checks, credit cards, first-born sons, suckling goats, etc. And you'll need to show me your valid KY driver's license or state ID, and bring a photocopy for my records; if you want I'll reciprocate. A CCDW would also help by establishing you're legally allowed to own a gun (but that's optional; I don't have one yet). This will most likely be the only firearm I'll ever circulate, so I want to do it right."

See below:

3MR   trigger functions in a standard semi-auto mode with a 4.5lb trigger when the safety switch is in the standard Fire position. When you switch the selector switch back to where full auto would be on an M4/M16 you get the same 4.5lb semi-auto trigger, and the action of the bolt resets the trigger for you. All you have to worry about is pulling the trigger for the next shot.

The build quality is superb. USA manufactured utilizing CNC and EDM processes to produce the parts. The quality control process is top notch.

TAC-CON says the trigger is capable of a 600 rounds per minute (RPM) rate of fire. Most shooters will   be in the 400-500 RPM range,   Short travel distance and assisted reset means you have to do very little movement with your trigger hand.

615,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3218615,"For Sale:  Ishapore Lee Enfield  -  1943, CAI Imported - No. 1 Mk. III","NE Portland, Portland, Oregon",$ 300,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 17, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Hello Armslist,

     The gun looks to be in 'Very Good' condition, the only rust I can see is some light surface rust on the front sight; a good steel wool scrubbing would see it disappear. Other than that, the gun is in 'Very Good' condition; I would say 80% of the bluing is still in place; I personally think the wear adds some charm to the rifle.

     The stock is pretty beat up, as one would expect of a military surplus rifle. It has been initialed on the stock 'C.F.'. There is also copper wiring wrapped around the rifle in two places. I am told by fellow collectors that these are attempts to strengthen the wood, as the rifle would be used to launch grenades, which had a brutal kick. So much so, that with normal bands, guns would shake themselves apart in a few weeks of combat without the added support of the wiring. This rifle in question even has an entire steel bolt under the rear wiring for this purpose, indicating that it was likely a grenadier's weapon. A tell-tale sign of this rifle's use in northern Africa is the 'pitch' or 'tar-grease' found in the nooks and crannies of the rifle; when soldiers ran out of traditional lubricants in the dry desert, they resorted to pilfering their vehicle's grease stores to keep the weapons firing.


     I'm in no hurry to sell this one. I haven't even had a chance to shoot it yet, but I will wait and see if someone else would like to have the first go. This is chambered in .303 British. It has been on my 'cleaning shelf' for a while now; I have worked on it on and off the past few weeks to clean it up. The barrel is almost perfect in terms of rifling, slight pitting near the receiver, but nothing to affect the performance of the rifle.

     This No. 1 is an awesome piece; early Enfields were some of the most accurate rifles built in the 20th century.


     Feel free to email me anytime with questions,

I am dowtown Orlando during days and Oviedo, nights and eves.
I bought on locally while mine was on backorder, now I have one too many.
I am not a dealer. These list for $495, I am selling for $400,used for one outing and cleaned.
This is for the Trigger, Selector switch, ATF letter, box, the whole package ready to go.

See below:

3MR   trigger functions in a standard semi-auto mode with a 4.5lb trigger when the safety switch is in the standard Fire position. When you switch the selector switch back to where full auto would be on an M4/M16 you get the same 4.5lb semi-auto trigger, and the action of the bolt resets the trigger for you. All you have to worry about is pulling the trigger for the next shot.

The build quality is superb. USA manufactured utilizing CNC and EDM processes to produce the parts. The quality control process is top notch.

TAC-CON says the trigger is capable of a 600 rounds per minute (RPM) rate of fire. Most shooters will   be in the 400-500 RPM range,   Short travel distance and assisted reset means you have to do very little movement with your trigger hand.

Developed through direct feedback from Special Forces teams stationed around the world, the new Taurus 24/7 OSS"" is one of the most advanced firearms in the history of pistol making. Built to meet and/or exceed all requirements laid down by USSOCOM (United States Special Operations Command) for its new sidearm, this extreme duty pistol offers unprecedented reliability, durability, accuracy and ergonomic functionality. Capable of firing thousands of failure-free rounds in virtually any environment, whether it be jungle humidity and mud, desert heat and sand, or arctic cold and ice, we packed the 24/7 OSS with features that real-world professionals were asking for. Bad guys beware-here comes the 24/7 OSS in .45 ACP, .40 cal. and 9mm.

Because of its innovative design, the SRS takes up less rail space while maintaining the durability expected from Trijicon. The shorter housing eliminates the tube-effect typical of other sealed reflex sights. Featuring a large 28mm aperture, the Trijicon SRS provides a massive field of view for quicker target engagements. The 1.75 MOA dot is small enough for precision and with 10 brightness settings it can be bright enough for any speed. Finally, the Trijicon SRS features dual power sources — an innovative solar cell assisted by a single AA battery.

As a result this shotgun has less than 50 shells through it, and is in as good a shape as you could ask. Paid $700 retail for it.

Some pointers:

* It is styled as a vietnam-era AR-15, with detachable carry handle to reveal a picatinny rail. Handle includes sights, as is typical. I haven't tested this but I am told that stock AR-10 parts work really well when customizing this shotgun.

* It currently has the stock heavier spring option, which makes target rounds cause FTEs; It works flawlessly with heavier loads and can load up to 3"" magnum shells; I have fired a few of these and they cycle without issue. There is a lighter spring you can put into the action that will fix the issue with target loads, and last I checked it was about $10-$20.

Price is firm. Please don't waste my time with lowball offers; I'm not selling this gun for under half it's new value just because it's been fired <50 times."

913,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3218913,For Sale:  Lyman Turbo Sonic Case Cleaner,"SE Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska",$ 90,"Listed On: Friday, June 27, 2014",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Lightly used Lyman Turbo Sonic  Ultrasonic Case Cleaner complete with Hornady 32oz case cleaning solution and Hornady parts cleaning solution. I used this sparingly and have decided to use a new tumbler instead. If you are familiar with sonic cleaners, this does a great job of making brass look like new but you still have to tumble to make shiny.  The unit features a heated tank that when combined with a specially formulated case cleaning solution delivers superior case cleaning including removing residue from the inside of the case and primer pockets. Ultrasonic action creates ""Microjets"" that take off the most stubborn carbon from brass cases, gun parts and other equipment that will fit in the machine. 
This is a $150 value if purchased separately. Will sell separately for: Lyman Ultrasonic-$80, Hornady cleaners $20 each.

Technical Information:

Voltage:110 Volt or 220 Volt
Bowl Capacity: Up to 900 - 9mm Luger Cases 
Solution Included: Yes 
Solution Available: Yes-Hornady One Shot Sonic Cleaner Ultrasonic Case Cleaning Solution, Hornady One Shot Sonic Cleaner Ultrasonic Firearms Cleaning Solution 

Special Notes: 
•Lyman suggest only using the approved cleaners above in the sonic cleaner as other cleaners could damage brass or firearms parts
•Ultrasonic Cleaning removes fouling from cases it does not polish cases. Reloader looking for polished cases still need to run cleaned cases through a tumbler to achieve a shiny finish
•Cases require dry time after cleaning prior to loading."

I've fired 20 rounds through this gun, and it was purchased brand new. I don't have the time or opportunity to take it out to a proper range (my local range has a max distance of 20 yards) so I'm offloading. A few notes

* The scope has not been zeroed in properly; I was in the process of doing so at a shorter range, zeroing for 100 yards by putting a target at either 15 or 20 yards (I can't remember which, but at the time my research showed that the ballistic arc for whatever distance I was at was the same place at that distance as it would be at 100 yards for .308); at the time I ran out of ammo, I was looking at the gun shooting about right for left/right, but a couple inches low, which at the time I remember thinking about 8 clicks should fix. But I am by no means an expert.

* Scope is x4-x12 and mil-dot.

* I can throw in a case for an extra $50, but otherwise you will need your own."
