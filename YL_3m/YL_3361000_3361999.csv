I put 9 rounds through the rifle. Shoots like a dream, and I really like it. Not planning on hunting this year with it, which was the sole purpose of purchase. I already have a high-quality bolt, so I'm not interested in any rifles. I'm including a sling, hard case, and 2 1/2 boxes of ammunition

If the deal is right, I'm willing to add cash. Worst I can say is no, so if you're looking for a high-quality, and accurate rifle; Look no further, these things are tack drivers and will stay on target for 400+ yards.

I have an ar pistol so I kind of makes less sense for me to have this. Bought it new after looking at it thinking it was pretty neat. Nice gun I'm just trying to keep the calibers more...American? Shall we say. 

The gun is made in Poland at the Radom plant I believe, and sense it's a pistol 922r is not necessary which means it was not build by cai or I.o inc. the pistol is still nib / unfired. Comes with 4 magazine kits and 270-280 rounds or surplus ammo.The ammo comes in 3 70 round packs (unopened) and I have another box that was opened but I never counted. Think the unopened box is 60-70 rounds as well. I believe this is the hot smg ammo. All the stories of 7.62x25 defeating (pistol) body armor basically stems from the ppsh rather than the tt-33. The gun weighs about 6-7 lbs loaded with 35 rounds. The stock unlike earlier versions of the same gun is pinned inside,rather than welded shut outside. 2 reasons this is better In my opinion. One, it looks aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Instead of a crappy looking weld on the outside, it just looks like the stock is folded. Two if you decide to sbr this gun, you could do quicker and easier without the need to re-blue anything.

Not in a rush to sell but like I said I have an ar pistol that I the same size but lighter. I like the nostalgia, but I think I'd rather have the cash

For Sale:  (1) very good condition Martini Henry VR Enfield 1881 Rifle in British 303 Caliber, (1) Martini Enfield 1818 Flintlock Musket that was hand made into a Camel Rifle with beautiful inlaid pearl, brass - absolutely one of a kind; (1) 1860 Enfield Pistol and (2) Middle Eastern two-edged curved dagger is one of the most recognizable weapon forms. Typically it is known by the Arab term djanbīyya sometimes Anglicised as ""jambiya"", or also often the Arabic term khandjar, but these curved daggers are found across the Middle East. Curved daggers have a long history, the famous sica  of the ancient Balkans which spread around the Mediterranean in the Roman era is similarly curved, but was sharp only on the inner curved edge. The earliest djanbīyya seem to be 16th century and found in Turkey and Iran, although its true origins may in fact be Arabia. The curve makes it very good for most styles of knife-fighting (which I discuss in an earlier blog), but it would probably be a problematic weapon for a thrust through armour. This may explain the spread of the form in the gunpowder age, when armour was less common on the battlefield. Essentially it is ideal for a draw-cut across unprotected flesh, or a thrust into unprotected vitals.

Martini Enfield 1881 Rifle in .303 Caliber 
Part of the reason we started this website was so we could write good thorough descriptions....I used to get frustrated with the text limits imposed by the high traffic sites and having you guys, my customers, not getting enough information to make informed decisions about what you were buying.  Now, we have the opportunity, or perhaps ""street-corner soap box"" to provide you guys with enough details and then-some. I'll be the first to admit that sometimes these descriptions can get a little overly verbose but please consider this to be more from enthusiasm than long-winded. These are more than just old guns to us; they are part of our history and if information isn't passed on, this history will be lost. We realize that in today's world, many of you don't have time to visit museums, travel to shows, or purchase expensive books...just look at the popularity of the History Channel.  We hope that you will find these descriptions interesting and informative and remember, this is history you can do more than just look at, you can own it as an investment!  

Here is an interesting variation of the Martini which is not often encountered. This old Martini originally built by London Small Arms Company in 1881 as a Mark III Martini Henry in Caliber 577-450.  After serving the armed forces of the British Emprire and the Crown for several years, this old veteran became obsolete in the early 1890's with the advent of the new .303 Caliber Bolt Action Lee Metford and Lee Enfield rifles.  Queen Victoria must have not been able to bear the thought of throwing away thousands upon thousands of perfectly good Martini Henry's so an ingenious plan was devised to rebuild and convert these Martinis over to .303 caliber.  These new .303's were sent off to the Colonies for a few more good years of loyal service to the Crown until they were retired at the turn of the 20th century.

MARKINGS: If you know what to look for, the markings on these old Martinis tell quite a story...Ian Skennerton is probably the best source for deciphering the labyrinth of markings the British military used on their weaponry...I'm not the best interpreter but I will do my best to translate. This rifle  has loads of good markings, all with a story to tell.  This rifle tells me it went to Enfield in 1895 for its rebuild and conversion and that it spent some time as a .303 in service with the Colony of Victoria. The LEFT side of the receiver is marked with the Crown Cypher over V.R. (that means Queen Victoria Regina), over ENFIELD (the manufacturer), over 1895 (Its Conversion Date), followed by the small cypher proof with broad arrow (viewers marking, I think), over M.E. .303 (Martini Enfield Caliber .303) followed by roman numeral ""I"" (1st variation). The RIGHT side of the receiver bears its original LSA markings from when this rifle was a Mark III and dated 1881.  As typical of London Small Arms markings, the original set of right-side receiver markings are extremely light and due to the Enfield rebuild in 1895, the crown and VR are now wraith-like shadows from their previous life. I wish LSA had put stronger markings on their guns but they usually get their message across as the markings still tell their story. The designations, Mark III, and production date are crystal clear.  The STOCK has some good markings with Victoria ownership markings ""VIC"" inside of a circle.  The Enfield Rebuild Cartouche is clear with the Mark I .303 designation over its serviceability designation of 1 (One being the highest).  The brass roundel has no unit designations.  Opposing broad arrows on both the stock and receiver designate this rifle was retired from military service."

Named after Israel’s Golani Brigade which first tested this rifle, the design of the original military Galil rifle (and thus the Golani Sporter) was a cross largely between the AK-47, the M16 and the FN-FAL. Essentially the rifle’s designer, Israel Galil, attempted to incorporate the legendary reliability of the AK-47 while using the .223 cartridge. The result was the adoption of Galil’s design by the Israeli military in 1972.

These two fine pistols we have in stock ready to go. 

First is a AAC $3200 

 Built in collaboration with Advanced Armament Corporation, the new AAC Suppressor Ready pistol is one that you will cherish for a lifetime. This one is not just another pretty face in the crowd, but rather an all business gun that comes ready to use with or without an Advanced Armament Suppressor. A steel thread-protector comes standard to protect your barrel when the suppressor is not in use.

Available through Nighthawk Custom, its Preferred Dealers or from Advanced Armament Corporation, this custom handgun is loaded with proprietary features. The first to catch your eye will be the lightening cuts on the top of the slide, mainspring housing and front strap that match the Advanced Armament Ti-Rant suppressor. As you can see from the pictures, it makes for a very attractive firearm.

The slide sports new Heinie Ledge Straight-Eight Suppressor Sights which are only available through Nighthawk Custom. These sights are designed to give you a complete sight picture over the top of the suppressor. The distinct ""ledge"" rear sight allows you to cock the weapon off of a hard surface if needed.

FEATURES
Proprietary Cuts on the Front Strap, Mainspring Housing and Slide Top Forged Frame and Slide.
Nighthawk Custom Match-Grade Blacked-Out Threaded Barrel with Thread Protector Medium Length Lightweight Match-Grade Blacked-Out Trigger
Ultra-thin Aluma-Grips with Nighthawk Custom™ logo
Advanced Armament Corporation Logo on both sides of the Slide behind the rear cocking serrations
Forged Slide Stop cut flush with chamfered frame
Complete De-Horn for easy carry

Next is a custom Ported T3 $2950.00
The Ultimate Concealed Carry Pistol: We designed this little pistol to allow users to pack the powerful 45acp in a small package, but due to its popularity we now offer it in 9mm and 40 S&W. A 4.25"" bushing barrel allows field strip anywhere, and keeps the weight down when compared to pistols of comparable size with tapered cone barrels. Already loaded with options, we find that most customers want it just the way it is.

When it comes time to choose your everyday carry gun there is a lot to consider. You need something that is reliable, accurate, and easy to wear all day. You need something that you can enjoy shooting a lot, because there is no substitute for practice. That's where the T3 comes in. We designed this pistol to be pleasing to the eye, but also to be a workhorse that can stand up to thousands and thousands of rounds.

The T3 has the best features for any gun its size. The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles really add to the looks as well. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius.

Another consideration is weight. The T3 actually weighs one ounce lighter than most officer size 1911s. This makes the T3 the first choice for an all-day carry pistol.

Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eights Night Sights are standard. The mainspring housing, as well as the rear of the slide, are horizontally serrated to match. This feature also helps prevent snags on silk lined jackets and coats that checkering often causes. The top of the slide is also serrated to reduce glare. A Nighthawk Custom© lightweight aluminum trigger that has been blacked-out using Perma Kote™ breaks between 3.5 and 4 lbs with no creep. When you put all of these features in one package, you come up with the finest carry gun you can own. All you add is practice."

Everything internally has been polished including hammer/plunge, sear, guide rode, barrel bushing, slide hold open, trigger, safety, grip safety along with the left spring retaining mechanism, the barrel, slide, and firing pin. The leaf spring is the only thing that hasn't been polished on the entire gun. When I got the gun it was in really terrible looking shape the blue was half gone and it has some massive scratches and pitting going on. Because I'm not a professional gun smith I didn't feel safe removing the pitting because of the amount of material removal that would be required. So the slide does still have some visible pitting on it but it's a carry/range gun so it doesn't really affect it. When I had the gun apart I went ahead and lighten the trigger just a little it's somewhere in the 4.5 pound range. I haven't touched the sear/hammer (1911s require trickery to be done properly). I also carved the grips from walnut and fitted to this gun. The gun is oiled and greased on the rails it's ready to be shot. I'll throw in a box of ammo for who ever picks it up."

435,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3361435,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE 10mm - 155 gr.

This is a full power 10MM load that is within SAAMI spec and is thus safe for use in ANY/ALL 10mm pistols. Loading this long-for-weight all copper bullet in the 10MM case, causes powder capacity limitations that we do not experience with shorter/heavier lead alloy bullets and thus our advertised 1500 fps velocity cannot be reached, regardless of how may internal ballistics charts tell us that we should be able to launch a 155gr. bullet @ 1500 fps from a 5 inch barrel, that long light weight bullet simply uses too much of the available case capacity to do so. See our below real world velocities fired from real world pistols, not extra long laboratory barrels, that give false high velocity readings. With Buffalo Bore ammo, you’ll achieve the velocity reading we advertise in the real world where it matters when your life and the lives of your loved ones may hang in the balance.

1455 fps - Custom 1911 with Nowlin 5 inch barrel
1429 fps - Colt Delta Elite, 5 inch barrel
1401 fps - Glock Mod 20,  4.6 inch barrel
If you are firing this 10MM ammo from an auto loader and are experiencing high extreme velocity spreads, it is not the ammo. Full power 10MM ammunition has always generated enough pressure to require a pretty stiff recoil spring in your handgun—this of course depends on many variables like your particular slide weight, etc. When the cartridge fires, it generates enough pressure/recoil to prematurely open your breech face in some guns. When this happens, the opening breech has an effect on the burn rate of the powder. This can result in some fairly high extreme velocity spreads. If you are experiencing extreme velocity spreads (in excess of 50 fps) simply install a stiffer recoil spring. For example, I have an original Colt Delta Elite. This Colt, with the factory spring runs extreme spreads of about 35 fps, with this load. I am happy with an ES of 35 fps, so I leave the Delta spring alone. My custom built Para Ordinance 1911, with a Nowlin barrel, runs extreme spreads of about 70 fps, so I installed a recoil spring that was roughly 4 lbs heavier and the extreme spread dropped to about 35 fps. (Wolff Gun Springs—REDACTED-- www.gunsprings.com ) My Glock mod 20 was running extreme spreads of nearly 100 fps, so I installed a 6 lb heavier recoil spring and brought the ES down to 50 fps. The folks at Wolff will tell you what the factory spring rating is for your particular pistol, so you’ll know where to start. I should note, these high ES #'s really don’t matter in the real world as they do not affect accuracy or reliability. The firearms industry fixed this ES problem by watering down 10MM ammo, to the point that most 10MM ammo made by major manufacturers is pretty weak, but it does not open your breech face early…... If weak ammo is the “fix” you want, most any 10MM ammo made by major manufacturers will do. If you wish to shoot our full power 10MM ammo, you can choose to live with the high ES (you’ll only know if you are getting high ES #’s if you use a chronograph) or you can install a stiffer recoil spring.

This load was accurate and reliable in our three test pistols."

I also make custom cornhole boards for 250.  The price includes everything but bags (decals, paint, different schemes, etc.). A lot of places say 175 but there charge extra for everything but the wood and dont do custom paint schemes and they use cheap wood that just does not look the same as the good wood. This is a set that will last you a long time. I can make almost anything you need as long as there is a decal. They are made with 1/2 inch Oak or maple plywood and top line 2X4s and hand painted then covered with three coats of urethane so they will last a long time. The legs fold under the boards for easy storage. I enjoy making them so you wont find the quality of these boards for the price anywhere else.

Owned a little over a year and used 5-6 times. Sits in the safe so would like to see someone else get some use out of it. 

Built to offer the same battle proven ruggedness as other Aimpoint
products, the Micro T-1™ is able to perform under extreme conditions
while adding negligible weight to your weapon. Suitable for use on
Rifles, Carbines, Shotguns, Sub Machineguns and Handguns, the
Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a stand-alone sight, and because it
weighs less than 4 ounces including the integrated Picatinny mount, it
can easily be “piggybacked” on top of larger magnifying scopes, night
vision, or thermal imaging optics.

The performance of the Micro T-1 is optimized for use with all
generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for
3rd generation night vision technology. Aimpoint’s unique band-pass
coating on the front lens gives the highest possible dot brightness, while
providing the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd
generation NVD. With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 day light settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready
for use around-the-clock."

This is without a doubt one of the best AK47's you could ever buy. Made by the Russian's, who invented the AK. As of a couple weeks ago, these are now banned from import and totally sold out. Get this gun while you can!

Note that these come into the country in a sporting configuration and this one has been converted professionally by the imported. This was not done by some guy in his garage. The gun is super straight and everything was done just perfect - it's beautifull!

Russian Saiga 762 AK variant rifle w/ pistol grip, 16"" chrome-lined BBL, semi-automatic, 300m sight, includes one 30rd AK-47 mag - 7.62x39 caliber. These are super nice and feature the Shark Fin tactical forearm furniture


I am Only selling because I am slimming down my collection. My loss is your gain! Rifle is located in Mesa, AZ. I am willing to ship to an FFL. In-person transfers require you to be legal to purchase the rifle, willing to show ID, and sign a bill of sale or show a valid CCW.






U.S. parts count meets full 922r Compliance - Russian Saiga AK-47 configuration rifle.  One of the smoothest operating, best looking Russian AK-47 rifles available. Fully 922r compliant, accepts all standard high capacity AK-47 mags and drums.  Integral scope mount on receiver. These rifles have been converted from the original Saiga configuration, to a more standardized military style AK-47 rifle configuration.

The U.S. parts count on the rifle itself meets full 922r Compliance.
This allows the rifle to legally use any high cap AK mag or drum regardless of its country of origin.  
The compliance conversion on these rifles was done on site by the importer and they were really done right. 
The workmanship is flawless with no sign that these are converted as opposed to a factory finished rifle.

Compliance parts include Buttstock, Pistol grip and 3 piece G-2 No Slap trigger set by Tapco. 

I absolutely believe that the conversion on these rifles leaves them in a condition that is of superior quality to the original rifle configuration. 

This rifle quite possibly has the best fit and feel of any AK-47 on the market today and accepts and feeds 
flawlessly from all high cap AK-47 mags and drums regardless of their country of origin.  

Each Rifle ships complete with one 30rd mag, cleaning kit and manual."

I'm looking to sell the lot of them at once. All magazines are complete and have mostly been cleaned, I used these magazines for plinking and 3-gun and had no issues, the ones that had problems have been thrown away.

Conditions vary and these are being sold as-is, but I've cleaned, tested and used at least 12 of them and know them to be in good condition. The other 8 have feed ramps in-tact and pass a basic function test. Cosmetically they are varied as most of these magazines saw use in Israel. Some have been re-finished. Depending on your lower you may need to do some minor filing to the dust rib on the magazine to get them to click in easily and drop freely.

I'm tossing in a 45 round Thermold magazine in mint condition that I had as my go-to defense magazine in the house. The great thing about the 45 round magazine is that you can keep it loaded with 30 rounds for 20+ years with little to no risk of spring fatigue. I bought the 45 rounder alone for $60 in the same condition, but I'm adding this in as I'm motivated to sell!

These are all pre-ban and legal to own in MA provided you have an LTC-A which I'll need to see a copy of before shipping. If you don't like my price make me a reasonable offer."

Taurus 905 9mm 2"" Revolver - 5rd Blue: TI905021
For years, law enforcement professionals have asked Taurus to produce a small, lightweight revolver chambered for the popular 9 mm and .45 ACP. This allows the capability to cross-carry a pistol and a revolver and only one caliber of ammunition.
Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
Taurus Security System (TSS)
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

This gun is truly loaded with history (search google to find out). It is also revered by many (including Nazi soldiers of WWII, who used them in Stalingrad after capturing Czechoslovakian factories and also sent them to their Romanian allies) to be better than their own Mauser K98. As it was made in 1924, it is generally believed to have inspired the German design of the Karabiner 98k. These rifles appear to be moderately rare and few are around today as compared to the K98. To make it more rare, it is a Bolivian Contract rifle with the Condor bird marking. Only 101,000 of these were ever contracted, caliber 7.65mm, to be used in the Chaco War. This rifle has NO IMPORT MARKINGs, and as Bolivia has not released these rifles for import, it is likely a vet bring-back. It also has numerous markings indicating that it was made by the Czechs and also accepted into their army (Z within a circle; ""E"" in front of a rampant lion) before being contracted out. I have been told by numerous experts that this gun features many components of a very early VZ24.
It is a great rifle in better condition than any I have seen. The action is smooth and cycles rounds beautifully. It functions and shoots just fine, if you're not into just letting it sit. This is one of the best bolt actions I have ever seen. The only reason I am even considering selling it is because I have always wanted an M1 Garand, and this will help me buy one.

Make an offer -- but please no lowballers! This is a quality Mauser worth much more than a Mosin Nagant (I know, I own one).

Willing to add boot if I trade up, just let me know what you're thinking. I'm located in Albertville, I appreciate it"

Condition: Factory New
Model:  SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace w/o Buffer Tube

Description:  Factory New SigTac SB15 (AR15) Pistol Stabilizing Brace

SIG SAUER introduces the SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace, a shooter’s aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols.  This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using an AR-style pistol.

Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0” – 1.2” in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

Features
- Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.
- ATF compliant*
- Veteran designed
- Made in USA
- Quick and easy to install

* ATF has reviewed this product and determined that attaching the SB15 to a firearm does not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the firearm to NFA control."

948,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3361948,For Sale:  Military Surplus 81mm Mortar Ammo Cans,"Lynnwood, Seattle, Washington",$ 35,"Listed On: Sunday, September 21, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a few of these hard-to-find 81mm mortar cans available for sale. Dimensions are 25"" L x 14"" W x 8"" H and the weight is about 20 lbs empty. They are used military surplus cans so they are not pristine, but I would rate the condition of most to be excellent to very good, with a couple being good to fair. Some are more scuffed on the outside than others, but the insides are all pretty clean and unmolested. The price ranges from $35-50 each depending upon condition. They are stackable and have foam dividers glued to the inside, but the dividers can be easily removed. The hinges and latches are heavy-duty and can be secured using wire ties. The handles are nearly indestructible. These are not watertight; they were not designed to be. However, they can be modified to be weatherproof with $8 of materials from the hardware store (well worth it).

These cans are heavy and very well-built. They would make a great storage option for ammo, gun parts, tools, camping gear, etc. I know some guys bolt them down to their Jeeps/trucks/SUVs to store tools, chains, ratchet tie-downs, and other gear. I use one for storing my range brass. I can fit 4 of the .50 caliber cans inside of 1 mortar can with the .50 caliber lids removed (the mortar can lid will close with the .50 caliber lids on, but it's a tight squeeze). You can easily outfit these with some latch hardware so that they can accept a padlock. I also add small cork stoppers to the holes and window weather stripping to the lid for a weatherproof box. The sky is the limit for what you can use these things for.
