I sold off all of my 7.62 x 39 and switched to 5.56. I now need the money for other reasons. Everything I have is brand new and has never been to the range. It's been sitting in my safe for the past 2 weeks since I made the switch. I know can't sell it back for retail prices even if it is new, which is why I knocked the prices down. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask, I need the money so please don't offer trades. Thanks.

This listing is for ONE holster from the same lot showing in the photos. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras at the same per-holster price and with no additional shipping charges. From very light duty in the Cold War Days of Communist East Germany comes these attractive, protective and eminently serviceable leather holsters originally designed for East German Police Pistols that were Walther PP knock-offs. They will also fit similarly sized CZ Pistols, models CZ24, CZ50, and CZ70. They fit the single action Zastava Yugoslavian made M70 in .32 ACP. Beretta models 1934, 1935, 70, and 71 fit well in this holster, and that goes for the 70 clones made by Tangfolio and imported by FIE and Excam, including models TA380, E380, E32, and E22. Measurements will accommodate a pistol whose length measures up to 6 1/2 inches from its muzzle to its grip frame strut beneath its hammer; with a slide thickness of up to 1 inch; and with a muzzle height of up to 1 1/4 inches measured from the top of the front sight to the bottom of the slide. The pistol’s height from the top of the rear sight to the floorplate bottom of an in-battery magazine should not exceed 4 3/4 inches. Manufacturer on these was probably the State Factory in Baden, East Germany. Construction is smooth grained dark brown leather outer, with natural soft suede type finish inner. Stitching is close looped cotton twine. Strap is eye type, secured by a two piece aluminum alloy stud. Belt loop is single 1 7/8 inches wide secured by six alloy rivets, and will accommodate up to a 2 inch wide belt. This is a well made holster that will protect a pistol very well, and its styling is distinctively European. Surface wear is minimal, and we do not believe these served on duty for more than 2 or 3 years, if that long. Most specimens are marked on the inner flap by the MDL, the East German Ministry of the Interior in loose translation, certifying its fitness for duty use. We estimate these holsters were manufactured in the mid 1970s to early 1980s. We’re offering specimens from the photo lot each for only $ 24.00. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 USPS Priority Mail with Adult Signature, total shipping no matter how many a person buys.

I have a .22lr single action revolver and hardcase I am willing to sell for $130 or best offer (it is already a low price). It features sturdy wooden grips and a very strong, firm trigger and hammer action (had it fixed by a competent gunsmith). The pictures do not do it justice. The bore is nice and revolver in overall good shape. Good for beginners or seasoned shooters. Snake or varmint gun as well as target. Only reason I am selling is because I shoot it the least of all and I would like a WWI/WWII era rifle or handgun to accompany the WWII militaria collection I have begun."

BECAUSE BEAUTY AND FUNCTIONALITY AREN’T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
SIG SAUER® pistols have long provided their owners with peace of mind. Now the SIG Sauer CustomShop Equinox series adds pride of ownership to that feeling. The distinctive polished slide flats and nickel controls contrast with the dark-coated surfaces for a visually arresting two-tone appearance. When combined with its practical features, the Equinox series is pretty to look at and beautiful to shoot.

The P238 Equinox®, it’s just a fraction of the size of our full-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine.

595,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3306595,"For Sale/Trade:  ""1985"" Prototype Silhouette EBMM Electric Guitar (Ernie Ball Music Man)","Tacoma, Puyallup, Olympia, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,599","Listed On: Tuesday, July 22, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Own a ""one-of-a-kind"" American Classic, made in California.  This gorgeous treasure from yesterday plays an amazing tune, and can be yours!  Whether you are a future ""Juke Box Hero,"" have your gig together, or an expert rock star, you deserve an amazing unique guitar.  This axe is fit for any rock star future, current, or past!

Sure, you could buy a cheap-o guitar.  Or you could buy a production piece, one-of-many-thousands.   Or one with a signature (but who cares about signatures -- which can be faked?!).  These might be satisfying to you. 

But come on.  You work hard, so you deserve to spend your money on an amazing rare guitar. 
Walk with me for a minute.  It was the mid-1980s.  Ernie Ball had been in business since the early 1970s, but was still a very young company, and experimenting with various guitars.  Along came the Silhouette design around 1986-87. 

And here's where this guitar comes into the picture.  It's an authentic circa-1985 prototype EBMM Silhouette, as confirmed by EBMM customer service.  Guitar has been inspected by two guitar shop owners and is in excellent condition and sounds amazing.  There are a few tiny cosmetic character marks to note:  a few small nicks in the paint finish, the input jack has a small bend, a small piece of tape was removed near the input, and the fretboard shows some wear.  This guitar has character, style, and class like a fine old sports car or a fine wine in storage.  The aged paint design has created a very unique cracking appearance all throughout the paint under the finish, and the sunburst orange paint looks stunning.  There are no apparent cracks, bows, or structural damage to the guitar, inside or out.  Excellent working condition.  New strings recently installed. 

Famous people that have used EBMMs: John Petrucci (Dream Theater, Liquid Tension Experiment, solo artist), Ronnie Wood (The Rolling Stones), Eddie Van Halen (Van Halen), John Fogerty (Creedence Clearwater Revival), Mike Einziger (Incubus), Pino Palladino (Paul Young), Dave ""Phoenix"" Farrell (Linkin Park), Cliff Williams (AC/DC), John Myung (Dream Theater), John Glascock (Jethro Tull), John Deacon (Queen), Tim Commerford (Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave), Paul D'Amour (Tool), Dave ""Phoenix"" Farrell (Linkin Park), and a long list of others. 

See EBMM Wiki for more information. 

Per EBMM, Silhouettes are known for offset double cutaway alder, ash or poplar body, aluminum-lined pickguard, bolt-on maple neck, 24-fret maple or rosewood fingerboard with dot inlay, strings-through bridge, 4/2-per-side Schaller tuners, chrome hardware, two single coil and one humbucker DiMarzio pickups (three single coil and two humbucker pickup configurations were options until 1998), volume/tone control, five-way switch, available in Black, Natural, Sunburst, Trans. Blueburst, Trans. Teal, Trans. Red, or White finish, mfg. 1987-present.

Holding this guitar feels just perfect.  Own a piece of history."

-altered bolt 
- Can still use Iron Sights with scope mounted.

The stock is made from 6 year old Walnut and white oak that were glued up in a vacuum press (clamps leave little gaps). I glued walnut veneer counter grain between the different woods to prevent checking and movement. this also gives the stock greater strength.

The current finish is several coats of oil, I oil the stock regularly during cleaning (malarial Oil) 

IF you plan to do more than take this to the range I can marin-varnish and oil the stock for you or wax it. you will need to reoil every 6 months- year if you take it as is."

I have 5 20 round clips that will be included  I have a gentry 4.5-14x50 illuminated mil dot scope, 45 degree flip up magpul pro sights not the ones in the pictures,  fore grip and bipod. It will also come with 2muzzle breaks, the original which is amazing for stabilizing the muzzle jump but horrible for shooter concussion! And another that is the exact opposite. I put an angled charging handle on it although I never had any problems with the straight one. It has been an amazing rifle but it is just too expensive for me to shoot as much as I like to go out.

Other info: Here's a WW2 m1 carbine with five magazines. This firearm was manufactured in 1943 by the General Motors Inland Division and likely saw action in the Korean War. Rifle was imported by blue sky armory (arlington VA). I'm actually selling this because I started off as a milsurp collector, but i'm now i'm looking to get into long-range precision.

It's a fun shooter and a piece of WW2 military history! I just find that my interests have changed and this rifle should be a shooter, not a safe queen. This rifle and its accessories were purchased & verified authentic at Martin B Retting in culver city. I also just had a gunsmith inspect the rifle and do a function test. The rifle is in great condition given that it's a 71 year old WW2 and korean-war service rifle and the gas piston is nice and tight and the gun cycles surplus ammo nicely!

You won't find a real USGI M1 carbine for this price at your local shop. I've seen Commercial carbines for sale for more than this.
