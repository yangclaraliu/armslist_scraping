US Gov't ordered 20,000 of these precision target rifles for smallbore competition. They then left them in the packaging until someone decided to inventory them by slashing open the package with a razor knife. This is the signature of the kimber 82G is a thin razor-groove cut in the stock. (THIS ONE WAS HAND PICKED AND HAS NO CUT IN THE STOCK)

The 82G is a single-shot, 1-in-16 twist, Heavy Competition barrel (25"") bolt action firearm. It was built to the standard of being sub-MOA rifles. The butt stock is adjustable for Length of Pull and all spacers are included. stock is walnut and has some beautiful tiger-striping that doesn't really show in the pictures. Sling swivel is adjustable to the shooter. Sights are anschutz at 1/5MOA per click. Trigger is factory set for 3.5 lbs but is fully adjustable for takeup, pullweight and overtravel. It breaks like glass.

If you are looking to get into smallbore competitive shooting, this is simply the least expensive way to get in without dumping 1400 bucks into the lower-end anschutz rifles. 

This rifle is UNFIRED. It was bought as new (non-rusty) from the CMP when they still had these. The stock HAS NO CUT IN IT. This one was hand selected from the South Store in Anniston. The finish and stock are flawless. This rifle is unfired.It was brought it home, given a complete disassembly, cleaned it thoroughly and put it back in the safe. My photo skills don't do it justice.

Magazine assembly can be added as well but you must ask for it. Its burried in my garage somewhere and I'd rather not search for it but I can if you want it.
I'll also include around 40 rounds of some very potent surplus Russian ammo. (This stiff is high powder and gets some serious velocity best surplus I've ever had)

Separately you'd be spending a lot more
- carbine length mosin - $160-$250
- archangel stock with extra 10rd magazine - $190
-magpul afg $30
-picatinny rail to add the foregrip $15
-scope mount $45

-muzzle brake $75
-ammo - $13-14
-barrel cut, crown,  threading- $150 min depends on gunsmith.
... Minimum cost for all of this is around $750-800 depending on where you source your parts and what you pay for shipping.
I am willing to let my whole package go for $600 obo today.
I love this gun I've hunted with this gun it is fantastic.  But I've run into some automotive problems than need to be addressed immediately.
The cost of this setup will only rise.  Archangel is pretty firm on the price of these stocks and all the other upgrades are the cheapest I've found or very standard pricing.  Russian firearms as you may know are now not allowed to import into the country so a basic mosin nagant will soon be over $200 and the carbine length rifles are already well over that usually between $250 and $320.  These prices will rise.
The ammo can still be imported from other countries and winchester even makes good hunting rounds.
If you were to build this now I guarantee you're looking at over $700 at minimum if you do a lot of the work yourself. 
Even the the tool prices arent too cheap.
This is a good deal.
Willing to ship if you provide FFL information and pay 100% shipping.
This gun hardly kicks at all.
I've taken down bears and bucks with this rifle with 1 shot on each. Accurate and fun/cheap to shoot. Ammo is full power strong and much cheaper than any other caliber in its field. Go ahead and check ammo prices against 308 and 30-06 or 300blk.
This blows them all away. $600 OBO trade offers and cash offers will all be considered.

THIS IS THE GAS OPERATED MODEL.

I recently took this in to a local gun shop to get a value on it. 
What we found was these were imported from 89 to 91. 
They were sold on average at gun shops for 1200 back then. 
This is the lightweight sporter  model and does have a aluminum receiver. They offered me 450 for the gun saying they would list at 750 and probably sell around 700 after someone offered them that. 
The owner seemed adement to buy it off me, I declined. This is a very nice shotgun, high quality and shoots like a dream light and heavy loads, I have taken rabbits with this gun. I do not need to get rid of it but want to see what else is out there. My new passion is handguns so those take highest priority but I am also a sucker for different firearms and lever actions."

Hey all,
I have up for trade or sale a sweet 1911. This is a Taurus PT1911 in used but great condition. It has a few marks on the muzzle end of the slide, but nothing too bad. I would keep this by I really am looking more for a compact 1911 than a full size. This will come with 2 magazines, factory box, and factory barrel brush. Need to meet up in Norman on this one due to my schedule. 

In terms of trades, I am somewhat open. I would consider a Kel-Tec PMR30, Decent AK (no 74s), XDS in 45, Ruger GP100, a nice Marlin 30/30 (plus boot), 223/5.56 semi rifles and even other semi-auto rifles or other handguns. I would consider a Bolt action rifle, but it would have to be pretty slanted in my favor for me to do it because aside from that lever 30/30 i only want another semi-auto. I would even trade up to an entry level AR. Some trades will need boot on your end, some will need on mine. I also have a substantial amount of JHP 45 ammo that I could sell with or add to to even out the values. For any questions or to make an offer shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

It is a 3.5-10x50mm in matte black with the duplex reticle. I put it on a Browning rifle of mine that never made it into the woods. Only ever shot it at the range one time to sight it in. Recently I sold the rifle, and no longer have use for the scope. Paid $899 for the scope, and it is in the same condition as it was the day I bought it. Lens is clear with zero imperfections. Tube of the scope is also mint. It is amazing to me how they make scopes with glass this clear.

For those unfamiliar with the VX-L it was designed to sit as low as possible on the barrel of your rifle without compromising the light gathering ability of a larger diameter scope. This scope gathers the same light as all other 50mm scopes, but it sits lower than even a 40mm scope does on your gun. When using it, it is like any other scope, you see a round circle out the end of it. The technology is truly amazing. 

Also, being that this is one of Leupold's top of the line scopes, it has the Gold-ring lifetime warranty offered by Leopold that is transferrable to anyone who owns the scope. If there is ever any problem with the scope, send it back, and they will replace it or fix it free of charge.

I have this same scope on my other two rifles, and I will never use any other scope besides this one. All of those people that have told me there is no benefit to this design are a testament to this as they now have all bought one for themselves. You won't be disappointed.

Please let me know if you have any questions. I will respond to emails quickly. I also have some pictures of it I can send upon request. Price is set at $600, but will also entertain reasonable offers. Thank you!"

Someone once said to beware of the man with a single shot rifle as he is likely to know how to shoot it.

This New In Box Uberti copy of the famous Winchester High Wall is outstanding in every detail. It's a handsome, no-nonsense rifle with beautiful casehardened colors on the receiver and lever, perfect bluing of the barrel, perfect wood, Winchester style rifle sights, and a wonderfully sweet trigger pull. And the .45-70 chambering will allow you to hunt anything in North America, and most everything in Africa, too.

These Ubertis are known for their fine long range accuracy with either factory ammo or good handloads. This short-rifle style corresponds to the Sharps Business Rifle having a 28-inch round tapered barrel which makes it shorter, lighter, and handier than the standard High Wall rifles. It also carries a cleaning kit hidden behind the trapdoor in its shotgun buttplate.

This configuration in .45-70 is extremely hard to find. This rifle is unfired, brand New In the Box and ready for the upcoming Spring shooting season. 

This rifle is private property and the sale will be a private transaction.

Will ship to your FFL dealer if you are outside of the Reno area. Price does not include shipping/insurance or any other costs involved in purchasing this rifle."

I really don't want to sell, but the wife and I are going to be purchasing a home so this needs to go. It has less than 400 rounds through it and the recoil spring really cuts down on the felt recoil. You'd have to wait 4 months to get this if you sent it in to all these guys. I believe Damon and Doug both have closed their books to catch up.

When the good Colonel Thompson (later General) began to plan what became his masterpiece by founding the Auto-Ordinance Company nearly a century ago, little did he know that he was creating one of most iconic firearms and visual images in American history; the “Tommy Gun”, a.k.a. “Chicago Typewriter,” “Organ Grinder,” “Chopper,” and in the “Great War” parlance where its first use was originally intended, the “Trench Broom.” While Hollywood is largely responsible for establishing the “Tommy Gun” as a global image of prohibition era American gangsters, Thompson’s have established themselves in wars over a lifetime; from the jungles of Nicaragua in the Banana Wars to the killing alleys of post-communist Sarajevo. Modern imagery ranges from the anachronistic post-WWI retail advertisements of chap wearing cowboys to the inspirational lend-lease photos of Churchill’s inspection of costal defense troops complete with cigar, hat, suit and indomitable and defiant attitude. This Thompson Model 1927 A1 SEMI-AUTOMATIC rifle is chambered in 10 MM (yes, YOU read right), a VERY RARE caliber issue, PRODUCTION RUN reported to be 200 with majority retrofitted to .45 ACP (poor retail sales). Features finned barrel with Cutts compensator, pistol gripped fore-end, wood marts finished in a military oil finish walnut; matte black finish, adjustable rear sight, solid steel construction. I acquired this firearm at the liquidation of a collectors inventory in the 1990’s and it was professionally assessed NIB (new-in-box) condition with PAPERS showing slight handling marks, box and one stick magazine…..and has been safed ever since. Due to its RARITY OF CALIBER (how many have you SEEN?)and condition (NIB), this is ideal for any COLLECTOR who seeks to add what is, arguably THE most emblematic 20th Century AMERICAN image of firearms to their collection and one which should prove to be an INVESTMENT to appreciate over time"

When the good Colonel Thompson (later General) began to plan what became his masterpiece by founding the Auto-Ordinance Company nearly a century ago, little did he know that he was creating one of most iconic firearms and visual images in American history; the “Tommy Gun”, a.k.a. “Chicago Typewriter,” “Organ Grinder,” “Chopper,” and in the “Great War” parlance where its first use was originally intended, the “Trench Broom.” While Hollywood is largely responsible for establishing the “Tommy Gun” as a global image of prohibition era American gangsters, Thompson’s have established themselves in wars over a lifetime; from the jungles of Nicaragua in the Banana Wars to the killing alleys of post-communist Sarajevo. Modern imagery ranges from the anachronistic post-WWI retail advertisements of chap wearing cowboys to the inspirational lend-lease photos of Churchill’s inspection of costal defense troops complete with cigar, hat, suit and indomitable and defiant attitude. This Thompson Model 1927 A1 SEMI-AUTOMATIC rifle is chambered in 10 MM (yes, YOU read right), a VERY RARE caliber issue, PRODUCTION RUN reported to be 200 with majority retrofitted to .45 ACP (poor retail sales). Features finned barrel with Cutts compensator, pistol gripped fore-end, wood marts finished in a military oil finish walnut; matte black finish, adjustable rear sight, solid steel construction. I acquired this firearm at the liquidation of a collectors inventory in the 1990’s and it was professionally assessed NIB (new-in-box) condition with PAPERS showing slight handling marks, box and one stick magazine…..and has been safed ever since. Due to its RARITY OF CALIBER (how many have you SEEN?)and condition (NIB), this is ideal for any COLLECTOR who seeks to add what is, arguably THE most emblematic 20th Century AMERICAN image of firearms to their collection and one which should prove to be an INVESTMENT to appreciate over time"

 A small carry gun when you just can't carry a larger one or for a back-up.

 The NAA .22 Long Rifle is the most popular Mini-Revolver ever produced. With the many current accessories, it is versatile for many applications and is the standard by which other Mini-Revolvers are judged.

 As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.

 Comes with the small holster, warranty card, small catalog and parts list, small padlock. No case... I am keeping the case.

When the good Colonel Thompson (later General) began to plan what became his masterpiece by founding the Auto-Ordinance Company nearly a century ago, little did he know that he was creating one of most iconic firearms and visual images in American history; the “Tommy Gun”, a.k.a. “Chicago Typewriter,” “Organ Grinder,” “Chopper,” and in the “Great War” parlance where its first use was originally intended, the “Trench Broom.” While Hollywood is largely responsible for establishing the “Tommy Gun” as a global image of prohibition era American gangsters, Thompson’s have established themselves in wars over a lifetime; from the jungles of Nicaragua in the Banana Wars to the killing alleys of post-communist Sarajevo. Modern imagery ranges from the anachronistic post-WWI retail advertisements of chap wearing cowboys to the inspirational lend-lease photos of Churchill’s inspection of costal defense troops complete with cigar, hat, suit and indomitable and defiant attitude. This Thompson Model 1927 A1 SEMI-AUTOMATIC rifle is chambered in 10 MM (yes, YOU read right), a VERY RARE caliber issue, PRODUCTION RUN reported to be 200 with majority retrofitted to .45 ACP (poor retail sales). Features finned barrel with Cutts compensator, pistol gripped fore-end, wood marts finished in a military oil finish walnut; matte black finish, adjustable rear sight, solid steel construction. I acquired this firearm at the liquidation of a collectors inventory in the 1990’s and it was professionally assessed NIB (new-in-box) condition with PAPERS showing slight handling marks, box and one stick magazine…..and has been safed ever since. Due to its RARITY OF CALIBER (how many have you SEEN?)and condition (NIB), this is ideal for any COLLECTOR who seeks to add what is, arguably THE most emblematic 20th Century AMERICAN image of firearms to their collection and one which should prove to be an INVESTMENT to appreciate over time"

When the good Colonel Thompson (later General) began to plan what became his masterpiece by founding the Auto-Ordinance Company nearly a century ago, little did he know that he was creating one of most iconic firearms and visual images in American history; the “Tommy Gun”, a.k.a. “Chicago Typewriter,” “Organ Grinder,” “Chopper,” and in the “Great War” parlance where its first use was originally intended, the “Trench Broom.” While Hollywood is largely responsible for establishing the “Tommy Gun” as a global image of prohibition era American gangsters, Thompson’s have established themselves in wars over a lifetime; from the jungles of Nicaragua in the Banana Wars to the killing alleys of post-communist Sarajevo. Modern imagery ranges from the anachronistic post-WWI retail advertisements of chap wearing cowboys to the inspirational lend-lease photos of Churchill’s inspection of costal defense troops complete with cigar, hat, suit and indomitable and defiant attitude. This Thompson Model 1927 A1 SEMI-AUTOMATIC rifle is chambered in 10 MM (yes, YOU read right), a VERY RARE caliber issue, PRODUCTION RUN reported to be 200 with majority retrofitted to .45 ACP (poor retail sales). Features finned barrel with Cutts compensator, pistol gripped fore-end, wood marts finished in a military oil finish walnut; matte black finish, adjustable rear sight, solid steel construction. I acquired this firearm at the liquidation of a collectors inventory in the 1990’s and it was professionally assessed NIB (new-in-box) condition with PAPERS showing slight handling marks, box and one stick magazine…..and has been safed ever since. Due to its RARITY OF CALIBER (how many have you SEEN?)and condition (NIB), this is ideal for any COLLECTOR who seeks to add what is, arguably THE most emblematic 20th Century AMERICAN image of firearms to their collection and one which should prove to be an INVESTMENT to appreciate over time"

The Beretta Px4 Storm SubCompact pistol is the most advanced deep concealment tactical pistol of its kind. It is a miniature-size version of the ultra-reliable PX4 Storm, a double/single-action pistol that keeps gaining an enthusiastic following among military and police organizations worldwide. The SubCompact does not sacrifice any of the features of its larger counterpart, while offering superior concealability and light weight.

Low Recoil in a Lightweight Package

In spite of its diminutive size, the Px4 Storm SubCompact was designed to be pleasant to shoot, offering minimal muzzle-jump and keeping recoil mild. The reason is that it is built around a rotating (or rotary) barrel system. The action dissipates much of the recoil radially, thereby reducing both the kick in the web of the shooting hand and the muzzle rise that happens at every shot. Besides being far less punishing on the hand than other handguns in its class, the PX4 SubCompact is quick back on target--a best-of-both-worlds situation combining superior concealment and low weight with a full-size shooting experience.

Superior Durability and Ease of Maintenance

The stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion- and sweat-resistant, making it perfectly suited for concealment even in hot and active conditions. This is a tactical pistol that is designed to work as hard as you while being as low-maintenance as possible. Disassembly is extremely easy and quick and requires no tools, while the tough and surface-treated steels enable you to keep it as good as new with a quick wipe even after a whole day in the holster.

User-Friendly, Feature-Rich and Ambidextrous

With the included interchangeable backstraps, the PX4 Storm SubCompact is easy and quick to adapt to different hand sizes (for instance, male or female) and grip styles. A built-in Picatinny rail further adds to its flexibility, making it possible to attach a variety of tactical accessories without any gunsmithing or alteration. Furthermore, most controls are either ambidextrous or reversible, making it easy to shoot and train with either hand dominant. Any shooter considering a reliable and soft-shooting subcompact for concealed carry or personal defense should give the PX4 SubCompact a very close look.

Item Description:
For your consideration, a Glock 37 Gen 3 .45 GAP. This appears to be a LEO trade in and as such was carried much more than it was shot. Some wear on the night sights and two small scratches on the grip as pictured. I had this inspected by Glock on 1/15/15 and they updated most of the internals. I will provide the service sheet to the buyer. Night sights are Glock brand and still have a lot of life in them. Comes with everything pictured. I have included 50 rounds of Speer 200 grain Gold Dot hollow points to get you started. Can meet in the Kennacstock area.
