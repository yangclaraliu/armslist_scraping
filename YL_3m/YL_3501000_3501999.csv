The American Spirit Arms upper receiver is mated with a Daniel Defense Lightweight 16 inch 1:7 twist barrel capped with a Lantac Dragon muzzle break. The tan ADM QD scope mount, holding a Vortex 1-4x24 TMCQ MOA, looks at home with the tan Troy Alpha rail and the GWACS polymer lower. A very smooth two-stage trigger is accompanied by a Battle Arms Ambidextrous 45degree safety selector. The gun comes with one tan Magpul 30rd PMag. This AR has been shot about 100 times with various 223Rem and 5.56mm ammunitions, ranging from 45gr to 69gr without any issues. For three shots from cold-bore it is a 1inch gun at 100 yards (with 55gr PMC). The gun comes with Magpul BUIS and weighs 5.5 pounds empty without the optic and mount. To fit the billet upper receiver the polymer lower did have to be filed down in certain areas as it is designed for a standard receiver; this work is noticeable when the rifle is pulled apart for cleaning if one looks closely but in no way impedes the operation or the external looks of the rifle. The finish on the takedown pins is noticeably worn; to my knowledge this is related to a bad batch of pins (in reference to their finish) GWACS had a while back. The only work that is recommended and has not been done is staking the low profile gas block and adding a JP Enterprises silent-captured recoil spring. I will cover shipping and transfer costs on my end; transfer fees posed by the receiving FFL will not be covered by myself. Cash or bank transfer only; face-to-face meetings welcome. $2000 OBO"

NO NYC. This listing is for ONE magazine, but winning buyer can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges.  We began stocking Mec Gar Magazines 20 years ago, not because some flashy sales rep came by, but because our knowledgeable local customers had tried them and endorsed them. Serious Combat and Target Handgunners of all types, from recreational target shooters to veteran police officers and Armed Services personnel, know and respect Mec-Gar's magazines. After all, they are the primary suppliers for Browning and Sig, and a major supplier for Smith & Wesson and Walther. Mec Gar magazines, writes the factory, are constructed from certified carbon steel and feature a heat treated housing and a hi-impact polymer or certified carbon steel follower and floorplate. To further complement this package, the surface is specially treated to ensure high corrosion resistance. Them work like they're supposed to: they insert smoothly, free-fall eject, and lock the slides open on big autos. We cannot say that about any other aftermarket magazines. Here is Mec-Gar's blue steel 9 shot magazine for the Beretta model 21 Double Action pistols chambered in .25 ACP. They WILL NOT work on the model 950 or Jetfire Single Action. On small pistols like these, it is even more crucial to have a reliable magazine. As our old teacher Joe Lowe used to say, without a magazine, it's just a single shot. And in our experience, without an original factory magazine or a Mec-Gar, there's a good chance it will be a single shot even with a magazine. Don't take that chance. Own One of them	for only	$ 25.00.

These are the mating rounds that go with the M855 green tip steel cone tipped penatrator rounds.  The M856 round, is usually mixed in with M855 on a belt in a four to one ratio for belt fed firearms.  These have the steel cone in thee nose, just like the M855 rounds and are magnetic. 

The M856 tracer is a long range tracer good to about 900 yards, and are red in color. I have had 100% reliability in the round lighting off....yes, 100% ! Some of the older tracer rounds you can find, your lucky to get 25%-50% to light.  

Take the whole lot, or let me know how many you want.

.42 cents a round  or 400 bucks for the whole lot of 960 rounds. I will entertain some offers, but be advised, this is a GREAT price for this specialty ammo. Some of the orange painted tips will be slightly missing from some of the projectiles, but 95% of the paint is there for the most part.

These are the mating rounds that go with the M855 green tip steel cone tipped penatrator rounds.  The M856 round, is usually mixed in with M855 on a belt in a four to one ratio for belt fed firearms.  These have the steel cone in thee nose, just like the M855 rounds and are magnetic. 

The M856 tracer is a long range tracer good to about 900 yards, and are red in color. I have had 100% reliability in the round lighting off....yes, 100% ! Some of the older tracer rounds you can find, your lucky to get 25%-50% to light.  

Take the whole lot, or let me know how many you want.

.42 cents a round  or 400 bucks for the whole lot of 960 rounds. I will entertain some offers, but be advised, this is a GREAT price for this specialty ammo. Some of the orange painted tips will be slightly missing from some of the projectiles, but 95% of the paint is there for the most part.

This is not the super 1050. This machine came before the super 1050. The only real difference between the 2 is that the RL 150 will only do rifle calibers up to .223. You can process 308 brass but not load cases. The stroke is a little bit shorter than the super 1050, so its mainly for pistol cartridges. Complete press has been gone through, and rebuilt. 100% taken down and all parts cleaned or regreased, new parts purchased where necessary. has case feeder with large pistol plate. Currently setup in .40 S&W/10mm. comes with small primer priming system, however i have the large priming system with it as well. This includes the swaging rod for both primer sizes... This is over 100 dollars from dillon. 

In addition to both priming systems coming, i will include a set of hornady 40 caliber dies. dies include sizer, expander(not needed with dillon powder dropper) and bullet seater/crimp die. 

This press is smoother than the newer super 1050's and can be converted to rotary conversion(more reliable than the POS ponsness warren auto drive which is crap) should you choose that route. case feeder works great as well. 

I have 2 extra tool heads for this press too that are new. The price is 175 each on those. I have some extra powder droppers too if you are interested. 

NO TRADES, cash only. not looking to ship. No offense, but if your email includes ""i know you said no trades, but...."" I will delete it and quit reading. I really dont trade. period. it never works out, the other person always over values their crap... just not interested, PLEASE. Located on the south side of atlanta.

This Pistol Shoots Exceptionally Accurate and is holds 7 very powerful rounds of .380 Ammo.  It will certainly keep you  protected and is lightweight and comfortable enough to carry all day, every day without getting in your way or bothering you. This is a great little gun, THIS GUN HAS A LIFETIME WARRANTY THAT TRANSFERS TO THE NEW OWNER AND STAYS WITH THE GUN FOREVER, NO MATTER WHO OWNS IT. SO, IF YOU EVER HAVE AHY ISSUE OF ANY KIND, YOU JUST CALL TAURUS AND THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF IT, THEY ARE VERY FRIENDLY AND EASY TO DEAL WITH. I checked over the weekend and this pistol is currently selling for $349.99 at the Local Gun Shops and Sporting Goods Stores, the lowest I've seen them selling for is approximately $319.99. I AM INCLUDING SEVERAL EXTRAS THAT I HAVE OVER $200 INVESTED IN- YOU'LL GET 3 BOXES OF AMMO- Federal ""Hi-Shok"" & Black Hills Gold Hollow Point Ammo & PMC Premium FMJ Ammo, a Custom Leather Holster and Uncle Mike's Pocket Holster, Owners Manual and Safety Key from Taurus that locks the Trigger For Safety, also Includes Gun Specific Paint and Refinishing Liquid for the Barrel. 

AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE IS ONE ISSUE: The Gun has been Stripped/Sanded down and is ready to be Refinished however you choose. The Gun can look like new in an hour or two with just a little bit of effort, the barrel/slide refinishing liquid is.applied in a minute or two with a cotton swab, or rag, it's very easy and you just follow the instructions on the bottle. The bottom frame is simply painted with the Special Paint Included, it's very easy. You can use the included materials to make it look exactly like the Black Gun in the Bottom Picture or Paint/Custom Coat it any Color or Combination of Colors You Want.  

I WILL SELL THE GUN & ALL ACCESSORIES PLUS THE MATERIALS TO REFINISH IT FOR ONLY $200- I am losing hundreds of dollars at that price but I'm willing to so my loss is your gain. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY AND NO LOWBALL OFFERS PLEASE, I JUST WANT TO RECOVER SOME OF MY MONEY THAT I'VE INVESTED AND IF YOU BUY THIS FOR $200- THAT'S BASICALLY THE COST OF THE EXTRAS AND YOU'RE GETTING THE GUN FOR FREE, 

EMAIL ME FOR A QUICK RESPONSE AND WE WILL MAKE A DEAL! 

I AM ALSO OPEN TO TRADING THE GUN AND WILLING TO ADD THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF CASH FOR ANOTHER FIREARM, I AM INTERESTED IN THE FOLLOWING GUNS: .22 Pistols/Rifles Including Ruger Mark III 22/45, SR22, Browning Buck Mark, Walther P22, Ruger LCR Revolvers in .22, .22 Magnum, .357 Magnum, Ruger LC9, All Glock, Springfield XD/XDM/XDS IN 9mm/.45 ACP.& Rifles in .22 life the Ruger 10/22, Marlin Model 60, Tactical AR/HK/MP5 Style .22 Rifles, Large Caliber .308 & .300 Win Mag Rifles of Any Kind, I'll add cash to make things fair on guns worth more than mine."

Billionaire Supports Gun Control for you, Wants Tank For Himself

Microsoft Founder, Seahawks owner, and billionaire Paul Allen has been a vocal proponent of gun control... while building up an arsenal of heavy armor for himself.

According to the San Francisco Gate, Allen's recent purchase of a German Panzer IV tank has run into some legal issues,

A Soviet SCUD surface-to-surface missile was a no-problem purchase for him at $349,000. A rusty and inoperable Cold War-era M55 self-propelled Howitzer was a comparable bargain at $45,000.

But when it came to an authentic Panzer IV, a World War II-era German tank, Allen, an avid collector of historical military planes and other equipment, has had to go to court in Redwood City, even after paying $2.5 million for it.

One of Allen's companies, Vulcan Warbirds, filed suit Wednesday in San Mateo County Superior Court alleging breach of contract and other violations after it paid $2.5 million for the rare tank in July and the owner subsequently refused to turn it over.

Allen recently donated over $500,000 to support gun control measures in Washington state. The hypocrisy is appalling, but the brilliant Alan Gottlieb nailed it when he said via a Citizens Committee on the right to Keep and Bear Arms (CCRKBA) press release,

“While Paul Allen is eager to get his hands on a genuine weapon of war,” CCRKBA Chairman Alan Gottlieb observed, “he is all-too-willing to support a measure that throws obstacles in the way of law-abiding citizens who may just want to borrow or buy a firearm from a friend or in-law. How silly is that?”

“This is simply incredible,” Gottlieb said. “This elitist Seattle billionaire thinks it is just fine to make it more inconvenient for average citizens to buy, sell or loan a rifle, shotgun or handgun, but he wants to buy a German tank with a 75mm cannon! We looked through I-594, which Allen supports, and discovered why he’s probably hot to purchase that Panzer. I-594 has a tank-sized loophole.

“Tanks appear to be exempt under the gun control measure because they’re not specifically mentioned anywhere in those 18 pages,” he explained. “So, Allen wouldn’t have to go through a background check. But who needs a tank to go duck hunting?

“Evidently,” Gottlieb concluded, “the difference between billionaires and the rest of us is the size of the guns they want to own.”"

This is a Ruger 10/22 I purchased here on Armslist about a bit over year ago.  I've shot a few times, and it shoots just fine.....but I just don't shoot as much with this guy as much I used to.

I added a super cheap Tasco Rimfire 3-7x 20mm Riflescope from Amazon, which I'm including (you can do what you want with it  - I'm not a big fan of it).  I will also include 250 rounds of .22 ammo as well as a 20 round and 25 round magazine.

Only slight defect is one of the ears of the flip up sight is broken in the corner.  Still useable (or course not needed at all if you use a scope).....More of a cosmetic defect really.

So here's all that you're getting for $300.....

 - Ruger 10/22
 - Tasco Rimfire 3-7x 20mm 30/30 Reticle Riflescope
 - 25 round magazine
 - 20 round magazine
 - 250 rounds ammo
