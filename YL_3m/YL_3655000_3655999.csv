Description: 
Built around Beretta's latest PX4 modular technology, the Beretta PX4 Storm Sub-Compact Pistol delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower. The Px4 Storm Sub-Compact utilizes Beretta's reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system for a more compact and lighter package.  Direct barrel-slide locking system design delivers a low barrel axis that reduces felt recoil and minimizes muzzle rise. Its stainless steel barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance, a great choice for a concealed gun kept close to active, perspiring bodies. The PX4 Storm's durable frame includes an integral Picatinny rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. Ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating provides superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. White 3-dot sights provide quick acquisition of the target.

First off, lets start with the basics. The receiver is an early Springfield M1A, definitely Pre-Ban, most likely built in the late 1980s. It was a ""Green Box"" gun, making it rare, and the most desirable generation of M1A. Serial number is 069,xxx. 

This gun has a handmade match weight walnut stock, with tiger stripe/curly blonde grain, and has had tung oil applied by hand. It is incredible. Was made and installed by the previous owner who made custom stocks for a living.

Also, it has a Krieger Super Match stainless steel heavy barrel. This barrel is tight enough to pop primers, and it does not get any more accurate than this one in an M1A. (Fitting alone by Krieger was almost $300, not including the cost of the barrel itself).

TRW bolt, HRA Op Rod, NM internals. All the best parts. 

This rifle also has National Match sights, making the use of iron sights out to 600 meters possible. Also has a picatinny rail on the forend of the stock which will make mounting a bipod easy. Match grade trigger is as crisp as any I have ever felt, and breaks like glass at around 3# or so.

Included is a Springfield Armory picatinny style scope mount ($150), a Bushnell 4-16 scope with BDC ($150), Weaver rings, and a 20 round mag.

This gun has EXACTLY 40 rounds down the tube. 1/2 MOA is like walking the dog with this gun, and it is not even broken in yet.

I am asking $2,800 or best reasonable offer, no trades unless its something pretty damn cool, and about $2,000 cash on top.

Description: 
Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

Description:
Is it possible for a pistol small enough to carry every day to have all the features and capacity that you’d expect in a larger pistol? If that pistol is the XD-S® from Springfield Armory®, the answer is yes. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack 9mm offers so much that you’ll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile.

The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Use your XD-S® Single Stack with an X-Tension™ magazine and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there.

If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

With this rifle, you can easily train and shoot with either hand dominant and improve your skills without breaking the bank. Limitless Accessorization, Customization Options This training rifle is a great base for building the tactical system of your dreams. It comes out of the box with four Picatinny rails: on top, a full rail enables you to easily attach your favorite sighting or optics system, while on either side and on the bottom of the fore-end additional rails let you add other accessories such as tactical lighting. Other customization options include the telescopic folding stock: you can adjust the length of pull at the touch of a button, while the stock can be folded partially or all the way to accommodate most firing situations. Durable, Easy to Shoot and Maintain The ARX160 is built to be durable and super-tough, being constructed of superior steel and technopolymer. Its flip-up sights are just like those on the full-caliber rifle—super-light but rugged, and featuring a rear diopter for quick and accurate target acquisition. Maintenance is easy thanks to the simple way in which it comes apart and is reassembled without any tools. Whether you use it on its own as a rimfire tactical rifle, or as a training tool to improve your handling of the full-power counterpart, the ARX160 will always turn heads at the range and will never let you down."

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

I paid $70 plus tax last year and they are $80 plus tax now at Dicks here: http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=23068546&clickid=prod_cs&recid=Product_PageElement_product_rr_1_966

Up for sale is a mint Savage 110 chambered in 338 Lapua Magnum.  I've decided I truly have nowhere to enjoy this guy at a long enough range so let someone else have the fun!  This 110 is the ""police"" version, equipped with an HS precision stock, adjustable cheek piece, a brand new, never set Weaver 8-32x50 Extreme 30mm scope with illuminated dual crosshair reticle, 30mm Burris Extreme Tactical Medium height rings, all sitting atop a pic rail. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention AN EXTRA FACTORY 5 ROUND MAGAZINE ($119.00) AND A $100+ ADJUSTABLE HARRIS SWIVEL BIPOD!!! Scope is mounted on the rifle but not set. 

 Also included are 80 rounds of FACTORY Hornady ammo, 60 of which are 250 grn softpoint, the other 20 being 285 grn match.  This truly is a heckuva opportunity for someone wanting a ready-made Lapua setup, not needing to chase ammo, optics, the rifle itself, etc.  I would call the rifle Excellent in condition with a very low round count (less than 20) from its previous owner.  I have not contributed to this round count.  This fella truly is ready to rumble.  Just sight it in and shoot :)  No box or papers but I do have the complete box/setup for the scope.  

In summary, for my asking price, you get the rifle, optics, rings, mounts, bipod, extra factory magazine, 80 rounds factory ammo and cheekpiece ALL for roughly the cost of the gun itself new.

I feel I have this setup bargain priced so I am quite firm.  No trades wanted/needed.  Simply looking for a straight sale.  I will meet FTF in the Central KY area and deliver the rifle to its new owner.  I am a licensed KY CCDW Permit holder and lifelong KY resident. Don't hesitate on this one as I feel it will not last long at the given price.

Please text for initial contact/questions at 8five9 7four9 6ninefour9 to discuss then I will gladly speak via phone at that number if you wish.  Again, I do have a couple pics available to send via text.  Thanks in advance for your interest and I look forward to the new owner being able to TRULY enjoy this setup at a range deserving of the caliber.  

Thanks and have a great day."

It's the Carbine 18.5"" barrel model which are normally known to shoot better than the long barrel in these guns. I've never hunted with it and have owned it approximately 2 yrs. Very accurate auto loader with not much recoil (the auto tames the 35 Whelen down to a little less than a 30-06 to my shoulder). These are fairly hard to find and I have never had any issues whatsoever with it (No jams or feeding issues). Great gun, just an overkill for me anymore. Bill of sale will be done.

9X18 Makarov +P (115gr. hard cast flat nose @ 1,000 fps-ME 255 ft. Ibs.)

Our introduction of a ""heavy bullet for cartridge"" 9X18 Makarov +P loading is the sole result of numerous customer requests.  With millions of these pistols now on American soil and no +P heavy loadings available, this cartridge and the many pistol owners are suffering from the lack of serious fight stopping ammunition.  This load is 20grs. heavier and 100 fps faster than standard 9X18 ammo.

This loading features a flash suppressed powder, so if you need to shoot in low light, you won't be blinded by your own gun fire and this is a useful tactical advantage since around 95% of all civilian shootings in the US happen in low light while the criminal element is out and about.  Our use of a hard cast bullet, with a flat nose, can best be understood if you'll read our technical article on ""The Use of Expanding Bullets in Small Defensive Cartridges,"" posted under the ""Technical Articles"" category on our home page.

Further, please note that the use of hard cast bullets (not lead but, Hard Cast) does NOT cause lead fouling in the polygonal rifling's used in all 9X18 Makarov pistols.  For more information, please see our technical articles entitled ""Hard Cast Bullets in Polygonal Barrels"" and ""Dangers of Pure Lead Cowboy Bullets"". We found no appreciable leading in any of our Makarov test guns. It should also be noted that all of our test guns functioned and fed flawlessly with this load. We also experienced very good to excellent accuracy in all test guns.

Please note the real world velocities listed below from real world 9X18 Makarov pistols. At Buffalo Bore we always use real, ‘over-the-counter’ firearms for our published velocities, as we feel the use of laboratory test barrels that give false, high velocities does the customer a disservice as each customer needs to know what their carry ammo will really do on-the-street in a real world situation.

I have been thinking about selling my 16 for some time now. I have always wanted to upgrade to the 17, but the funds just were not there. I have finally convinced myself that I own plenty of 556/223 platforms and need to get 308. So, here is my Scar 16s, she has a little under 1000 rounds through her and is in excellent condition. I always give my guns a thorough cleaning and lubing before and after use, so her internals are spotless. I made some basic upgrades including the Geissele Super Scar trigger and the Stryker E.A.C.H.(Gen 1). My local gunsmith changed the muzzle break to a YHM Phantom so I could use a suppressor on it (only fired suppressed once 50-100 rounds, its still in jail). The Phantom works surprisingly well to hide the flash and reduce the recoil. I am also including the Pelican iM3100 Storm Case, which has to be the strongest case I have ever owned, works great for storing and transporting the firearm safely. The original factory magazine will be included, as well as the factory brake and factory charging handle. I am asking for $2000 which seems like a fair price and would allow me to get my 17. I am located in Tampa. If theres any questions feel free to ask. I can snap some more detailed pics if requested."

The SAM7K PISTOL
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria.

Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7K - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, and peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.
