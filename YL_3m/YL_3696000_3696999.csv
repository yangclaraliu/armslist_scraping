Sight and Mount 30mm With Picatinny Tops
Timberline scopes are made to mount low on short action rifles to maintain the agile feel and balance of a short magnum. The new scopes' profiles are quite compact, so Timberlines are in their element when in a tree stand, in a scabbard, or anywhere else space is in short supply. Generous amounts of eye relief have been designed in to allow the scopes to point quickly and to keep your face well away from the potentially abusive recoil of heavy magnums. A matte finish adds stealth to the equation. Of course, the four new scopes boast suberb optical performance. They are Burris', after all.

SOG Knives Collectors' Review/Take: The SOG Seal 2000 won over 13 other knives to gain the prestigious title of being supplied to the US Navy Seals for their usage, after a rigorous battery of tests which included flame, saltwater, acetylene torch resistance and abuse of all sorts. It is the combination of all of SOG's fixed blades - a little bit from each model pieced together to form it. 

The SOG Seal 2000 Knife features 7"" partially serrated blade, powder-coated for low reflectivity, grippy Zytel handle for chemical and flame resistance, AUS-6 steel for saltwater resistance, tactical jump-rated kydex sheath with ""groove"" for easy cutting of cords, and the list goes on... This is the iconic ""SOG Knife"" indeed. It is especially popular among the general public as a scuba diving knife for its high saltwater resistance and is usually strapped to the thigh/calf for a tactical feel.

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 17 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me.

The quality of pictures are severely reduced when uploaded to armslist so it can make some textures look strange (like on the extended mags.) If you'd like the full size pictures, I can email them to you."

I recently purchased a newer car with better gas milage and I am now selling my 4runner. This was my daily driver and it has had a lot of work done recently which is all listed below. I hate to see it go, but I have no need for it now. It has power windows, locks, mirrors, and seats. Also has the roof rack so its easy to install a basket if you wanted. It has ABS and Traction control with the ability to turn the rear differential off. It is a 4x4 which works perfectly. Has a full size spare which is a new tire also. The engine runs strong and the transmission shifts smoothly. It has cold AC and warm heat. The only issues with it is that the paint is fading on the roof and the hood, the sunroof is not working for some reason, and the leather on the front 2 seats is torn and cracking. A couple seat covers would take care of that. It has 245k miles on it, but if you are familiar with these 3.4L 4runners they will run forever if you take care of them and this one has been taken very good care of. I have the title ready to sign over. Please email to make an appointment to see and test drive. Looking for $3000obo cash or will do a partial trade for 1 or possibly 2 firearms. I have a permits for handguns. I need to get no less than $2500 cash plus trades.

These exotic 12 gauge rounds are similar to a short-range flamethrower, which can produce flames up to 100 feet. It can be used as a flare in distress situations. There is little to no combat record of dragon’s breath being used in the field. At close range this round can be very effective however dragons breath rounds are not relied on in tactical scenarios. It is not practical to use an incendiary round when there is a risk of catching a house or building on fire, which could possibly cause civilian casualties. These rounds offer great fun for recreational shooting. Just ensure there are no flammable materials in the general direction that the round is fired.

I have these in packs of 3 or ""3-Paks"". I have a total of 23, ""3-Paks"" for a total of 69 rounds. Normally, these sell for $6.00 + each, to as low as $4.00 each in quantities of 25+ rounds. I will sell these for $2.90 each for a ""TAKE-ALL"". I prefer a FTF sale, as these do require a HAZMAT fee for shipping, and runs the shipping costs up substantially.

PLEASE NOTE: WE HAVE STARTED USING NEW GRIPS ON ALL ELITE DARK MODELS. THE GRIPS NOW COME WITH A BLACK SIG SAUER LOGO IN PLACE OF THE WHITE.

The new P226® Elite Dark is the newest edition to the P226 Elite and features an ergonomic beavertail grip, front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITE® Adjustable Combat Night Sights, custom aluminum grips (may differ from image shown) and the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. SIG engineers designed the SRT to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting.
The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet's special warfare operators. The railed P226 Threaded Barrel chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

The ""certified check"" is fake and by the time your bank refuses to honor it, you have already handed your item over to their ""agent"".

If you are a collector of these then I may have some you are looking for.

Some have very nice boxes and some are torn, taped and worn but the shells are all in nice shape and will display nicely.

Some boxes are full, some partial and some I just have the empty boxes.

Most are 12 gauge but a few 20 and maybe a couple 16 gauge? Ages are quite old to modern.
Also have a handful of old 3"" .410 shells (no boxes) and some old .22 shell boxes, so if you collect those let me know.

If you are interested in one shell or a box full, let me know what brand, gauge, etc. you are looking for and what you'd pay and I'll see if I can fill your request.

I don't have particular prices in mind but will entertain any reasonable offers. That said, I do shoot a lot of clay birds and as all these will still function well, if I can't get reasonable money for them I'll shoot them up. (meaning: no lowball offers.....shotshells are expensive nowadays and these are collectibles so should easily go for more than a new box of cheap shells). Some of these shells I have seen at local gun shows with quite hefty price tags (although I am not looking for gun show prices)
I don't need to sell any of these but can use the space, so if you are a collector, please let me know what you need and I'll let you know what I have.

Description: 

Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing.

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days."

Description:

The P-06 is the .40 S&W version of the 9mm CZ 75 P-01 model.

The P-01 9mm was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.

The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.

Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!"

I took this gun to Cabela's for a possible sell/trade, and they confirmed the gun was original parts with emphasis on having the safety behind the gold trigger, ventilated barrel, and a real bone butt.  The gun does have a poly-choke that according to Cabela's takes value away, but this was a hunting gun for me years ago.

If you are reading this you probably already know the great accuracy/quality reputation of this HARD TO FIND rim-fire rifle in LEFT HAND configuration. Left handed rifles are difficult enough to find, let alone a model of this fine quality and features. It is a real tack driver and will perform well for training, hunting, target shooting, and plinking. You not will not regret this purchase of a Classic Rifle.
EXTREMELY ACCURATE!!!

I am the original owner and regret having to let this one go. My issue is that I wear trifocal glasses and my aging eyes can no longer effectively work with open iron sights on a rifle. My loss is your gain. Due to limited production this rifle is very difficult to obtain new.

The rifle is in mint condition. The price is FIRM, and I will only take USPS Money order (or cash if it is local face to face). I will not travel and if shipped I will quote you on actual UPS shipping charge, which you will also be responsible for paying."
