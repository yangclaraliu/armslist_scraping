140,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3834140,"For Sale:  BRAND NEW PEPPER SPRAY KEYCHAIN, HARD CASE, BLACK IN COLOR...**FREE REFILLS FOR LIFE","greater seattle area, Seattle, Washington",$ 5,"Listed On: Sunday, May 27, 2018",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Pepper Spray Keychain, hard case, black in color If you ever use your ""pepper spray"" in self-defense, send me a copy of the police report and you'll get free refills. ================= About Pepper Spray: This spray has an Ultra-Violet Light Identifying Dye (which helps to ID these Ass-holes) includes both a clip (to easily attach it to your clothes while walking) and a key ring. PEPPER SPRAY FACTS: Pepper spray enables you to defend yourself while keeping a safe distance from an attacker. Pepper sprays induce an almost immediate burning sensation of the skin and a burning, tearing, and swelling of the eyes. If spray is inhaled, the respiratory tract becomes inflamed resulting in a swelling of the mucous membranes lining the breathing passages and temporarily restricting breathing to short, shallow breaths. A one second burst to the face will cause temporary blindness, choking, coughing, and nausea-disabling your attacker giving you time to escape. The active ingredient in this spray is Oleoresin Capsicum (O.C.), commonly referred to as red pepper. It is a natural, oily, resin-like substance derived from hot peppers, the same peppers used to make spicy foods hot. When considering which pepper spray is most effective, one must consider the percentage of pepper being used and the heat rating of that pepper (measured in Scoville Heat Units or S.H.U.). A good pepper sprays has a rating of 2 million S.H.U. or higher... **Don't be fooled by the claims ""Hottest allowed by law"" and ""Hottest in the industry"" that are made by some on the web. This gives people a false sense of security.** FYI...Capsaicinoid Concentration is the determination of active components in Oleoresin Capsicum. Capsaicinoids are the group of compounds that cause the burning sensation. There are the three main compounds that make up about 95% of the Capsaicinoids: Capsaicin, Dihydrocapsaicin, and Nordihydrocapsaicin. The Capsaicinoid Concentration is the amount of these compounds in a certain solution. Therefore, by measuring the amount of capsaicinoids, an accurate level of pungency can be determined for the solution. This is the unit of measurement that is the most consistent and best representation throughout all grades of Oleoresin Capsicum. In essence, it is the equaling factor between SHU’s and % OC. While the strength of the selected peppers may vary from year to year or between seasons, the measurement of capsaicinoids is consistent in determining that hotness. A 0.2% Capsaicinoid Concentration will yield the same amount of hotness, regardless of the batch of peppers or their location of cultivation. For this reason, it is the only accurate method of determining the pungency of peppers. The current detection method for this analysis is by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, HPLC.4 Therefore, by establishing quality control monitoring the capsaicinoid concentration, a consistent strength or pungency can be easily obtained and verified by this analysis. **Federal law does not allow carrying any type of pepper spray on airplanes or in the security areas of an airport. They are also prohibited on aircraft because the drop in air pressure can cause the pepper spray canisters to explode. For the same reason, pepper spray cannot be shipped by air. **If you're flying, I'll tell/show you how to make your spray ""airplane safe"". Just e-mail me. Always remember that you assume all risk and liability for owning and using pepper spray. Even if you use it correctly, there is no guarantee that it will always be effective at hindering an attack, and there is always the possibility that it may be used against you instead. **Consult the laws of your state and/or local agency. Understand and Obey them before owning pepper spray.** ------------------- **Revised Code of Washington 9.91.160** Personal protection spray devices.

Rare due to the letters FTR engraved on the right side near S&W crest. The Smith and Wesson forum explains it as follows:

This revolver was likely shipped from the S&W factory in the 1943-1944 time frame. From the markings you provided it is evident that your Victory served with the Australian military, as it bears the FTR rebuild markings that are so often seen on the Aussie guns. Most of the Aussie guns seen here today underwent a rebuild process in the 1950s.The gun has been FTR (factory thorough rebuild) probably at Lithgow, but that is where the original grips probably got parted from the gun.

This gun has S&W diamond walnut grips, if you remove them you can see much deeper bluing. The Victory model used a smooth walnut grip still available on Ebay for $12-20.
Also missing is the lanyard loop available for $20-30 on various websites. The barrel, frame and cylinder numbers match. This gun was blued rather than the standard ""Magic Black"" sand blasted or Parkerized finish. The finish is worn to a nice patina, overall it is in great shape for a gun 70+ years old. I tried to show the mirror bright quality of the bore. There are no other military markings on this gun. I cannot guarantee the information from the S&W forum is 100% accurate but it does have some of the most knowledgeable experts on this model. 

FTF sale preferred, must have valid Wisconsin ID or will ship to FFL holder. Items are sold as is, no warranty. No scammers or low ballers please. 
Owner may be interested in trading for S&W M&P Shield or left handed .22s."

Limited Warranty Terms and Conditions
Davidson's, Inc. warrants to you that if any gun sold by Davidson's ever becomes defective, Davidson's will replace the gun at no charge, subject to the following conditions. This warranty applies only if Davidson's Supply Company sold the gun to the retailer from which you purchased it and extends only to the original purchaser from the retailer. In order to be eligible for warranty coverage, the original purchaser must complete the warranty registration online or return the warranty registration card to Davidson's, Inc., at the address shown below, within 30 days from date of purchase. If no replacement is available, we will repair the original or offer you a similar model (to be determined at our discretion) free of charge. This warranty extends to any and all parts of the gun as originally sold by us, but does not extend to guns altered or rebuilt after their original purchase, or guns used other than for their legal intended purposes. DAVIDSON'S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACING OR REPAIRING THE NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE GOODS (TO BE DETERMINED AT OUR DISCRETION). WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EITHER DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. To obtain performance under this warranty, you must return the product to the retailer from which you purchased the product and pay the cost of shipping the product to Davidson's. If the retailer is no longer in business, you may contact another Retailer Near You or us directly at Davidson's, Inc., 6100 Wilkinson Drive, Prescott, Arizona 86301, REDACTED. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.

*BRAND NEW GUN:
Davidson's will ship your replacement firearm the very next business day for all in stock items. You are only responsible for return shipping costs to us (ie: getting the firearm to Davidson's through your retailer we do not accept shipments directly from end consumers.) Handguns are shipped out for next day delivery while long guns are typically received by your dealer within 3-4 days of shipping. If we do not have a replacement or you elect to get the same repaired firearm back, your firearm will be sent to the factory or an authorized warranty station for repair. If your firearm is repaired, the time frame until we return your firearm will be longer. Your dealer must have a valid FFL with original signature on file for us to ship and a current account with Davidson's.

252,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3834252,For Sale/Trade:  17 HMR Marlin 100% tuned and upgraded (Competition &  Zombie ready),"Historic District, Cheyenne, Wyoming",$ 590,"Listed On: Saturday, December 20, 2014",Rifles,Marlin                                                                                ,17 HMR                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"I'm moving to an area that doesn't have rimfire class match clubs, so rather than have a ""safe queen"" here is my uber-tuned sub, sub, sub MOA accurate rimfire competition rifle, trigger, scope, stock... Everything but a silencer, ****plus several hundred rounds of ammo**** all from the same lot except one box I use for PD's.

The photo below was shot off the bipod, 100yds, 7 to 11mph wind, 10 shots. The group would be half that size without the blustery wind, without a doubt. 

3 magazines: two 10 round and one 5 round.

This is my ""go-to"" rifle for any rimfire competition. It never let me down and the rounds scream so fast, they are almost laser-accurate. It's almost an unfair advantage, going up against .22LR with this.

This rifle is Zombie, Germ Outbreak and Prairie Dog removal ready. The power and explosive nature of the ammunition makes an unparalleled paper puncher, varminter or just plain fun 300 yard plinker. YES, I said out to 300 yards, with a .17! It's that good of a round.

If you use the software app ""STRELOK"", plug in your ballistic data, it will give you instant firing solutions for every distance, including atmospheric inputs. Simply hold-over or dial in your windage and elevation and you're ALWAYS on, as long as you do your part too!

From 30 yds to 150 yds, prairie dogs nearly explode, at 200, it is still a little messy-goopy shot and (of course) they are DRT, however, I've pushed it to 315 and dropped them with one clean hit. I have no doubt you could go further if you were using paper targets.

The stock and finish is in immaculate shape. This is NOT an off-the-shelf Marlin, the wood is shiny as glass, there is laser stippling on the forend and grip and the optics are very nice.

You'd be hard pressed to find fault in this weapon. It operates perfectly, I don't believe it has any ""felt recoil"" with the heavy barrel, as you can see the bullet impact even with the scope on high power, and it flat-out looks cool.

The trigger is wonderful and responsive. It doesn't have any grit or an inappropriately heavy pull. I've had people tell me it feels like a rack and pinion steering race car wheel on ball bearings - they can feel the entire draw and feedback, smooth and accurate.

Please email me through here or text 4O99398903. I'm Robert. Let me know if you need different photos or anything else. I'm at your disposal.

Limited Warranty Terms and Conditions
Davidson's, Inc. warrants to you that if any gun sold by Davidson's ever becomes defective, Davidson's will replace the gun at no charge, subject to the following conditions. This warranty applies only if Davidson's Supply Company sold the gun to the retailer from which you purchased it and extends only to the original purchaser from the retailer. In order to be eligible for warranty coverage, the original purchaser must complete the warranty registration online or return the warranty registration card to Davidson's, Inc., at the address shown below, within 30 days from date of purchase. If no replacement is available, we will repair the original or offer you a similar model (to be determined at our discretion) free of charge. This warranty extends to any and all parts of the gun as originally sold by us, but does not extend to guns altered or rebuilt after their original purchase, or guns used other than for their legal intended purposes. DAVIDSON'S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACING OR REPAIRING THE NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE GOODS (TO BE DETERMINED AT OUR DISCRETION). WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EITHER DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. To obtain performance under this warranty, you must return the product to the retailer from which you purchased the product and pay the cost of shipping the product to Davidson's. If the retailer is no longer in business, you may contact another Retailer Near You or us directly at Davidson's, Inc., 6100 Wilkinson Drive, Prescott, Arizona 86301, REDACTED. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.

*BRAND NEW GUN:
Davidson's will ship your replacement firearm the very next business day for all in stock items. You are only responsible for return shipping costs to us (ie: getting the firearm to Davidson's through your retailer we do not accept shipments directly from end consumers.) Handguns are shipped out for next day delivery while long guns are typically received by your dealer within 3-4 days of shipping. If we do not have a replacement or you elect to get the same repaired firearm back, your firearm will be sent to the factory or an authorized warranty station for repair. If your firearm is repaired, the time frame until we return your firearm will be longer. Your dealer must have a valid FFL with original signature on file for us to ship and a current account with Davidson's.

Totally Armory fresh, but with 13 hashes in the side of the stock. Serial number, a trace and homework on the armory stamps show it likely saw the end of WWII then guard duty before being crated and stored. I purchased crates of these, TT's, Tokarovs, SKS's and a few AK74's directly from the Red's armories while on deployment to East Europe with the USMC and imported via my best friend's company. 

Comes with a CRATE of ammo. See pics. 

Bayonet included... Probably 2 feet long. Also has a small service and cleaning kit. 

Upgraded rear leaf sight to diopter style and this WILL shoot within about 1.2 MOA out to 900yds without even a second thought. If you don't like the rear sight, I kept the Russian leaf. A simple pin and spring will swap them.

This is one BAMF rifle. Harvested a share of Caribou and a Moose while on hunts in Alaska, using Russian ammo. Bears = DRT.

Comes with that giant case of ammo PLUS RCBS reloading dies and 20 S&B loaded brass bullets if you want to reload right away or simply not shoot USSR ammo. 

When this was unpacked, it had a habit of sending fliers up and to the left. The barrel was recrowned ever so slightly which corrected the gasses not exiting equally from the crown... and the barrel is in a slightly better condition than most others that are out there.

 Again, it will shoot just over 1MOA using milsurp ammo. I don't doubt you could do a minute or less on handloaded brass.

As soon as this was uncrated at my friend's business, I hand picked this one and gave it the royal treatment. The barrel was corked, all parts degreased, treated, and repolished, which took about a week. 

I do not have any details about the ""13"" engraved in the stock. We suspect it was either combat kills or months in service.

Headstamp is 1943, Tula.

SR-15E3 IWS CARBINE MOD1

The latest evolution of our SR15 16” Carbine now features an improved URX 3.1 with a longer overall length to allow for better muzzle stabilization. This alteration allows for reduced weight by removing the commonly unused rail section of the system. It also allow shooters who prefer a thinner rail diameter the ability to still mount accessories on the front and rear sections of the rail while providing a comfortable grip.” Also, feature buttons are overlapping other items.

if you want a great rifle for a great price, you've found it!

I have a mid 80's Winchester Model 70 that I'm selling to fund my recent interest in .17HMR.

It was my fathers rifle before it was mine. it has some very minor ware, just what you would expect for something that is 25 years old. I've always taken very good care of this rifle just as my father did before I. 

A Bushnell 3-9X40 scope is held tight by weaver rings and is zeroed at 200 yards. I can consistently shoot two inch groups. I'm sure a more accomplished shooter can do better then me. 

the caliber is 7MM REM MAG.

the bolt shows ware but is still very clean and smooth!

the bluing has a few scratches here and there but is overall in good condition. 

the stock has very few blemishes.

I need to thin out the extras in my AR safe, getting ready to build some new ones, I wish I had time to shoot this one, because it is one of my favorites besides the SIG x1 carbon.

Let's get down to brass tacks... It's 100% pro built with ALL premium components. ONLY TEST FIRED, operates flawlessly. 6 shots to zero optic and iron sights, 14 shots to check BDC ranges in optic. (20 total) Cleaned, put away. Barrel is considered ""properly broken in"" by popular method.

Build data:

Lower:

-Spikes Tactical 7075 Lower with ""Live, Dead, Undead"" switch settings (see pic)

-Palmetto premium M4 stock, Buffer Spring and buffer

-Preeeeeeeemium tuned trigger, polished everything, ceramic-embedded lube surfaces. (Best AR trigger I've owned or shot)

-Ceramic surface coats on sear/disconnect/hammer/friction surfaces and Teflon lube at lugs, doesn't feel gritty, won't walk out pins or leak shit everywhere, (because that collects dust and we don't like that).

-Ambidextrous single point sling mount for right handed shooters and southpaws too!

-Ambi safety selectors

-Hogue grip

-Enhanced Trigger Guard

Upper:

-Nearly everything on the upper is Cerakote SOCOM Blue (pics are hard to see but it's sexy) Barrel, receiver rear cap, castle nut, D-ring, handguards, Flash suppressor, almost everything we could possibly do. 

-Internals are Black Phosphate with chrome contact surfaces and stainless rings. (Military testing showed that using other coatings or chrome besides the phosphate only extends the anti-foul by 100 rounds. AR/M4 always foul, nearly scientifically at 2,450 rds if you don't clean it)

-Barrel is a new SIG Tactical Designated Marksman 1:7 twist, will stabilize up to 90gr subsonics and will drive tacks with 75 and 77 grain 5.56 NATO loads (barrel is SOCOM Blue)

-Carbine length gas system, flat top front rail with 45 degree back up iron sight
Spikes upper (SOCOM Blue)

-Standard charging handle, as a Marine, I just don't feel that is a useful upgrade, but if you want it, I'll put on the BCM gunfighter Ambi.

-Wylde chamber (shoots .223 and 5.56 NATO without having extraction issues. It's just better. Go Wylde.)

-SIG ARMS bolt, carrier group and cam with all premium polish and lube on appropriate areas only, not drowned in CLP!

-Dampened extractor (brass doesn't fly 40 feet away, it is tamed down to about 12 feet) if you want brass to fly far again, simply remove the extractor spring donut.

-PROFESSIONALLY HEADSPACED, torque checked and timed by SIG armorer, re-checked by my armorer, no messing around there. Safety is king.

-Titanium firing pin to reduce severity of light primer strikes when rounds chamber. (I have never seen an AD from a firing pin, but I wanted to build this right.

-Flat top receiver

-Plain Ejection Port Cover, ready for your customizing or for a Strike Industries door clip

-45 degree back up iron sights (BZO is dead on)

Option: Prismatic 3x SIG TAC scope with illuminated BDC reticle out to 600 yards (+$175)
Option: Magpul MOE handguards ($retail price, will install / fit for free) MOE requires a slight mod under the top grip so the front sight rail clears it. 

Everything is built to spec, torqued and indexed correctly. Match grade components on all internals and hard use items, SIG matched bolt face to chamber, 7075 aluminum in receivers (so dry firing won't bend the area in front of the hammer, which crushes 6061 aluminum receivers.)

The backup sights have mil-spec steel day/night diopters and the range roll. I tried to keep it simple and light. They hold zero and locked solid."

Description
If you enjoy pest elimination and hunting with your air rifle but are worried about bothering your neighbors, the 1400CS air rifle has a sound suppressor on the end of the muzzle. Winchester says the sound of your shot will be reduced by 50%! This air rifle is loaded with accessories.

The bipod is attached to the sides of the rifle's forearm and is there when you need it to steady your aim but can be flipped up out of the way when you don't need it. No clumsy or confusing bipod adapter needed! Lots of shooters like the option of attaching a sling, but it's a pain to attach the sling swivel studs.

Winchester's already done that for you. Just pull the sling through the swivel loops, and you're good to go all day in the field. The gun will be there when you need it without weighing you down when you're on the move.

Overall, I am into the build & coating around $2500. I don't expect to get that, as I overpaid for the barrel (no a bad barrel by any stretch, I just overpaid) and the coating ran $300. The coating was 4 layers of different colors of Duracoat, professionally done and professionally cured. There is some wear in the coating near the magwell and on the rail from general use but the firearm has never been shot. It was taken to shows and put on display at booths, but other than that it has seen no use. Please do not low ball,  I have an idea of what I am looking for but would like to see what offers I can get. Ultimately looking to fund some other projects which is the only reason I am selling the rifle.

I know the market on this is probably low just hoping someone who knows the value of this will see it. If you have any questions please let me know by email or text at REDACTED

The rifle has ran every type of ammo I've fed it, through Pmags, DPMS mags, KAC mags, Larue mags, and Lancer mags.

I verified it was the charging handle when I swapped the Raptor into my ECC and it did the same thing in that rifle. There is some wear on the bottom rail near the front where I had attached some BCM rails. 

Rifle is stock with the exception of a Slash XH buffer and spring, and a Norgon ambi mag release. Originals will be included. 

The rifle was shipped in a nice Rainier branded hard sided case, and that is how I will ship it to you. 

$2050 shipped 

For trades, I'm interested in quality factory AR rifles or uppers, ""tactical"" optics, 5.56 or 7.62 ammo, 5.56/7.62 AR mags, anything Knights Armament, etc. 

I'll ship the day after I receive payment via FedEx, so please make sure your FFL accepts from a private party. I can do PayPal (gift or you cover the fees), a USPS Money Order, or any other type of certified funds. 

Fastest way to contact me is via email. jeremytye AT sbcglobal DOT net.

I tried my best to take pictures of the spots, but the camera wasn't cooperating very much. It's not horrible, but it's there and I want to be upfront about it.

The scope mount fits a railed Glock and is simple to attach.......just remove the trigger screw on the Glock, slide the mount over the rail and reinstall the screw.  It appears to be very solid from what I can tell. As you will see from the photo the mount also houses a tactical light (the tac light shown in the pic DOES NOT go with the sale....it rides on another railed Glock I have).

The Owl Doctor works perfectly as it has a good battery in it.....and comes with a dust shield (as pictured).   The Owl DR is for an AIRSOFT pistol. It came mounted on a .40 Glock?"
828,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3834828,For Sale:  Original Antique Vintage German WW2 NAZI Dagger made by Robert Herder Solingen,"Macedonia, Akron, Ohio","$ 1,400","Listed On: Friday, January 9, 2015",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This German SA Dagger was originally commissioned by Hitler for members of the National Socialist German Workers Party or NSDAP (National Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei). These daggers were designed for use as dress accessories and functioned as symbols of status and rank within the Nazi party. The design of the SA dagger, like its counterpart the SS Dagger, incorporated elements of the ""Holbein"" dagger which was a German hunting knife that dates back to the 16th century. One of the primary design features of the SA knife is the Nazi eagle with its wings spread wide, grasping a wreath that contains a very prominent swastika in its center. Other prominent features include the SA symbol within a circle at the top of the wooden grip, the phrase ""Alles fur Deutschland"" (Everything for Germany) inscribed in the center of the steel blade in Gothic script, and a distinctive curved grip fashioned from various woods including walnut, birch, and maple.  Some of the early versions of the German SA dagger exhibit some important differences compared to later knives. These include the lack of the circular SA insignia, a different phrase inscribed in the blade: Deutschland Uber Alles"" (Germany Above All), and a larger nickel eagle design. However these early models of the SA dagger are extremely rare and only a small number of them are known to exist. This dagger is by maker Robert Herder, Solingen with the nice, hard to come by windmill maker mark."

This gun is in decent condition, with some spot marks on the outside of the barrel. This gun does need a new bolt sleeve and the price is adjusted for such. After calling Browning, they said a new bolt sleeve was 50 dollars and is an easy fix. The gun can still fire and function without a bolt sleeve, and I have met people at gun shows that say one is not needed. It is used to make the action slide more smoothly. The inside of the gun is spotless.

Firm price. Will not ship. Check out my other listings of AR-15s, optics and ammo. 

Finest quality 5.56mm ammo made in Lithuania by GGG to exceed NATO specification. This is ""GP21"" ball ammo which is a ss109 / M855 type load, made to stricter quality standards than NATO requires. The ammo is of course brass case, non-corrosive and reloadable boxer primer. The projectile does contain a steel penetrator and is magnetic, but it is not color coded with a green tip as is traditional with US manufactured m855. Manufactured in 2012 or 2013. Comes 50 rounds per box, 20 boxes per case. This ammo is truly some of the best real NATO mil-spec 5.56x45 ammunition ever to be offered consumer in the US market. If you are looking for top quality ammo for your AR15 or other 5.56mm caliber semi auto rifle and you will accept no substitutions then this is the ammunition to get.

Unlike most other ‘NATO’ ammunition on the market GGG GP21 is new production; not old surplus, product overrun or ‘NATO like’ imitations. GGG GP21 is 100% authentic military ammunition exceeding all STANAG and MOPI requirements. GGG manufactures and qualifies GGG GP21 ammunition to the same rigorous standards whether the end user is the US commercial market or a front line military combat unit. GGG spares no expenses in the manufacturing process using only the highest grade of brass with deep annealing that is excellent for reloading. The military grade boxer primers are non-corrosive, non-mercuric and exceed all sensitivity requirements for combat use. A high quality double base smokeless propellant is used. The full metal jackets are made from tombac. The case mouth and case primer joint have a waterproof sealing. The M2A1 cases are sealed with a full rubber gasket. There is also a wire and pressed stamp lock around the hinge which must be cut to open. As a result of both the quality manufacturing and the packaging, when stored in this fashion, GGG NATO ammunition has a minimum shelf life of no less than 20 years. GGG NATO qualified ammunition far exceeds the benchmark and typical performance of other NATO ammunition."
