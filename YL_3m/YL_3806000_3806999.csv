Everyone that has ever pulled the trigger on a Kahr Elite series pistol has been blown away. It's like nothing else.

As stated, the Mk9 Elite is an upgrade over the standard MK9. In short it has a very nice polished finish (as opposed to matte) and of course, a super smooth trigger. The MK9 pistol is the same size as a PM9, but has an all steel frame, which in turn means reduced recoil and option to customize the grips, not to mention the much smoother interior parts that comes with the Elite series.

sometimes, only when shooting HP's*, it stovepipe-jams. those are easily cleared. according to the factory website, it is designed for target shooting only, low grain ammo. 

round count is ~150 and its clean.

You must have an LTC-A, and we will submit an EFA-10 form recording the transfer. This is an unapproved gun so FFL's/gun stores cant touch it.

purchased new, in August 2014, from Nova Firearms in Mclean, Virginia. I am the original owner.

I lived in Massachusetts, then DC-Maryland-Virginia, then moved back recently. There I bought guns and earned a virginia Concealed Handgun Permit. 

LTC-A: I don't have one yet. I have had 1 (of 2, maybe more) meetings at the Newton Police Department. 
Trip 1: My LTC-A paperwork submitted, I was fingerprinted etc, paid the fee, and I scheduled an interview with a police guy for later this month (Trip 2).
There may be a couple more steps, yet I should receive my LTC-A hopefully this December or after."

Been to the range with it 7-8 times. I have put 3-4 hundred rounds through it with zero issues....The advantage of the Keltec over the ruger or taurus 380 is that it is rated for +p ammo for defensive purposes. In other words occasional +P ammo is okay, at the range use regular 380.  I chose the keltec over the other two for this reason alone.   It is used has some scratches in the polymer frame. I also polished off the bluing on the slide making it look like stainless steel.  The pistol is not really a looker so to speak, but functions like a pro!...If you or wifey need a great concealed carry gun this is it.
I paid around $240 for it. You can buy it for $145.....That is a steal and I think you know that.

Your CZ-20 QuickSilver is truly an all-purpose metal detector
engineered for land, beach, salt and fresh-water treasure
hunters. Here are some important built-in features:
1.
Leakproof:
Submersible to 250 feet, headphones
and all.
2.
3-Tone Target I.D.:
A low tone for iron; a mid-tone
for pull tabs, foil and most gold rings; and a high
tone for U.S. coins, silver rings and some gold rings.
3.
Visual Target Response:
Two bright, red LED’s flash
over targets, varying in intensity according to
target signal strength.
4. Depth:
Patented Fourier domain signal analysis.
Two
deep-seeking, ground-compensating VLF
signals (one at 5 KHz and one at 15 KHz) provide
twice as much target information for accurate
analysis and identification.
5.
Two Search Modes:
A silent-running, slow-motion
target-I.D. mode and a hot, wide-scan autotune
mode for all-metal searching.
6.
VCO No-Motion Pinpointing:
Just push the
pinpoint button and the signal tone increases in
pitch and volume as the center of the coil
approaches the target.
7.
Big-Target Alert:
Ordinary detector circuits
overload on large, shallow targets, identifying them
as good targets. But not the CZ-20. A distinctive bell
tone immediately warns you that the target is too
large to identify.
8.
Faint-Target Audio Boost:
The lower range of the
volume control is like any other that you’ve used.
But as you increase it above mid-range, strong
target sounds remain at a fixed volume while faint,
deep-target sounds continue to get louder.
9.
Pushbutton Ground Balance:
Just push the
pinpoint button and lower the coil to the ground.
Then set the ground control just below the audio
tone and you are precisely tuned for on-site
conditions.
ABOUT YOUR DETECTOR
2
10.
Separately Sealed Battery Compartment:
Protects the electronics from accidental flooding.
11.
Spider Coils:
Your choice of the all-purpose 8-
inch or deep-seeking 10 1/2-inch Spider coils. Light,
tough and with open centers for accurate
pinpointing. The hot, little 5-inch coil is great for
extremely trashy areas, tight spots or highly
mineralized ground.
12.
Balanced, Comfortable and Hipmountable:
Cushioned arm rest, soft foam grip and a control
housing that slips off the handle and onto your belt.
13.
Easy to Use:
Just pick it up, set the control on
the red circles and start searching in a “coins-only”
mode. Or for maximum performance, you can
easily adjust the controls for your own specific
situation."

DESCRIPTION
Get on target, range, and take the shot in seconds - all without lifting your cheek from the stock. The NIKON M-223 Laser IRT 2.5-10x40 Rifle Scope, BDC 600 Reticle, Matte Black (8491) combines the speed and precision of a Nikon rangefinder with the accuracy potential of the M-223 riflescope and BDC 600 reticle. The Nikon Laser IRT Scope ranges distances from 32 yards to 735 yards in 1 yard increments with ease.

The M-223 IRT provides the equivalent horizontal range to the target, features one-touch laser technology that keeps ranging and displaying distance for 12 seconds with a single push of the button and an integral mount for Picatinny Rails.

With an impressive 4-time zoom range and four inches of constant, non-critical eye relief, M-223 Laser IRT Riflescope features a massive ocular lens that delivers a huge, exceptionally bright, high-resolution sight picture.

This Laser IRT has a smooth zoom control, with help of which magnification reference numbers are viewable from the shooter's position. Precise, 1/4-MOA hand-turn adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting - even with heavy recoil. Quick focus eye piece allows the shooter to instantly bring the reticle into sharp focus.

To simplify field adjustments, Nikon has integrated Zero-Reset turrets into all M-223 riflescopes. Just sight-in at 100 yards as usual, then lift the adjustment knob, rotate to your ""zero"", and re-engage. Field adjustments are now as simple as dialing-in your subsequent ranges.

Developed specifically for the trajectory of the .223 Remington / 5.56mm NATO round with 55 grain polymer tip bullet with muzzle velocity of approximately 3240 fps, the BDC 600 reticle offers shooters unique open circle aiming points at 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 yards with additional hash-marks at 250. 350, 450 and 550 yards.

The M-223 Laser IRT 2.5-10x40 Riflescope is fully waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. The riflescope is covered by Nikon's Lifetime Full Warranty.

 This transmitter operates on Ultra High Frequency, (UHF) 434.120Mhz. This type of UHF transmitter is used by professionals worldwide because of its penetrating power and very clear reception. *Includes high quality transceiver with earphone option for private listening.

Over 4000 feet!! transmission range in the open!

Long range and long life transmitter.

Why is a UHF transmitter better than a VHF transmitter?                                              Traditionally most Spy Bugs are VHF (88Mhz-108Mhz) FM. 
They work well but there transmissions are not secure because you can use any FM radio to listen to the transmission ,this transmitter is on UHF and the transmission is very much more secure because you need a transceiver / scanner or a UHF receiver to listen to the transmission. 

This UHF Transmitter is PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) controlled.
What is PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)???
Phase-locked loops are widely used in radio, telecommunications, computers and other electronic applications. They generate very stable frequencies in addition to stabilizing a particular communications channel (keeping it set to a particular frequency) So making this Spy transmitters frequency very stable ,you can hold this transmitter and the frequency will not move.

In testing this transmitter we used a transceiver and got a transmission range of well over 4000 feet!

To get the maximum range: 
The antenna should be stretched out straight and placed either horizontally or vertically.
 The receiving antenna must be in the same plane to get the maximum range and both 
 antennas should be as high as possible. The signal is generally not affected by brick walls, wooden walls, glass or plaster."

After the entirely handmade version, came the Original profile in 1990, the Regular in 1996 and the Classic in 2000.  2008 was the 21st year of the Sebenza and to celebrate, we introduced the Sebenza 21—an updated version of the classic, that is easier to insert into a pocket or pouch.   Whether plain with a tumbled or “stonewashed” S35VN blade and sand blasted handles, or embellished with a polished or damascus blade, wood inlay or lavish graphics, each Sebenza is individually fitted to the closest tolerances. All Sebenzas are available in large or small, and dedicated right or left handed."

The Scar is chambered in 5.56x45 NATO and is FDE. I have three FN SCAR mags that are also FDE.

The Elcan is very rare. The company who makes them is called Raytheon. They make radar guided missiles and other defense/military technology in Tucson, AZ. Elcans have been available primarily to the military and are very hard to find in the civilian market.  This optic is built like a tank and is both 1x and 4x power. On the left side of the optic there is a throw lever that allows you to switch your power very quickly. It has two reticle options. Turning the lighting dial back illuminates the whole reticle for precision shots. Turning it forward illuminates a red dot so it can be used like an Eotech or Aimpoint. It also has built in iron sights on the top of the unit. Very expenisve. Mine was 2100."

The barrel has a 1 in 10 twist, and for those of you that dont know what a 20 prac is, its a 223 necked down to 20 caliber and gives the performance of a 204 with cheaper reloading costs. I just never got around to switching barrels and I am an avid predator hunter and think a semi auto would be my best bet. The barrel also fits all savage and stevens rifles with a small shank.

The 84FS Cheetah with plastic grips is light, fast handling and ideal for personal defense. Its .380 Auto caliber is just right for those who prefer the light recoil and report of a higher caliber, smaller pistol. Very accurate out of the box, its ambidextrous safety is easily accessible by the thumb for right- or left-handed shooters. High-strength nickel-chromium-molybdenum steel with hard chromed bore for longer life. Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stovepiping. Fast, sure target acquisition from standard 2-dot system. Notched rear sight is dovetailed to slide. Blade front sight is integral with slide. Easily accessible by the thumb for right or left handed shooters. Button to
accommodate right or left handed shooters. An anodized alloy offers superior corrosion resistance. The first round is full double-action mode, and the second and all subsequent rounds are fired single-action.
