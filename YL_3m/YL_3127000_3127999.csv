$875 for USP (OBO)

I have a very nice HK here. Location is Muncie, willing to travel to Ft. Wayne or N. Indy. Purchased around (December 2014) and I am the second owner. I have approx 400-500 rounds through it and nothing is wrong with either one.

USPf- V1 DA/SA with Safety and Decocker. Date code is BC. Purchased the gun with match trigger kit installed, hammer spring was causing light strikes so I put the original back in and 0 problems since. Also put original flat spring in as the match spring was a little bent. It didn't effect performance but I didnt like it. Can order and install new one if desired (same with match hammer spring). Again, gun fires with no issue just wanted to disclose what I have encountered. Added GG&G rail adapter so lights are good to go. Added the jet funnel kit and purchased two new 18 round mags...very few rounds fired through them. Original parts are also included. 

I have a full write up on HKpro.com dealing with what I encountered. Everything is good to go.

The barrel and mag tube need to be the same length. Other than that I don't care which stock as long as it's not a cheap aftermarket stock. I don't care what sights are on it, or if it has the heat shield. 590A1 only! I do NOT want something else, and I do not want to order from your store either.

This gun is built to exceed the USMC's current M40A5 sniper rifle in feature, configuration, and function, all in a civilian/competition package. Accuracy has been confirmed to be under 1/2 MOA using SMK match ammo.

The Stock is the Bell & Carlson A5 Medalist Kevlar/Polymer with adjustable cheek rest and butt plate and fully aluminum block floated. Additional slop in the recoil lug has been taken up by a custom T6 aircraft-grade block forward of the lug for complete precision fit and stability. Stock is custom hand finished in ""Winter Camo"" duracoat. The barrel/receiver is also duracoated with a custom pattern in ""Carbon Stealth Grey"" to match/enhance stock camo.

The bolt knob is a Surgeon Tactical CNC S/S custom threaded & fitted and highly polished. The barrel is precision lathe threaded in 5/8x24 and fitted with the Advanced Armament (AAC) brake/Flash Hider with external quick lock thread for sound suppressor and complete flash elimination. The action, raceway, feed-ramp, etc are hand polished/lapped for quiet and effortless function. The bolt locking lugs are lapped for 98% full contact. The firing pin and spring is upgraded to Tubbs Speedlock light alloy pin, improving lock time by 60% to 1.9 ms. The detachable box magazine is a 10 round from Wyatt. The Remington trigger is gunsmithed to a smooth 3.4lb and non-adjustable - I prefer the old school triggers over the current x-marks pro offering. Leupold Mark 4 steel rails installed and to upgraded 8-40 retapped holes for 40% more torque. Leupold Mark 4 30mm steel rings precision installed, rings precision hand lapped lapped. Rings are etched-marked front/rear.

It has the 18 1/2 barrel, which makes it a superb home defense shotgun. I bought it when I was 18 and I have owned it for 3 years and I have not had a single issue with it, and I have probably put about 100- 125 shells though it. It will shoot as fast as you can pump the next shell into it. The setup I have is very comfortable and surprisingly light. 

Included in the package is as follows:
The shotgun: ~$200
Black Aces Tactical rail: ~$150 
Hogue OverMolded rubber grip: ~$25
Mesa Tactical stock adapter: ~$75
ATI Universal Six Position StrikeForce Tactical Shotgun Stock: ~$80
ATI Shotforce Shotshell holder: $16
EOTech 512 CHINESE KNOCKOFF: ~$20 
(NOTE: This optic LOOKS like an EOTech 512, but it is NOT the real deal)...that being said, it works well as a red dot optic but not as durable as the real thing (obviously).
12 Gauge Bore snake: ~$17
Mixed 12 gauge ammo (mostly target load, but there is a box of slugs as well): $25

All of the above items were bought over time and add up to +$600 invested into this gun. I used it to plink and as a home defense piece and have treated it very well. 

I am asking $300 but it is negotiable, just shoot me an offer. The worst I will say is ""no thanks"". If you have any questions, shoot me an email."

Unlike a chromed lined barrel that only treats the bore of the barrel, a Melonite Nitride barrel is completely treated inside and out. It hardens the metal of the bore to a Chrome like hardness or greater for wear resistance and adds a lube like slippery finish for less friction and corrosion protection three times greater than chrome. The outside of the barrel is also hardened for scratch and corrosion resistance and gives the barrel a beautiful black finish. In fact a Melonite Nitride treated barrel is almost completely resistant to salt water. Also the hot gas discharge of crud and carbon does not stick to a Melonite Nitride treated barrel.

This light weight over/under won’t break your back or the bank.  Weighing in at just 6 lbs, it is a full 2 lbs lighter similar steel framed models.  With all the gear we find ourselves carrying into the field today, (like remotes for training collars, gps, cell phone, extra ammo and a bottle of water just to name a few) I don’t mind taking advantage of the opportunity to shed a couple of pounds.  In Kansas we have a daily bag limit of four pheasants.  The recoil is a little more than my sporting clays gun, but it sure isn’t too much for my typical day in the pheasant fields.  12 ga 2 3/4 "", 28"" bbls, extractors only.

Now the same Benelli M4 used by the U.S. Marine Corps can be your home defense shotgun of choice. When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a shotgun, they bought the M4 — the 12-gauge shotgun that functions the first time, every time. Its unique Auto Regulating Gas Operated (A.R.G.O.) system developed by Benelli engineers has dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber that operate directly against the bolt assembly.

The M4 Tactical comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a fully adjustable ghost-ring rear sight and fixed-blade front sight and a black synthetic pistol-grip style stock. An optional standard stock is offered. With features and reliability that do it for the U.S. military, the Benelli M4 is an excellent choice for your own home defense plan.

As for condition, the blueing looks good, although there is some holster wear in the usual places, but the barrel is beautiful and it is mechanically sound. I am not in a huge rush to sell, I am just seeing what else it out there. I am primarily looking for cash $600 (or $625 with 48 rounds of winchester 32 acp).

As for trades, I want to get into the 1911 or hi-power game. For a 1911 I am thinking I want to go with a Remington R1 but offer up whatever, though it must be in 45. (Unless you want to trade a springfield EMP in 40). Not too picky about the hi-power except it must be in 9mm. I am also interested in uncut Webleys in .455, enfield NoI MkIII's in .303… Oh and if you have a West German PPK or PPK/S in 380 I would go for that too, but I would prefer a pre 68 with a lanyard loop. If you couldn't tell I like older stuff. Oh and 30-06 ammo that would be suitable for an M1 Garand. I also have access to many types of optics (Aimpoint, Eotech, Trijicon, Leupold) if that floats your boat.

This is a VZ52 she rifle that was imported by Century Arms back in the early/mid 1990's.

t has been literally untouched since the person got it from Century.  It still has the idiot hang tag that came with the rifle.  The rifle still has the armory grease in the barrel and other components.  At some time in it's life, the stock was recoated with some kind of textured painting, which has peeled off on parts of the the stock..  I've done a little research and it's not clear whether this was done by Century, or done by the Czechs before they exported them.  And of course because of the age of the gun, there's some pitting on the bayonet and some rust on the muzzle of the barrel.

In other words, it's a rare rifle that you don't see anymore.

With the rifle comes five (5) boxes of ammunition

SMITH & WESSON MODEL 36,  Designed to be small and compact, this series Model 36 has a pinned 1.875 inch barrel which makes it an ideal CCW handgun.  This gun looks great with about 99% factory blue, virtually no wear.  Does not look like it has ever been holstered.  Locks up tight, and functions very well with no play. Has a 1 7/8"" pinned barrel with an excellent clean shiny bore, and factory walnut grips that look like new. This is a five shot steel cylinder/frame. Trigger has serrated front, and as with the hammer exhibits strong color case hardening!

The very thin drag line on cylinder attests to very little use. As you can see in the pictures, it's almost flawless.  The S&W MODEL 36 is a pinnacle of handgun craftsmanship within the venerable manufacturer's history. Up until 1981 all Smith and Wesson revolvers were handmade and fitted by craftsman that were unmatched in their trade.  

If you are looking for a revolver, don't even look at the new because they are no match to the quality of the pre 1981 handcrafted S&W's.

Comes with Don Hume IWB Holster.

I've got 8 collectible Avon cologne pistols with boxes. 7 out of 8 are full of cologne, but one leaked/evaporated.

850,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3127850,For Sale:  Glock 19/23/32 Storm Lake 9MM Ported Barrel - Glock 17 Mag - Pearce +2 Extension - A&G Grip Extender,"Nashville - Downtown, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 220,"Listed On: Monday, June 2, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"FOR SALE

This is a complete kit to transform your Glock 23 or 32 to 9MM or to add a stainless steel ported barrel to your Glock 19. It also includes a Glock 17 (Genuine) magazine with a Pearce +2 magazine extension and an A&G grip extender (to fill the gap).

I used the set-up for two purposes. The first was to shoot cheaper (and more available) 9MM ammo out of my Glock 32 (.357 Sig). The second was to use my Glock for tactical drills and speed shooting. I've since moved on to a 1911 and this kit has been collecting dust in my safe.

The first reason is probably pretty obvious. 9MM ammo is about $15/box cheaper than .357 Sig and about $6/box cheaper than .40 S&W. What you may not realize is that the ported barrel has a pretty dramatic effect on felt recoil and muzzle flip from the 9MM round. It also adds about another 1/2"" to the barrel, increasing accuracy. That makes it great for speed shooting and tactical drills and the 19 round capacity of the extended magazine will have to out in the field for a while before needing to reload.

I used this set-up on a Gen 3 Glock 32. I'm unsure as to how it would function on a Gen 4. You're welcome to install it and try it out to ensure it will function. It performed flawlessly on mine with 115gr loads. I did not have to change the stock spring.

This barrel will not work on a full size Glock (17/22/31). I'm unsure as to whether or not it will function on a sub-compact (26/27/33). My gut says it will not, but again, you're welcome to try.

I'm open to hearing what you have for trade (including me or you adding boot), but I'm mainly interested in cash. My Glock 32 is not for sale.

The action is smooth and the trigger is crisp. If you're looking for a 'Safe Queen' or mint condition rifle for collection purpose, this is probably not the gun.
