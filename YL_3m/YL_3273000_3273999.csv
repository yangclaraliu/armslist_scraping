It is a 5 shot .44 Magnum with a 2.5 inch barrel, blue. This awesome revolver comes stock with a fiber optic front site and great rubber grip that has to be felt to be believed. 

This gun has only had 5 shots fired through it, ever, and those were .44 special, not magnums, so it is very nearly brand new. 44 special are very controllable in this small but sturdy package. I would imagine full magnums might be a bit snappy, but specials are pretty awesome. The five rounds I fired were just to test funcionality. While it's a cool gun, it doesn't fit my needs, so I'm looking to sell or trade. As far as I know, you won't find many of these in Massachusetts.

I was able to conceal this fairly well, it's hefty but not crazy heavy, and was very accurate at 15 yards, surprisingly so. The fiber optic front site is very handy.

Included is the original cardboard box, all paperwork it came with, 95 rounds of Blazer hollowpoints, 20 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense 165 gr FTX, and one speed loader. BAM!

I am looking to trade this for a Ruger SR9 full size, first. I might be willing to trade for other full size 9mm semi autos, or possibly sell outright for $450 but trade for SR9 is first option. On eFA10, within reasonable distance of Millbury/Worcester/Uxbridge. 

Thanks for looking! 

Statement of Legal compliance:
I will comply with all Federal and State Laws. I will not ship this firearm.  All transactions must be face to face with a properly licensed Massachusetts resident. 

When ammunition, magazines or other regulated items are sold/bought or traded as part of this transaction, I agree to follow all applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations pertaining to these items."

As shown in the pictures, there is also an adjustable bipod mounted on the rifle that is also included in addition to a rifle case.  
I've priced this rifle to sell as I'm unable to take it with on an upcoming move abroad.  That said, I don't appreciate low ball offers.  As I paid just over $1000 for he rifle, another $350 for the scope and to have it mounted, $100 for the bipod, and I'd guess $50 for the case, totaling roughly $1500.  As you will have the additional benefit of avoiding sales tax, I find the asking price of $750 to be very fair.

first is the Yugo M92, which was converted from a pistol. It is 922r compliant and has been duracoated. It has had several hundred rounds fired through it, but functions flawlessly. Depending on the trade/sale it can come with a second side folding stock, a number of yugo bolt hold open mags, 75 round drum mag, and even ammo (again, for the right trade). I can certainly provide additional detail upon requet)

the second is the M85, which is an underfolder. It has also been converted from a pistol but has not been fired. It is chambered in 5.56x45 and is also 922r compliant. For the right deal it can also come with a number of the steel (not polymer junk) AK mags, and ammo.

I would be willing to trade each one individually, or both depending on what is being offered.

Please understand that while these are both 'AK's', they are not poor quality, everyday models. They are not the easiest to find, and the configuration that each one is in is even less common. These were made by the Zastava factory, and not in someones garage on a 'no name' receiver.

89,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3273089,For Sale:  Spanish Civil War M91/30,"Springdale, Fayetteville, Arkansas",$ 400,"Listed On: Sunday, July 13, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I've got a Mosin from the Spanish Civil War, a 1936 Tula model. It's definitely an SCW Mosin, with the post sight, rough stock, wire sling hanger, and a faint MP8 mark. Numbers do not match, but on SCW's, none of them do. The bore looks great, but I havent shot or cleaned it. 

If you dont know the significance of an SCW Mosin, don't waste either of our time with responses like ""I can buy that at Bubbas gun shop for $150!"". No, not one like this you can't. Or maybe you can and Bubba is an idiot, in which case I'm buying his too. This rifle is rated an 8/10 on rarity, so you might not see another one locally for quite a while. I know in years of Mosin collecting, this is the first i've seen. Pictures upon request!

I might be interested in a trade, but i've got selective interests. If you've got a PPS-43C or something like that we can definitely make a trade - I like old Soviet stuff, or remakes of said. This is a bit random, but I'd also love an old project DJ-5 postal jeep...they usually sell for around this price in unrestored condition. But, I'm open to other things, so let me know what you've got!"

This is an oldie but a goodie, i recently acquired this from a friend but do not have much use for it.  This would be a great collection piece or a nice field gun.  This thing is built like a brick shit house with heavy duty steel receiver, they don't build them like this anymore.  This is a browning design and as such contains the browning proof marks on barrel, bore is clean and the whole gun is in good condition for its age.  Very nice patina to the whole gun, absolutely no rust whatsoever.  This would also make a good platform to convert into a trench gun.  I have not fired it, action cycles smoothly.

Will Sell Complete Rifle or Complete Upper.  Will not sell just the Lower, until Upper sells.
This AR .22 has been 100% Reliable for the 600+- Rounds Ive put thru it. Also VERY Accurate!  I havn't found any brand of .22lr it will not shoot! It flys thru even the cheapest of cheap ammos! The Spikes Tactical Lower only has around 100rds on it!  And is 100% ready to swap out this .22 upper with any other Caliber upper..  Mostly Interested in Selling, but will entertain trade offers.  I am in no hurry to Sell this, and will not give it away!  All Low Ball offers will be ignored!  I have roughly over 1100.00 invested between this Upper and Lower! (feel free to price out these parts) I will sell just the Upper for 400.00 firm. or the Complete Rifle for 725.00 firm.  I will include 2 newer CMMG 26rd. Magazines, and have many more mags, along with lotsa ammo to throw in in the deal is right..  Thanks for looking!"

Here's the story, I've had a couple of heart surgeries and now I have a 45 / 50 lb. weight restriction. Meaning I will have to have a bow with between a 45 - 49 lbs. draw (I have found one PSE bow with a 50 LB. draw weight. The Archery shop was able to get it down to 49lbs.).
I have two bows I’m trying to sale, one is a High Country “American” Supreme LT, Compound Bow.
I got this and the PSE bow in a packaged deal, the guy said he would let them go cheap because the string had slipped off the cams of the High Country bow.    The bow has 3 strings on it so I brought them home.

Took it to archery store today and got the PSE adjusted down to 49 lbs. But it turns out the High Country bow is supposed to have a fourth string! So the string is missing. 

To read the full ad go to the top left corner of this ad and click on Listings by this user

The second bow is an Indian - Stalker compound bow, the draw weight is adjustable for 45, 50 & 55 lbs. (This can be done without a bow press). 
I was in the process of making a fishing rig out of this bow, it has a new roller rest and nocking points installed. And comes with a Browning ""tape on fishing reel” (all metal no plastic), two fishing points & one arrow. 

To read the full ad go to the top left corner of this ad and click on Listings by this user.

Asking $190.00 for both bows.

I am looking for another bow capable of 45 – 50 lb. draw to have as a backup bow. Prefer a Bear or PSE but will look at all bows. 
Would trade both of my bows for one good ready to shoot bow in the 45 – 50 lb. draw range. Depending on accessories might add other items in the trade.

This Polish Makarov was built in 1967
-Is single action and double action. SA pull is very light and DA pull is somewhat strong but can be fixed with aftermarket springs. The pull didn't bother me so the pistol retains its factory springs 
-Has a built in decocker so that you can load one in the chamber and reset the hammer
-Built with all steel so it is heavy, but strong
-Holds 6+1 rounds of 9x18 Makarov
-Comes with 3 magazines (cost about $35 each) and ~130 rounds of 9x18
-Works great for concealed carry! Fits in the pocket of most pants, and hides in the waistband easily due to the pistol being slim.

As far as trade value:
-P64 with one mag $300
-P64 with both mags $360
-P64 with both mags and ammo $400

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

This is by far the best striker fired handgun I've shot. The trigger is just over 4 lbs and has a very low bore axis making it very pleasant to shoot.  The ONLY reason I'm selling is because the gun will not function with my suppressor, but functions flawlessly otherwise. My silencer is just too heavy on the end of the barrel for the slide to lock all the way forward after each shot, but I've been told by some steyr experts that this model cycles just fine with lighter suppressors like the AAC Ti-Rant. Even if you don't own a suppressor this is one heck of a cool gun. Very accurate and has never malfunction unless the suppressor was attached. I hate to get rid of it but need the money to buy a gun that will work with my silencer. If you any question or want more info just call or text me at REDACTED."

Very accurate shooter and handles recoil exceptionally well. Zero FTE's zero FTF's. It is the top of the line model, all the options you can get. Night sights etc.  I also bought a StealthGear Onyx holster for it(rated #1 most comfortable IWB holster on the market). Paid the $106 and waited a month for it to come in. I was going to carry it but while I was waiting for the holster to come in my FFL showed me a Glock 42 and I just prefer that to carry instead. So I never even carried the FNS except for about 15 min to check out the holster. I was impressed. Also have brand new SafariLand OWB holster. I think that was about $40. Anyway, I dont shoot it so its all for sale.
