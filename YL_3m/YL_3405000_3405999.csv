Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.

The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

The LC9 has a 3.12"" barrel, is 6.0"" long and 4.5"" tall, making for a very compact 9mm pistol. The LC9 is impressively narrow at a mere .90"" wide, and weighs only 17.1 ounces with an empty magazine. Featuring a black polymer (glass-filled nylon) frame and blued alloy steel slide and barrel, the lightweight, full-featured Ruger LC9 offers the versatility and capability of the popular 9mm cartridge in a highly compact, reliable, and user-friendly pistol. The LC9 is a double-action-only, hammer-fired, locked-breech pistol with a smooth trigger pull. Control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. The Ruger LC9 features smooth ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing. One seven-round, single-column magazine is provided with each LC9 pistol. The magazine's standard flat floorplate aids concealability, while the provided finger grip extension floorplate offers an option to shooters who prefer a longer grip surface with more hand-to-pistol contact. The wider rear aperture of the dovetailed, low-profile, two-dot rear sight aids quick acquisition of the single-dot, dovetailed front sight. This high-visibility, three-dot sight system provides fast, positive sight alignment. The slide locks open on an empty magazine and the external slide stop is easy to reach and manipulate for positive firearm functioning. A single-sided manual safety and a magazine disconnect are additional features of the Ruger LC9.

CZ 75 P-01
The P-01 9mm was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN.

All are in excellent condition.  Some convert to .32 and able to use the Expert magazines, some are not.  Some have a single stage trigger, most can use either single or two stage triggers.  All can accept a 10"" barrel if that is desired.

Price range is from $600 to $3800.  At 600, one has an extremely accurate .and reliable 22lr handgun with adjustable trigger weight, but no ability to convert to .32 or vary trigger position.  5 or 10 rd magazines, the 10 rd aftermarket only.

All are cosmetically not quite perfect, all are mechanically perfect.  The lowest priced one ($600, see my other listings), is near-perfect cosmetics.

FFL transfer only.

Price is with one .22 magazine, but others available with purchase of the gun. 

For the Curious

This series or the Expert?

These guns are every bit as accurate as the Expert series. The firing mechanism is essentially identical.  The cartridge feed is slightly different.  The moving parts in the breech are hardened, but not TiN coated, which some prefer and others do not.  The recoil buffer of the Expert series is not present on these guns, which some see as an advantage, others see as a problem.  The sight radius is longer, as the Expert moves the front sight closer to the grip.

For the price difference and balance of cost vs quality, this gun may well be preferable, but it's a matter of opinion and taste.

Hammerli, AW93, or GSP?  Something best discussed by phone.

Depending on how one counts versions of the GSP, the one illustrated is the 3rd type that was produced in any quantity, and excluding the early 1960s OSP from that series (the frame was quite different, as was the modularity). The one at $700 is the first type after the prototypes.  

The one illustrated is  the first version designed to accept the current series of .32 magazines, and the .22 magazines with the front and side ribs. The frame width, as well as the magazine width differ, but triggers do interchange, including the 2 stage modules that are sold with most of the Expert series. It also accepts the various .32 upper sections as well as the magazines, and the 10"" and rifle barrels.

Some prefer the Expert series to these guns, some do not. The main differences are that this series did not use a kinetic recoil buffer that mimics the AW93, and used hardened steel internal parts rather than a TiN coating. Also, the barrel is stabilized by geometric cross section, not by thermal stress relief, and is rectangular cross section rather than round like the Expert. The sight radius also is longer.

There are so many options with this gun, the price is only ""approximate"" as each of the options will raise the price a bit, except for some of the alternative grips that are available. Two of those optional grips are special for small to very small hands.

The options (grips, cases, magazines, weights, upper sections) are available with gun purchase only .... the new ATF rules on importing more of those make it impossible to offer them separately now.

Other GSP also available, a few at lower price, most at higher prices than this.  Please email via ask the seller, if interested in the options, lower, or higher cost versions.  Also some .22-only guns are available, that will not accept the current .32 magazines.

This gun is one of several target and ""other use"" pistols available, which are NOT listed on Armslist.  For a complete list and EXPERT'S SELECTION GUIDE to these guns, please email.  The guide and list are free.

A few of these GSP are .22lr only (convertible to .22s but not .32 SWL WC).  Those are lower in price, but do not use the ""Expert"" or current series of magazines.  Older magazines for them are available, however, in 5 and 10 rd capacities.

CZ 75 D Compact With Night Sights
SKU: 91194
Light alloy frame de-cocker model featuring an extended magazine release, low profile snag-free sights, and a loaded chamber indicator.
Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing.

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. 

All USPs use a corrosion-proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The nitro-carbuerized steel slide has a corrosion-resistant blued finish. 

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The 5 round mag can be interchanged with the 17 round .22 TCM pistol mag, turning this into a high-capacity rifle.

The mainspring housing is the original arched style found on GI issue 1911-A1s, but it includes the Springfield Armory® I.L.S.™ The pistol also has a standard spur hammer and standard grip safety. The single-sided, non-extended thumb safety and short military combat trigger are true to the original 1911-A1 design. The Combat 3-Dot sights are fixed, and the ejection port is lowered and flared. Each Mil-Spec comes with a beautiful pair of cross-cannon emblazoned walnut grips that are held in place with slotted grip screws."""

Design Notes -
Although most striker-fired guns are classified as double-action-only - including the Glock - the XD is correctly classified as a single-action design, which has confused some. This is because when the slide is racked, the striker is charged to a full cock position. And although the trigger pull is as long as the Glock's, its pull weight is noticeably light and constant, taking no part in cocking the striker, only releasing the sear at the end of its stroke.

Most single-action autos have manual safeties, but the XD's Croatian designers eliminated the need for such safeties by adopting the Glock-type trigger safety as well as an internal firing-pin block. They also added a grip safety which blocks the sear from releasing the striker until it is squeezed. 

The caliber -
SIGARMS, in partnership with Federal Cartridge, developed the 357 SIG cartridge in 1994. The 357 SIG cartridge uses a bottlenecked .40 S&W casing crimped to a 9mm bullet; this is why the 357 SIG is not written as "".357"", as it is not truly a .357 caliber bullet, but is instead a standard 9 mm parabellum (.3550 in). The 357 SIG design is an attempt to create a cartridge with stopping power that would approach the larger .357 Magnum revolver round, but in a smaller package that can fit comfortably in the grip of a semi-automatic weapon.

There is a large selection of 357 SIG bullet weights available in factory loadings. Generally, the range is from an 87 grain ""screamer"" (running 2000 FPS+ in velocity) to a high of about 150 grains.

The following data set is based on standard factory loaded cartridges fired from a 4"" barrel chronographed at 20 feet. This is only a very small sample of what is available.

100 grain Cor-Bon Pow R Ball: 1,703 Feet Per Second
115 grain Triton BHP : 1,564 Feet Per Second
124 grain Hornady JHP XTP : 1,329 Feet Per Second
125 grain Cor-Bon JHP : 1,439 Feet Per Second
147 grain Speer JHP GD : 1,186 Feet Per Second

Handgun Observations -
The XD's square slide, polymer frame and trigger safety are extremely similar to the Glock design, although in my opinion the single-action trigger pull is much more appealing.
150 grain Federal JHP : 1,130 Feet Per Second

The slide is tight and trim with virtually no rattle when shaken.

The XD has a grip angle and grip safety similar to the 1911, and the takedown lever and barrel lockup appear to be copied from SIG.

Like most polymer frame guns, the XD is a little top-heavy when empty, but not nearly as noticeable as a Taurus PT, Beretta 9000, or similar S&W design. When fully loaded, the gun is perfectly balanced.

The gun tested was marketed during the ""ban era"" and as such, came supplied with only 10-round magazines.

You can't load the +1 round into the open breech. The loaded chamber indicator gets in the way and prevents the breechblock from locking. The +1 round must be loaded from the top of an inserted magazine, after which the magazine can be removed, the top round replaced, and magazine re-inserted.

Shooting -
I was completely surprised by this pistol's shooting action. The trigger's single-action pull weight and great grip ergonomics combined to make this one of the most accurate guns I have fired. Although the 357 SIG cartridge gave a loud report, actual recoil was minimal."

Remington is one of the leaders in rimfire ammunition advancements. For years generations of shooters learned by using Remington rimfire ammunition and many still use it today for hunting and completion. Remington uses the same high level of care to produce their rimfire ammunition as their centerfire ammunition. For everything from bullseyes to tin cans, or prairie dogs Remington rimfire ammunition has you covered.

Remington Golden Bullet loads create a pleasant shooting experience for young shooters as well as high scores for competitors. Golden Bullets are loaded with clean burning powder and plated bullets making them perfect for semi-automatic firearms. The solid bullet is a good candidate for both small game hunting and plinking.

Hey all, 
I got a order of 22lr that came in from a little while back. The shipping was pretty steep on them but given how much of a pain they are to find I grabbed them anyways in case anyone needs them. These are for pickup in Norman only and really not looking to trade, but if you have some swede Mauser, 7.62x54r Nagant, or 44mag ammo I might listen to a offer. But it would have to be more slanted to my end, simply because I don't ""need"" the ammo. Would even consider trades for cheap guns that may need some work on them. Easiest is just to shoot me a text though.
Here is what I have:
1X federal champion 500rd 22LR- $45
Again, these are at cost (28.99 + 16.02 shipping) so I'm only looking to meet here in town and prices are firm. To grab some either shoot me a message on here or a text at REDACTED. 
Thanks all and happy hunting!

It's the 12.5 inch barrel version. I've only put 300 rounds through it. The previous owner was a family friend. They never fired it, so it only has the 300 down the tube. I put up a picture of some damage to the finish near the windage drum. I bought a cheap NC Star sighting tool and the hole wasn't big enough for the windage drum to move into. I thought the drum was just stiff from being new-ish. Me being an idiot, I gave the tool a couple extra whacks with a hammer and made it clamp even harder on the finish. That's what happened there. Besides that, the gun has always shot very reliably and is a fun gun to shoot. I'll include at least a steel mag and a tapco mag.

It's the 12.5 inch barrel version. I've only put 300 rounds through it. The previous owner was a family friend. They never fired it, so it only has the 300 down the tube. I put up a picture of some damage to the finish near the windage drum. I bought a cheap NC Star sighting tool and the hole wasn't big enough for the windage drum to move into. I thought the drum was just stiff from being new-ish. Me being an idiot, I gave the tool a couple extra whacks with a hammer and made it clamp even harder on the finish. That's what happened there. Besides that, the gun has always shot very reliably and is a fun gun to shoot. I'll include at least a steel mag and a tapco mag. If you have any questions or want a pic of anything else, just shoot me a message. Thanks!"
