Our eBay link to order is down below. Please visit to purchase.

Shell Aerospace grease (Aeroshell 33MS) that meets mil-spec MIL-G-21164D, for barrel & nut assembly on AR platform upper receiver threads.Also good for installing LPK pins

As used on gov - military sample builds, offered here in 5ml jars for your own barreling projects. It possesses enhanced anti-wear and anti-corrosion properties and is particularly suitable for lubricating heavily loaded sliding steel surfaces. 

AeroShell Grease 33MS is extreme pressure (EP) grease based on the proven lithium complex technology of AeroShell Grease 33, and is fortified with 5% Molybdenum Disulphide.


The benefits of Grease 33MS:

• Improved anti-wear and corrosion resistance

• Allows for easy Install & Removal of AR Barrels

• Add on LPK PINS/Detents for easy install & Removal

• Mil-Spec fully approved to MIL-G-21164D Grease at an affordable price, so no need to use automotive grease that hurts your barrel, upper receiver and threads

• It is fully compatible with AeroShell Grease 33, so reduces the risks and problems associated with misapplication

• Load carrying and EP properties equal to that of the well-established AeroShell Grease 17

• NATO Code G-353


How we process this grease:

We transfer our grease in our clean room in our Brick & Mortar store located in Casa Grande. We transfer the grease from a new sealed tight original 3kg container, which we order from Shell’s main distributors in Phoenix, Arizona. In the transfer process nitrile gloves are worn to keep any chance of dirt from getting into the grease. We use medical grade plastic syringes to further ensure a safe and clean transfer of this grease. Afterward, we then use a stainless steel scoop that presses the grease down to ensure no air bubbles are in the jar and then scraped. This guaranties the fullest possible amount with no grease to overflow.

I had about 200 rounds on it and it developed a crack in the chamber face . HK replaced it with a NEW factory barrel ,documentation is available . I got it back and slow fired about 40 rounds through , basically taking a shot and then pushing a brush and then a patch . I always out through the chamber , and it was a chore to say the least , but whatever , that's what I do with a new barrel . The main reason I do this is to reduce fouling . I've been busy shooting other stuff and never went back to it . If you shoot 62gr or higher ammo this thing is a true tack driver . The way the barrel is crowned it also sounds like a cannon , so I have been told . You will not shoot a smoother more accurate rifle for the money . It's got a 20"" Chrome lined hammer forged barrel . This is the same action as on the G-36 rifle . 

The only reason I'm selling it is to move on to a bolt rifle .  I think with 69 or even 77gr ammo with this SL8 you could have some fun out to 6 or 700 yards .

Shell Aerospace (Aeroshell 33MS) grease that meets mil-spec MIL-G-21164D, for barrel & nut assembly on AR platform upper receiver threads.Also good for installing LPK pins

As used on gov - military sample builds, offered here in 5ml jars for your own barreling projects. It possesses enhanced anti-wear and anti-corrosion properties and is particularly suitable for lubricating heavily loaded sliding steel surfaces. 

AeroShell Grease 33MS is extreme pressure (EP) grease based on the proven lithium complex technology of AeroShell Grease 33, and is fortified with 5% Molybdenum Disulphide.


The benefits of Grease 33MS:

• Improved anti-wear and corrosion resistance

• Allows for easy Install & Removal of AR Barrels

• Add on LPK PINS/Detents for easy install & Removal

• Mil-Spec fully approved to MIL-G-21164D Grease at an affordable price, so no need to use automotive grease that hurts your barrel, upper receiver and threads

• Load carrying and EP properties equal to that of the well-established AeroShell Grease 17

• NATO Code G-353


How we process this grease:

We transfer our grease in our clean room in our Brick & Mortar store located in Casa Grande. We transfer the grease from a new sealed tight original 3kg container, which we order from Shell’s main distributors in Phoenix, Arizona. In the transfer process nitrile gloves are worn to keep any chance of dirt from getting into the grease. We use medical grade plastic syringes to further ensure a safe and clean transfer of this grease. Afterward, we then use a stainless steel scoop that presses the grease down to ensure no air bubbles are in the jar and then scraped. This guaranties the fullest possible amount with no grease to overflow.

I have a completely unissued, unfired CZ-52 (more accurately known as a vz. 52) pistol for sale.  How, you ask?  The good folks at CzechPoint stumbled across them a few years ago, and I will let them tell the story: 

-----

How are these unissued vz. 52 pistols made available?  While opening boxes of ‘very good condition’ pistols that were sold previously, CzechPoint discovered a very limited quantity of unissued pistols.  We put these pistols to the side and are now selling these last few remaining ones.   It is ‘first come, first served on these unissued pistols.

Pistols are unissued, but some have more handling and storage marks than others (after all, these pistols are 60 years old!).  Further, some pistols will exhibit patina on the slide and/or frame and possible dings in metal or grips from handling by Czech armorers.  These pistols were stored in wooden vz.52 pistol boxes and you can see this wooden storage box in one of the thumbnails. Pistols were wrapped in plastic, and every five to ten years, were removed from the wooden boxes and plastic bags and completely inspected/function-checked by Czech armorers. Holsters are in very good serviceable condition.  Just to confirm, vz. 52 pistol holster leather varies so the holster you receiver may not match the photo (there are light and dark color holsters in addition to different types of texture).  Further, lanyards differ in material so not all lanyards will look like the one in the photo.

The magazine included with the pistol had been inserted and removed a number of times, so the finish on the magazine will be worn.  In addition, the magazine included with the pistol had been used to remove the barrel from the slide during inspection by Czech armorers.  Therefore, you’ll see cosmetic wear on magazine floor plates.  The pistol shown the in the photo is a good representation of our current unissued inventory.

The ‘CzechPoint’ import engraving is on the frame and can only be seen when the pistol is turned upside down.  A 19 page color instruction manual is included – written by CzechPoint.  We may be a little partial, but we feel it is the best manual written on the vz.52.

-----

I snagged two when they were available, shot one, and held on to the other until I wanted the investment for something else, and here we are. 

The gun comes with its original plastic shrink wrap (complete with the cosmoline I have not cleaned off), a magazine, a holster, a lanyard, a cleaning rod, and the aforementioned instruction manual.  And, yeah, it has not been fired, as far as I can tell.  I will the pictures tell the story.

Asking $450 or best offer for the whole kit.  A little steep, I know, but it is something of a collector’s item, what with it being unfired, and it is doubtful any more in this condition will hit the market any time soon.  Feel free to ping me if you have any questions."

Now.. I did open the box, to marvel at its beauty. I powered it up to make sure everything was good, and it is Perfect! Ever since then, it has never left its protective hard case, or the house for that matter.

My wife purchased this for me as a Christmas present, for an AR-10 build I'm currently working on, but since then I've decided to go with the adjustable magnification of a NightForce instead. She spent over $1100 with shipping, but I am willing to sacrifice this combo at $950.. Cash Only, In Person Only..(No exceptions!) 

I am willing to split up this combo and sell them separately, and I ask $425 for the magnifier, and $550 for the sight. *I am open to trades, but it would have to be something really special.. because I really need the money to finish up this build.

I have not registered the sight or magnifier yet, so you will still be able to register as the original owner, and receive the full unlimited lifetime warranty. If you decide to take a look at the sight, I will suggest for you to call Eotech, and verify authenticity using the serial numbers, before you purchase.

Thank you for looking at my item, and feel confident in contacting me as I am not a dealer or a Craigslist scam artist... just a regular guy. Give me a call, or text at REDACTED.  -John

Overall, this rifle is in amazing shape, considering the age.
The bluing is about 75-85%, case coloring on receiver at about 60-70%, per NRA grading.
Minor rust/patina/wear/pitting on exterior metal, as expected for age.
Wood is in excellent condition. No cracks or repairs, just typical dings and scratches.
This is not a beat-up model 93 like you see so many of here and on other online sales sites.
The bore is clean, no pitting. The rifling is crisp.
I don't think it's been shot all that much, just been around for over 100 years.

Price is somewhat flexible, but don't insult me with lowball ""offers"".

Overall length is about 29.0-30.0 inches. This is a very small carbine I built that was meant for close-midrange shooting. It was meant for fast transitions between targets due to its light weight (around 5.0-6.0lbs. and low recoil (mid length gas and JP buffer spring). With the cold hammer forged lightweight barrel & nickel boron corrosion resistant BCG, this rifle was super accurate, and is built to last you more than a lifetime of shooting with no barrel change. Built on this low-friction system, the action is butter smooth, with NO springy/chalky feeling, and is a very fun gun to shoot. I've only had the privilege of shooting 300 rounds of federal through it. No FTF's/FTE's. NO HAGGLING. PRICE AS SHOWN.

I have built well over 10 AR-15's in my life, and this one is one of the best ones i've built. The rails match up, and everything is zero'd in. I have barely put rounds through this thing, only to test its accuracy and to zero it in. All parts are in new condition.You will save 500 dollars with this purchase. Tell your friends!

I'm treating myself to higher-end nightvision and will no longer need this scope.  It is in excellent condition (I've babied it).  I am the original owner and purchased it at Gander Mountain for $540, and it paid for itself in coyote and fox pelts the first year I owned it.  

The scope has been mounted mostly upon my AR15 coyote rig, and has spent slightly less time on my Remington 597.  On full moon nights, shots out to 175 yards are a no-brainer.  On pitch-black cloudy nights (without an auxiliary IR torch), kill shots out to about 100 yards are possible.  If you have a good auxiliary variable/adjustable beam IR torch, you can stretch that kill zone back out to 175-200.  I DO have a TNVC ELR Torch-V that I would be willing to include for more cash or a better trade.

If you've never owned any NV gear but have been curious, this would be an excellent entry point for you at a reasonable price.  You will spend loads of time in the back yard looking through it, just for fun.  Hunting with it is a blast.

The tube on this scope is flawless; as in - more flawless than some brand new Gen2/Gen3 military-grade tubes I've seen.  If you know about NV tubes, you know they're difficult to manufacture, so even flawed tubes make it into top-priced scopes, even for military purposes.  This scope has zero spots.  None at all.  Super clear.  It also has excellent glass.  Scope has never been pointed toward a light source.  It is as perfect in form and function as it was the day I bought it.

It runs on 2 AA batteries.  I have always removed the batteries from the scope when the season ended.  2AA batteries will last this scope an entire hunting season; it is extremely energy efficient.

The scope also has an input for recording your hunts (recording unit not included, but available online, ebay, etc).

I am usually free on Monday nights if you would like to come look through the scope.  Serious inquiries only, no tire kickers."

An improvement on the 1860 Henry rifle, the Model 1866 still fired the Henry rim fire round and retained most of the Henry design. This 2nd Model has a less severe drop at the rear of the receiver and flares at the forward edge to better mate with the forend. The stocks have been refinished and repaired and the barrel has been refinished, but likely long ago. The rifle has seen some rough use. The left side of the muzzle is compressed from a strong force. We can only imagine how that happened. Visions of confrontations with road agents or other hostiles comes to mind, with a previous owner bravely fending off danger before a lucky shot put him down, hurling this rifle into the rocks below. In any case, from the use this Winchester exhibits, it’s possible that it made it through more than one scrape. The Model 1866 was the beginning of the Winchester legend and was in production for 32 years, long after improvements in design, ammunition and technology provide more modern and powerful rifles. The longevity if the 1866 is a testament to quality of design and execution. What a thrill it would be to own an original example of the first classic Winchester."

Two Colt 6721 HBAR 16"" carbine uppers. Factory built uppers removed from two rifles that I bought new several years back. I shot half a case of federal m855 in each rifle and then put them in the back of the safe. There have a couple small cosmetic blemishes but they look good.

Both uppers are complete with 16"" HBAR barrels with bayonet lugs, A2 flash hiders, standard A2 ""F"" marked front sight bases, A3 flat top uppers with M4 feed ramps, M4 handguards, charging handles and bolt carrier groups. No back up iron sights, sorry.

All new lowers being built into rifles in Maryland have to be HBAR type. Colt is one of the best manufacturers. Consider these as an inexpensive way for you to build your lowers into rifles with minimal effort. All you have to do is push the pins on your complete lower and you are ready to go. 

I'm asking $550 cash or $600 trade value for each upper. What you see in the photos is what you get (minus lowers).

Possible trades: Other guns that don't require a dealer transfer, Omega/Hamilton/Tag Heuer/Marathon or other quality watch, or whatever you have that may strike my fancy. If your trade is worth more I'd obviously add cash or other trade items on my end.

All deals will be in the quiet suburbs outside Baltimore.

I have several hundred feedback (all positive) between ebay, gunbroker, and many firearm and vehicle related forums. This said, I will see to it that everything on my end goes smoothly. The rest is up to you."

No HTML allowed on Armslist) starting at about 24:00These work extremely well for 300 BLK which reportedly can be finicky with some PMags (although I have no problem with any magazines personally). These Lancer's are my personal favorite mag in *any* caliber. 1/$172/$32 FTF in the Hillsboro/Forest Grove area only I only have Olive Drab left (OD Green)The L5 AWM is a hybrid magazine that combines the best features of polymer and steel magazine designs. Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap-around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use. The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET. The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR-L / Mk16, and the ARX160 to name a few, and is available in 20-and 30-round capacity with a translucent or opaque polymer body. Features: Polymer body that is impact resistant through a wide range of temperatures Can be dropped onto the feed lips without damage Withstands 5 foot drop, fully loaded onto concrete at -40o F through +180o F One piece hardened steel wrap-around feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to the polymer body. Can be stored loaded for extended periods of time without feed lip spreading Steel feed lip assembly is PTFE coated for corrosion resistance.

The gun is in nice shape and hasn't been messed with other than the Canjar single set. The bore is bright and looks good to me, the stock has minor wear and the metal is also in nice shape , the stainless barrel shows a few light rubs and scratches but is consistent with a gun of this age that has been used but not abused. (the pictures should speak for themselves). I hate to sell this piece as I have owned it for a long time but I find I just don't shoot it much anymore.

This is a very sought after 20GA that is no longer made and this one was made in 2000. On our very close inspection, we have determine that this Red Label has been fired but is in mint condition. The only way to see that this one has been fired is with a bore light looking inside the barrels. The stainless steel frame is engraved with gold inlaid on both sides and the walnut wood is without any marks and as beautiful in person as it is in the pictures. This beautiful Red Label comes with 5 chokes and a box but we don’t think the box is original to this Red Label. Don’t let this great opportunity pass you by on owning one of the most sought after Red Labels. Perfect for the upland bird hunter that wants to have that one shotgun that stands out from the rest of the other shotguns.
