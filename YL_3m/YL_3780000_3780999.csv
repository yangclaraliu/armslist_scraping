The MALICE Pack, an acronym for Modified ALICE, is Tactical Tailor's improved version of the military issue large ALICE Pack. Our pack takes the proven design of the decades old ALICE Pack and brings into the 21st century and beyond. We started by constructing the entire pack out of 1000 denier Cordura Nylon and reinforcing the high stress areas of the pack. Accessing the pack has been made easier and faster by replacing the snaps on the three main outside pockets with quick release Fastex buckles and adding the same buckles to the main straps. The hook and loop opening on the top flap has been replaced with a zipper and an 8"" x 12"" x 4"" Claymore pocket has been added to the top of the flap. The pack also features a storm flap, carry handle and drain holes in all pockets. Fully compatible with issue ALICE pack frame, straps and belt.
MALICE Pack Version 3:
The MALICE Pack Version 3 is the same as the Version 2 but the zippered pocket on the left side of the pack is replaced by a 7"" x 18"" x 4"" hydration pocket and a non-removable sleeping bag compartment has been added to the bottom of the pack with three cinch straps.
Main Compartment Capacity: 3276 cu. in.
Total Capacity: 6474 cu. in.

It's technically not a pistol or rifle, according to the ATF definition. They call it a ""firearm"". Very helpful, right? :)

This is almost like getting 2 rifles, since you can swap calibers in well under a minute.
Shoot 5.56 at the range, then switch to 300AAC to take down a deer that evening.
Also, the short overall length (only 27.5"" with 300AAC upper, around 31"" with 5.56 upper) makes it easy to handle and maneuver in a vehicle or inside a building. 

Anyway, here are the specifics of the build...

Lower Half:
- New Frontier All-Polymer lower with lifetime warranty (very smooth trigger!)
- Extended takedown and pivot pins (steel) by Xtreme Precision
- Sig Sauer SigTac SB-15 pistol brace, intending for firing with one hand while strapped to the user's arm.
- Extended buffer tube assembly, with single point sling plate
- Forged charging handle with extended tac latch
- Magpul MOE pistol grip

223/5.56 upper:
- Mil-Spec forged upper (Cerro Forge), with forward assist assembly
- 11.5"" Heavy Contour barrel, 1:9 twist, chrome-lined
- Seekins Precision Melonited gas tube, carbine length
- LJC adjustable low profile gas block (US made)
- 12"" free floating carbon fiber modular handguard, with custom 3D printed end cap and (re)movable rails
- Magpul RVG vertical grip (semi-permanent installation, for ATF compliance. Having an OAL of greater than 26"", this is not a short barreled rifle by ATF definition.)
- Custom-machined (by me) 'flash can' style muzzle device, to direct blast forward. 
	Reduces concussive force felt by shooter.

300 AAC Blackout upper:
- 8.5"" barrel, Melonite coated, 1:8 twist, HPT/MPI
- Muzzle threaded 5/8x24, A2-type flash hider
- Low Profile Micro Gas Block
- Pistol length gas system with stainless gas tube
- Carbine length free floated quad rail (T-marked) with vented end cap
- Forged Upper Receiver (Anchor Harvey) with forward assist assembly

Other/shared components:
- Full-auto type bolt carrier, with Barnes Precision bolt
- (2) brand new Tapco 30-round poly mags, one with a ""300AAC"" sticker, so you don't try to load the wrong caliber in the wrong upper!

All components are brand new, other than minimal rounds fired for testing and tuning purposes.

*T-1 micro-type red dot sight shown in photos is NOT included, but is available. Inquire if interested.

Not really looking for trades, but feel free to offer if you have something really interesting."

It is an L framed 6-shot revolver with the full lug.  This is a rare 6"" Nickel model.  Gun is beautiful as the pictures show.  Fired very little and had been a safe queen for quite some time.  Barely noticable turn-line and it looks as good or better in person as it does in the pictures. I'm including two other sets of grips: hogue monogrip rubber and some jordan pachmayer's that are cracked and can be thrown away or used for whatever.

I forgot, also has a very nice Galco leather holster with the soft suede lining so as not to scratch nickel or blued guns.

Perfect lockup, trigger action and timing.  This model was made in 1987 according to the serial numbers.  SandW ceased production of nickel 586's in 1991.

$785.  I encourage people to try and find one of these on the net in 6"" nickel, cause I had a hell of a time.

Text/call (515) six64-5978 with questions or for more detailed pics of the cylinder, chamber, etc, as I have plenty.

Thanks.

The mark on the pic of the right side close to the grip is just a glare/shadow. Not a flaw."

In my case he was offering a gun with some ammo and extras. We agreed on a price and arranged to meet. So last Saturday I traveled 50 miles one way to meet him in Greenville. About ten minutes after the agreed upon time I got a call from him stating that he couldn’t meet with me due to a family situation. He said he could meet with me again this past Wednesday at 6PM. I have contacted him via phone/text/email since Tuesday evening with no response.

The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.

It's based on a Tula Mosin Nagant action, but there's very little of the original gun that wasn't replaced, upgraded, or reworked. Check the photos for a better idea.
I built this to look rustic or distressed, but it's very solid, no junk.

It shoots 7.52x54r ammo, and I'm including around 100 rounds of 147gr steel core Silver Tip. They can't really call this 'armor piercing', due to import and ownership restrictions, but let's just say it was made to punch though steel helmets, so other lighter armor isn't gonna help much.

The barrel was reprofiled, shortened to 20.25"", and threaded 14mm LH, the same as an AK.
The muzzle brake is VERY effective at reducing recoil, and makes a heck of a blast when you fire it. It also has those wicked sharp points for use as a close-in 'deterrent'. :)

All the metal has been Duracoated in OD Green and Desert Brown, with matte black on the scope mount to reduce glare.

The thumbhole stock was hand carved, epoxy-bedded for accuracy and solid mounting, then coated in a rubberized sealant that kinda feels similar to truck bed lining, but thinner and less 'tacky' to the touch. It has a grit texture embedded in the coating to increase grip, especially if your hands are wet.
Over top of that, is a light coat of a softer, more velvety coating, that was then partially removed to give the weathered look.
You can pretty easily remove the top coat if you prefer.
The recoil pad is thicker than most, has custom cut and profiled with a solid aluminum backing plate. It really cuts down the felt recoil.
Between the pad and the muzzle break, I'd say this gun recoils about double that of a 5.56 AR, which isn't much!

The scope mount is custom machined from a solid billet of aluminum, and is mounted in a scout configuration.

I have a cheap red dot type sight on there now, since I was setting this up for close range work, under 75 yards. You could easily get a long eye relief (LER) or 'scout' scope, if you prefer a magnified optic.

All the internal bolts components and bearing surfaces have been polished and Duracoated. They will wear through to bare metal only where actual contact occurs. This offers the best corrosion protection, while making it look and function the best it can.
The bolt handle was forged from a single piece of steel into a ""spoon""-type profile, threaded, then epoxied into the bolt body. This flat profile makes it easier to open and close the action, especially while keeping the sight picture.

There aren't many truly unique guns available these days, so here's your chance to own a real one of a kind. Since I did the work myself, and fabricated several of the parts, I can say with confidence that there is not another one like this on the planet.

More photos available for serious buyers, not looking for trades.
Got another project in mind and need cash to make it happen."

The IC Enhanced rifle uses our Cold Hammer Forged barrels that are spiral fluted to reduce weight. They include a two position gas block, with a bayonet lug, that can be switched between suppressed and non-suppressed modes. This feature enables the user to restrict the gas flow to the piston system, allowing the rifle to run smoothly and compensate for the added back pressure resulting from running a suppressor. We complete the upper with our modular rail in a nine inch length. This handguard utilizes individual rail sections that allow the owner to place accessory rails where they are needed while retaining the slick, low profile nature of the rest of the handguard.

The IC-Enhanced is perfect for those who wish to have a fluted barrel along with an adjustable gas block, allowing you to shoot suppressed.
The IC-Enhanced is essentially identical to the IC-SPR mechanically; with a shorter rail and adjustable gas block.

The IC-SPR may be a better option if you prefer a longer rail and have no use for an adjustable gas block.

This carbine lists for $1725 in stock configuration, the stock costs $225 alone and the sling, mount, selector, oversized mag release and BCM charging handle, trigger group, etc. are probably worth another $200. I'll also include a new $55 Blackhawk! Sportster rifle case and 2 new black PMags rather than the one aluminum mag shown in the photos. You're really gonna like how comfortable the smooth handguard is!

 Now for the extras, available but not included in the quoted price is a new EOTech XPS2-0 with GG&G flip-up covers mounted on a LaRue Tactical ECOS-C quick release mount that places the YHM back-up sights in the lower third of the lens. Mounted up front is an also Streamlight TLR-1SHP white/strobe light with remote activation. If you want the EOTech, mount and covers add $550 to the price (the street price of the EOTech alone is $500 or more, the mount cost $135 and the lens cover was $42). If you want the tactical light plan on another $150. The YHM flash hider/suppressor mount is not included but will be replaced with a birdcage flash hider.

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

Squeaky clean upper !!

Upper only purchase will include all upper components only nothing else and of course a negotiated FS/FT price.

Has been kept in a temperature and humidity controlled gun safe it's whole life, I have all receipts and documentation.  I bought this to go varmint hunting and never went!!

I am a gun aficionado and shot the barrel in properly as factory recommended.  I still shoot no more than ten rounds without a good bore cleaning from the breach only.

I do not shoot this regularly it stays in the safe.  I have a dedicated 16"" upper I use when I go out to shoot for fun, I use the 24"" Varminter upper for long range practice only.

I don't think there's a mark on it, if your interested look up what you think is the going value and maybe we can do a deal.  Remember this is a complete upper just slap on your optics and pull the trigger.

Also, this is a tack driver-factory matched and validated piece of workmanship.  I think this is a generous offer for someone wanting a ""sniper accurate"" or ""varmint accurate"" upper."

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.
