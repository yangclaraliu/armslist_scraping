This is a great gun that I bought for the sole purpose of concealed carry.  I decided to go with the 40 cal over the 9mm because of the extra stopping power.  The gun fires beautifully for a slim, only 1 inch thick, compact gun.  It comes with the 2 backstraps for different hand sizes.  I currently have the bigger strap on it just because I like the way it feels better.  Only reason I'm selling it is because I'm losing my job and need the money more than a gun at this point.  I'm asking $475 or best offer, but don't insult me with low ball offers, this is a quality gun made by Walther not some cheapo.

I'm attaching a link of a review of the gun.

Test envelope date of 8Apr13. I acquired it unfired and have since put 100 DoubleTap 10mm full power rounds and 40 Hornady 40S&W Critical Defense rounds through it with zero malfunctions. The 10mm full power loads are loud and fun, similar to a 357 snubbie and drawing a lot of attention in an indoor range. The Lone Wolf stainless 40 barrel drops in and uses the 10mm mags. I can install the extended slide release & slide lock in five minutes if desired. They came with it and work fine but I prefer a 100% stock gun. Trijicon HD night sights are expensive but my favorites, though the stock white-outline sights come with it. The photos are stock but exactly the same as my pistol, including the rail.

The rifle itself appears to be in fairly good shape, although there may be some to the barrel.  The finish is generally in the 80% range.  Item G-35627-3

Chile has a discrete Mauser series of Rifles, Short Rifles and Carbines, and once one has accumulated all the basic Models, one can go wild on the variations, right up to the 1960s.

Must be the Germanic nature of the Chilean Armed Forces through out its history (Very ""prussian"" in outlook) which maintained everything ""just so""...although their navy did allow Ross Rifles to sneak in, in 1920, with the replacement Cruisers from Britain, which had been sequestered in 1914, along with the original Steyr M1912 Rifles, by the Royal Navy.

Otherwise everything in the Chilean arsenal was 7mm Mauser until the late 1950s, when they went NATO...Even .30/06 Johnson rifles acquired for the ""Carabineros"" (Militarised National Gendarmerie) in the late 1940s-early 50s were converted to 7x57 by sleeving the barrels.

Ruger 5517 Super Redhawk Toklat .454 Casull Revolver, 5 inch Barrel, Stainless Finish, 6 Round

Named for the Toklat River in central Alaska, this Talo version of the Ruger Super Redhawk would make an excellent general purpose handgun. This revolver has a satin stainless finish and an unfluted cylinder with a 5″ slab sided barrel and adjustable sights (red insert ramp front/white outline notch rear). The textured rubber finger groove grips help manage recoil. The powerful .454 Casull is a capable round for defense against bears and other dangerous game. The gun is also capable of shooting the common .45 Colt round allowing for practice without the stiff recoil of the .454. The frame is machined to accept Ruger scope rings (Included). This gun weighs 3 lbs. 2 oz.
The potent Ruger Super Redhawk revolvers are popular among hunters, metallic silhouette shooters and those looking for an added level of safety when outdoors in dangerous game country.

This 1911 has less than 200 rounds through it and has been babied at the range and in the safe, and looks practically new.

This Kobra is loaded with factory options, including an Ed Brown Bobtail for ease of carry, front slide Carry Cuts, flush slide stop, flush cut and crowned barrel and 10-8 night sights that can be used to rack the slide in an emergency.

The slide, frame and barrel fitting on this 1911 is excellent, as can be expected from a custom shop. Little details like the crispness of the manual safety and smooth fitting of the grip safety are excellently done. The trigger is lighter than most 1911s, probably around 4lbs, and extremely crisp with a short reset. Lighter 1911 triggers can be had for a competition gun, but I wouldn't go any lighter on a gun intended for carry.

This is the 5"", full size slide/barrel Kobra. It is not the (otherwise similar) commander size Kobra Carry.

Included with the gun is the original Ed Brown soft case, the original Ed Brown magazine plus an extra Ed Brown magazine. Manual. Lock, Ed Brown Oil. and grip screw wrench.

This gun, brand new from Ed Brown, would run over $2,945 and would involve an extremely long wait as the options are not one of their standard models.

Comes with all of the original hardware and packaging; scope and lenscovers, still-wrapped cleaning kit, original box, packing and manual etc. This is a factory rearsenaled sniper, not a refinished rifle. After wartime the scopes and rifles were disassembled and stored separately, which were later reassembled at random, and stamped to match. While the stock looks like every other mosin and is kinda rough, I dare not refinish it and ruin the history. The bore is beautiful and looks new. Scope glass is clear and bluing on the rifle is 90-95%.

I have added a few goodies as well like a rubber butt-pad for the recoil and length of pull, a reproduction fabric scope cover in flecktarn camo pattern to protect the scope, and I have fabricated bedding plates for the action and spaced the trigger sear with a washer to lighten the trigger pull. All of these are completely reversible obviously and I have all original hardware. 

This rifle is a great piece of history, I just don't have time to enjoy it like I should. I've had fun with it and have been able to get about 2 inch groups at 100 yards from the bench. You can buy one at classicfirearms.com for 550 (without the lens caps), or atlantic firearms for 650, and then pay an extra 25 for FFL and 25 for shipping, or you can take this one at 550 picked up, with all of the extras I've put into it.  I am in Atlanta on the weekends and Carrollton during the week, contact me via email or text for any questions.

I bought this rifle new, I’m the only owner.  It’s had about 100 rounds through it (proper break-in procedures were followed).  It’s in excellent working condition and has superb accuracy tested at over 1000 yards.  I personally feel that it’s more accurate than the other Windrunner models due to the increased metal in the frame as opposed to the magazine fed units.  If you compare the two units, this would not only hold up better it would also flex less under stressed firing conditions.  Just my own observations, based on shooting the different models. 

It breaks my heart give this up as it’s been registered in California and as you know I will never be able to own another one, once I sell this.  I just don’t use it enough and can no longer justify it sitting in my safe.

The price is firm, as any less is just not worth it to me and I’d rather just hang on to it.  Thank you for looking and please email me if you have any questions or need more details or photos.

Basically the story is I had a Chinese Type 53 with a stock that was so far gone it went straight to the trash. I had an extra full size M91/30 stock laying around, so I cut it at where the first barrel band usually goes, sanded it all up nicely, refinished the stock, added the butt pad, and did some dremel work on the outside to accommodate the folding bayonet on the carbine models and on the inside to accommodate the thicker profiles.

The result is a handmade wood stock that will, as you can see from the photos, work for any Mosin Nagant I can think of. Call it ""bubba'd"" if you want, but it is nice and functional and would be a nice option if you need to replace your beat up old stock, but still retain a wood stock without get a modern synthetic one. It kinda looks interesting anyway. 

I'm not really sure how much to ask because I haven't seen really any other stock like this, so surplus M91/30 stocks usually cost about 30 bucks, the butt pad was about 10 and I put countless hours into doing this.

The gun was bought by my Uncle originally for $700, but he gave it to me a while back. He was a collector and I don't think he even shot it except for a few rare times. Since I've had it, I've shot about 25 rounds thru it and cleaned it once. It is in really great condition, never been messed with or modified. I blurred out the serial in 3rd pic, it doesn't have an altered serial.

There are some light smudges and marks on the slide's coating, and the gun is a little dusty. I would have polished the slide and cleaned the gun thoroughly, but I know everyone has their preference on things like that so I am trying to leave the gun as untouched as possible.

It's the 10.5 inch barrel version. I've only put 300 rounds through it. The previous owner was a family friend. They never fired it, so it only has the 300 down the tube. I put up a picture of some damage to the finish near the windage drum. I bought a cheap NC Star sighting tool and the hole wasn't big enough for the windage drum to move into. I thought the drum was just stiff from being new-ish. Me being an idiot, I gave the tool a couple extra whacks with a hammer and made it clamp even harder on the finish. That's what happened there. Besides that, the gun has always shot very reliably and is a fun gun to shoot. I'll include at least a steel mag and a tapco mag. If you have any questions or want a pic of anything else, just shoot me a message. Thanks!

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

The Sightmark Laser Bore Sight provides the most convenient and accurate method for sighting in rifles of all types. Simply chamber the bore sight like a regular bullet and a laser dot will show exactly where the rifle is aiming; it’s easy to sight in any scope without firing a single shot. Live fire is only needed to fine tune the weapon being sighted in order to compensate for inconsistencies, such as bullet drop due to distance. Perfect for hunters, competitive shooters and law enforcement, the Sightmark laser bore sight is sure to take the frustration out of sighting in almost any gun. It’s easy to use and will quickly save both time and money by avoiding prolonged live fire tests at the range; use the extra ammo for honing those shooting skills and for the hunt. A lightweight carrying pouch protects the laser for convenient use in the field. The Sightmark laser bore sight is available in several calibers and gages for use with all the most popular rifles and shotguns.

With the sponsorship, the gun just sits in the closet and it doesn't deserve that.......The rifle has all top of the line components assembled by one of the best precision gunsmiths in the country, all in all I had to wait eight months for this work of art.  The action is a Remington short action 700 trued and blue printed, barrel is a Bartlien 1:8 twist 6.5 creedmoor match barrel with the M40 heavy contour barrel, the stock is a McMillian A5 stock that is glass bedded and free floated and adjustable comb for different size shooters, trigger is a Timney single stage trigger that breaks at 2.5 lbs like a piece of a glass rod, tactical oversized bolt handle, and flush cups for sling, and has a drop bottom metal that accepts AICS magazines.  The mags that come with are a five round and two ten round mags.  

This gun shoots half minute of angle all day long with five shoot groups.  A typical five shoot group is covered by a dime at 100 yards.  At 1000 yards it hits consistently and you will find that any wind calls made on a .308 will be about half with the ballistic coefficient of the creedmoor round.  I hate to sell it! But there is no point in it just sitting in it's case collecting dust not being driven to it's limit.  My good fortune in regards to sponsorship is your good fortune in getting a turn key rifle that you don't have to wait almost a year for.  If you have any question contact me at REDACTED"
