The 721 is the predecessor to the 700. This is an extremely accurate rifle. You do not see 721's in this condition often. Here is your chance at a great deer rifle that is maybe even older than you - it's older than me...

The bore on this rifle is excellent, and the wood is excellent as well. Many dealers have told me this Remington is an honest 85-90 on a scale of 100.

Please look at the trade below, as I am not really interested in selling outright, however we do have deer season coming up and you can't beat the .270 as a great caliber for deer.

I would be glad to meet you in Cranberry, or somewhere near PIT airport, Moon Township, or near Beaver Valley Mall / Monaca / Rochester. I also am in Squirrel Hill on Tuesday and Thursday nights, and Sundays. I also am in Harmarville on Sundays.

The pistol is in very good condition – no scratches, scrapes or missing parts, only some holster wear by the muzzle and where the action moves.

These are very accurate pistols, due to their high quality and fixed barrel.  The sights are drift adjustable and night sights are still made for it.  Recoil is mild and follow up shots are quick and easy.  Serial numbers on the frame and slide match.  An interesting and rare fact about this piece is that the last two digits of the serial number on the frame are over struck.  The original number being 69 and re-struck to 70 – don’t believe that happens very often at the HK factory!  Imported by HK, Arlington, VA.

These are not the Mosin Nagant 91/30 which was the re-design in 1930. This is the orginal model rifle. 
All three are complete, including upper handguard and cleaning rods. 

The first is a 1915 Russian Peter the Great. This rifle is SA marked, meaning that Finland captured the rifle from the Russians, and the rifle passed Finn inspection, and was placed into service. This rifle was built at the Tula factory as well. Not a numbers matching, but I am firm on 325 for this rifle.  THIS IS SOLD - thanks Ken !

The second rifle is a 1942 Tikka. This is the original Russian model, put together by the Finns during the WWII effort. The bolt and barrel serial numbers match. This is a great shooter, and I am firm on 350 for this rifle.

The third rifle is the gem I have in regard to Mosin Nagants - this is a US built Westinghouse. The barrel is dated 1915, however my understanding is that all Westinghouse rifles built between 1915-1917 were dated 1915. The barrel and buttplate are numbers matching, but this is a great American built 7.62x54R rifle with a lineage to Pittsburgh... I am asking 375 for the rifle.    SOLD

You can't beat a good defensive handgun at a very reasonable price, and one of these is the SCCY CPX-2. The CPX-2 is a double-action-only, hammer-fired, semi-auto pistol. The milled stainless-steel slide, sand blasted for a blemish-free satin finish, is angle cut and rounded at the corners to provide a practical and attractive shape. Five curved serrations are located at the rear of the slide to provide a good grip surface for easy cocking. The slide is topped with a three-dot sight system. The front sight is polymer, but the rear sight is steel and windage adjustable via a set screw.

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT: Several great reasons to purchase AA .22 LR conversion kit:
1. ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 
2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.
3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 
4. FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.
5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.

I'm really going to regret selling this rifle but I don't ever use it. Over all the rifle is in very good shape, it has a few little hunting dings here and there, it unlike many of these pumps has a nice tight forearm with minimal rattle, there is no rust and only slight blue loss on the slide bars. Its all original never modified and has the neat old reminington sights. Rifle comes with one 4 round magazine and the leupold scope base and rings. I will only ship this gun to an FFL, I only accept US Postal Money Orders or certified money orders.  Super hard to find so don't let it get away! Please feel free to txt me anytime I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. The price is FIRM at $650.......REDACTED. Thanks, Jeff"

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT: Several great reasons to purchase AA .22 LR conversion kit:
1. ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 
2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.
3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 
4. FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.
5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.

It is fully adjustable so it fits pretty much everyone (S-XXL). It comes with: 1 double mag pouch, 1 triple mag pouch, 1 tactical field accessory panel pouch, 1 miscellaneous tactical field pouch, and also 1 tan colored american flag Velcro patch. It comes with a total of 3 LVL III stand alone AR-500 steel rifle plates. (Let me clarify, the pic shows 2 upper body plates. But, this sales comes with 1 front plate and 2 side plates - $250 is a steal minus the back plate)....so you get (1) front 10"" x 12"" curved shooters cut plate (1-front approx. 8.3 lbs.) and (2) 6"" x 6"" level side plates. These plates have a Brinell rating of 500+ and are designed with a multi-hit capability. This is everything you will need to have full upper-body armor minus the back plate. All you need to do is adjust the carrier for comfort, I put it all together for you already. I'm firm on the price, it's hard to get your hands on these. You can look online all day and tell me about all the prices you see and why I should give this away to you, but this is guaranteed USA built and in my possession. Getting these in hand is harder than looking at websites (it's harder than you realize). I have it if you genuinely want top quality projectile protection, not Chinese knockoffs.

Since I got it I took it to the range, shot those 250 through it, cleaned it, then stuck it in the safe where it has been ever since. I am huge Beretta fan,  but I just have no use for this fine weapon. It ran flawlessly with the Remington UMC ammo I fed it. It comes with five magazines; two 17 round, and three 12 round.

double/single action (DA/SA) pistol with a manual safety that also serves as a hammer decocking lever. It operates in the same way as the Beretta 92F (M9) service pistol.

There is also a half-cock safety notch.

For sale is an AK-74 Polish Tantal chambered in 5.45x39mm.  

This started as a basic Polish Tantal, but had a few nice upgrades added.  The traditional hand guards have been replaced with a Midwest Industries quad-rail system.  This allows a wide range of tactical accessories to be added.  A multi-position vertical grip has been installed for comfort of shooter, accuracy, and to help with the heat these generate from the high cyclic rate and hot 5.45x39mm round.  Finally a nice single-point bungee sling has been added.  The traditional folding stock has been left in place.  

There will be five Tapco 30-round polymer magazines included.  

For an additional $200 I will include one sealed sardine can of 1,080-rounds.  This is cheaper than I see it listed online for at the bulk places.  

The 5.45x39mm is a popular Russian round and available at Fleet Farm, Cabela’s, Gander Mountain, and many other places.  It is a suitable - and more affordable - replacement for the 5.56mm round.  

This firearm offers the durability expected from AK’s with a round equivalent to an AR-15.  

I made this with the intent of holding onto it for many years.  But I am migrating toward long distance shooting and away from AK variants.  

If you have questions about this posting or would like additional photos let me know.  It's simpler for me to text photos, but I can email them also."

Baikal is a brand developed by IGP around which a series of shotgun products were developed from 1962. After the collapse of the USSR, commercial gun manufacture was greatly expanded under the Baikal brand.

During the 1990s, Baikal marketed various Makarov handguns in the United States under the IJ-70 model. Included were handguns in both standard and high-capacity frames. They were available in .380 ACP in addition to the standard 9 mm Makarov round. Some minor modifications were made to facilitate importation into the United States, including the replacement of the rear fixed sight with an adjustable sight (only these Russian models marketed abroad feature an adjustable sight). A sporting version is the Baikal-442.[9] Voluntary agreements later restricted importation of small arms from Russia to the United States."

I sent it out to be stirpled and the gunsmith lost it. I do have the Pro medium and large back staps though. Buyer must be at least 21 years of age and have a valid Arizona DL or CCW. (CCW gets preference). Selling price is $600 cash. Only trades I'm interested in is M&P Pro in 9mm, XDS 4.0 in 9mm + $50, or standard M&P 9mm + $100."

Ghost Gunner is a miniature CNC machine designed to automatically manufacture publicy created designs with nearly zero user interaction. No prior CNC knowledge or experience is required to manufacture from design files. Defense Distributed's first design is the venerable AR-15 lower receiver. Ghost Gunner automatically finds and aligns your 80% lower receiver to the machine, with simple installation instructions, point and click software and all required tools. Just follow a few simple instructions to mount your 80% lower receiver, tighten a couple screws (with simple tools we provide), and on day one, Ghost Gunner can help you legally manufacture unserialized firearms in the comfort of your own home.

As shipped, Ghost Gunner can manufacture any mil-spec 80% AR-15 lower receiver that already has the rear take down well milled out. Lowers with non-mil-spec trigger guards that are otherwise mil-spec are also compatible. Defense Distributed recommends using the 7075 Ares Armor Raw 80% Lower AR-15 Billet, available for purchase.

Started out as a bone stock diamond back arms ar15 pistol in 5.56 with a 7.5"" barrel.  Added the following to it over time and it is a great shooter.  Doing paperwork now for sbr and suppressor so this set up has to go.  I did not do any of the work myself, everything installed at a local gun shop.  All of the following is included in the asking price.
Lower-
Diamond back arms ar-15 pistol lower, added jard 2 lb trigger and kns pins, magpul bad lever, magpul winter trigger guard, MOE+ pistol grip, and sig pistol arm brace.

Upper #1- Diamondback arms factory assembled upper
7.5"" 5.56 barrel with aluminum top / bottom rail hand guard, and a pretty wild looking flash hider that came on it.  Magpul AFG in FDE
Upper #2- CNMG factory assembled .300 blk with 8.5"" barrel.  Salt bath nitride barrel coating (supposed to be better than chrome lined) aluminum quad rail hand guard, chrome BCG,  magpul ladder rail covers, and an eotech 517 on top.  
All of this is less than 1 year old.  I will include 2 - 30 round pmags loaded with either .300 blk ballistic tip or .223 ballistic tip ammo, your choice.  
With the eotech and 300 blk, this set up will put 2"" groups in paper at 100 yds all day long, may do better but thats what i can do.  The 5.56 upper, i never mounted anything but peep sights on it, fun but i dont know how accurate it really is.   I have over $2100 in this set up, i will let it go as listed above for $1750.  I will not separate the uppers / lower.  Will do $1400 without the Eotech.  Thanks for looking!"
