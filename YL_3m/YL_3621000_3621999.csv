VERY GOOD condition.

This is a near new appearing model 57 Featherlite Ithaca. It is a 20 ga. semi auto, and has a 26 inch improved cylinder barrel. This is a very good condition gun, with just a very few minor handling dings. Stock is uncut, and factory length. 

Bought it for my son to do upland/waterfowl with it, but its still just a tad bit to big for him. length of pull is just a little bit big. 

It would be about another year before he grew into it since hes a smaller guy, and i want to take him this season. He loved how light it was compared to the others he tried. He was even able to carry it around for hours with no complaints when we went up-landing.

Also comes with a shotgun bandoleer full of 20 ga ammo, and a shotgun sleeve with 20 ga ammo.

Asking $200 Cash FTF Oregon resident.

Trades considered would be a youth 20ga in similar price range."

As most of you know, I'm unable to purchase a lower receiver from a dealer due to the fact that it could be used to build a pistol. However, my understanding is that a person to person sale is completely legal. I would just buy a complete set up, but I believe building my own will be a great way to better my understanding of the rifle, and I plan on picking up the parts as I get the money for them as I don't have the necessary funds to purchase one outright. So if you have one you'd like to sell, I'd happily buy it. Contact me via text or phone call at REDACTED. Thank you for your time."

   Compact, accurate, and tough as nails! This is one of a series of in-house AR pistol builds we did experimenting with the SigTac arm-brace. As we do with most of our demo-guns, this one is up for grabs! The 11.5"" carbine system is maximized for speed & accuracy with our RTA M16 BCG, custom spring set, & SOCOM-D profile barrel. The end result is a very manueverable, fast cycling tough-as-nails weapon that runs flat & smooth, and displays remarkable accuracy for this length of barrel.

A very nice shooter. The little 1911 spits out 380 acp just like its big brother is have in 45acp. Its a lock and cock carry gun and very dependable.

Rear sight is adjustable and it has a pair of 50.00 cocobolo grips I put on it that are still in new shape.

I really like this gun and had it out two weeks ago and put a box through it without a hitch like always.

This is the 4th gun I have gotten rid of lately and the reason is I have got a Dillon re-loading press set up this year and 380acp is not one I'm reloading. 
45acp, 9mm, and 38sp/357mag is enough for me to keep track of, haha.

Nothing wrong with the gun. It looks good, shoots good, lots of fun and is easy to carry conceal.

I have exactly 420.00 invested in the gun and it breaks down like this:
Original price: 350.00
Cocobolo Grips: 50.00
Fobus Holster: 20.00

The 380acp round has gained a lot of popularity lately with the CC crowd and the fact that the new 380 acp self defense ammo is getting pretty good results.

If this looks like something your interested in and have something to trade of equal values in one of the rounds I listed let me know what you have. Just e-mail me and leave your phone number if you prefer a call, or text over e-mail

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

I used them as rear speakers in a surround sound home theater system, that was the only use they ever saw. I think my rear output was only 15 watts.
They are Polks, so they sound great, and made in the USA, not to many products are anymore.
Great little speakers for your game room, garage, or man cave

Something like a Savage Axis, Marlin X7, Mossberg ATR 100, etc. May trade on real nice pistol, but not really looking for any handguns.

Includes a Factory Ruger letter confirming 1958 date of manufacture and also an instruction manual. Book in picture in not included. I will also include a hard case. Located in Maryville area."

""With the introduction of XD(M) series of semiautomatic pistols, Springfield’s reputation for ergonomics, intuitive operation and handling is taken to a whole new level. Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included backstraps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDM’s trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, while a grip safety allows the gun to fire only when you have a firm grip on the pistol. The loaded-chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow you to verify visually or by touch and without a doubt, whether there is a round in the chamber and if the striker is cocked. Match-grade barrel and proven three-dot sighting system are standard. Capacity is impressive 13+1 in .45 ACP models. Available in all black finish and black frame with a stainless steel finish slide. Includes black hard case, holster and double magazine carrier."""

I was""gun-shy"" about polymer .22s until I bought this one. This is not like the remington 597 polymer junk, this Savage is a solid rifle, much better than the Rem 597, which is also black polymer. Will trade it for the right boy's .22LR or pay cash."

I have for sale a Russian Mosin-Nagant M44 purchased from Gander Mountain about 7 years ago.  The rifle is a standard round receiver M44 with side folding bayonet.  The rifle has all of its secondary serial numbers matching.  The primary serial's don't match.

This, post 1938, rifle was made by Izhevsk, and features the following stamping marks: The rifle has the Soviet Crest Barrel Shank stamping; Concentric ""00"" Accuracy proof Barrel shank; Final black powder proof Barrel shank; Izhevsk Arrow in Triangle (post 1928) Barrel shank.

The rifle's standout feature is the Huber Concepts ""Black Teflon Match Grade"" Trigger.

While the trigger is by no means truly match grade, it does give you a Mosin Nagant that will shoot economical and hard-hitting 7.62x54r with a trigger that can hold its own with a modern sporting rifle.  Drop in an ATI stock, and you would have one heck of a WV deer rifle.

I will include a Gander Mountain Rifle sock, a Limb Saver recoil pad, and three boxes of Brown Bear 7.62x54r ammunition with sale.  Between the trigger, recoil pad, rifle sock, and ammunition, this is fantastic deal."

946,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3621946,"For Trade:  Drilling 3-Barreled shotgun/rifle, gold/silver?, engravings","Freedom, Bloomington, Indiana",Offer,"Listed On: Saturday, November 22, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a JJ Reeb Hofbuchsenmacher in Bonn rifle, the rifle appears to be two 16 bore (gauge) on top SXS and maybe a 11x60 Mauser on bottom.

I understand JJ Reeb was from Bonn and that produced guns from 1870's to 1909(or 1912) (retired) and then passed the business to his sons with the business ending in 1920. Hofbuchenmacher is ""court gunsmith"" in german. There are no markings on the gun other than the label going between the 2 top barrels and JJR inside the receiver as well as the number 1066 that I assume is a serial number (also on underside of Barrels). I have looked up some other Reeb guns but all serial numbers are all 5 digits long, so I assume this was an early production (roughly 1880-1890).There is ""initials"" on the bottom of the trigger or some other marking is what I assume is gold. I the top barrels are 16 bore and most likely for 2 9/16"" shells. There is tons of engravings all over the rifle/shotgun. The grip behind the trigger guard is made from horn. There is also storage for 4 rifle rounds in the stock (maybe silver?). It is missing the forearm and the front sight, as well as one of the hammer screws does not appear original. It has one set of sights for the shotgun and a peep sight that flips up in the rear for rifle. The take down lever appears to be shaped like an otter or beaver. The front trigger operates the right barrel and when the switch between the 2 hammers is flipped it then selects the rifle firing. The front trigger can also be pushed forward to become a ""hair trigger"". The rear trigger operates the left shotgun barrel. The hammers are strong and still will move the firing pins freely. From what I understand most of these ""drilling"" guns are WWII bring backs and many of them were missing the forearms. I have no doubt that it will fire, but I assume that needs to be ""old"" black powder ammunition.

I have two Diamondback DB9's in like new condition.  They each come with box, and a total of 3 - 6 round mags.  I AM ONLY SELLING ONE OF THEM, WHICHEVER ONE SELLS, I WILL KEEP THE OTHER.  One is the all black and one has the flat dark earth grip.  I have about 200 rounds through each of them and they have proven to be reliable carry guns.  Fully loaded they weigh just under 16 ounces and truly are the lightest and smallest 9mm you can get.  I have read several mixed reviews about these firearms, but wanted to check them out.  I have had a good experience with them.

On that note, this is NOT a good first firearm.  This firearm is for an experienced shooter looking for an easily concealed pocket 9.  It shoots well and it is accurate, however it is NOT a range gun.  50 rounds go through okay at the range, but after that you hand won't like it.  It can be somewhat picky about ammo and it does NOT like limpwristing.  Most of my 115 gr went through fine and it feeds very well with Hornady Critical Defense.  As with any defensive gun, make sure what you plan to carry will feed reliably.  

If interested, please contact me by phone/text at REDACTED. You should have an Indiana ID and valid handgun permit and we will do a bill of sale. If not, we can do transfer at FFL. OH, please be 21 or older (I know 18 is legal, but my own rule).  Thanks for looking and have a good day."
