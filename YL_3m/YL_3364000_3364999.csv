I purchased this upper last year with the intention of hunting hogs with it, as it turns out... I don't get out hunting much (at all) so I figure this one can go. The only use that it has seen, is 1 range day where I sighted in, and shot some groups... and it definitely shoots better than I do.

Hornady Manufacturing has taken cartridge case cleaning to the next level with the new Lock-N-Load Sonic Cleaner. A combination of intense ultrasonic cleaning action and a unique cleaning solution, One Shot Sonic Clean, provide an extremely effective and efficient method to remove carbon residue and other foreign materials from the entire case. Unlike tumblers, this sonic cleaner quickly cleans the inside of the case as well as primer pockets. The ultrasonic action creates microjets that blast carbon buildup off cases, small gun parts and equipment. The Lock-N-Load Sonic Cleaner can hold up to two hundred .223 cases or one hundred .308 cases. No other cleaning tool on the market even comes close."

The gun will operate in all three modes DA/SA/DA+. The gun has a standard picatinny rail, and nice factory Cerakote finish throughout. It has had 300 flawless rounds through it and will eat any ammo you throw at it. MSRP on an LH9 MKII is $695 new... ALL of them include a FULL LIFETIME WARRANTY!

This is a VERY hard gun to find in a gun shop, and a very unique gun. It is in the Black/Patriot Brown.
The carry case and all the goodies are a nice plus for a gun like this too. It has been treated to FROGLUBE and cleaned meticulously.

This gun is in perfect condition, has never been carried, and has only been to the range twice. I have fired LESS THAN 200 rounds through it. Both times I cleaned the pistol immediately and lubricated it before storing it in the factory case.

Long story short, I had another one of these that was being carried when I was involved as a passenger in a car accident. The gun was not holstered went missing in the event. I never found it so I reported it stolen and bought a replacement. In the time that I spent hunting I grew rather fond of another carry-sized pistol that I own so I decided to continue carrying it and sell this one instead. Therefore, I am also including most of the gear I had left over from the last one which was only moderately used itself.

Details:
Springfield XDs 9mm 3.3 in factory case. All original gear and paperwork included. Less than 200 rounds fired through the pistol.
2 extra magazines. One is factory 7 round. The other is Springfield made extended 9 round. 9 round has seen virtually no use. The 7 round was carried for 2 months.
Extra factory Springfield magazine holder included. That means you have 2 belt-clip mag holders for a total capacity of 4 extra magazines.
One Cross Breed Mini Tuck IWB holster. HIGHLY concealable and incredibly comfortable too! I will purchase another for my next firearm without hesitation. $70 new.

To sum things up, you are getting an almost-new pistol with all of the original XDs gear, factory case, and paperwork. I am also including an extra 7 round mag, 9 round mag, magazine holster, and Cross Breed IWB holster.
That is a total of 4 magazines, 2 magazine holsters, and 2 gun holsters (factory OWB and Cross Breed IWB) with all original case and paperwork. Even the extra fiber optics for the front sight are included. 
This pistol retails for $600 + tax. If you bought all of these new at your local store you would be looking at over $750 after tax. 

Please feel free to contact me via phone calls, text, or e-mail. If I do not respond right away it is because I am working and I will get back to you as soon as possible. I do work virtually all day Saturday and Sunday (August 9 & 10) but will be happy to show you the pistol the following week."

It appears to have some holster wear and a few small scratches on the left side of the grip, but besides that its in great shape, no scratches on the frame itself that I can see. The proof markings under the barrel indicate that she(yes, its a she)was made in 1991...same age as my girlfriend! 

I have personally put around 500 rounds thru her with zero malfunctions. I ran every cheap type of ammo I could find and had zero issues. Shes a great shooter and very smooth. The only reason Im selling her is because I originally bought her to be a home defense weapon but unfortunately my girlfriend has very small hands and cant handle the weight or reach the trigger comfortably. If you are interested we will be going thru an FFL, D&L Hunting in Warwick. If you have any questions or would like to see more pictures, feel free to contact me."

Designed through close collaboration with Israeli Special Forces, the MEPRO M21 is battle proven, simple to use accurately and totally reliable.

The MEPRO 21 reflex sight offers users the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open.

The MEPRO 21  is also designed to work in tandem with a magnifying scope like the
MEPRO MX3 - mounted behind it for ultimate accuracy.

This has never been fired and stored in the safe. This was one of the first JB Customs made prior to 2007 and sold for $2995+based on the hand work and fine tuning. The first 50 produced used a pre 64 never assembled Winchester receiver stamped for a pistol. I also have a customer leather leg holster ($260) and 170 rounds for 44-40 ammo ($90). I have the origial paperwork and documentation from J.B. Custom when purchased.

If you've never owned a Glock, you've certainly heard of their rock solid reputation for reliability.  I personally prefer the Gen 2 as the finger grooves of the Gen 3 and Gen 4 models don't fit my hand well and feel out of place, and I don't exactly have big hands.

I've had numerous questions about the slide being polished and whether it affects the corrosion resistance or not.  The short answer is ""no"", it does not.  Glock goes through a two stage finishing process.  The first stage is the ""Tenifer"" coating which is the corrosion resistance coating.  The second stage is the black ""Parkerizing"" coating.  The polish process is simply removing that outer Parkerized coating to reveal the beautiful Tenifer coating underneath.  The Tenifer coating still retains all of the corrosion resistance properties and in fact is more reliable than aftermarket coatings.

Here's the longer answer via the Glock WIKI page:
""The barrel and slide undergo two hardening processes prior to treatment with a proprietary nitriding process called Tenifer. The Tenifer treatment is applied in a 500 °C nitrate bath.[36] The Tenifer finish is between 0.04 mm (0.0016 in) and 0.05 mm (0.0020 in) in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth.[38]
The Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, non-glare surface with a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications),[37] making the Glock particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.[38] Glock steel parts having the Tenifer treatment are more corrosion-resistant than analogous gun parts having other finishes or treatments, including Teflon, bluing, hard chrome plating, or phosphates.[38] After applying the Tenifer process, a black Parkerized decorative surface finish is applied. The underlaying Tenifer treatment will remain protecting these parts even if the decorative surface finish were to wear off.[9]""

Used almost exclusively for target practice, few times on small game. Needs to be calibrated probably, but once it is, it's very accurate even up to 100 yds.

Overall only a few very minor dings and scratches and a few extremely superficial pits, hardly noticeable. Looks very nice. The rifling in the barrel is smooth as aged whiskey. 

Scope is very clear without any scratches. Missing lens caps/ adjustment covers, but does not affect calibration/clarity.

Comes with a box of ~250 Federal LR copper plated HP rounds, brass casing.
