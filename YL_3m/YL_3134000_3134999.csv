The optics are a Primary Arms M3 red dot and their 3x magnifier with a flip to side mount, which is really nice and pretty cool! It will come with one 30 round magazine, as well as the owners manual, lock, etc. that came with the rifle. This is a nice rifle, and comes with the Core15 warranty which is pretty awesome. The warranty reads:

“The rifle you have just purchased has the simplest, most plainly written warranty you will ever read. This is no fine print. There are no exceptions. This CORE15 rifle has been manufactured and assembled with painstaking care and precision by proud US Veterans, trained by the best there is. If anything is not up to your standard, accuracy included, if anything goes wrong, gets bent, broken, cracked, misaligned, tweaked, snapped or otherwise, simply contact one of our professionals and we will work to make it right. If you are the 5th owner and the rifle has seen 40k+ rounds, it simply….doesn’t….matter. We stand behind our products and we take care of our customers. That is our promise and your assurance.”

That is the Core Difference. See. Shoot. Believe.

I think that pretty well speaks for the quality of rifles that this company produces. I am looking to sell the rifle for $1000 cash, which I think is a very fair deal considering that is less than these go for in the stores (plus there is no tax, even more savings!), and I have added the sight, optics, handguard, vertical grip, and the pistol grip. This rifle is ready to go!"

EOTech's most popular holographic weapons sight, the Model 512 is perfect for people who want the best in close-quarters-combat speed and versatility but don't need night vision. The Model 512 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.
The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings. The Model 512 is compatible with 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.

243,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3134243,For Sale:  DuoStock with commercial tube spring and buffer,"wilmington area, Cincinnati, Ohio",$ 50,"Listed On: Sunday, August 31, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling a very lightly used like new duostock and a new commercial tube spring and buffer that came with it from the company.  Made in USA.

(Shamelessly copied from Duostock)
The Tactical Duostock is the first weapon butt stock specifically, ergonomically designed for CQB (Close Quarters Battle). It is especially beneficial to shooters wearing body armor. The angles of its construction assure smooth, fast target acquisition and puts the weapon's optic directly at the level of the shooter's eye. Use of the Duostock eliminates the necessity for the shooter to bring the head down to the rifle, as proper placement will assure an immediate and constant cheek weld while keeping the head upright. With a standard stock the shooter would need to place the high in ‘the pocket’ in order to maintain this kind of shooting posture.

Use of the Duostock does not inhibit shooting from the prone or alternate positions. The high back can be dropped down into the pocket for a more standard shooting posture if needed.  

The Duostock consists of upper and lower surface areas for the absorption of recoil. The upper back is essentially the same as a ‘standard’ stock, with the lower surface angled out to ride on the upper chest (particularly with the use of body armor, though it works perfectly well without it). The bottom of the stock is rounded and allows a smooth mounting of the weapon from patrol carry or low ready. All of this makes for a more stable, consistent shooting platform that puts optics or iron sights in direct alignment with the shooter’s eye, resulting in increased comfort, speed and accuracy. One test run by shooters of a special operations unit in North Carolina, for instance, had operators shaving .6 seconds off the first round fired on a timed MOUT CQB course, without decrease in accuracy. Shooters employing the Tactical Duostock were engaging their targets over half a second faster than their counterparts.  Elsewhere (but with similar operators), shooters equipped with the Duostock had a nearly twenty second improvement on overall time shooting at SFARTEC.  Duostock also received an overall score of 4.34 National Tactical Officer Association (NTOA) Member Test and Recommendation Program.

Only 3000 of these were imported, there were three batches of 1000. The first batch was 910, which this rifle is part of (serial # 910USR001), followed by batches 911 and 912. 

This rifle is highly collectible and more versatile than than the Steyr AUG A1 because of the upgraded firing pin system, the foldable cocking handle (prevents the wear on the receiver), and the Swarovski optic is an improvement of the first generation, which the crosshair has been added to the ""donut"" sight. This combined with the heavy/bull, cold hammer forged barrel give you more accurate, precision shots, ideal for hunting and target shooting at long range. Also the optic is removable so you can install the Picatinny rails to use you own optics/red dot sights, the AUG A1 optics are not removable. 

USR’s were the last AUG variant imported into the USA that were built in Austria.

this rifle has had less than 500 rounds through it in its lifetime. The rifle is still like new and comes with the original box, the original 9 rd. factory mag., and the original papers that were included with the gun.

The reason it is considered ideal is due to its completely unique safety system, namely the ""squeezecocker"" control surface built into the front of the grip. When the operator picks up the firearm, the main shooting hand instinctually squeezes the panel rearward, and this action cocks the striker rearward while unlocking the sear for use. The panel is spring-loaded, which means when pressure is reduced, it snaps forward, decocking the striker and locking the trigger. This system is also designed to release the slide when it is locked rearward. This design eliminates the need for a decocker, external safety lever or slide stop lever, making the sides of the firearm completely flush and reducing overall width. The barrel is fixed (does not cant upwards) which means despite the firearm's compact size, it is capable of printing groups of 2 inches or less at 25 yards. This accuracy is easily comparable to many high-end automatic pistols in production.  It has classic three white-dot sights dovetailed into the slide. I purchased it New in 1996 and have fired approximately 400 rounds through it without a single jam.Will include extra mags and nice holster.OREGON Residents ONLY"

Includes a $700 NIKON M-308 4-16×42 Scope that’s made specifically for the .308 platform with an incredible 95% light transmission rate.  It’s fully waterproof, fogproof and shock proof and holds zero perfectly.

I also added a very expensive $350  Magpul PRS Precision Tactical Sniper Stock which is an absolute necessity in a gun of this build.  I further complimented it with a $125 aluminum monopod made specfically for the PRS that in combination with the Harris Bipod allows the gun stand to be integrated into the gun for ultra precise long range targeting.

I didn’t stop there and added a $150 precision machined bolt-on Kahntrol Solutions Heavy Muzzle Brake designed for the .308 round.  A bolt on brake is the best option since some states like California have made some threaded brakes illegal without a stamp.  You can simply unbolt and remove this from the bull barrell.  This muzzle brake along with the heavy bull barrel makes this AR-10 recoil lighter than most AR-15′s.

Also added a tactical rubber coated grip with hand relief perch.  Excellent comfort and trigger control.

This is a beast of a gun and in one of the pictures you can see the size difference between it and an AR-15 sized HK 415 I have chambered in .22.  This AR-10 get’s a lot attention anywhere I’ve taken it including a couple of trips to the range.

Willing to ship to any legal purchaser within the state of Wisconsin person to person (as is legal). $20. I will ONLY ship to the address on a valid driver's license. 

I prefer cash but if I take trade I will only do it if I can sell what I get for the same cash value AND get paid for the time and trouble it takes to do so. It has been my experience that most ""traders"" want to avoid the hassle and risk of selling their items but still want me to value their stuff as if it were cash in hand. I don't do that.

For valuations Im looking for the worst case scenario. I don't care what someone is asking, I only look at the price items have sold for in the last week. I want to know what the least I can reasonably expect to get is.

I took this item in on trade originally and I'm looking to be made whole by selling it. My original goal was to get cash, and I'd still like to. So, if that's not going to happen I want to end up with more cash than if I didn't take the trade. 

I'm legit. I've sold many guns and shipped both instate and to other states. 

I am willing to ship guns to any state in the nation, I just have to ship to your FFL. $25 for shipping.

This Savage Model 30, 12 Gauge pump action has a 28 inch python barrel with double beaded sights.
It is chambered to except 3 inch Magnum shells. It has beautiful ornate engravings of Pheasants on both sides of the receiver. The photos do it no real justice as I was using my camera phone. It has a walnut stock and forearm grip that don’t have a scratch on them that I have found. The bolt is stainless steel.  I am almost tempted to keep it but that wouldn’t be right as it belongs in the hands of a bird hunter who will use it for that purpose. It is a great weapon that will be a proud addition to your hunt or collection.

I DID NOT HOARD THIS AMMO! I TOOK IT IN AS PART OF A TRADE. Don't send me messages about how nasty I am, or anything like that. When I traded my gun for items including this ammo I valued the ammo at $40 when I estimated the value of the trade vs. the value of my gun.

Prefer to sell face to face for cash, but will ship and will accept credit cards for an additional 3.5%. You can email me, text, or call REDACTED. 

Willing to ship in the US for $15. 

I prefer cash but if I take trade I will only do it if I can sell what I get for the same cash value AND get paid for the time and trouble it takes to do so. It has been my experience that most ""traders"" want to avoid the hassle and risk of selling their items but still want me to value their stuff as if it were cash in hand. I don't do that.

For valuations Im looking for the worst case scenario. I don't care what someone is asking, I only look at the price items have sold for in the last week. I want to know what the least I can reasonably expect to get is.

I took this item in on trade originally and I'm looking to be made whole by selling it. My original goal was to get cash, and I'd still like to. So, if that's not going to happen I want to end up with more cash than if I didn't take the trade. 

I'm legit. I've sold many guns and shipped both instate and to other states.

Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D.

Functional for both left and right-handed shooters, the B.A.D. Lever also allows traditional bolt catch manipulation according to the AR15/M16 manual of arms. All mounting hardware included.

Product Description
NOTE: Only fits standard length AK-47 & AK-74 operating systems with stamped or milled receivers. This model does not fit Yugoslavian or Draco model AK's and does not support .308 or shotgun caliber (variants coming soon). There have been reports of this not fitting the Century C39 and M&M M10 and we do NOT recommend modifying our forearm assembly in any way.

Easy installation! Simply replaces standard handguard & gas tube. Instructions & hardware included.

This new and Innovative proprietary design does not mount to the barrel and provides a solid mounting platform for optics and accessories as rugged as the AK-47 itself. Features a beveled front gas tube, new relief cut design, and all mounting hardware use the same diameter hex wrench.

Made in USA using advanced precision manufacturing with Mil-A-8625 Hardcoat Anodized protective finish. Constructed of high-strength aluminum with aerospace alloy gas block insert and heavy duty M4 metric thread fasteners.

Adds only 4-6 ounces to weapon depending on type of forearm & gas tube replaced. Optional accessories excluded from weight. Swivel available separately.

Includes:

2 detachable side-mounting Mil-Std 1913 Rails (1 non-QD & 1 QD) which can be mounted in various positions on either side of the forearm.

Mounting hardware. (Don't panic. We drop stuff, too. We include extra fasteners.)

Keeping the varmint hunter in mind, the .308 Winchester upper receiver group can be easily swapped out for any Mil-Spec Colt upper receiver chambered in 5.56x45 NATO. The fact that all operating controls are ambidextrous, including the magazine release, bolt catch and safety selector, makes for versatility and ease of use. You can depend on the new Colt LE901-16S to take the shot of your lifetime!"
