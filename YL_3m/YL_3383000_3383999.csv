the netbook has 1gb of ram, but is missing the cover for the ram slot and hard drive, but doesnt affect the performance. 

the galaxy tab 2 has a really bad cracked, but still perfectoly functional screen, which is repairable if u know what ur doing. i have already changed the charger port for it, but dont have the money for a replacement screen for it. it is the 10.1"" version.

This gun is chambered in 5.56 Nato and has a 16” Cold Hammer Forged Chromelined barrel. The Daniel Defense M4V2 comes with their latest M4 Rail, front sight post and flash hider. This rifle includes one Magpul PMAG and plastic hard case.

Its extremely light - I've carried Colts and Sigs and this weapon is amazing. I promise you won't be disappointed.
Comes with the gear on it, except the Magpul BAD lever and light. 
I can't praise it enough and hate to part with it.
The scope is a Burris MTAC with a Fastfire for CQB atop it. Look that part up and you'll see its no cheap option.

I'm pretty inflexible on the price and am not interested in trades, unless its another rifle and its got to be interesting. So please don't contact me with a lowball price - I'd burn it first before letting it go cheap. I'm not hard up or desparate at all."

For those wanting/needing a lead-free, HEAVY 357 Magnum load, generating full power plus, here it is.

Below are real world velocities taken from my personal stock guns. The industry established use of long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings is essentially misleading to the public who won’t be firing the ammo from a laboratory test barrel in the real world, where it matters.

1947 fps—Marlin mod 1894, 18 inch barrel
1518 fps—S&W mod 27, 5 inch barrel
1519 fps—S&W MT Gun, 4 inch barrel
1436 fps—S&W mod 66, 3 inch barrel
1385 fps—S&W mod 66, 2.5 inch barrel
You’ll notice the newer S&W 4 inch Mt. Gun, gave higher velocities than the older 5 inch mod 27 S&W. This is because of different internal barrel dynamics and chamber dimensions of the newer gun. In general, the newer S&W revolvers are made to tighter tolerances than those of 30+ years ago.

Due to the long-for-weight all copper bullet, the 357 does not have the case capacity to use a bulky flash retarded powder and thus there is a noticeable muzzle flash with this load in all the test revolvers, however the rifle shows no flash at all due to its longer barrel.

This load is the typical barn-burning, turbo charged, Buffalo Bore type HEAVY 357 Mag. load and as such, should only be used in revolvers made of all steel. It should not be fired in light weight, alloy framed or cylindered revolvers. Feel free to use it in ANY/ALL 357 mag. chambered rifles and all steel revolvers/handguns."

This one is very much original, it has a matching numbered bolt and floor-plate, it also has the original matching numbered front sight blade, another neat feature of this early M39 is that it was built utilizing it's predecessors (the Finnish M28/30's) upgraded rear sight base, (not too many have this feature). 

The artic birch stock has a good mixture of looks and character as can be seen in the pic.s it also has a nice crisp Sako stock cartouche.

I have the QC hand checked card that shipped with it as well as the original box, manual, and plastic sleeve. This isn't a ""cleaning out the safe"" bullshit ad. Just a rifle that you might have been looking for. Charging handle is the standard Gen 2 tactical LMT handle. I've got the basic LMT Gen 2 CAR stock if you want it as well. Barrel is 16"", 1:7, Chrome 

Upgrades - I won't tell you what they cost because you have Google too.
Troy MRF-CX 12"" free float rail system w/ ladder rail covers
Rock River National Match 2-stage trigger - supposed to be 4.5-5 lbs. Feels lighter and VERY crisp
Troy Ambidextrous QD end plate
Defense Industries Ambidextrous Selector/Safety - Can be set for Right or Left dominant
MagPul B.A.D. Lever
Original LMT SOPMOD stock with storage and QD connection
Yankee Hill Manf. Phantom Flash hider

BCG and chamber have been head-spaced and fired by LMT (per the hand check card). The original trigger was very gritty (like many Mil-Spec) so I swapped it for this RRA NM one. The old trigger is gone, but you'll be so pleased with this one, you won't care. The rail mounts over the original gas block and front post sight on a new barrel nut. Very nice if you ever want to remove it for gas tube cleaning or exchanging.

The Ergo grip is OEM and branded with LMT on the side and bottom. In fact, you'll find LMT marks on the upper, lower, grip, removable rear sight, and SOPMOD stock. It is truly set up as a mil-spec weapon - and you can ask your buddies who went over. Plenty of units are equipped with LMT rifles.

I will include a brand new 5.11 Tactical 36"" rifle case (as shown) for full asking price. If you want to haggle, no problem. I'll be happy to entertain offers if you don't mind my counter-offer. I believe this to be a fair price for an excellent rifle. Approx. 200-300 rounds down the pipe (that might even be high). This groups better than ""mil-spec"" getting between 1.25"" and 2"" groups at 100 yards, outdoors, with M193 ammo and a 4x32 ACOG. I have only shot it without a rest from a typical range sitting set up. Add a bipod or sandbag and better ammo -who knows."

Hello!

I have up for sale a nice collectible very early Finnish made P-series rifle also known as the Finnish P26.

This one has a matching numbered bolt and was built in a US made walnut stock. 

Not counter-bored as many are and this one has an un-scrubbed hex receiver with a great looking crisp and clear crest.

I am looking for a FTF(face to face sale) in the eastern Henrico area. (Richmond, Hanover, Hopewell areas) if your willing to travel. 

$450 FTF only at this time. First one to me with the cash is the winner. :-)

Ruger 0915 New Bearcat Shopkeeper .22lr Revolver, Birdshead Grip, Satin Stainless, 3″ Barrel
The New Bearcat Shopkeeper revolver from Ruger. Features a steel frame and wood Birdshead Gripframe. The revolver is single action, with a Button Head Cylinder Pin and Crescent Ejector Rod. This gun is a distributor exclusive.
Understated Elegance. The Ruger® New Bearcat® is different from other single-action revolvers. Smaller, lighter, and based on older Remington® single-actions of the 1800′s, it has a one-piece cylinder frame that also forms its compact grip. It has been described as “a mechanical jewel,” and is the smallest and lightest 22 LR caliber single-action made by Ruger.
Compact and perfectly proportioned for 22 LR caliber ammunition, it is easy to carry and fits comfortably in a backpack or tackle box. Fulfilling the ideal of a smaller “kit gun” style 22 LR caliber single-action revolver, it is perfect for hikers, campers, boaters, small game hunters, or just about anyone who needs a dependable 22 LR revolver for the trail.

Unfired and new in the case with all accessories, speedloader and both 17rd mags. Also included is a Blackhawk belt/paddle holster. For those who don't know, the Glock 17 is the full size 9mm. I've never shot this particular firearm, but i do own another 17 and its by far my favorite gun to shoot. Will not come with ammo unless trade for another caliber that also comes with ammo. Trades listed take priority but will look at all. Not really looking to downgrade, even with boot, but i might depending on the gun."

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail.

In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

This Mossberg 500 Mariner is made for self defense and home defense, gifving you 12 gauge stopping power, 6-shot capacity, the shorter 18 1/2 inch barrel, Mossberg's fabulous Mariner Marinecote� finish and Mossberg's great dependability and warranty. Mariner� Shotguns provide Corrosion-resistant Marinecote Finish for All-Weather, Year-Round Protection. This finish is ideal for humid environments. It was developed to prevent deterioration due to humidity and coastal environments, for boat patrol too, so it makes this shotgun last much better than other finishes. The Mariner is the ideal choice because your shotgun can be subjected to all-season climates, which can induce condensation. Rigorous testing proves the Marinecote resists corrosion better than stainless steel. This finish is harder than ordinary gunmetal and provides the added bonus of greater resistance to wear and distinctly smoother action. One reason so many military and police organizations purchase Mossberg shotguns is that the guns will withstand heavy wear and tear. But you don't have to be in the service or a police officer to buy this shotgun. In the event service is required, owners of Mossbergs always receive Mossberg's highest priority for inspection, repair and fast return of their firearms. Their expertly trained technicians complete every detail of service and repair at the Mossberg production site. Mossberg uses only factory original parts and install them to exacting specifications. Every firearm is returned in ready condition. Those who trust their lives to Mossberg products continue to rely on Mossberg's dependable, reliable and proven performance.  Manufacturer Mossberg

The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 3.8” Full-Size is the perfect pistol for those who want full-size performance in a slightly shorter package.

The XD(M)® 3.8″ Full-Size mates a 3.8″ barrel with a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and capacity you’d expect from a standard sized pistol, but with a shorter top end for easier carry. The XD(M)® is packed with features. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision.

Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See what you’re missing and pick up an XD(M)® 3.8” Full-Size. It redefines what a polymer pistol can be.

I've always loved the M145, and consider it far superior to the ACOG (except the big 6x48), having similar magnification but with slightly better glass and a far superior field of view. I do love Trijicon as a company, but this thing is just awesome.  It is a little bit heavy compared to the ACOG, but to me the trade-off in increased FOV is very worth it.

reason for selling: trying to raise money for an upgrade to the Specter DR -- if I can scrape it up from other sources, I'll probably pull this off the market and just keep it."

-Has Krebs custom enhanced safety lever with ""bolt hold open"" feature so you can operate safety with the shooting hand still on the pistol grip 
- Hogue OD green pistol grip with built in/removable storage compartment inside grip
- Magpul AFG angled foregrip in OD green with adjustable/ removable finger grooves
- lightweight, polymer quad rail/ picatinny/ weaver rail, so you can easily mount your favorite optics, lasers, flashlight etc...
- integrated sling swivels
- shark fin front sight vs the typical front post style sight
- elevation/ wind age adjustable read leaf site with adjustable set screw
- solid, 1 piece construction, MILLED! Not stamped receiver! Made right here in the good old U. S. of A. 
- Tapco G2 DOUBLE hook fire control group/ trigger which I particularly like. Super crisp light trigger pull with positive reset. Pleasure and easy to pull 
- AK recoil buffer installed onto the BCG/ spring which drasticallyyyyyyyyyy reduces recoil and muzzle climb. Seriously google it if you want. This little 14$ upgrade might arguably be the best single upgrade purchased for this piece. Wayyyy less recoil. This and the AFG and you're good. 
- Tapco custom retaining plate instead of cheap AK shepherds crook 
-Tapco birdcage flash hider (AR style) built for this piece. Really spreads the pattern of the fireball that comes out the muzzle in a cool X pattern like the ARs do. 
- CHROME LINED BARREL, shoot all the cheap commie steel ammo you want, this puppy can eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner. 
- a 3 point sling included 
- nice floating gun bag with 4 mag pouches and storage zipper made by Bulldog 

This gun has been pampered and cleaned thoroughly after every outing. Probably around 700 rounds down the pipe I have upgraded everything for reliability and performance and long lasting use. This was my primary SHTF piece and got it just the way it should be to make it through that scenario. I love the ak platform and have 2 Serbian/ Yugo ak variants and want to get rid of this one and buy another different ak so I can have all yugo/ Serb aks. I'm Serbian and love our line of ak variants and want them all now! This is a great piece and quality made with quality made upgrades. EVERY single time I go to the range with this piece I get crowds of people asking about it and wondering what it is. It looks like robo cops gun. People love it. I love it. And have let those spectators shoot my gun to their surprise and let everyone enjoy it. This is a piece to enjoy and share with others. So that's what I did and plan to do by selling it or trading so I can get my next project. A zastava pap m92 ak pistol. Which is cheaper than the one I have. But I want one. I will also entertain the zastava pap m85 ak pistol chambered in 223/556
Guns should be fun, and you should enjoy shooting them, and they should also protect your home and family. This piece fits the bill, great for home scenarios with its short body and barrel. Easily maneuverable in tight places. And it's classified as a pistol, not a rifle. It's a pistol in rifle caliber. Must have FOID card to purchase. No FOID, don't contact me. I might entertain an offer for an AR just because I kinda want one. Text me for updated pictures. These are kind of old and don't depict all external upgrades. Will happily text you back. That the easiest form of contact. I will definitely message you back. Just say your name and tell me you're contracting me about the armslist post. Ray @ REDACTED text all day or night I don't sleep until late at night."

560,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3383560,For Sale:  Armasight Spark CORE ceramic gen 1+ NOD w/ rail mount,"Moultrie, Valdosta, Georgia",$ 525,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 13, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Armasight CORE ceramic high definition Gen 1+ NOD w/ throw-lever picatinny rail mount.  Like new condition.  Original cost for all parts was about $680.

This is the lowest grade NVG that in my opinion is worth fooling with.  Gen 1 NODs just don't do a whole lot, and I can see almost as well with my naked eyes as through the unit.  IR illumination makes this thing an asset, however.  If you're considering a sub-Gen 3+ unit, you're going to need an illuminator or it's a waste of time and money.  I have found the Eagletac t20c w/ 3.4w IR module to be fairly effective, although it has a wider beam than is optimal.  Using it in conjunction w/ this Armasight CORE, I can ID a coyote vs. a sheep at about 180 meters.  Viewing through an Eotech reduces that to about 150 meters.  The rail mount puts it a bit too low for my Aimpoint -- the misalignment drops ID range to about 120 meters.  

The illumination is at or maybe a hair above standard for a gen1+ device, and only functional to just past twilight without IR illumination.  The integral illuminator is a wide flood that actually works quite well for indoors, but has a maximum effective range of about 10 meters.  This unit's claim to fame is the use of ceramic (like the gen 3 units) instead of plain glass in the interior, getting the resolution up noticeably from conventional gen 1 units, as well as increasing durability by a fair margin.  They advertise a ~53 lpi resolution, and that seems about right.  not the 67~72 of a good Gen 3, but on par with most Gen 2 units.

I probably recommend this as the best bang for your buck under a good Gen 3+ PVS-14."

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip (Not included for CO, NY, CA, NJ, HA sales). The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. 

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.
Includes only 2-10 rd magazines.

Its heavy leather construction, wet molded during manufacture to the specific firearm for which it's intended, is incredibly sturdy and reliable.

Keep in mind, this is a holster for LEFT HANDED users, with a forward tactical rake for the most efficient draw during a stressful moment.

I only wore this holster a few times to carry my P239 .40 and as you see it's like new, with no scars or damage. To keep its surface in the best condition possible, I've always treated it with the superb water based 303 marine grade protectant, the same product I used for years on the leather, vinyl and plastic of my sports car. It's even made with sunscreen for optimal UV protection! Unlike those horrible silicone based treatments, water based 303 cures with no unpleasant residue and keeps the material it's applied to supple and in great shape."

Still has the first tank of gas in it from the dealer. I purchased saw for a project for a client and literally cut 2 branches off a tree.

 Specs Below-
 pecifications:

Displacement: 50.2 cc (3.06 cu. in.)
Engine Power: 2.6 kW (3.49 bhp)
Powerhead Weight: 12.3 lbs.
Guide Bar Lengths (Recommended ranges): 16""-20"" (18"" standard)
Fuel Capacity: 500 cc (16.9 oz.)
Chain Oil Capacity: 240 cc (8.12 oz.)
OILOMATIC® Chain: 26 RM3
Key Features:

Reduced-Emission Engine Technology - Caring for Nature: The STIHL® Inc. “Caring for Nature” (see image above) seal identifies its powered products that are more environmentally conscious, producing zero or low exhaust emissions. STIHL® Inc. defines “low exhaust emissions” as being cleaner than EPA and/or CARB exhaust emission standards.
STIHL® Quickstop® Chain Brake System: Equipped with a chain stopping system designed to reduce the risk of injury in certain kickback situations. Designed to stop the rotation of the chain if activated by the operator’s hand or by inertia if the saw kicks back with sufficient force. In some working positions, it can be activated by inertia, stopping the chain within fractions of a second.
Anti-Vibration System: STIHL® has developed a system for minimizing the vibration levels of handheld outdoor power equipment. This system helps reduce operator fatigue and provides a more comfortable working experience.
IntelliCarb™ Compensating Carburetor: Designed to automatically adjust the air/fuel ratio when the air filter becomes restricted or partially clogged and maintains the engine’s correct RPM. It uses air from the clean side of the air filter to control the diaphragm and flow of fuel. As the air filter becomes dirty and less air is available for the carburetor, this system adjusts the fuel flow to compensate for the decrease in air flow. This is in contrast to typical carburetors that utilize this air from the “dirty” side of the air box.
Winter/Summer Shutter: Allows the carburetor to operate at optimum temperature year-round and helps to prevent carburetor icing when working below 50°F (10°C).
Ematic™ Lubrication System: When used with STIHL® OILOMATIC® saw chain will provide proper lubrication and less oil consumption than conventional methods. The system works because two ramps, strategically placed in the guide bar rail, help contain the flow of oil and direct all lubrication to the sliding faces of the bar and chain links as well as the rivets and driver holes, which in turn can reduce bar oil consumption up to 50%.
Side-Access Chain Tensioner: Makes it more convenient for the user to adjust the saw chain with a bar wrench as opposed to the typical location of the guide bar adjustment screw.
Master Control Lever™: Easy to use single lever, operating the choke, starting throttle lock and on-off switch. The operator must pull the throttle trigger before moving the Master Control Lever™ to the choke position.
STIHL® OILOMATIC® Saw Chain is made by STIHL®.
Additonal Features:

Bumper Spikes help prevent pull-in and provide better control, making cutting easier
Spark Arrester Muffler has large baffles which reduce noise level and contain a screen designed to reduce the emission of sparks
Front Hand Guard is designed to reduce the risk of injury
Front Handle is designed for a secure grip and ergonomically angled for comfort
Protected Spark Plug is protected, yet easy to change
Large Starting Handle is easy to grip
Smooth Clean Design has no rough edges to snag on clothing or brush
Air Filter Cover is easy to remove for fast and easy filter cleaning or replacement
Rear Hand Guard reduces the risk of injury as well as provides a wide area for foot placement during starting
High-Tech Polymer Housings are lightweight, withstand greater impact and are corrosion-resistant
Translucent Fuel Tank allows operator to easily check fuel level before starting work
Electronic Ignition provides easier starting and smoother running
Replaceable ""In Tank"" Fuel and Oil Filters lower cost and are easy to maintain
Automatic Bar and Chain Oiler lets operator concentrate on cutting, not on bar lubrication
Chain Catcher helps reduce the risk of operator contact by a chain if it should break or derail
Throttle Trigger Lockout must be depressed before the trigger can be activated"

The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 4.5” Full Size is the perfect pistol for those who are looking for full-size performance, sight radius and handling.

The XD(M)® 4.5″ Full Size is the perfectly proportional combination of a 4.5″ barrel with a full-sized frame. The result is a service size pistol that’s ready for anything. The XD(M)® includes a number of features that will change your perception about what you can expect from your pistol. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision.

Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs – all the way up to .45ACP. Try one today and see for yourself what a polymer pistol can be.

I just don't use or need it, so it's gotta go. Now.

Here's what Remington says:
Born of the gun-making expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the 870 – this 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior that handles the most extreme conditions. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. The exclusive ArmorLokt construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can just wipe it down at the end of the day.

Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches and the revolutionary SuperCell recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel and the barrel is hammer-forged.

Key Features:
Action design based on the venerable Model 870 – ultra-smooth and reliable 
Rugged ArmorLokt coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces 
SuperCell recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% 
Remington's softest-shooting pump gun ever 
Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics 
Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably 
Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels 
28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes 

Includes both Modified Rem Choke and Turkey Choke. Still have the original tags and owners manual. So please don't wait too long. Hunting season is coming and the first $290 (or reasonable offer) is going to take it. More photos and info available from REDACTED."

This is the real deal. I am the second owner of this firearm, however both owners have babied this gun. There is MINIMAL wear on the slide, frame, rails, and barrel. I carried the gun once (for fun), however there is no evidence to suggest routine carry. It appears we both used it as a safe queen. 

I do not know the actual round count, and I would guess I sailed ~300 rounds down range. It is a (KE) triple serial marked P228 indicating it was made in 1994. I have the original cardboard box (one corner is torn at the spine), manual, warning tag, and what I believe are the original 13 round mags. I do not have the test target (I will double check but I'm pretty sure it was never included). Gun is equipped with standard ""dot the i"" sights.

Magazines feed reliable, gun fires flawlessly, and has the precision accuracy you would expect from a West German Sig. I have had ZERO issues with this masterpiece. I hate to sell it because of it's fame, quality, and condition, however I do not shoot it near as much as it should be and I am currently funding other projects. I will not entertain any trades so please do not offer anything other than cash. 

I have done my best to provide detailed pictures, however feel free to message me for more pictures, information etc. I will do my best to answer any and all questions to the best of my knowledge. 

I will ship at buyers expense, however I would like to keep it a local transaction. I require a DL, Carry Permit, and a Bill of Sales. If you cannot meet that require (with the exception of the carry permit) DO NOT INQUIRY. 

My price is fair considering the condition and rarity of the firearm, however I may have a little wiggle room. DO NOT low ball me, you will be rejected/ignored. Reasonable offers will be considered."

Primarily this filter is meant for camping and other outdoors activities but serves well as an emergency backup filter if you find yourself without a clean source of water. Here's the product description from the internets:

Built for long-lasting continuous use, the Katadyn Pocket water microfilter features a silver-impregnated ceramic element that's effective against bacteria and protozoa even in extreme conditions. Unlike disposable filters, the ceramic element can be cleaned several times--even in the field. More importantly, the element filters all microorganisms larger than 0.2 microns (0.0002mm), producing clear, drinkable water wherever you are. The pump also includes an improved, round pump handle for better ergonomics and an outlet hose that attaches to water containers with a single clip.

The Pocket hails from Katadyn's Endurance series, a high-quality line of filters that can produce up to 100 times more water than standard water filters. The Pocket is so tough in fact, that it's the first choice for extreme adventurers like Mike Horn. Plus, it's the only water filter with a 20-year warranty. Other features include a measuring gauge that indicates when you should change the filtering element, a cushioned base that makes it easy to pump on all surfaces, a prefilter, and a carrying bag.

Specifications:
Capacity: 13,000 gallons / 50,000 liters
Dimensions: 24 by 6 centimeters / 10 by 2.4 inches
