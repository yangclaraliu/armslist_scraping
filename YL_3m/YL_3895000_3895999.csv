Fore grip is a UTG metal quad-rail covered in MagPul accessories -- positive grip and stays cool after repeated magazine dumps. On top is a Burris FastFire II, making this AK easy to aim and a pleasure to fire quickly. I also have four Tapco 28-rd mags, one ProMag drum that performs flawlessly, a MagPul single point/dual point sling with two QD attachments and one quick-release clip, a Surefure dual-mode tactical light, a Sightmark red laser, and an offset mount for either of the above. Also a sturdy bipod and a cheaper plastic AK-AR stock convertor. The flash suppressor is an AKM style. The magazines are all loaded and I can include a couple hundred loose rounds for the right deal.

This is a great platform to have fun and to build skill. It is also a very reliable and effective weapon for self-defense at close and medium ranges. The red dot adds a lot of functional accuracy. It is an AK. It is not an accurized AR10 capable of sub-MOA groups at 200 meters or more. But you knew that."

You continue to acquire stuff for it. For sale is my faithful fiend of 30 years, a genuine HK-91 with all the toys imaginable. The gun was purchased in the 1980s, I am the second owner to the best of my knowledge. It will eat any type of 7.62/308 ammo on the planet and shoots most of it extremely well. I have taken deer with it at over 200 yards and won many rifle range bets with it over the years as well. It will shoot 1-inch groups or better with factory ammo and good reloads. It has the folloing accesories:
-HK scope mount 30mm/1-inch ($400 many years ago)
-Recoil buffer (within fixed buttstock - $35)
-HK Ejection Port buffer ($40)
-HK Carry Handle ($45)
-HK Collapsible buttstock ($200)
-ARMS scope mount with 3-9x basic hunting scope ($150)
-Bayonet lug (difficult to find one these days - $50)
-Bayonet (commercial not surplus) ($100)
-HK bipod ($200)
-HK leather sling ($30)
-Ten (10) HK STEEL 20-rd magazines. (I've never owned an aluminum one)
-Eight (8) Thermold 20-rd magazines. I prefer these to steel for my own exploits.
-Four (4) HK steel 5-round magazines (these are the expensive ones at $50 each)

The big scope is NOT offerred with the package unless someone wants to pay a reasonable amount above the sales price of the package. It is a 30mm Springfiled Armory 1000-meter scope. Most of the magazines have some ammo in them so I'll throw that in too. I have extra parts such as the scope ring inserts for 1-inch scopes, the dust cover where the bayonet lug resides today, and extra bayonet lug (surplus), original recoil buffer, books, etc.

The gun is no longer in 100% condition. It has been in the field. The gun shows wear at the sling mount point on the front, under the selector lever and around the ejection port wear the ejection port buffer has moved slightly during extended use at the range.

I will entertain some trades, multiple gun trades, bullion and $100 bills, with cash being king.  I only check my email a few times per week, so be patient with my response. The gun alone sells for more than $2000 on gunbroker. Do your homework and you'll see this is a fantastic opportunity to own one of the best battle rifles in history."

They are formed from copper and tin blended powder using a compaction and sintering process that eliminates the need for a jacket or plating on the outside of the bullet. This design prolongs the life of backstops and target traps.

The Neos pistols feature cutting-edge design, modular construction that allows personalization and the flexibility for many shooting disciplines. Available at popular prices, the Neos is ideal for new shooters, but it won't easily be outgrown as skills improve. SOPHISTICATED. In the unmistakable design and style of Giugiaro. The valuable collaboration between Beretta‚Äôs engineers and noted Italian designer continues to fruition. The sleeker and ergonomic U22 Neos with its captivatingly designed gun case is guaranteed to appeal to Beretta enthusiasts. MODULAR. Constructed of five assemblies which are easily disassembled without tools, the U22 Neos is manufactured in the classic Beretta blue or inox to satisfy the tastes of all shooters. The ergonomic grips in fiberglass reinforced technopolymer with anti-slip finish can be substituted with optional colored or rubber inlay grips. PERFORMING. Reliable, durable, easy to maintain and notably precise thanks to the 6‚Äù barrel featuring an integral rail that accepts Weaver style scope mounts, and a fully adjustable target rear sight. The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack magazine made from inox steel (with a 10 round capacity) boasts a practical device which facilitates loading. The ambidextrous manual safety can be engaged either with the firing pin cocked or uncocked."

Remington CTF Bullets are an excellent lead free bullet choice for target shooting at both indoor and outdoor ranges. CTF bullets are jacketless  frangible bullets that disintegrate into powder fragments upon impact with hard targets without splash back, thus dramatically reducing the hazard to bystanders. They are formed from brass and polymer blended powder using a compaction and sintering process that eliminates the need for a jacket or plating on the outside of the bullet.

The Neos pistols feature cutting-edge design, modular construction that allows personalization and the flexibility for many shooting disciplines. Available at popular prices, the Neos is ideal for new shooters, but it won't easily be outgrown as skills improve. SOPHISTICATED. In the unmistakable design and style of Giugiaro.

The sleeker and ergonomic U22 Neos with its captivatingly designed gun case is guaranteed to appeal to Beretta enthusiasts. MODULAR. Constructed of five assemblies which are easily disassembled without tools, the U22 Neos is manufactured in the classic Beretta blue or inox to satisfy the tastes of all shooters. The ergonomic grips in fiberglass reinforced technopolymer with anti-slip finish can be substituted with optional colored or rubber inlay grips. PERFORMING. Reliable, durable, easy to maintain and notably precise thanks to the 6‚Äù barrel featuring an integral rail that accepts Weaver style scope mounts, and a fully adjustable target rear sight. The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack magazine made from inox steel (with a 10 round capacity) boasts a practical device which facilitates loading.

Remington‚Äôs model 788 Bolt Action Rifle was not a looker at all, like their 700 BDL. It was, however, one of the most accurate rifles ever made. Its looks stand out, more than anything, for the detachable magazines like the ones in our photos. The 788 enjoyed production from 1967 until 1983, and variants chambered in specific calibers, with briefer runs. The .243 was manufactured in 1968 and 1980 only; 7mm-08 in 1980 only; and the .308 from 1969 until 1980. Photos show only a handful of old stock Remington 788 Magazines we found in an old West Warehouse. Manufacturer is Taiwanese, probably HFC / Keymore. Construction is blue steel body, floorplate, and cartridge follower, with polymer release lever. These magazines are manufactured on Remington Factory Equipment. Each magazine holds 3 rounds of .243 Winchester or 7mm-08 Remington or .308 Winchester caliber ammunition. These magazines Will Not Work in any other rifles except model 788 Remington chambered in one of those 3 calibers. All 3 calibers, of course, were invented from the .308 case, just with different bullets in them. Body sides are marked with the caliber, just like the last production ones made in Ilion NY were. These are excellent, well made magazines, and they work well, from numerous field reports. 788 Magazines are nearly impossible to find; this is the only show in town. We‚Äôre offering them each for only $ 39.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City.

I will not accept offers that low ball me with overvalued trades
I will not drive to the end of the world to meet you (local Metro residents only)
I will not accept offers that don't meet my criteria.

I don't want to be a jerk about it, but apparently there are plenty of jerks reaching out to me thinking their trade is worth more than it is. I am basing all pricing off the lowest retail price from 3 credible sources (Buds,CheaperThanDirt, and SportsmanWarehouse). Being that said, I am actually undervaluing the G23 because it has the upgraded sights and grip. And don't give me the rigmarole about it being a used gun, your trade is used also. 

Like I said this is the last time I am putting this up. I will only reply to REASONABLE offers. 

I am looking at trading my Glock 23 for a Sub-Compact pistol. I like my 23, but plan on carrying soon and would like something smaller. I'd like to trade for anything of lesser value and you can put money on top. So Kel-Tecs + cash, etc. Or If you have a nice Kahr, S&W Shield, SR9, LC9 or any other sub-compact in that class I will do even trade depending on the value. Will entertain 17hrm rifles plus cash or 223 bolt plus cash."

Buffalo Bore Ammo - Heavy 10mm Ammo - 200 gr. F.M.J. (1,200fps/M.E. 639 ft.lbs.) - 20 Round Box







The Buffalo Bore Heavy 10 mm ammo is the result of many years of customers requests that we produce several such loads for the 10 mm.

These loads bring out the full potential of the 10mm, but operate at standard pressures and as such, are safe to use in any standard 10mm pistol. Please don't phone us and ask if these loads are safe in your 10mm - THEY ARE - provided your 10mm is a normal operating pistol in good condition.

We are using flash-suppressed powders so your vision will not be materially affected should you be required to drop the hammer in low light.

If you are firing this 10mm ammo from an autoloader and experience high extreme spreads in velocity, it is not the ammo. Here is why and how to remedy the situation.

Full power 10mm ammo has always generated enough recoil and pressure to require a pretty stiff recoil spring in your handgun - this of course depends on several variables such as your slide weight, etc. When the cartridge fires, it generates enough pressure/recoil to prematurely open your breech face in some guns. When this happens, the opening breech face has an effect on the burn rate of the powder. This can result in some fairly high extreme spreads in velocity. If you are experiencing extreme velocity spreads of more than 50 fps, simply install a stiffer recoil spring. For example, I have an original Colt Delta Elite. This gun with the factory spring runs extreme spreads of about 35fps with both of these 10mm loads. I am happy with 35 fps, so I leave the Delta Elite as is. I also have a custom built Para Ordinance with a Nowlin barrel. It runs extreme spreads of about 70 fps with its original recoil spring. When I install a spring that is 4 lbs stiffer, the extreme spread drops to about 35 fps. The new Glock model 20 comes with a recoil spring that allows the breech face to open too soon and my new Glock model 20 will get extreme spreads of about 100fps with the factory spring installed. When I go to a stiffer recoil spring, the extreme spreads drop to about 50 fps in my new Glock model 20. Of course none of this will be an issue in a revolver. None of this will be an issue in real life either, as these high extreme spreads don't hurt accuracy or function. However, I mention this because if you are like me and want things to be as correct as possible, I have outlined the problem and the solution. The industry fixed all these problems initially, by watering down the 10mm ammo over the last several years. The watered down 10mm ammo does not generate the pressure/recoil to open the breech face early. If you want the full powered 10mm ammo we make, you simply need to tweak your pistol. Or just realize that you are getting some fairly high extreme spreads and ignore it or live with it. It's not hurting any thing in reality.

Mossberg is joining industry heavyweights in the AR-15 market such as
Remington, Ruger, and S&W. Mossberg wants to differentiate themselves in
the market by going with a A2-style (carry handle) receiver instead of the
A3-style. Featuring A2 front and rear sights with a carry handle picatinny
rail if you want to mount optics. Most tactical .22s have a 16"" barrel, but
Mossberg has decided to go with an 18"" barrel for a better sight radius and
a more traditional look. Also featuring a full length picatinny rail hand
guard and a 10 round or 25 round magazine. Mossberg is offering these guns 
in a fixed and an adjustable stock.

Springfield XDM95259BHC XDM Competition 9mm 5.25"" 19+1 Polymer Grips Black

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5-Time World
Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for
competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened
recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced
performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front
sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots.
Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load
combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass
which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be
used.

These particular shotguns were manufactured around 1902 by the Hopkins and Allen company in Norwich, Conn.

The barrel lengths are 30"" with steel beaded sight.  The finish is a soft patina with a unique ghosting effect developing around the edges from years of handling.  The stock and fore-end are American Walnut with a rich, warm finish.  One shotgun has the original leather recoil pad and has 6 notches on top of the stock indicating the number of successful hunts.  The other shotgun has the original recoil pad but features an embossed image of a squirrel.

He had many guns but I was always drawn to the 1903. My son is 16 and became almost as close with my grandpa as I was, so he told him when he passed that my son could have the 1903. Months went by and we went to borrow it for a day at the range, regretfully it was missing along with 3 other handguns. We had come to realize the cable man was the only person in the house since it was last seen. Called comcast and the tech that came was no longer working there.  My grandpa passed last March, me and my son have some of his other guns but only truly want his 1903. Although I can not be replaced,  I feel I could make new memories with my son to fill the hole. I can spend around 500.00, but would much rather trade. Not looking for a collector peice but not a peice of crappie either,  a nice shooter would be great.

Hey all,
I have up for sale a 1895 Nagant ‚ÄúGas Seal‚Äù Revolver with holster. I pocked this up in trade and would keep it, but i already have one and can‚Äôt see a reason to need two. Haha. I HAVE NOT shot this myself, but the gentleman i got it from said that it shot fine for him, but of course is ‚Äúas is‚Äù (like every other gun trade anywhere haha). The rifling is good and the blueing is in decent shape for its age. This particular Nagant is marked ‚Äú1932‚Äù as its manufacture year. 
In terms of trades, I would consider most rifle trades or even trade for pistols (mainly looking for a 38/357 revolver or a cheap 1911) . I have a BUNCH of surplus ammo for this that i could sell at an additional price, or add on to even out a trade. Just shoot me a text at REDACTED o a message on here and we can talk specifics. I would also trade for gun + cash, gun, or just cash. 
Need to meet up in Norman on this one. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability. Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‚Äò3-dot‚Äô sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it‚Äôs either positively ‚Äúon‚Äù or ‚Äúoff‚Äù. The safety lever also functions as the pistol‚Äôs decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber). Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual‚Äôs hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use. No Glare Finish: Beretta‚Äôs exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design. Barrel: The Px4‚Äôs unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction)."

BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
In the world of Browning,  the name ""Medallion"" is not tossed around lightly. Medallion means beauty, strength and function. The A-Botl Medallion epitomizes this idea offering a beautiful rifle with high gloss Walnut and blueing in a package with a super strong and accurate action.

STOCK
The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
A durable gloss finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.

ACTION/BARREL
Durable polished blued steel for a striking appearance.
Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
Glass bedding provides stable and precise fit for the action, eliminating accuracy degrading physical stress.

The G24(t) was produced for two years only and total production numbered roughly 250,000 rifles before the plant was converted to produce the standard model 98k infantry rifle. This particular rifle is non matching and is in fair condition. The metal parts that were originally blued are heavily finish worn and have a nice aged patina. The German proofmarks are intact and unpinged on the receiver. The large Heer proof is quite clear on the receiver by the serial number. The stock is also Heer marked, but it is very faint. There is a repaired crack at the sling slot. Additionally, the stock is a laminated stock which is likely from 1942 production and it is not original to to this rifle. Production of the Gewher 24 rifles ceased in mid 1942 when the factory converted to 98k production. With the total production of only two years and 250,000 rifles, examples that remain in excellent and all matching condition are extremely difficult to find and command a significant premium. This example can be purchased at a lower non-premium price because of its condition, allowing the buyer to add a rifle to their collection that is typically missing from all but the most advanced collections.

849,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3895849,For Sale:  Beretta Px4 Storm Full Size .45 ACP Pistol 42-JXF5F25,"Englewood, Denver, Colorado",$ 578,"Listed On: Tuesday, August 11, 2015",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability. Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‚Äò3-dot‚Äô sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it‚Äôs either positively ‚Äúon‚Äù or ‚Äúoff‚Äù. The safety lever also functions as the pistol‚Äôs decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber). Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual‚Äôs hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use. No Glare Finish: Beretta‚Äôs exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design. Barrel: The Px4‚Äôs unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction)."

Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability. Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‚Äò3-dot‚Äô sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it‚Äôs either positively ‚Äúon‚Äù or ‚Äúoff‚Äù. The safety lever also functions as the pistol‚Äôs decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber). Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual‚Äôs hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use. No Glare Finish: Beretta‚Äôs exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design. Barrel: The Px4‚Äôs unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction)."
