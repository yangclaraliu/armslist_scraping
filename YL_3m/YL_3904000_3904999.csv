It is small enough to conceal with the slightest ease but also very easy to use. It has the factory Viridian Laser which works great. It also comes with a pocket holster that will disable the laser while inserted meaning that as soon as you pull the gun from the holster the laser is on. This set up works really well. 

I have an extra mag and both mags have pinky extensions. I also have some ammo (maybe around 200 rounds) both range and home defense. It will come with box and everything else that it came with from factory. Fired approx 50-100 rounds through this and it works fine. no wear marks anywhere. The only reason I am selling is to consolidate calibers and this is the only 380 that I have.

Capable of hitting ~65 mph on smooth water, Doesn't suck up that much gas.
Only noticeable flaw is the sea doo bumped into the dock and got chipped. (bumper fell off). You can see it in one of the pictures. Purely cometic and could be buffered out.

I was told I could keep anything that she hadn't wanted, and I decided to keep these.  Now, I have no use for them as I haven't a firearm which could accommodate these, but I would be more than happy to send them off to someone that can make use of them.  After doing some looking I determined these rounds typically sell for a relatively high price.  I am willing to sell these 200 rounds for $100 (or best offer), plus $30 S&H for the SE Michigan area.  If you would like these delivered elsewhere, please let me know, and I will determine the S&H cost for you.  I also will be selling 12 gauge shells (8 shot, 100 rounds), and 7.62 x 39mm (50 rounds).  If you would like to buy the shotgun shells and/or the 7.62 x 39mm rounds in addition to these, I would be willing to give a deal."

The rifle completely accepts and with perfect reliability; standard AK47 magazines. The magazines need no mods and are completely interchangeable with a AK47. This rifles was professionally milled out, then hand fit with a rotary tool to allow ak magazines to be seated, along with modifying the trigger group and bolt. Unlike Norinco brand AK magazine compatible guns, this particular stock has no liner, allowing the use of polymer mags like the Pmag included with the gun (Other Stocks can be adapted to fit easily). Gun also had professional trigger job and Parkerizing finish applied, which is far superior to the bluing finish on the Norinco and most SKS's. Gorgeous and new looking Chrome Lined barrel, US made piston, synthetic stock and blade bayonet makes this particular SKS interesting and sold as a 922r compliant rifle. Makes for the perfect collection and add on piece to your ak47 rifle. I AM willing to ship, most likely at buyer's expense to their FFL. Lots of Gun for the value and these AK magazine compatible SKS's are crazy high in appreciating value. Note: not shown in pictures, metal liner was installed in magazine well and the front slot of the magwell was filled and blended in. New pictures on request will show this.

Hey all,
	I have available a used but good condition Mossberg 835 Ulti-Mag with 28 inch barrel with the Accu-Mag choke. This gun is chambered for 2 3/4, 3, and 3 1/2 inch shells. I got this in trade and would keep it, but I already have a 835 of my own and would rather trade or sell this one off so someone else can use it more frequently. It is in pretty good shape for being a used shotgun and has Norman scuffs, scratches, and dings for being so. This one mainly needs a thorough deep cleaning and a new home! They make tons of accessories for these and this are some of the best shotguns I have ever used. 
	As far as trades go, I'm somewhat open. I would really like to get a 1911 in 45, certain bolt rifles (depending on caliber), or a 357 full size revolver. Honestly, the best bet is to shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here. Never know what may trigger my interest! I do have a decent amount of ammo that I could include on a trade to even things out. I need to meet up in Norman on this due to my schedule. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

EMF's Hartford 1892's were manufactured by the Brazilian arms maker, Rossi. By using updated materials and production techniques, the Model 1892's action is strong enough to chamber high pressure handgun rounds, such as .357Mag & .44Mag. 

Note: In December 2008, Rossi Firearms sold their 1892 rifle manufacturing to Taurus International. Taurus has declined to continue manufacturing the Hartford 1892's for EMF. Therefore, as the current inventory of EMF Hartford Model 1892's is depleted, the various models will no longer be available. If you donât already own one of these you better hurry and get one while you still can. Here is a link to the EMF Hartford site current as of September 2010 and the current prices for the gun I am selling.

Not much info seems to be out there, and even less on value, so your guess is as good as mine.
It still takes the 7.62x38r cartridge, though a true ""target"" load does exist.. same casing but with a very light powder charge and a wadcutter type bullet.
It is Single-action only.
Rear sight is windage-adjustable, front sight elevation adjustable.
This example was crafted from a 1928 pistol, and shows some wear & scratching typical of an old milsurp. The target grips feel good, but the left side panel has some monkey-business going on. The screw and ferrule was missing, and I (very poorly) made up a screw out of a ground-down M4 bolt and a nut that just fits down in the factory grip ferule hole. Numrich, and others could never come up with a proper replacement - it is different from the regular service model grip.  Mine works and the grip is tight, but it just isn't ""correct""
rifling is good and cylinder clean, shoots well. The Cylinder serial # doesn't match the frame, though I can't say for certain that any of the target models ever had a matching cylinder. 
That's about all I know about it. Found it at a local pawn shop and snapped it up but it doesn't really fit in with my collection so I'm letting it go.

 If you aren't familiar with the Cougar design it is the precursor to the Beretta PX4 and uses a rotating barrel action to improve accuracy and lower recoil. Identical to the Beretta Cougar aside from the name on the slide; Beretta transferred the tooling and manufacturing equipment to Stoeger, Stoeger being a subdivision of Benelli, which is in turn owned by Beretta. Has the same manual of arms as a Beretta 92/M9, so its a great choice if you're looking for a more compact version for carry.

 Has some light holster wear from being carried but overall is in good shape, bought new about two months ago and only has about 200 rounds through it. Will come with two 13 round magazines. Depending on what you have I can also include an extra 15 round magazine (modified Beretta 92 mag) and I have a fair amount of 9mm ammo.

Just picked up a different compact carry gun, so I'd like to swap this for a bigger 9mm.  Looking for a mid or full sized 9mm.  First choice would be a Springfield XD9 or Ruger SR9, but would consider similar 9mm's in this size range.  Only looking for 9mm's though, and no Taurus or Kel Tecs please.

Dan Wesson INFO

There has never been a higher demand for self defense handguns than there is today. The greatest demand is for the smallest, lightest gun available, but this has drawbacks. Generally these guns are difficult to shoot well, lack stopping power and recoil can be a problem. If you canât hit or stop what you are shooting at, what good is the handgun? We can understand all of these concerns as we face them every day as well. We wanted to give our customers the smallest, lightest gun that we could without sacrificing accuracy, dependability and stopping power.

Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say canât be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.

The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5â slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.

Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy youâve come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control."

Two detention plates for V1 and V9, and extra magazine base plates.

The V1 plate lets the gun function as follows: DA/SA with safety and decocker on the left hand side.

The V9 plate causes the gun to function as follows: DA/SA with safety, but no de-cocker.

These switch out in less than a minute when you field strip the gun to clean it. Just allows the owner to have the choice of having a V1 variant USP or a V9 variant. All about personal preference. V9 functions basically like a 1911.

Gun is excellent, functions flawlessly, very very light wear. I will not part this out. If the buyer would like to sell off the magazines or some of them at the $50-60 they go for, that is fine with me. Same goes with the holsters.

I'll even throw in the Troy Battle Sights in the pics. I picked them up for $50 (may be the knock-offs) but they worked extremely well on another AR. Do your research and you'll see that it's fair. Not interested in giving it away. Don't need the money. Just changing my home defense strategy. Thought I'd go with one AR and a shotgun instead of two ARs. 

Willing to do a partial trade for a Mossberg 590A1 9-Shot with Ghost Rings. With or with Speedfeed stock is fine. Will knock off $600 but also the mags as well. I get the shotgun and $1200 and keep my mags. You get this awesome rifle with sights and 500 rounds of .223 and 250 rounds of .300.

This will fit Gen 1, Gen 2, And Gen 3 only. The actual Glock models that this fits are G17, G17L, G22, G24, G31, G34, G35, G37.

 EXCLUSIVE FEATURES this CONVERSION KIT:

1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR Conversion Kits for the GLOCK pistol.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.
I have shot this very little. It is really accurate and fun to shoot.
Comes with Slide and Barrel and one 10 round mag. i do not have the box for it. Extra mags can be ordered from the manufacturer."
