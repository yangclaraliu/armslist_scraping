This vehicle has almost 182k on the odometer but the 4x4 and engine run solid.  The oil pressure gauge is glitchy but pump is working like a champ.  Interior and exterior are a little rough.  Headliner is coming down and well lets face it the truck is almost 20 years old and from Kansas, there will be rust.  Truck doesn't leak oil or let in water when it rains.  It has a third door and fold down back bench seat.  The tires are shot.  The steel belting is starting to show on the front tires.  Drivers side power window works, but window is not on the track, it will go up and down manually. I love driving this truck over the winter but we do not need a third vehicle.   I am in it for the cash, but would love to find a conceal carry 9mm for the wife.  So if you are short on the cash, a firearm can be brought into the deal.  Thanks for looking."

The intent is that an officer will carry a Ruger P Series pistol as a sidearm, and keep a Carbine available (for example, in his/her patrol vehicle) as a shoulder weapon if needed. Since the carbine has a 16-inch (410 mm) barrel, it provides more power with the same ammunition used by the 4-inch (100 mm) barreled pistol (see internal ballistics). The carbine also provides additional accuracy and range over the pistol."

Interested in AK47 and AR15 mags. Primarily interested in buying in bulk to make any traveling worth it. I don't need to buy in bulk, I'd buy just a few if the price was right, but I won't travel for it. If you happen to be able to meet me close to me then I'd buy even smaller quantities, but if I'm going to drive then it needs to be worth my effort. I strongly prefer that they be stock mags and not painted or whatever. 

Here's what I'm looking for:

AK 47: I'd be interested in pretty much any capacity, but THEY MUST BE STEEL. Not at all interested in the modern Korean mags. 

AR 15: primarily interested in 30rd mags, can be aluminum of polymer. No junk. 

Yes, I'd like to buy them at a discount. If I wanted to pay full price I'd buy from a retailer and have a warranty and have them shipped right to my door. But if you've got a pile of magazines laying around I may well be interested in taking them off your hands. I'm in the NE Valley but would consider traveling. Obviously the better the deal and the more mags involved the more willing I'd be to travel.

Anything else, even low end full builds from DPMS,  DEL-TON, double star,   you have a $500 used gun.  Sorry if you paid $1200 back during the scare, it is just the way it is.
A note on Palmetto State Armory,  I have used quite a bit of their stuff and it is decent quality.  The only beef is they are SLOW to ship,   but it DOES ship.  Expect a 10 day turn around and you will not be dissapointed.

It was originally shipped to G. W. Shroyer and Company, Dayton, Ohio, May 16, ’25, as a blue and case colored .32-20 with 7.5” barrel. It was returned to the Colt plant sometime between then and 1937, when it was changed to a Frontier Six Shooter (.44-40) with 5.5” barrel, ivory grips with medallions, and gold plated, as evidenced by the Colt rework “&” (ampersand) mark on the right rear of the trigger guard. It appears unfired since the factory rework.

As Kopec states in his book (p. 169, 1976 edition), “… in most parts of the world the SA’s hard working days were over, and … a number of its sales after 1923 were intended as gifts, presentations, prizes or just to rekindle memories of the ‘good old days.’…” This Colt typifies guns of that nature, remaining in 95% plus condition, with only the gold having been rubbed off in spots. The nickel finish, where the gold is missing, is almost perfect (gold plated guns had to be nickel plated before the gold would adhere).

This fine Colt has been custom cased in a late 1800’s lap desk, made of hardwoods and intricate inlaid veneers. It comes with the revolver’s accessories as well as antique pen, nibs and brass ink well holders. The case also has its key and locks."

In the past, carrying a small handgun normally means making some big sacrifices. Pocket pistols and handguns geared towards concealed carry typically lack the features of their larger, easier to shoot service pistol counterparts. That's all changed with the introduction of the Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380 Automatic.

With an actual set of full sized adjustable sights, a practical thumb safety, and a functional slide stop, you aren't giving up anything by switching to a smaller sidearm - except the hassles of carrying a large gun. Unlike most pocket pistols, the slide on the Bodyguard .380 stays open on the last shot. Takedown and maintenance are easy, thanks to the simple to use disassembly lever.

The Bodyguard is uniquely engineered to be the most state of the art, concealable and accurate personal protection handgun possible. Lightweight, simple to use, and reliable - nothing protects like a Bodyguard.

This Core30 features a 16"" Stainless Steel barrel with a matte bead blasted finish. The 1:10"" twist rate effectively stabilizes the heavier and longer bullets preferred for long distance shooting and defense purposes, while also adequately stabilizing lighter, shorter bullets at closer ranges. The mid-length gas system reduces heat related wear to critical internal componentry and reduces felt recoil. The muzzle is threaded and a SureFire three prong flash hider is installed

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

Starting with their Extra Large Frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVR™ has interchangeable compensators to accommodate every load and its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long-range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot! Only Smith & Wesson could deliver this much power, this much velocity and this much accuracy in a precision, production revolver.

It is in factory, perfect shape, and is unfired. It comes in its original Colt factory case.

The gun is a blue Colt 1911 Series 80 Government Model, with a factory 7-round clip. I have two new Wilson Combat stainless steel 8-round clips as well. Further, I have a Wolff 18.5 heavy duty recoil spring and a heavy-duty Wolff firing pin spring. All of these extras go with the gun for the price listed.

There are no scratches or marks on the gun. The bluing is eye-catching, beautiful (one of the best factory bluings in a model of this type that I've ever seen) and perfect, as are the beautiful factory Rosewood stocks. The gun has been stored inside a gun safe and has been oiled on a regular basis. There are no blemishes or rust of any kind. The gun is immaculate clean and the barrel (a polished factory stainless steel barrel) is also spotless clean. It has factory raised 3-dot sights, a lowered ejection port, and an extended trigger. Once again, it's a ""new"" gun, as it's never been fired and is perfect condition. It's tight, yet smooth, a true Colt. The gun is simply stunning. Dad really hates to sell it, but he's gotten very sick over the past year and needs to liquidate some of his gun collection.

I also have 250 rounds of Remington 230 grain FMJ 230 ammo that I will sell for $110. Further, I have 20 rounds of PMC Starfire 230 grain JHP that I will sell for $15.

The first $975 takes this gun. My Dad has over $1080 total in it (including the two extra $45 Wilson Combat clips, and the $10 Wolff springs), and the gun is absolutely PERFECT. This is a firm price. The ammo is a great deal as well, as I have nearly $140 in it. This gun won't last long,  as it's priced to sell.

I can meet any potential buyer either here in Owensboro, or at any meeting point a reasonable distance from Owensboro, so long as it's in the state of Kentucky. Buyers must be over 21 and Kentucky residents. Cash only.

When you research this rail make sure you are looking up the correct rail. UTG has 2 different lines of products. The UTG PRO line is much higher quality then their typical line. It is made here in the U.S. and is made of a higher quality aluminum. The side rails are slimmer then the top, in order to make it much more comfortable to grip than the fat chunky rails that most companies still make. It is a great rail and definitely one of the highest VALUED free float quadrail I have come across. It has done everything I have asked of it and more.

The DPMS Panther Mini SASS rifle is a smaller .223/5.56x45mm version of the full size Panther LRT-SASS (.308 Win./7.62x51mm). The original DPMS SASS rifle was designed to meet the needs of snipers who needed a single, high capacity rifle that is just as effective and useful for long range shots as it is for CQB scenarios. The Mini SASS is just a smaller caliber version of the original. Comes with two 30 round magazines, one Harris Swivel Series bipod, one Fobus bipod adapter, and one nylon web sling. SCOPE INCLUDED.

Recently I received a medium sized bag of rare ammo. from the head stamps it appears to be of 41 caliber and 42 caliber pistol ammo. a quick google search show this ammo can be used in a current modern 45 auto or 45 ACP. I am wondering if this is true to experience, has anyone shot this ammo in a new day 45? also since I have never seen it retail or at any guns shows, I am wondering the collector value, or antique value, or even the trade value?

I am mostly looking to get educated on these caliber's. I don't know any thing about them.
it appears to be pistol ammo, but I have no idea, again the head stamps say 41 cal and 42 cal.

if you are interested in them, I may or may not be willing to trade, deal, barter, sell, etc, but not entirely sure yet. I need to determine my fcats and values.

any help any of you can share with me would be fantastic
any links, or any storys of experience, etc.

I hope to post a pic soon. thank you to each of you reads and or responds for your very valuable time in advance. I appreciate the help."

Here is a pre-owned revolver in good condition, shows minor wear from use. I made the mistake of polishing this gun w/ a stainless brush, so it shows some light discoloration in the metal, but may be worked out w/ some light buffing. I purchased this gun in 2006 & has since had about 300 rounds shot through it. I only used the magnum cylinder just a few times. The grips are in mint condition, showing no scratches, dents, dings, abrasions, etc. This gun comes with both cylinders, original box, manual, lock, original receipt, etc. I live in Opp, Alabama. If interested contact Davy Ham at 334 - 764 -3482. Thanks."

This pistol is Not C&R Eligible. It cannot be transferred to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. Here is a direct descendant of the Soviet manufactured model TT-30 steel frame Tokarev pistol; only this Zastava M70A is chambered in standard 9mm Luger caliber. Origins of this pistol was when the Soviets pirated John M. Browning’s 1903 design and modified and chambered the new pistol for their purposes. Several of this one’s ancestors saw action against the Nazi Army in World War II, and even against our soldiers in Vietnam. Crvena Zastava began manufacturing on Russian milling equipment shortly after World War II, when Yugoslavian Marshal Tito successfully courted the Soviets. As far as Specs, type is blowback single action semi-auto. Manufacturer is Zastava Arms of Kragujevac Serbia. Importer and service warrantor is Century Arms of Georgia, VT, and so marked on the right forward side of the slide. Caliber is 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19mm, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Each pistol comes with two magazines, and capacity is 9 + 1 rounds. Barrel length is 4 1/2 inches; sights are blue steel dovetailed low partridge front with dovetailed steel rear; weight empty is 31 1/2 ounces with center of gravity at the magazine release; grips are classic Soviet style serrated polymer but with Crvena Zastava logo pattern. This is the best made, commercially available Tokarev 9mm pistol there is. We’re offering the M70A in the photos, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 249.00. Not C&R Eligible; not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts.

 Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Fire Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to bump fire more safely, offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! You can now safely and accurately bump-fire your AR-15 at an incredible rate. Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.

 Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.

 The primary difference between the SSAR-15 SBS™ and the SSAR-15 OGR™ is the design intent. In an effort to cater to varying consumer preferences, the SSAR-15 SBS™ is designed to resemble current combat rifle stocks. In addition, the SSAR-15 SBS™ was designed with multiple accessories in mind which will be available in the near future.

This pistol is Not C&R Eligible. It cannot be transferred to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. Here is a direct descendant of the Soviet manufactured model TT-30 steel frame Tokarev pistol; only this Zastava M88A is chambered in standard 9mm Luger caliber. Origins of this pistol was when the Soviets pirated John M. Browning’s 1903 design and modified and chambered the new pistol for their purposes. Several of this one’s ancestors saw action against the Nazi Army in World War II, and even against our soldiers in Vietnam. Crvena Zastava began manufacturing on Russian milling equipment shortly after World War II, when Yugoslavian Marshal Tito successfully courted the Soviets. The M88A is the compact variant, of the Government Size M57 and Russian T33, a Commander size, if you will, with a 1 round shorter magazine. As far as Specs, type is blowback single action semi-auto. Manufacturer is Zastava Arms of Kragujevac Serbia. Importer and service warrantor is Century Arms of Georgia, VT. Forward right side of the slide is marked with Century Arms’s stamp. Caliber is 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19mm, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Each pistol comes with one magazine, and capacity is 8 + 1 rounds, Barrel length is 3 3/4 inches; sights are blue steel dovetailed low partridge front with dovetailed steel rear, 3 dot configuration; weight empty is 25 1/2 ounces with center of gravity at the magazine release; grips are polymer factory with checkered lower panels and thumb rest type uppers. This is the best made, commercially available Tokarev 9mm pistol there is. According to the box markings, the photo specimen and its mates were manufactured in 2012, and it is well greased, as the photos show. We’re offering the M88 in the photos, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 249.00. Not C&R Eligible; not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts.

With bayonet and pouches and oil can. I'm figuring the numbers do not match. The original numbers are all replaced with etched numbers, in the steel. But the new etched numbers DO ALL MATCH on all components. I read on the Web that after the rifles were captured/surrendered, back in the war, they were then disassembled then put back together (at a later date) in a random order and the newly assembled parts were re-numbered (via etching on the steel) after assembly. This may or may not be true, but I read it in several different places. 
I bought several Mosins a while back- for some projects (Arch Angel and Blugrass thumbhole stocks, with scopes) and saved this one because the wood looked too nice to do the stock swap. I am done with my mosin projects and will not use this one. I paid $160.00 for it, I want $160.00 back. Or I will trade it for a 12 or 20 gauge or a .22 rifle or handgun. Maybe a HiPoint 9 or 40. I just want something back of near value or the 160.00 I spent on it.
I have never fired it, but everything works smoothly. The wood is not perfect, but it is a nice reddish color that looked a lot better than than the others that I bought. I couldn't bring myself to ""modify"" this one. The others had junk wood so it was an easy decision. It is Russian with the hammer stamp on it.

I need your help. Recently I received a medium sized bag of rare ammo. from the head stamps it appears to be of 41 caliber and 42 caliber pistol ammo. a quick google search show this ammo can be used in a current modern 45 auto or 45 ACP. I am wondering if this is true to experience, has anyone shot this ammo in a new day 45? also since I have never seen it retail or at any guns shows, I am wondering the collector value, or antique value, or even the trade value?

IT IS MY CURRENT UNDERSTANDING THAT this is rare extinct military ammo, very old, so I have been told. for old military weapons.l

 I am mostly looking to get educated on these caliber's. I don't know any thing about them.
 it appears to be pistol ammo, but I have no idea, again the head stamps say 41 cal and 42 cal.

This rifle has matching numbers, and the stock cartouche is clearly visible.  The bolt was modified to be a flat bolt, and the receiver was originally drilled for a scope mount, and those holes have been filled.

The Mosin Nagant rifles were developed at Tula by Sergi Mosin.  The feed system was developed by Belgian designer Leon Nagant.  Russian production began in 1892 and took place at the Imperial ordnance factories at Tula, Sestroryetsk nd Izhevsk.  The Model 1891 is a 7.62x54R mm bolt action rifle with a 31.6 inch bbl, a 5 shot integral magazine, and a ladder rear sight.  The weight of these rifles is about 9.5 lbs and they were used extensively in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905.  This is a very nice example of that rifle.

Here is one of the best products from Turkish Gunmakers, the most competitive producers in the gun market. This is SAR Arms’s model B6P9, a slick made, credible clone of the tried and true CZ75 Wondernine, as we called them in the 1970s. Its price competition to both Baby Eagles and parent CZs themselves is making more than ripples in the firearms industry. Design, of course, descends from John M. Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Manufacturer is Sarsilmaz of Istanbul, Republic of Turkey. Importer is European American Armory, E.A.A., of Rockledge, Florida. Type is traditional single and double action blowback semi-automatic. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts all in a steel lined polymer frame. Finish is matte blue. Barrel is 4.6 inch 6 groove, hard chrome plated with matching full length steel guide rod and pressed in barrel bushing. Slide to frame fit is excellent, with full contact slide rails that runs the length of the slide. Sights are three dot cp,bat configuration, dovetailed rear sight and rivet secured modified partridge front, 5 1/2 inch sight radius. Hammer is .315 black matte steel serrated skeleton Commander type, with .312 smooth face matching combat trigger. Double action pull is hitchy from a resting hammer, but smooth and consistent from the half cock position. Single action pull on the photo specimen measured 5 1/2 pounds with minimal felt creep. This pistol has a firing pin safety and ambidextrous main safety for right- and left-handed shooters. Lever safety will engage in all three hammer positions: full rest, half cock, and fully cocked for secure carry and single action cocked-and-locked readiness. The safety Does Not decock the hammer. Trigger guard configuration is SP01 type square serrated front face, and the grip frame is serrated fore and aft, with vertical scores on the panel areas that contain Sar Arms’s logos. Grip frame will accommodate a Hogue Handall if the owner feels the need to use a rubber. Magazine is Sarsilmaz’s own proprietary CZ type, blue steel body and floorplate with steel spring and red polymer cartridge follower. Capacity is 15 rounds of 9mm Luger / Parabellum Ammunition. This is an excellent pistol. Fit and finish are excellent. Similar pistols from the parent CZ manufacturer command pricing upwards of $700 apiece. While we expect substantial price increases, we’re nevertheless offering the SAR Arms / EAA B6P9 in the photos, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 269.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, Maryland, or Massachusetts. Add any number of Mec-Gar CZ7516B 16 Shot magazines [subject to our stock on hand] at $29 per with gun purchase. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 15 round magazines are restricted, we will sub a 10 round Baby Eagle magazine for $10 extra, or $10 off with no magazines. Affected jurisdictions include Chicago Cook County IL, Connecticut, Hawaii, and New York.

The Mil Spec ProMag Side Sling Swivel for the M16 and AR-15 was originally designed for soldiers to make use of their slings while having an M203 grenade launcher mounted underneath their M16. Today this barrel mounted device has expanded its usefulness to include any number of tactical accessories that are mounted underneath the barrel of an M16 or AR-15. Tactical lights, lasers, bipods, or any number of accessories could get in the way of the use of a sling mounted normally, but with the ProMag Side Sling Swivel your sling stays out of the way but still easy to access.
