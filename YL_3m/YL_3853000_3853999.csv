The bolt is long and sturdy with dual opposing locking lugs. The separate bolt head employs a plunger-type ejector. It cocks on opening. The lockup is tight enough that it takes a good slap up with the palm to release it and a slap down after running it forward to chamber a round. Although compared to some rifles, the safety seems almost like a World War II design used on the Springfield ’03 or other rifles, but I actually like it: Flicking it to the right puts it on “safe,” and the left is “fire.” This safety locks the firing pin to the rear when applied.

Probably the first thing most shooters will notice about the AR-30A1’ is its large muzzle brake with dual baffles. I’ve shot most of the current .338 Lapua Magnum sniping rifles and have found that a muzzle brake is a necessity. This brake is screwed on using 3/4×24 threads, the standard for many suppressors.

A utilitarian aluminum chassis that is bedded using a V-block keeps weight down and enhances accuracy, as does the free-floating, 26-inch barrel. ArmaLite offers two versions of the AR-30A1, Standard and Target models, and I received the latter for testing. The Target version features an adjustable cheekrest and buttpad to help tailor the rifle to the shooter, allowing them to get the best cheekweld. The cheekpiece allows 1 inch of vertical adjustment, while the length of pull may be adjusted from 13.6 to 15.6 inches."

The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included.

 FROM THE MANUFACTURER:

The GLOCK 19 is ideal for a more versatile role because of its reduced dimensions when compared to the standard sized option. Chambered in 9x19, the G19 has found worldwide acclaim with both private and public security agencies. In addition to being used as a conventional service pistol, it is ideal for concealed carry or as a backup weapon."

The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included.

To fully load the Carcano the Enbloc clips are needed. So to add to the rifle, I will be throwing in 5 vintage boxes of Italian made 6.5x52 ammo. Each box contains 18 rounds and 3 enbloc clips (except one with 16 rounds and 4 clips) totaling for 88 rounds and 16 enbloc clips. These rounds are the correct match for the rifle and will shoot accurately through it. Carcano's overall have a bad rep of being inaccurate, but this comes from use of incorrect ammo, such as Privi's 6.5 chambered ammo. 

If you would like to see pictures of anything or have any questions or concerns,  please feel free to ask. This rifle alone is a great piece to any collection, and even nicer with the addition of the ammo.

     The first of the month is quickly approaching along with the whole slew of finincial commitments that go right along with it. I'm sure that i am in the same boat as a lot of folks in the aspect that I might have ngone just a little bit overboard this holliday season. Therefore I am selling off some of my surplus ammo.
     So up for sale today are two wooden crates of .308. There are 1,060 rounds in each crate for a total of just over 2,100. I am selling them for $400 per crate, of for a mere $700 if you buy both. I am expecting these to go rather quickly, and am taking cash only. If you are seeing this add then the ammo is still available. Also, I am trying to sell this today, preferably in the next couple hours, as this is my one day off.

No Batteries! No switches. No Bullshit. Built by the best combat optic manufacturer on the planet and virtually indestructible. I love the scope but failing vision has forced me to go with magnified optics.

For Sale $400. This scope retails at $519. Trijicon ACOG RX06 Dual Illumination Reflex Sight with 12.9 moa amber triangle reticle. The tip of the triangle is the aiming point which makes it more precise than a regular small moa red dot. I bought this less than 2 years ago. There is one very minor mark on the right side of the scope which is visible in the pic.. There are marks on the inside of the mount where the screws were tightened down. I never registered it so you can register the warranty. I bought it because it is always on and my EOTech was always dead. It is a great scope but I need magnification at this stage of the game. I can accept Visa, Master Card and Discover, cash and possible trades.

A really nice example of a WWII Enfield. The metal and wood look good for a rifle from 1941 that most likely did see some combat by the number of markings it has. I would like to sell or trade it as a package. I have a book I bought for it a few years ago at an Indy 1500. I have 240 rounds of ammo, all of it Greek HXP except for a box of PPU.

Used in Wyoming when I was hunting by horseback in the mountains and in excellent ++ condition.  Blaze orange to help prevent a hunter from mistaking you and your horse for an elk--don't laugh, it happens.  It is called a rifle saddle scabbard by Cabelas I bought new in the 90s and can be partly unzipped to use it scabbard style.  It is made in USA, with thick shearling wool style full lining (synthetic I guess but durable and provides a thick protection cushion unlike neoprene or other rubberized stuff that wears and tears) Allen brand heavy ballistic cordura outer with end hanging loop, double built-in carrying straps, heavy chromed steel D rings, original separate nylon buckle straps for attaching to saddle fixings, velcro closure-rifle retainer straps at butt end when using with butt end unzipped scabbard style, and built in semi hard rubberized muzzle boot for extra protection of the rifle muzzle.  Very well taken care of.  Used but never abused.  No snags, rips, tears, repairs or rub wear.  If you horse hunt then this is one of the best saddle scabbard cases made--NOT CHINESE manufacture.  The custom leather ones that will rub blue off of and/or tarnish or rust your gun run $170 unlined to $200 lined and will no way protect your fine rifle like this Allen scabbard/case will.  Check me and see on that.  Of course it is just as easily used without the straps as a very well padded carry along rifle case.  It also fit every rifle I ever put in it scoped or not from a little .280 Rem A-Bolt Micro Browning to my monster 8mm Mag Custom shop Rem.  Email to w v spark at gmail dot com."

If you've ever shot something with 5.56/.223 and only pissed it off... Upgrade. 

This is a one shot, one kill rifle, so 300 rounds is about a lifetime supply of ammo.   The 6.8 caliber round has twice the grains of powder of 5.56 and can withstand a significant amount of pressure vs. the 5.56.

$1450 as is 

Add $300 to substitute Bushmaster lower for a DTI Lower with Slide Fire Stock that shoots at rate of fire 500 rounds per minute) This lower can be put on an AR-15 upper making fire legally like a full auto M-16.  ATF paperwork included and must remain with the lower.

This rifle is in very good condition for its age and what many of these rifles went through. Like usual with these rifles, there are no import marks. These rifles are much harder to come by than the m38's and are more desirable due to the adjustable sights. Both models M38's and M1891's come with attached bayonets.

This Carbine like all others produced before the M38 model is chambered in 6.5x52 Carcano. To fully load the Carcano the Enbloc clips are needed. These clips hold 6 rounds. So to add to the rifle, I will be throwing in 5 vintage boxes of Italian made 6.5x52 ammo. Each box contains 18 rounds and 3 enbloc clips (except one with 16 rounds and 4 clips) totalling for 88 rounds and 16 enbloc clips. These rounds are the correct match for the rifle and will shoot accurately through it. Carcano's overall have a bad rep of being inaccurate, but this comes from use of incorrect ammo, such as Privi's 6.5 chambered ammo. 

If you would like to see pictures of anything or have any questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. This rifle alone is a great piece to any collection, and even nicer with the addition of the ammo. I'm asking only $500 cash value or $550 trade value. If you offer something worth more in a trade, I may be willing to add cash or more ammo to make up the difference."

The gun is extremely accurate and has very little felt recoil.

Looking to trade at this time. If trading for a different caliber I have about 300+ rounds of .45 I can throw in."

I have a very cool item up for trade. Its an original Colt Pen Flare Gun. It is in a non original green steel case stamped U.S. It comes with 18 flares with 7 of them being original Colt. It also comes with 4 smoke cartridges. I do not want to sell this package, trade only, which is how I acquired it. I will trade the whole package for a nice handgun or rifle. I would also entertain offers for ammo, mags and tactical gear. Please be realistic. The last one I could find that sold for cash brought 149 dollars with only 2 flares, no smoke and no box. The flares are worth 180 dollars alone and the smoke is worth another 80. These were carried by pilots during the 60s and 70s as signal devices should they go down. These are incredibly hard to find in this condition. Pen is in excellent shape, not beat to hell like all the ones I found online. Thank you for looking. P.S. There is no catagory for these so I chose .45 ACP, which is obviously not correct."

Love the sights on this gun as well. front sight is ( i think) 24kt gold bead and the rear is a V shape. I've never needed scope because it's so easy to aim. Notice this has the full cylndar as well instead of fluted.

Probably shot at most a 100 rds in the years I've had it. I don' think it was shot that much, but I do think it was a hunting gun. it has holster wear on the finish and some light scratches. Gun shoes no signs of ever being dropped. 

Again, this is a crazy awesome gun. Hard to come by and also a prelock. I'll call smith and wesson on monday and find out when it was made. I'm guessing late 90's early 2000's.

The 30Hz ThOR 320 9x Thermal Weapon Sight from ATN is a multi-purpose thermal imaging device equipped for intermediate to long-range targeting and observation. By analyzing the heat signature of a visual scene, this scope is capable of seeing through fog, dust, daylight, and darkness to reveal subjects of interest where the naked eye sees none. This thermal imager can be weapon mounted for tactical engagement as well as tripod mounted and handheld for patrol and reconnaissance missions. When it comes to covert operations, the ThOR gives a tactical professional the advantage over a subject in their crosshairs.
A 320x240 microbolometer sits at the core of the ThOR imaging system. This heat sensor has 50mK sensitivity, capable of distinguishing subtle temperature differences and creating well-defined thermal images. An RCA video port allows the transmitted image to be outputted at full-resolution to video monitors and recording devices. The detector's 30Hz refresh rate delivers near-real time images that are ideal for intelligence gathering and essential for long-range target engagement.

The 9x configuration of the ThOR transmits a 3x2.4° angle of view. For a closer look, digital zoom can magnify the visual scene by 2x or 4x. For a better view of the displayed image, this electro-optic has image enhancement tools, including brightness adjustment and multiple polarity modes. The five polarity modes allow the operator to designate white-hot, black-hot, or even transpose the heat signature into a false-color image. Additionally, the shooter can select from five reticle patterns and five reticle colors to customize the sight for their task.

In addition to the optical features and functionality, the ThOR thermal scope is built to handle the rigors of the battlefield. The waterproof scope housing is constructed of aerospace aluminum and anodized with a type III hard coat that resists corrosion and scratching. Using the included quick-release Picatinny mount, this optic is ready to endure the recoil force of heavy caliber ammo. The built-in OLED color display, accessory side rail, and comfortable 28mm eye relief complement this scope's range of features, and help make the ThOR a fully-loaded thermal optic for tactical engagement, threat detection and intelligence gathering.

Zeiss Victory HT 1.1-4x24mm Scope Product Info

Zeiss Victory HT 1.1-4x24mm Scope is a high definition scope that combines precision reticle technology with high quality optics to create a versatile, low-power scope that will serve you well in a wide range of hunting applications. These Zeiss scopes are equipped with premium Schott HT high transmission glass, which combines with the T* multi-layer lens coating to create an impressive light transmission rate of 95%, great for hunting in the dimmest lighting conditions. The close-range, 1.1x to 4x magnification range of the scope is ideal for driving, stalking, and open range safari shooting, with its fast target acquisition capabilities, wide field of view, and comfortable eye relief. The Zeiss Victory HT 1.1-4x T* Coated scope has an ergonomic body design with easy side-wheel illuminated dot adjustment, rubberized surfaces, and a 30mm tube that will mount to most scope rings. Zeiss Optics has incorporated their efficient LotuTec coating on the Victory HT, which makes moisture roll right off the lens, improving your sighting capability in rain or snow. No matter what reticle you choose, every Zeiss Victory HT scope uses one of the brightest illuminated dot systems in the world with fully adjustable dimming capability, and since the reticle is located on the second image plane, it will always stay in focus while you change powers. An ideal close range scope to achieve victory on the hunt, use the Zeiss Sport Optics Victory HT 1.1-4x24 Schott Glass Scope.

I am selling a blown CT4K. only thing wrong with it is 2 capacitors popped which you can see in the pictures. I called amp medics at ampmedics.com and they quoted me 100-150$ to fix it and ship it back. However i already picked up a DC Audio 5k so no longer need the 4k. just looking to get rid of it quick for a good price. ive seen them selling for 800-850 used on Facebook and craigslist. There is a scratch on the cover but thats the only thing cosmetically wrong with it. Was a great amp just couldnt push my 8s very well, so had to up the power.

I've carried it myself for a while and it's great but I've moved on to another carry piece so this one is up for someone who loves revolvers and want the punch of a .357 and have the option of carrying +p .38 special. It has been carried so shows some signs of that with a couple of scratches here and there but it's stainless so doesn't take away from the durability and beauty. Very little if any rust anywhere to be found. The grips you see on her are not the original ones. These are Pachmayr presentation grips and are worn but still absorb recoil. 

I'm including a few extras in this deal. Here is what comes along with the Smith at my asking price:

6 Rounds of .357 Magnum HP Self-Defense Ammo

The Tac-Con 3MR Trigger System is the latest trend for gun enthusiasts that want selectable firing from their AR-15. This drop in system is a three-mode model. The first position is “Safe” as it is in all of the ARs. The 2nd mode converts the gun into semi-automatic mode which contains a single stage, 4.5 pound pull, match grade. The 3rd is TAC CON patented single stage, 4.5 pound pull, with almost no take up and contains a positive reset feature that reduces the time between shoots. The 3rd mode is a balance between a higher rate of fire with controllability.

Once installed, the 3MR will allow the shooter to reach higher rates of fire without compromising accuracy. Different tests have been performed at different gun ranges with test subjects reporting much higher rates of fire then they could with the original trigger group when engaged in the 3rd mode. It is the method in which the device is designed that allows for such rapid fire in such a smooth manner. Because of the design, however, it is not considered a fully automatic part and is 100 percent BATFE classified as a semi-automatic AR 15 trigger."

For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with collapsible stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

Also, There is also a Browning sling with the gun.

People have asked if this gun was accurate, so I decided to go and shot the gun to show how accurate it can get. I have attached a target that I shot on 1/4/2015. I loaded IMR 4350 at 72.5 gr. using Sierra GameKing 165 gr. HPBT, and the bullet was set at 3.389 due to box length max's 3.390. The target was at 100 yards. As you can see I shot a 5 shot group for testing and I had 1 pull. The other 4 you can cover the holes with a quarter. 

If you are interested in the scope it is a Vortex 30mm - 6.5-20 x 50 Viper and will be an additional $600.

The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. 

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."

I am interested in a conversion service for a Saiga-12 shotgun.  I bought mine in NJ and couldn't have it converted due to the fact that NJ law prohibits autoloading shotguns from having a pistol grip.

I want to touch on this- as I had tried to discuss with a gunsmith, who actually was completely wrong regarding the law.  The Saiga-12 is completely and totally legal to be ""converted"" to a pistol-grip and AK/AR/Skeleton shoulder stock .. because in fact it is not a CONVERSION, it's a RESTORATION.  They are factory made with that configuration in mind - but due to the USA importation laws, the guns are then ""sporterized"" by the factory, which involves the installation of a standard shotgun/rifle shoulder stock.  However, this move requires the trigger group be transitioned back an inch or two, as the fire control group could not be accessed when gripping a shoulder-stock grip.

The ""Conversion"" process is in fact a restoration - the fire control group moves forward to it's intended (original ) location, a pistol grip and shoulder stock installed, and you're good to go.  The legality comes in on the ""922R"" laws, which are importation codes requiring an imported gun to have a certain amount of American-made parts post modifications.  I am very familiar with these laws and not intending to break any, but a gunsmith wouldn't help me because he didn't understand these laws.  I am just not comfortable doing this work myself as I don't have the tools and haven't done it before, so I need to hire someone (who is very good and familiar at this area of expertise).

I can buy all the parts needed and simply pay you for the job, if you're capable and interested please message me back.  I could also pay in ammo if you like.  We can discuss the compensation to mutual satisfaction.  Thanks much for listening and hopefully contacting me!

(The Saiga-12 was a Christmas present to my father a few years back, and I swore I'd get it converted for Christmas in Florida for him, and that never happened yet despite both of us moving to Florida now.)"

A PSA Premium Lower Parts Kit was used, it also has a Magpul grip and Magpul trigger guard.  The trigger in this one feels better than most standard triggers IMO, but not as good as the $200+ Timney trigger, of course.

$220 firm in cash on the lower or $280 with the Magpul CTR stock.  I don't mind keeping the CTR stock for a future project.

If wanting to do some type of trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I don't need anything in trades, but I will consider trading if the deal makes sense on my end, otherwise, I'll take cash.  I have other items listed as well, if you have a firearm trade of more value of course.

Here is the short list of items I might can use right now, FN SCAR 16 and 17, Tavor, CX4 in 9mm(92FS model) or maybe the CX4 .45ACP model, quality stripped billet AR-10 lowers and parts kits(trigger group not needed as I would replace it anyway), Sig pistol arm braces for the AR and AK(2 for AK), maybe a complete AR-10 or just the lower or upper with 16""-20"" medium or maybe a heavy fluted barrel (no bull barrels please) and a Century C39 pistol, maybe other AK-47 rifles.

Semi-auto rifles, pistols and maybe shotguns(pumps too), revolvers, ammo in common calibers, maybe quality optics and/or red dots.  Again, I am open to firearms related trades, depending on the deal.

Ftf in the Garland area, I will meet along I-30 from Rockwall to Lowe's in Mesquite or Dick's at Firewheel mall.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX."
