The P250 a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the 'To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability' you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

I Just picked up a Model 15-2 Combat Masterpiece that shoots amazing, but needs some TLC.  It's not a pretty gun (pitted, little bluing, a little rust), so I'm not looking to spend a fortune. I just really like it and want it cleaned up - and fixed - up RIGHT.  The issues I noticed were: 1) Cyl is tight opening, such that the ""button"" drags along the ramp 2) even after basic lubing, ejector rod is a bit tight and gritty for the last bit of travel 3) Hammer hangs up sometimes when decocking. 

If you're good with these old revolvers, Please give me a shout.

Some trades considered, no junk, no long guns or Florida guns. 
More info on trades: Be realistic in placing a value on your trade in, look at the value of closed sales on gun broker auction sites etc. That is the amount we would expect to get for your gun when it is resold. Since we are a for profit business we must be able to make a profit on your gun, we are not gun collectors or gun enthusiasts at all, just in the business of firearm sales, so we would offer you less than average retail. Your gun is used, regardless of the amount (if any) that it has been shot, it is a used gun and will be resold as such. Customers paying shipping costs and FFL transfer fees are not willing to pay anywhere close to retail store prices. Your gun is worth a lot less than you think. The amount you paid for your gun makes no difference in the current market value. We are fair and pay more than pawn shops.

Description:  The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use. The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Here's a great little 22 that I really like, so I’m selling it for a pinch more than the normal amount.

As you probably know, small (pocket) pistols tend to not be very accurate and have problems like failure to feed and/or extract.  This 22 is very accurate and it doesn't jam.  I hear people say 22's are not good for conceal carry, but let me tell you, unless it's a bear, it's not going to continue coming at you if you quickly pump 10 rounds into it.
Here's a picture of me shooting one magazine thru it. I shot a bit high, not it. If I adjust my shots (as I do with more shots), I wipe out the red (3 inches at 10 yards). No other $150 gun can do this.

First is an original factory 5 shot clip/magazine properly marked including nov 25 1919 patent date. Functions flawlessly in both my 69a and my 75. I think these work in the model 52 and 57 as well; but, I am not sure.

Second is an extremely rare single shot adapterl. Top is spring loaded to function like the follower in a standard magazine. It locks in the well just like the clip. I have been told these were used as training aids by the US Army before WW2 but again that is hearsay. The body of the device is aluminum instead of steel which tends to support that contention. There is a bit of red stain [paint I believe as it sure cant be rust] in the edges of the well on the sides. Again I have been told these were painted red for training purposes. I just dont know for sure. I have had it for almost 30 years so I know it sure isnt a modern fake of some kind. 
I will ship these via priority mail insured to any location in the USA for $10. No shipping anywhere else. I will accept paypal [NO ECHECKS] or postal MO for payment . Cash always cheerfully accepted if you pick them up."

Springfield Armory SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close quarter battle
rifles. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial
at a distance. They feature 16 inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a
civilian owned rifle) made possible by a retuned gas system. A proprietary,
high efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you
to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The Cluster
Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by
accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit
a standard picatinny rail.

I figure there might be someone out there who would like to have it. The guy I got it from said he got it from an Ex-Marine if it helps at all.

From what I have found, I think it may be made out of rubber or some sort of plastic...it's very hard and as you can see, it has definitely had some use in it's life.

This is NOT a real firearm and cannot be made to fire.

It does have a metal barrel.

There are some markings on it too:
On the left side, above the magazine, there is a circle. Inside the circle, there is a stallion up on his hind legs.
Under the Circle is stamped:
PROPERTY
OF U.S. GOVT.
M16A2
CAL 5.56MM

And a serial number, but I can only make out a few of the numbers: 65??8??

Also on the left, but above the Fire Selector Switch is stamped:

Lastly, on the rear Right Side of the Buttstock, someone has etched ""BLADES A H""

One rifle, one pistol. Both lowers built from stripped receivers and assembled as pistols first, so you can legally swap both of them back and forth. Uppers are as-built unless otherwise noted.

Lowers: built by me on Spike's normal ie spider rollmark lowers. LPK was mil-spec PSA (the name brand PSA, not their lower level generic brand). They have the ""cap screw through the grip hole threads"" trigger mod, easily reversed if you desire. Ditto with the rear take down pin detent spring mod. Threading was factory from Spike's, so no half ass home tapping here. Both unfired  sad and with no to very minimal finish wear. I don't think either of them have any scratches, but I'll need to check before I can swear to it. Grip on both is a Blackhawk. They pass function tests with flying colors. One has a Magpul ASAP sling plate and MOE stock. The other has an A2 buffer tube with a Sig brace. Both with appropriate springs and buffers for their respective tubes.

Uppers: GI charging handles, AIM inside and out nitrided BCG (name brand not the unmarked and unwarrantied generic). One is  V1 one is V2. Bolt in both cases is MPI Carpenter 158. http://www.aimsurplus.com/product.aspx?item=XAIMBCGV2&name=AIM+v2+BLACK+NITRIDE+.223%2f5.56%2f.300+BLACKOUT+AR%2fM16+C158+Bolt+Carrier+Group&groupid=931&fprdct=1

AAC 9"" .300 blackout upper, the same as here except for the BCG http://www.advanced-armament.com/300-BLK-Upper-9-Barrel_p_461.html Small scratch on the right side above the rear takedown pin. It's a tight fit on both the Spike's lowers, haven't tried it on any others. I have a Magpul AFG bolted to the bottom, directly to the smooth side of the URX. Had low rounds on it when I bought it, I was told <200 and I believe it. Haven't has a chance to fire it.  sad  sad 

If the .300 goes I also have... 5 or 6 boxes I think, of the Barnes 110 grain VOR-TX black tip ammo, generally considered one of if not the best supersonic anti-personnel load commercially available in this caliber. Loaded into mags but not cycled. Won't need it without the upper, so I can sell or include in the swap to even out value. Won't go if I still have the upper. http://www.midwayusa.com/product/430384/barnes-vor-tx-ammunition-300-aac-blackout-110-grain-tipped-tac-tx-bullet-flat-base-lead-free-box-of-20

One rifle, one pistol. Both lowers built from stripped receivers and assembled as pistols first, so you can legally swap both of them back and forth. Uppers are as-built unless otherwise noted.

Lowers: built by me on Spike's normal ie spider rollmark lowers. LPK was mil-spec PSA (the name brand PSA, not their lower level generic brand). They have the ""cap screw through the grip hole threads"" trigger mod, easily reversed if you desire. Ditto with the rear take down pin detent spring mod. Threading was factory from Spike's, so no half ass home tapping here. Both unfired  sad and with no to very minimal finish wear. I don't think either of them have any scratches, but I'll need to check before I can swear to it. Grip on both is a Blackhawk. They pass function tests with flying colors. One has a Magpul ASAP sling plate and MOE stock. The other has an A2 buffer tube with a Sig brace. Both with appropriate springs and buffers for their respective tubes.

Uppers: GI charging handles, AIM inside and out nitrided BCG (name brand not the unmarked and unwarrantied generic). One is  V1 one is V2. Bolt in both cases is MPI Carpenter 158. http://www.aimsurplus.com/product.aspx?item=XAIMBCGV2&name=AIM+v2+BLACK+NITRIDE+.223%2f5.56%2f.300+BLACKOUT+AR%2fM16+C158+Bolt+Carrier+Group&groupid=931&fprdct=1

AAC 9"" .300 blackout upper, the same as here except for the BCG http://www.advanced-armament.com/300-BLK-Upper-9-Barrel_p_461.html Small scratch on the right side above the rear takedown pin. It's a tight fit on both the Spike's lowers, haven't tried it on any others. I have a Magpul AFG bolted to the bottom, directly to the smooth side of the URX. Had low rounds on it when I bought it, I was told <200 and I believe it. Haven't has a chance to fire it.  sad  sad 

If the .300 goes I also have... 5 or 6 boxes I think, of the Barnes 110 grain VOR-TX black tip ammo, generally considered one of if not the best supersonic anti-personnel load commercially available in this caliber. Loaded into mags but not cycled. Won't need it without the upper, so I can sell or include in the swap to even out value. Won't go if I still have the upper. http://www.midwayusa.com/product/430384/barnes-vor-tx-ammunition-300-aac-blackout-110-grain-tipped-tac-tx-bullet-flat-base-lead-free-box-of-20

Hey there.  I'm a law abiding Texas citizen who has been on this site for a while and been through several trades.  Much like the rest of you, I enjoy trying out various firearms and have spent thousands of dollars in my pursuit of such.  Being that I'd like to stay married for a while longer I'm looking for like minded individuals who are honest, avoid games and take excellent care of their firearms.  I'm preferably looking for a trade and have a few guns up for consideration starting with the Glock in this ad.  Please keep reading for additional details and look for my other trade offers including - Stoeger Cougar 8000 9mm w/extras, Taurus PT145 Millennium Pro .45, HK P2000sk 9mm and Spikes Tactical AR w/several tasteful mods.  Unlike some - ALL of my stuff is always up for trade given the right circumstance (including my children ;-) although don't tell me wife please).

DESCRIPTION:

Firearm in question is a Glock 32.  I've owned this semi for about a year and a half only carrying it a few times otherwise used sparingly at the range.  This Glock is chambered in .40 with a stainless Wildcat barrel which is very nice addition over the stock .40 Glock barrel.  This Glock has Crimson Trace lasergrips on it and comes with both .40 and 357 mags, some spare .40 ammo (roughly 40 rounds) and locked soft carry case.  She shoots flawlessly and like most Glocks super accurate.  Crimson Trace lasergrips are obviously a nice addition and is dead on at about 15 yards.  I've put about 500 rounds total through this guy and like my other guns was immaculately maintained being cleaned and oiled after every single use.  Link for specs in the case anyone isn't aware:

http://us.glock.com/products/model/g32

TRADES:

I'm really looking for a nice SA/DA pistol in either .45 or 9mm being that most my other semi's are .40's.  I'd love to find another Kimber Pro/Ultra and willing to add cash or other valuables (your preference) to the trade.  I'm also interested in acquiring a shotgun as I don't have one at the moment and feeling a bit vulnerable for home defense.  All other compact 1911 frames will be considered.

All other trades will be considered as well so please send over any interests.  The worst either party can say is no and I have no problem field stripping to take additional pics for those interested however would just request you do the same if offering a firearm.

FAQ:

Why are you trading?  ~ Simple answer is I own two Glock 32's.  My primary has been heavily used for carry and at the range.  It also has sentimental value having acquired it through my late father.  Being I have two and want the option of adding to my collection versus spending the money it makes the most sense to part with at the moment.

Where are you willing to travel?  ~ I'm in the Lake Worth area however willing to travel 20-30 min for the right trade.  If an even trade I'd only ask that you meet me half way which seems fair.  If the trade is a little more or less I'm willing to travel further or shorter to accommodate.  Time is money and money is time.  Please be fair with both.

Trade requirements?  ~ I only ask for a bill of sale, F2F meeting and current TX DL or CHL.  This follows law and it is important that I do so as well.

Any other questions please don't hesitate to contact me."

I have had this 25-06 for a few years now and absolutely love the gun. It shoots great but I would like to buy another lightweight stainless carry rifle. This is the ONLY reason for the sale. I have hunted with it a little so it does have a few normal marks but it is a very nice rifle otherwise. The stock is bedded and the lop is 13"". It has a 26"" Medium contour target grade/crown barrel, NOT the bull barrel. This thing really shoots with virtually no recoil.

The trades I would consider would be:

257 Roberts
257 Weatherby with ammo and reloading dies
260
280
6.5x55
6.5 Creedmoor 
35 Whelen
Possibly a HK VP9
Glock 10mm SF with extras
Would also consider NICE optics
Partial trade plus cash OK

I'm open to most with the exception of Remington.  I would also prefer to have ammo/brass/dies with most of the odd ball calibers for obvious reasons.

Preference would be for a Stainless Sako, Tikka, Browning or Steyr ProHunter or Scout. I also like CZ's as well but still prefer another SS rifle. Might also consider a SS 260 or Savage lightweight hunter in 6.5 Creedmoor or 260. I can add cash if needed to make it fair. 

3 - Different Options to purchase:
1.  $550 Cash gets the gun only 
2.  $625 Cash gets the combo (6-18x50AO Bushnell scope/Ruger factory rings/gun). 
3.  Trade for options listed above (I can Add cash if needed to make it fair).

Price is firm and certainly fair. These are NOT cheap (Mine is the Target Grade model) so please be respectful and skip the lowball stuff .

""This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.""

It is all steel and comes in the original box although the box is worn. The paper work and parts list are in good shape. I bought this for my wife because I thought She would shoot it with less recoil but She will not even try it. I haven't shot it either but it has been fired, but I would say not very much. It comes with a carry set of grips and a target set, it has adjustable rear site with 3 dot sights. It comes with 2 mags. This is a very nice 380 for a lady that is recoil sensitive. I will take 275.00 cash for it with a CCW or PPP and a valid NC license to look at. I can meet during the day during the week only and may can travel to you."

""This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.""

""This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.""

Hello;

Nice older Rossi Pump .22.  Model 62.

Nice wood, shiny bluing, and really slick action, not like the newer ones which tend to be stiffer.  Round barrel and tube fed.

I assume this gun is 15+ years old.  I rate it 90+ percent, maybe 95%.  Shoots great. 

It's also a take-down.

Shoots .22 Short, Long, and Long Rifle.

Comes with a soft case.  NO TRADES PLEASE.

Face to Face in Allendale or will ship and to your FFL for an additional $30 cost.

Thanks."

The Ruger Redhawk 44MAG Stainless 6-Shot Revolver, with 5.5"" barrel, red wood grips, bladed front sight, box and paperwork.  This gun is fresh from the factory and is perfect for hunting season.  Here is a great description from Champion Firearms:

""Since its introduction in 1979, the Ruger Redhawk has proven to be a rugged, reliable, accurate and very strong sixgun. As a rule of thumb, Ruger's double action revolvers like the Redhawk have heavier frames and thicker chamber walls than the competition. They are built for years of hard use and will never wear out. The design is a solid frame and the massive cylinder locks up in front at the crane and at the rear into the recoil plate of the heavy frame. The ejector rod does not rotate, and will never unscrew itself from its fixed position, locking up the cylinder, as happens too frequently with some other double-action revolvers. The cylinder bolt notches are cut a bit off center, making a stronger cylinder wall than on designs that place this cut directly over the center of each chamber.

The investment cast frame of the Ruger Redhawk has no removable side plate; most of the internal parts are attached to the trigger guard assembly, which is removed from the bottom of the frame. Most revolvers on the market are built on a removable side plate design that is over one hundred years old. They were built to handle low pressure cartridges of the period. When .44 magnum cartridges came along in the '50s, the old designs were just made larger to handle the extra intensity of firing magnums. Still, magnum revolvers built on the removable side plate design tend to loosen with heavy use. Ruger’s double action revolvers like the Redhawk have always been built without a removable side plate. This adds needed strength to the frame around the cylinder.

The Ruger Redhawk comes equipped with adjustable sights and hardwood grips. The hammer spur is checkered for a secure hold while cocking the piece for single action fire, and the firing pin is protected from accidental discharge by Ruger’s famous and proven transfer bar safety system. This makes it nearly impossible for the gun to ""go off"" when dropped. When the hammer is fully forward, it rests on the frame and cannot contact the firing pin. The transfer bar itself rises as the trigger is pulled. Then when a cocked hammer falls, it hits the transfer bar (thus ""transferring"" the energy to the firing pin) which subsequently fires the shot. Loaded and unloading is easily accomplished by pressing in on the button mounted in the frame's left recoil shield, which subsequently swings the cylinder out. This heavy duty workhorse features a solid stainless steel construction, and includes a 5.5"" barrel. The action is driven by a traditional double / single design and unlike other revolvers, Ruger exclusively uses higher quality music wire springs."""
