It has a nice custom stock and shoots great. Very clean inside and out. No rust. Some minor scratches. No cracks or gouges. 4 round internal magazine. About 40 rounds of ammo included. Also comes with a Bushnell 3.5-10x scope. The rifle was manufactured in 1954. The pre-64 rifles were built much better than the ones that came afterward, making them collectors items. I have been trying to find comparable prices online, and on average I saw about $1000.

I would like to start off by asking for $750 OBO. All reasonable offers will be considered.

Trades: I am interested in Sigs and Glocks only in 9mm. Also interested in Saiga 12 and MKA 1919.

This gun was manufactured 15 years ago so the quality is higher than the ones being pumped out today. It's a Ruger 10/22 Rimfire Auto-loading Rifle in .22 LR (Model: 1103 Carbine) I bought it when I was a kid. Everything on it is either wood or metal. It's been stored in a climate controlled gun safe. It only has a few hundred rounds through it and it's only been fed copper jacketed bullets. 22 is such a dirty round and this minimizes fouling. The gun is in phenomenal condition. I'm not dieing for the money so I won't just give it away to the first low ball offer that comes through. 

I originally had this listed as a ""Sporter"" model but a few people contacted me and enlightened me on the 10/22 model differences. I guess you learn something new every day..."

Titanium Nitride 
TiN is an extremely hard ceramic material, often used as a coating on titanium alloys, tool steel, stainless steel, carbon steel and other metallic components to improve the substrate's surface properties.  Common applications include aerospace parts, military components, medical implants, cutting tools, industrial parts, manufacturing dies / molds and dental and orthodontic appliances.  TiN is a beautiful gold color and is often used as a wear resistant alternative to elemental gold plating. 

Applied as a thin coating, TiN is used to provide a hard surface to protect cutting and sliding surfaces and for decorative purposes (due to its gold appearance).  It is also used as a non-toxic barrier on the exterior of medical implants and jewelry.  TiN has a low coefficient of friction and an operating temperature of more than 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.  In most applications a coating of less than 5 micrometers (0.00020 in) is applied.  

We apply TiN using a technique called cathodic arc PVD, or physical vapor deposition.  This method is environmentally friendly and produces a functional coating unlike some other methods which are strictly decorative in nature.  Our coatings comply with aerospace specification AMS 2444A."

This is NOT a Saiga 12: there isn't an option for Molot in the menu.  These are everything a Saiga wishes it was.  Chrome lined chamber/barrel/gas system, and magazines insert straight like an AR instead of needing to rotate in like on an AK.  There's a reason these guns are taking over 3G competitions.

There were only 1,000 of these guns imported into the US.  There's a lot of similar looking Vepr 12's on the market for a lot cheaper, but they do not have the working internals for the folding stock.  This is the best side folding mechanism made for the AK platform, and these guns are now impossible to replace."

Grips are in excellent condition also. No cracks, splits, or scratches. Comes with 200 rounds of GECO (German made) FMJ non-corrosive ammo. According to my research on line this gun was made in 1951. Overall condition (internally and externally) is in excellent plus condition for being a 63 year old gun. Very small, or tiny import mark on the frame.

This gun has a carbine length gas system,  and I'd like a mid-length or possibly even rifle length.  

This gun is 5.56/.223.  I'm open to the same, or to 7.62/.308 or .300 BLK.  Maybe others?

The barrel has a 1-8 twist (no longer found on the newer MP15X).  This is considered by many to be the most versatile twist rate, bridging the gap between 1-9 (better for lighter bullets like 55 gr.) and 1-7 (better for heavy bullets in the 77-80 gr. range).

Everything is all black (no FDE or OD Green parts).  No problem for me if your rifle is not all black.

I am in no hurry to part with this gun, and will only do so for the right deal.  Please keep this in mind when making an offer.  Thanks for looking!

Real nice and straight M10 AK that has had some upgrades done to it, the big upgrades are geared towards reliability, longevity, shootability and some minor aesthetics upgrades as well 

Stuff I added;
Thinner front sight post, makes distance shooting a bit easier
Modified to fit norinco Mak-90 gas piston tube, these have 8 gas ports to dissipate gas pressure during cycling. Results in softer recoil, longer action life (no more carrier bashing into the rear trunnion) and actually help the action stay a bit cleaner and cooler. 
Replaced the fixed stock with a polish tantal sidefolder, benefits speak for themselves on this one, trashed the tapco POS polymer stock.
Replaced the recoil spring with a Wolff extra power, again that's fairly self explanatory. 
Damage industries ported muzzle brake, more effective than the AK-74 muzzle brake in recoil reduction and substantially better in its flash hiding capabilities. 
Surplus bulgarian canvas sling in OD - best slings out there for the AK, simple and robust. 
Custom made AK light mount, mounts between barrel and gas tube, 2in metal picatinny rail section, sorry the TLR-4 in the picture doesn't come with unless you want to add some cash
Egyptian Maadi wood handguards, these are kinda rare and a personal favorites of mine due to palm swell and they're just awesome looking to boot. Still have the quadrail it came with, comes with it. 

Stuff that the M10 features out of the box;
Factory RPK sight that makes sighting in an AK a real painless process instead of dicking around with the front sight tool. 
Factory side mount scope rail for optics
Factory hogue pistol grip, much more comfortable than the commie grips that seem to be made for underfed children

Besides that, great running and looking AK that is straight and lighter than most comparable AK's featuring all new parts and a much better build quality than WASR-10's. Not too mention this AK rivals my Norinco type 56 in accuracy which isn't fair 'cause the norinco was a good bit more expensive. The recoil spring and damage industries muzzle brake really cuts down on recoil too.  Last but not least the magwell is CNC cut on these and mag fitment is excellent with every mag I own, tight lockup and negligible wobble. I will throw in a couple mags.

So if your looking for good 22 pistol ammo this is it. 
I had 2 boxes. We used 1 box and this one is completely full. I have sold the pistol after she learned to shoot so we have no use for this new box of ammo. 

It still has the price tag on it. We paid $31.99+ tax for this box.
I'll sell this new box for $20. That's the lowest I'll go on it. That's almost $15 less than it cost me new after tax.

Total easy $600.00, new so trades around $200+ sounds fair depending on what you have. Or just whatever you might feel is equal in value.

The light is way to big but you get the general concept.  I call it the ""DONT SHOOT THE HOSTAGE EDITION"" because of the fact that there are 4 different ways to sight in your target simultaneously allowing for much more confidence when faced with the typical movie hostage scenario.  

Now, I am not a gunsmith and I havn't even fired it dressed up like this.  I just thought it would be cool to post it this way.  Mags hold 14 rounds each making it perfect for Colorado and the real swift 15 round magazine limit.  An anti-weapon law that encouraged me to buy more powerful weapons based on magazine capacity.  Ok....

The pistol and accessories can be sold separately.  Just email me an offer on what you want.

I will throw in a very nice hard leather concealment holster (w/metal clip) and a Flambeau Tactical hard case big enough to hold just about everything.  This pistol is in NEW condition and has had about 100 rounds run through it.  It is a very easy pistol to operate and a true pleasure to shoot.  It has 3 different back strap inserts to fit any hand.  Check out all the details online.  There is a lot of features I am not listing here.  It is a truly modern piece of weaponry with all the bells and whistles yet very simplistic and user friendly.  Now contact me soon because I think I just sold it to myself. :)"

Conversion Kit. EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT:  Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

 1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
 The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
 The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
 Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

 4.  FINISH
 All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

 5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
 Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

 This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.


-------------------------------
 COMPATIBILITY OF OUR GLOCK CONVERSION KITS
 Our Glock Conversion Kits are made to work on FACTORY STOCK Glock frames.
 Note:  Aftermarket parts such as trigger bars and connectors, especially the Ghost Connector, can adversely affect the function and reliability of your conversion kit."

    The Walther PPX M1 Centerfire Pistol is made of rugged polymer and has the famous Walther ergonomic grip. The low-profile, three-dot polymer combat sights aid in rapid aiming and target acquisition. Rear sight drift is adjustable for windage. Tenifer™-coated slide and barrel have a matte finish and resist corrosion. The loaded chamber viewport gives quick status inspection. Front and rear slide serrations provide a nonslip surface to operate the slide. Hammer-fired action won't snag on clothing. Ambidextrous slide stop locks back on empty and is extended for easy gloved operation. Two drop safeties and a firing pin block make for safer carry. Reversible push-button thumb-operated magazine release is conveniently located and reversible for left-or right-hand use. A constant 6.5-lb smooth trigger pull gives greater accuracy and control. The checkered trigger guard is perfect for a tactical two-handed grip stance. Mil-std-1913 Picatinny accessory mounting rail accepts lights, lasers or other tactical devices."

Gun has been through 45 rd and is basically new. No one single scratch shows in this beretta, and have receipt to show the $693.00 that i pay for the gun last month. Recently purchase a s&w shield and this gun is just sitting in my safe.    

This is the compact version of the 92fs with 4.2"" barrel instead of the regular 5"", shorter grip, 13+1 of 9mm and is exactly like the full size in a smaller version. Gun comes with box, papers, 2 magazines, remora holster with full sweat shield($50.00 value) dont pay full price and taxes You would not be disappointed.   ( from i75 i m located in exit 116)
Thanks for looking.

I purchased it new last year and have put less than 300 rounds through it. It's very soft shooting and fun to shoot, I just don't shoot it much. I've got the box, paperwork, and everything that came with it new. I also bought a full set of benelli crio plus extended chrome chokes that were around $70 each in CL, IC, M, IM, and F. As well as a carlsons skeet choke, turkey .665 restriction choke, and black cloud mid range .705 choke. There's about $500 worth of chokes on top of the cost of the gun, plus the three flush for chokes that came with the gun. The only imperfection on the gun is some finish wear at the ejection port and it's pictured.

For the whole deal my price is $1200 FIRM. I will not ship and I'm not interested in any trades."

This is an AMAZING work of art! This rifle was hand crafted back in 64 according to date on barrel and Gunsmiths personal signature stamped on barrel ahead of forearm. It's been my pride and joy to own as a functional piece of art of bygone days of such outstanding craftsmanship. I've shot a box of 1990's Winchester factory silver box ammo and it was sub-MOA all day long ;-). RARE to find such a period correct 264 Mag with a barrel in such outstanding condition (i.e. not shot-out). To produce this quality today would be astronomical in cost, and with the beautiful arsenic produced bluing - virtually impossible to reproduce. Incredible lines on the custom carved laminated stock with what appears to be Rosewood caps with diamond inlays (Bone?). Nice patina to the hand-rubbed finish to provide that golden coloration to the maple laminates. includes a Leupold AO 10x scope and Leupold mounts. Beautiful deep arsenic old process blue that give it the rich deep true blue not black) bluing color. Good luck on finding another one this fine...one slight scratch on the grip cap below the diamond and some touchup to the annodized floorplate...otherwise pristine!"

Well-equipped.

I've decided I want to get a Daniel Defense MK18 SBR. To fund this, I need to sell my existing rifle. 

What began as a standard 2014 DDM4 V5 LW with 16"" barrel has now become a well-equipped rifle that is ready to shoot as-is or can be further upgraded with a nice high-quality optic.

I have added the following upgrades:

- Daniel Defense front and rear fixed sights
- Midwest Industries Gen 2 SS-Series Modular free float rail (15"" vs. the original 12"" DD rail)
- Midwest Industries Gen 2 SS-Series Hand Stop
- Mission First Tactical Battlelink Minimalist Stock
- Tactical Link Battery Assist Lever
- Rainier Arms Raptor Charging Handle (by AXTS)

Included in this sale is the Magpul G2 PMAG as shown, plus the OEM plastic hard case, the OEM charging handle, and the misc. rail attachment pieces from Midwest Industries.

Bought this gun for $1386 from Cheaper Than Dirt + $25 FFL transfer fee paid to Ted's Shooting Range in Queen Creek. Considering the upgrades and the work that went into swapping the rail (flash suppressor, low pro gas block and tube, and proprietary barrel nut all had to come off and then be re-installed correctly), $1,600 is a fair price. Gun is like-new and unfired. Smoke-free home.

Not interested in trades and low ball offers will be ignored. Copy of Arizona driver's license and signed bill of sale with serial number recorded will be necessary to complete this transaction.

853,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3329853,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE HEAVY 357 Mag - 125 gr. Barnes XPB @ 1650 fps - 20 Round Box,"azusa, California, United States",$ 24,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 29, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=277

For those needing/wanting a Lead-Free, HEAVY 357 Magnum load, generating full power plus, here it is.

Below are real world velocities taken from my personal real world stock guns. The established use of long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings is essentially misleading to the public who won’t be firing ammo from a laboratory test barrel in the real world, where it matters.

2145 fps - Marlin mod 1894, 18 inch barrel
1583 fps - S&W mod 27, 5 inch barrel
1591 fps - S&W Mt. Gun, 4 inch barrel
1507 fps - S&W mod 66, 3 inch barrel
1448 fps - S&W mod 66, 2.5 inch barrel
You’ll notice that the newer S&W 4 inch Mt Gun gave higher velocities than the older 5 inch model 27 S&W and this is because of different internal barrel dynamics of the newer gun.

Due to the long-for-weight all copper bullet, we did not have the case capacity to use a bulky flash retarded powder and thus there is noticeable muzzle flash with this load, except when firing it from the rifle, which yielded little to no flash.

This load is the typical Barn-Burning, Turbo-Charged, Buffalo Bore type of HEAVY 357 mag. load and as such, should only be used in revolvers made of all steel. It should not be fired in light weight alloy framed or cylindered revolvers. Feel free to use it in ALL/ANY 357 mag. chambered rifles and all steel revolvers."

Location: Houston, TX
November 1959 Remington Nylon 66 .22LR. This was the first year made for this rifle and this one really shows it. The blue has turned into a brown patina (not rust) and the stock has some serious “use” or character. I would call this a true “survivor” rifle, similar to how they rate the all original survival classic cars. This will include a softcase as well.
I will ship to your FFL if you like or I can mail directly within the Great State of TEXAS.
