The hammer is polished and modified to work with the Vepr rifle (counts as three 922r compliant parts).  The Vepr has a 23"" barrel and slant back receiver.  I was going to modify the rifle, but do not have the desire, so I'm selling it plus the trigger group for cost.  Price is firm.  The rifle is new, never fired.  Comes with everything all the accessories (box, cleaning kit, two five round mags).  I might be interested in trades, plus cash.  Only trades I would consider would be local trades of military surplus firearms (no Mosins, unless they are M91's or Finns in good condition).  Only new weapons that I would be interested in are the Ruger Scout in .308.  Or, a Springfield M1a (I know the market is different for these rifle, but you never know).

I was originally going to try to modify this to look like a Dragunov or PSL.  The stock set and muzzle brake are available for this conversion.  Rhineland Arms has an affordable stock set. Nodak Spud has the muzzle device.  I have found scopes on Ebay for very good prices...you just have to keep an eye out.  All of these additions would put you in the price range of a PSL.  However, the Vepr is regarded as a sturdier rifle and can fire heavy ball ammo.  Also, this rifle is new, and the bore is chrome lined--which helps if you shoot corrosive.

          While my gun collection has been steaming ahead towards completion, my arsenal of medieval weaponry has become sadly out-of-date(no pun intended). I am looking for any and all medieval weapons, primarily I am looking for morning stars and axes, but as always, I will take a look at everything you have. Let me start with my standard boilerplate:


       I cannot accept any fake, 'faux' or 'display' weapons. These weapons will be disarmed(de-sharpened) and distributed to my SCA group for medieval re-enactments. The morning stars, in case you're curious, are for my personal collection, and will be kept sharp. There's no real way to de-sharpen a spiked ball anyways. So, any who offer up weapons will be required to prove that they are not display weapons(often giving me the company name is sufficient; I can find it from there and look at its specifications). Unless you are giving them away for free, I have no extra money for non-functioning weaponry(but I will take free ones off your hands!). These are not wall-hangers; they will spend their lives in the mud-and-blood of medieval combat, and as such must be built like real weapons.

    A word about material; I will not accept stainless steel. Anything over 12"" and made from stainless is hilariously brittle and can't hold an edge, so I avoid it wherever I can. Carbon steel is the material they used to be made of, so that is my preferred choice. I will consider iron but I don't care for it's weight.


    Oh, and this ad includes armor! You have a suit of armor? Let me know! Even just helmets, greaves, chainmail, etc. All is fair game.

      I was going to include a paragraph describing what I'm looking for, but as there are literally thousands of medieval weapons and designs, it's impossible to name them all. So, let's keep it simple. I'm looking for any weapon styled pre-1650, and will consider weapons styled after. Let me be clear, I am not looking for actual medieval weapons. Reproductions or custom-made are the ones I'm after. European is my favored style, Germanic-Gothic if we're being specific, but I will, again, look at whatever you have.



Regards Armslist, let's see what you've got.

3 hole skeletonized trigger, taurus standard hammer w/ locking internals, ambi safety.

I will also include Hogue wrap around overmolded grips with finger grooves.

Comes with 1 - 7round steel magazine, lockable hard case (not factory)

Pistol had slide rollmarks filled, so a nice smooth slide and finished in duracoat.. (flat black).

Sierra MatchKing bullets have very thin jackets and are held to exacting tolerances in diameter and weight. These Hollow Point Boat Tail bullets have a small meplat to produce a higher ballistic coefficient. Their accuracy has been acclaimed worldwide and they have been used to win more target competitions than all target bullets from other manufacturers combined. The 30 Caliber 155 Grain MatchKing was designed for use in PALMA competitions which require extreme accuracy at 800, 900, and 1000 yards. This is not loaded ammunition.

It is a lightly used, recently built AR in great condition, less than 200 rounds through it. 
-Anderson Arms lower
-BCM Upper
-18 inch fluted .223 Wylde Barrel (Allows you to shoot .223 and 5.56 equally well if you arent familiar with the .223 Wylde chambering)
-Tri Delta Tactical muzzle brake, same size as an A2 birdcage style brake and legal for three gun competition, reduces muzzle rise dramatically
-ATI Strikeforce stock with Scorpion recoil system and adjustable cheek riser for optics
-Low profile gas block with a 12 inch free float quad rail with T Marks
-MPI/HPT inspected BCG with properly staked gas key
-Magpul BUIS

Will also come with a couple of Magpul P Mags and 20 rounds of M193 5.56 depending on trade. Have around $900 invested in it. Shoots exceptionally well and with the longer barrel, muzzle brake, and cheek riser stock it would make an excellent long range rifle with a good scope, however I'm more interested in a .30 caliber rifle right now. Primarily interested in a .308/7.62 battle rifle like a PTR 91 or FAL, possibly a Cetme+Cash. Would also be interested in a nice AK47 in 7.62X39mm (NO WASR'S). Not interested in SKS's, I already have one.

While I'm primarily interested in these rifles, I'm also looking for an HD/Tactical style 12 gauge shotgun, no more than a 20 inch barrel with a cylinder bore such as a Mossberg 500, Remington 870, Benelli Nova Tactical, just about any of the new Turkish import pump guns, etc.. I already have a nice field gun, so not looking for a hunting shotgun. Would be interested in a two gun trade for one along with a semi auto .223/5.56 or 7.62X39mm rifle such as a basic AR (M&P Sport, similar) or AK (would allow WASR's if including a shotgun), or maybe even a Kel Tec SU-16.

Feel free to let me know what you have though, but I'm not interested in hunting style weapons or bolt actions of any kind, I already have my share of those.
I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with offers. texts preferred.

Thanks!

It's a scaled down 1911 (Carry Cocked and Locked just like a 1911)
This is way better than any of the micro polymer 380's out there.
Model: IIIA Series 5 (added a grip safety)
All steel, but only 22 oz.
Red dot front sight.
Great fit in the hand. You can carry it in your pocket or anywhere you can think of.
I shot it today, below is a picture of two magazines worth of rounds. I missed the 2 1/2 inch red bulls-eye with a couple of shots (they're still kind of touching the red), only because this is a new gun to me.
It has a scratch on it's left side, but I don't care. I care about how it feels in the hand and how it shoots.
Just a great gun, doesn't jam.

Snub nose (1 1/2 - 2 inch barrel) revolves barely have more power than a 380 and so most don't have enough velocity to expand hollow points. But, a 3 - 4 inch revovers (like this) does.

another example is this

FS/FT: Romaniun AK47 with ammo and Mags
while the title says its romanian it clearly is not as at least this time the guy put century arms as the reciever so it is a century arms gun built with romanian parts so it should be listed as such not the falsehood it is listed as...... as a romanian gun would be a preban and have the proper markings on the receiver to say such 

another exapmle 
Preban M1A national match
this one was clearly a preban gun and properly listed as such has the bayo lug ect. ....

just want these fools to be more truthful about what they have and how it is listed to keep some of us for falling for false claims of glory if it is not properly listed don't even think about touching it you are not getting what your paying for not to mention if they lie about what it is there are probably more problems they are not going to mention either. ...."

This sale is for the rifle, scope, scope mount, flash hider and cheek pad. A grease pot will also be included so you can properly lubricate the firearm.
The receiver is Springfield Arms in the 1.18m range which dates it to February 1943. The barrel is dated 10-52. The stock has an SA JLH cartouche which dates it to the barrel when this firearm was converted. The receiver is marked SA 65 on the leg indicating it went through the re-arsenal process at Springfield Arms in 1965.
The scope optics are clear and the cross hairs in excellent condition.
I was told the scope mount is aftermarket. I am not sure of the flash hider, it may also be aftermarket. The rest of the gun is believed to be original GI.
Another interesting fact is the heel of the receiver was lead annealed. This can be seen in the coloration of the parkerizing in this area.
I have run a limited number of rounds through the gun. It is accurate with both scope and iron sights, but not zeroed in. The only issue I found is the clip does not latch in place when the bolt is open. The bolt has to be pulled back slightly for the clip to latch. I do not know what is causing this issue. As always, I suggest a gunsmith inspect the gun before shooting.

This gun is perfect for shooting out on the range and for home defense (or zombie apocalypse). I absolutely LOVE this gun and do not want to part with it, it holds 20 rounds, comes with two 19 round magazines, and is in flawless shape with only 40 rounds fired. I am planning on moving cross country to a place where firearms of this capacity are not exactly smiled upon.

From the manufacturer: ""The XD(M) pistol from Springfield Armory sets the standard for what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M) has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M) 3.8” Full-Size is the perfect pistol for those who want full-size performance in a slightly shorter package.""

Sierra MatchKing bullets have very thin jackets and are held to exacting tolerances in diameter and weight. These Hollow Point Boat Tail bullets have a small meplat to produce a higher ballistic coefficient. Their accuracy has been acclaimed worldwide and they have been used to win more target competitions than all target bullets from other manufacturers combined. The 30 Caliber 175 Grain MatchKing was developed along with military experts for use in the M21, M24 and M40A1 sniper systems. It then generated a large amount of interest by long range competitive shooters due to its high ballistic coefficient and ability to remain supersonic at 1000 yards out of a 308 Winchester. This is not loaded ammunition.

----
I would like to offer for sale a few crates of Yugoslavian 7.62 x 39 surplus ammo. These are brass-cased, a very accurate load with the excellent M67 bullet.  

I have both the 1,260 round crate (15 rds per box) as well as the 1,120 round crate (10 rds per stripper clip, 40 rds per box). 

All ammo is still sealed in tin, and comes in zinc-lined wooden crate with latches and sturdy carry handles, so perfect for long-term storage.

The price on these changes, as does all surplus ammo, but I've priced it fairly, I think, between what the cheap, plinking ammo costs right now (about 20-25c/rd) and what the domestic brass-cased (e.g. Winchester FMJ) and steel-cased (e.g. Hornady SST) costs.

Asking $390/crate.

If you aren't fully squared away on your long-term SHTF ammo yet for your AK or SKS rifle, don't miss opportunity to pick up some very nice ammo that is no longer consistently imported.

Will include 30 rounds (two 15 rd boxes) of this ammo from a tin I've opened for shooting so you can test in your rifle for function and zero without breaking into a sealed tin."

You can also purchase different sized frames if you want a larger or smaller frame. It comes with box, docs, lock, 3 magazines (comes from the factory with 2), and a Sig OWB holster.

My asking price for the gun if you want to buy it is $1000 FIRM!!! So I am willing to allow up to $500 trade value for either a .9mm or .45. That means if you have one of the other I will give you my Kimber and you will have to give me your gun plus $500 cash.

I no longer have the m1a so here is your chance to get it. I paid 450 for the stock, I'll take 200. The M1A pictured is NOT part of the sale. I also have a custom M2 USGI stock for an M1A or M14 on another listing. Check it out too. You can call/text anytime. 4seven9-9two6-7one7six

Product Information, Features, Specifications:



At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice. 

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

Decades of coins dropped in jars.  These are the pennies.  We've done a quick visual sort to separate the wheats and the post 1982 ones (quick is relative, it took forever).  There is no doubt we missed some of both, but these are the remainder, 1959-1982.  If your hobby involves picking through coins to find that rare treasure, this bunch should keep you busy for a very, very, long time.  I haven't the patience for it. I guess some people also buy them as an investment due to copper content. I have a few ounces short of 140 pounds. Based on ebay prices and trying to stay a little low and get this done, I'll sell them for 1.5 cents per.  This is of course for the bunch, so that would be $304.
