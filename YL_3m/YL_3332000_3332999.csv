It's chambered in 12 ga and accepts 3"" or 2 3/4"" shells. More or less stayed in the safe, fired exactly twice, both times with 3"" slugs.
Fairly clean, has a few nicks and safe marks.

Comes with original box.

It's a very nice gun, definitely has that old school feel, especially with the double triggers and hammers (hold on to your butt if you light both chambers off with 3"" slugs, let me tell you), has a very solid stock.

Unfortunately my gun collection has to downsize, and this Cimarron can't do anything my Mossberg 500 can't already accomplish.

Will consider trades, no pistols. Will trade up.
$450 obo.

PICTURE IS A STOCK IMAGE REPRESNTATION, NO CAMERA AT THE MOMENT SO YOU WILL HAVE TO INSPECT THE FIREARM IN PERSON."

However, I am also trying to unload my Mossberg 12 guage persuader as well as my Springfield M1A Socom 16. Both guns are also new from last year and in great condition. The mossberg new is around $450, and if you can even find an M1A it'll cost around $2k new. Both these guns are also Cerakoted but these are done in Titanium Blue coloring. I mention these two guns in this post because if you want all 3 guns I will sell the entire set for $3k and also give you the remaining ammo and ammo tin I have for them. Separately you'd be looking at $3.5k plus for that...

This version of the SUB-2000 will accept Glock 22, 15rd magazines, caliber 40SW.

The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun.

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

I have fired about 500 rounds, so it has basically been broken in and smoothed out for the next owner. The gun comes with the original box, manual, and two magazines. I have six magazines for the gun (One 15-round, four 16-round, and one 17-round), that I will sell with the gun for an additional $20 per magazine. I also have two holsters. One black leather belt holster made by Wild Bill's Concealment out of Garner, NC, and a IWB holster by Theis out of Arkansas. I will part with the holsters for an additional $10 a piece. They are both very high quality.

The CZ 75B is a very accurate pistol. The internal rails lead to the gun being very tight, but very smooth when the slide is moved. The steel frame but not overly hefty, but definitely makes the pistol very easy to shoot with a light recoil. The DA/SA trigger is already smooth, but tends to smooth out even more as the pistol is fired. The low bore axis lends itself to directing the already soft recoil straight back and decreasing the target transition time.

I am asking $500 for the base package, with the the prices for the additional items listed above. If you want to make your own offer, go ahead. The worst I can do is say no.

I require a copy of a valid NC ID and a pistol purchase permit/copy of CHP, upon face to face sale. I will ship if you cover the cost."

I love my jeep, and I always wanted one... but some recent events have me needing a truck. I thought I would put this ""feeler"" out there to see what might be around. I'm looking for a truck so I can haul stuff and it NEEDS to be an extended or crew cab since I have kids. Also would prefer 4wd since I go camping. For the right deal, I'll throw in my small trailer (new tires) that I was hoping to eventually turn into my expedition trailer (but still works now just to haul smaller stuff around). Also, if it's the right trade, I might throw in a 8000lb Champion winch and winch plate (brand new, still has tags on it) that i've not got around to mounting yet. 

Here are the details

2000 Wrangler TJ sport

The good:
Straight I6 4.0 Engine (just rebuilt earlier this year)

31 inch tires with good tread

Mostly stock, not all beat up or off-roaded (although she could). 

Good exterior and clean interior.

AC/heat

Manual

Desert sand pearl paint scheme is somewhat had to find, and one of my favorites

Radio with AUX input and USB, and sound bar up top.

Needs work:
AC works great, but blower turns off on highest setting. Prob resister block which i'll replace later this week (most likely), still blows cold enough on setting ""3""

Soft top needs a few stitches redone, but holds true. Keeps water and wind out as is now.

One fender flare was cracked and repaired with putty. Holds fine, looks ok, but a perfectionist would want replaced.

Shop that rebuilt engine welded the exhaust rather than use the donut that holds it together (since donut was damaged). I think the weld leaks a little because sometime I hear it rattling. 

Hood has a few wavy spots that are hard to see unless you are driving.

Other little odds and ends that I can't think of, but are typical for a 14 year old vehicle.

Overall, I drive this everyday and it runs strong. These I6's are practically bulletproof, and with the rebuilt engine...this one has many many years of life left. 

Title is free and clear.

Ok, so.... if you have a truck you want to trade, email me the info. Truck needs to have 4wd. I will try and respond to everyone who sends up ideas for trade. Obviously I recognize we will have to see each others vehicles for the deal to be finalized. Please understand, that if I'm not interested, I'll try and respond back if I'm not flooded with too many requests (I'm sure I'll get a whole slew of people with old half running trucks looking for a trade, lol). I will just respond with ""no thanks"", please don't take it personally, it's gonna have to be just the right trade to make me give up my jeep. These TJ jeeps, with the 6 cylinder and rebuilt engine and with these options in this condition is prob worth around $9500 from what i've seen them going for on CL. 

For me to get a truck I want...I'm looking for 9k.

It's in great shape and still looks good for it's age.... of course, pics don't always show the little bumps and bruises. Thanks for looking!"

 Any sale will only be made to a responsible citizen with a CCW or a pistol permit. I will only sell this handgun to an individual with a valid ID and someone who will sign a bill of sale and give me a pistol permit or copy of CCW and license signed by buyer. If you can't agree to that then I'm not the person to talk to. 

 Email me with your name and # and let's make a deal. I will call you back ASAP. Thanks and have a great day!

Details
If you could marry a competition rifle with a military rifle – the CSR-1516 would probably be its offspring! Introducing the CSR-1516. A sporting rifle that your friends are going to drool over.

This rifle has all the features and appointments that a competition rifle has… only it’s a sporting rifle. Really? You bet! How about a 13 slot Picatinny Rail on a slick side flat top receiver, or an integrally-forged enlarged trigger guard. Don’t forget other high-end features like a Nickel-Teflon coated Colt match-target trigger, or 16” 4140 Chrome-Moly steel air-gaged match-quality barrel and even a low profile gas block. And we didn’t forget that people don’t come “one size fits all”. Which is why we made sure that this little Colt has a six-position adjustable carbine stock in an improved M4 style. It may look like a cross between a military and competitive rifle, but we assure you – it’s a sporting rifle!"

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

I would be interested in handguns maybe a 40 caliber and rifles most interested in .17, .270 and 30-06. This is an almost new Browning Silver Hunter. This is an awesome shotgun for birds or clays. This weapon has been meticulously maintained, as with all my weapons, and broken down and cleaned after every use (I use Frog Lube on all my weapons...no harsh chemicals). Again this is the Browning Silver Hunter 12 Gauge with a 28"" barrel, right handed, with a round capacity of 3+1. It weighs 7.5 lbs. and has a walnut stock with a blued finish. It comes with a full, modified and improved cylinder choke and has a 3"" chamber. This weapon goes for $999.99 new, not including the cost of a background check if your dealer charges for that.  To walk out of the dealer for one of these amazing shotguns you are looking at an out the door price at a minimum of $1,055. I am asking for a reasonable $950 so save yourself a little cash and come get this one. Even though I would take a possible trade if it's interesting cash talks. There is nothing wrong with the weapon I just don't really have room for another shotgun. Call or text me anytime between 7am and 9pm if I don't answer I will get back to you as soon as possible 715-Eight 5 One - 4 one six 5"

Gibbs Info
Originally an extremely rare experimental design, the Australians designed the No. 7 for their jungle fighters in Burma. Now Gibbs Rifle Company has recreated this carbine using the modern, stronger 2A barreled action made from chrome vanadium steel. Chambered for the popular .308 Winchester, each No. 7 starts out as a hand selected, barreled 2A action, and is then cleaned, inspected and refurbished. The original wood is retained and reconfigured, and a flash hider with a bayonet lug has been added to recreate the original Jungle Carbine dimensions. The No. 7 Jungle Carbine is a short, powerful carbine, perfect for today’s collector, shooter and sportsman. Weight - 8 lbs., Bbl Length - 20”, OAL - 40”, Cal - .308 Winchester.

Single-stage match trigger hammer forged match grade barrel.  FDE ""Dessert"" is the color scheme.  Foldable stock and is adjustable comb for rise and length of pull as well.

 It's one year old and has less than 200 rounds through it.  I've mounted a Nikon P-22 scope with a cantilevered Picatinny mount and quick release riser with 45 degree offsets.  It also has flip-up sites for use at close ranges.

This is NOT the same as ISSC's version. So don't be fooled.   The internals are made in Germany and not stamped like it's cheaper (and bastardized) cousin, which is made in China.  

The purchase price was $850 + 9.5% tax and FFL for the out of state import.  The scope and mounts were an additional $200+ at Cabelas. I'm into it for well over a grand as it sits.

Want to have something new to show your shooting buddies?  I have been casting bullets for a few years now, and I always tumble lubed them and coated them in mica powder to make them less sticky.  That works well, but recently I started doing something different.  I heard about people who were powder coating their bullets, so I decided to give it a try and the results are impressive.  The powder coat seals off the outer diameter of the bullet, preventing any contact with the barrel and essentially eliminating lead fouling.  There is no sticky residue and the coating is very slick, acting more like a plated bullet.  I now have several calibers that I stocked up on, and I have a few spares I can now sell.

Prices:
.38 148gr wadcutter (sized .358) - $30 per 500 Coated, $25 Tumble lubed
.40 180gr Truncated Cone (sized .401) - $35 per 500 Coated, $30 TL
.45 230gr Round Nose (sized .452)- $40 per 500 Coated, $35 TL
9mm 124gr Round Nose (sized .356)- $30 per 500 Coated, $25 TL

I have had very good luck coating with red and black, and I highly recommend those two colors.  I am playing around with white and yellow, and have not gotten the consistency with those two yet that I see with red/black.  More experimenting is needed, and I will eventually branch out into more crazy colors as hobby money allows...

Regardless of color, I have seen absolutely no residue in the barrels of any of my guns.  Not from lead or the powder coat, these shoot very clean!

I am selling my Browning X Bolt .308 rifle, it has a mounted Bushmaster Nikon BDC scope, the only time I fired it was when I went to the range and put a dozen or so rounds down range to setup the scope it's been sitting around waiting to be used. The gun normally sells for 800 new, and the scope is 200 dollars new and is a beauty herself. I will update with some pictures tomorrow. I need to get rid of this rifle by Friday as I am leaving town so best reasonable offer takes it home, or first person to offer 700 bucks for it. If I get a offer that is 700 I will even throw in some .308 rounds (100 rounds american eagle FMJBT, and if the rifle is purchased for 700 i will sell you additional 400 rounds at 7.50 per box of 20 which is over half off bulk prices). Update: there is a minor scratch on the wood picture posted. Just make a offer best offer by Saturday morning as long as its reasonable takes it home and I will sell you the american eagle ammo up to 500 rounds for 7.50 per 20 rounds box, remember anything under full price doesn't get the free 100 rounds."

Also when at the range everybody wants to look at it and shoot it; probably since it has a distinctive sound when being fired and it's bad ass.  Retail is $1329(good luck finding one).  Ammo has not been a problem to find and is relatively cheap (50 rounds for $24 at Academy and $27 for 50 round Hornady V-Max box).  If your local store does not have any, I know of a place online that never has been out of stock for me.  Gun has adjustable sights and rail for flashlight, laser or whatever accessories. Three 20 round clips are included along with case, handbook and box of Hornady V-Max ammo.  Also available are 30 round clips for $35 online, I would buy a clip or two if I wasn’t selling it.  Get one before they ban it, because honestly it is one bad ass gun.  Wouldn't sell but Wife is giving me hell about the bill's.  Below I added some information that I found online.

FN Five-Seven, trademarked as the Five-seveN, is a semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured by FN Herstalin Belgium.  The pistol is named for its 5.7-mm (.224 in) bullet diameter, and the trademark capitalization style is intended to emphasize the manufacturer's initials—FN. 
The Five-Seven Pistol was developed in conjunction with the FN P90 personal defense weapon and the FN 5.7×28mmcartridge.   The P90 was introduced in 1990, and the Five-seven was introduced in 1998 as a pistol using the same 5.7×28mm ammunition.  Developed as a companion pistol to the P90, the Five-seven shares many of its design features: it is a lightweight polymer-based weapon with a large magazine capacity, ambidextrous controls, low recoil, and the ability to penetrate body armor when using certain cartridge types. 
Sales of the Five-seven were originally restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers, but since 2008, the pistol has also been offered to civilian shooters for personal protection, target shooting, and similar uses.  The Five-seven's introduction to civilian shooters was met with vocal opposition from gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign, and the pistol has been subject to ongoing controversy in the United States.   Get it while you can!!
The Five-seven is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations, including Canada, France, Greece, India, Poland, Spain, and the United States.  In the United States, the Five-seven is in use with numerous law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service.   In the years since the pistol's introduction to the civilian market in the United States, it has also become increasingly popular with civilian shooters.

High Capacity Magazines
• Polymer body

• Low-friction follower
• Polymer base

Sights & Accuracy:
• Adjustable 3-dot
• Highly Accurate
• The accuracy and flat trajectory of the 5.7x28mm cartridge gives a high hit probability up to 50m and has an effective range of 150m, far more than any other handgun.
• Extremely low recoil results in quick and accurate firing.
• The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol can accept up to 20 rounds in the magazine and a 30 round magazine can be purchased from most gun stores for $30-$40.  This is by far a force-multiplier!

Extremely Light and Ergonomic:
• The light weight of the slide and barrel, made possible by the 5.7mm caliber, and the reduced weight of the cartridge make the loaded weapon much lighter than traditional handguns.
•Well-balanced, with smooth contours and no protruding parts, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol will instinctively be handled correctly and is extremely easy to use.

Fully Safe
• The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol features an ambidextrous manual safety that blocks the trigger mechanism and avoids any accidental firing.

Ammo Types and Performance:

The new benchmark in ammunition, the 5.7x28mm cartridge has been specially tailored to excel in several specialized roles. The SS190 duty round is restricted to law enforcement and military users only. It has been designed to minimize the risk of over-penetration. The L191 tracer and SB193 subsonic rounds are also available for specialized situations including the use of a suppressor (can).  The SS197SR, distributed in the U.S. by federal Cartridge Company, is ideally suited for sports and training applications.  Blank rounds for training and simulations are also available from FNH USA. 

FMJ 40 Grain Federal Ammo(AE5782A)- Cheapest ammo available $24.99 for 50 rounds, ideal for target, practice, or general use.

SS197SR- V-Max 40 grain Polymer Tip 650 m/s (2,130 Ft/s) hottest ammo that I have tried, although SS195LF is now available.  $26.99 for 50 rounds at Academy picked up two boxes last night.

SS195LF- 27 grain Hollow Point 5.7x28 SS198LF Cartridge.  High Performance Ammo 10700022.  Normally available to ""Law enforcement and Military Use only"", we were able to get a small lot of this ammo that is up for grabs to the civilian market.

I have owned it for about a year and have been shooting trap and sporting clays with it. It is a great gun but doesn’t quite fit me so I am selling it to make room for my new trap gun. I would also consider trade for a 12 or 20 guage benelli. 

This gun features unique checkering, adjustable trigger and right hand palm swell as well as A TRUGLO® TRU-BEAD® competition front sight with fiber-optic inserts and a mid-bead. In addition the barrels are back-bored .742” diameter and use Invector-Plus Choke tubes. 

A little history on this gun, I purchased this gun new last year though they ended production in 2007. It arrived still sealed in its protective layer of grease. I purchased it from a gun dealer who bought the remaining stock. They were discontinued when Winchester changed their name back to the M101 and did some modifications to the design. It still shares the same action design as the current 101 as well as the same choke standard which is good for when you are buying accessories. 

One note of wear and tear, it has a small nick on the stock which is only noticeable in certain light, otherwise it is better than new with all the original grease cleaned off and the action broken in with a thousand rounds. (Sporting Clays guns are good for 10s of thousands of rounds)."

I picked up this awesome weapon in trade, but because I already have a hand cannon, I am not as in love with it as I thought. It is an awesome piece, and is a first gen Israeli import pistol. The .357 DE can handle the hottest of loads, and runs flawlessly, chewing through everything. The frame size is slightly smaller than the .44 (slightly) which makes it easier and more comfortable to shoot. The bore has polygonal rifling, much like an HK. 


This is a very early serial number, 83xx... First run!


This pistol is a real show stopper, and is in absolutely stunning condition. The BCG is clean, and there is very, very little handling wear. (Most DE pistols are handled more than they are shot.) 

The pistol will include one magazine and a hard case. 

This variant of DE is far more affordable to shoot, as .357 mag ammo is far cheaper than 44 or 50!"

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.
All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.
The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.
Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.
The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.
The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.
Features:
•	Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•	Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
•	Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
•	Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
•	Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
•	One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
•	Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
•	Ambidextrous magazine release lever
•	Extended slide release
•	Patented Lock-Out Safety device
USP Variants:
Variant 1:  Double action/single action with ""SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame.

Its in great shape with minimal wear.  These have 4.25in commander length barrels and has a lightweight alloy frame making it much easier to carry as a cc pistol.  Also has cocobolo hardwood checkered grips, flat mainspring housing, extended beavertail safety, 3 dot sights, skeletonized adjustable trigger, extended safety lever, and ring hammer; basically all of the features that most people want on a 1911.
Comes with two factory mec gar magazines, case, barrel bushing wrench, fobus paddle holster, and all factory paperwork and accessories.

Its a great gun but I've had a few 1911's and I'm just finding that I'm not a big fan of the platform.  I'd preferably like to trade for a different mid sized .45 caliber handgun such as a Glock 30 or Springfield XDm 3.8 compact + a little cash or ammo or something similar, I'm pretty open to suggestions.  Would also very much be interested in a Beretta 92 compact. Not looking for anything full sized, and no Tauruses please.

I would also be interested in a rifle of some sort.  Would really like a Czech VZ58/2008 or an AK47 pattern rifle of some sort (No WASR's please).  Would also be interested in an AR15, Ruger Mini 14 or 30 tactical, or a semi auto .308/7.62mm rifle of some sort.  Not interested in bolt actions or hunting rifles with the one exception being a Mossberg MVP Patrol.

If not interested in trading I will sell for $650.

The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize in standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v5-300 URG is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

Yes better then your russian siaga converted ak. Better then any ak on the market besides of course another sas m7 classic. I really do not want to let tgis go and honestly i am really hoping i can sell my ar first even though i love the ar just as much amd have just as much into it. But it has an arsenal sas m7 classic r milled receiver. Good luck finding one of those under $600. Bulgarian classic barrel chromed lined circle 10 mags and of course a bulgarian ad parts kit. It is 922 but i did it so no cosmetics would interfere in the beautiful look it has. It is an underfolder shot 20 times with arsenal ammo. You cant find better nor will you ever probably see this again. Does need a nice finish. Duracoat,cerakoat but my honest opinion i think it should be blued back to origanality. I wanted to get it blued but the wait is over 9 momths and i cant exactly seeing myself giving someone my baby for that lenght of time. Absolutly no trades. Except a mini gun 308. Haha now ots not worth that much but probably just as rare. But the ticket is $2700. Go look on other sites they are just aroumd that range but with the new blonde stock that devalues the gun greatly. Like i said good luck finding an ak like this one that someone is willing to sell. Go elsewhere with your lowballs this rifle is worth every penny. Must show proof residentcy no sales to any nazi liberal state citizens ohio only must show two forms of id and sign bill of sale. I might trade for a 2007 newer american made car full size under 75,000 miles. Please dont buy it. Im kinda forced to sell it but our family does need a new car."

*READ DESCRIPTION PLEASE*
This HK91 is in good condition, but used. It is an original HK built gun from the HK factory, except for the receiver, which is a Gewehr Werks Replacement(fine quality receivers)and it was installed by a proper gunsmith. THIS IS NOT A PARTS GUN OR A GARAGE BUILD
I can prove its a true Hk as well. The Lower, which is Steel(oem from Hk factory) has the 0-1 safety, the barrel has 12 flutes, and 4 lands in the barrel, as well as a HK proof mark on the gun(KF) dates the gun to be manufactured in 1995. I have researched Gewehr Werks and they make great quality receivers for all types of weapons, so its not a cheap part at all.
***SEE PICTURES BELOW

It shoots pretty good, about 2.5 inch group at 100 yards with open sights. I have had no malfunctions at all, and the internals are all good. Works like an HK should. I dont really want to get rid of it, but just throwing it out there because id like an extra vehicle
