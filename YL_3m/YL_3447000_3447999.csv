I've decided to part with my Para Carry 9 LDA 1911. This is the most accurate 1911 I've ever owned. It out shoots my Kimbers, Colts, Ruger, and Springfield. It is very dependable and has shot any ammo I've fed it flawlessly. It comes with the original Para case, both mags, 2 sets of grips, and the manual/paperwork. It has the LDA (light double action) trigger system which is sought after by many competitive shooters and gun enthusiasts who desire a tack driver. It is a perfect carry 1911 with a 3"" barrel and a larger magazine capacity than a traditional .45acp. It has an extended thumb safety and 3-dot glow sights."

This kit comes with the pictanny mount, so you could be up and plinking in no time. Great product, just decided I didn't need it on my AR10 and I don't want it just collecting dust. These kits retail for over $350, and I purchased mine for just over $300 about seven months ago. This is new, never used outside of putting it on my rifle, testing the red dot and taking a few pics.

Here is some info from The Burris USA site:

FastFire sights are light, small and tough, placing a powerful bright red dot on your target. They're perfect as a primary sight or paired on top of an existing optic or laser. The electronics and chassis are built tough to handle the abuse of competition and hunting. All FastFire sights are waterproof and shockproof and covered by the Forever Warranty. A wide variety of mounting options let you equip your favorite rifles and pistols with a fast-action FastFire.

The FastFire III models are available with either a 3 MOA or 8 MOA dot size, and gives you three manual brightness settings as well as an automatic brightness setting. Top mounted battery provides easy access without removing the sight. Upgraded windage and elevation adjustments are easy and accurate.

The cheapest I've been able to find my exact kit is $249 on-line. Locally you will pay a lot more. Selling mine for $225 obo. If you aren't close to that number don't waste either of our time. Cash best but may consider trading up for some excellent glass at a fair price.

I'm the second owner and have put about 400 rounds through it. I don't know how many rounds the original owner put through it but I bought it in excellent condition and it's still in excellent condition. Shoots great but has become a safe queen that I mostly fondle and rarely shoot. I never tried shooting it with the ported barrel on. The original owner had it ordered. The ported section sticks out longer than the muzzle when in the gun, and it comes with a rubber cap to protect it during storage if you want to keep the ported barrel in the gun instead of the normal barrel.

      A few accidental orders went through, and now I'm stuck with a brace I have no use for. Not trying to profit, I'm putting it up for how much it cost me; obviously, for that reason, price is non-negotiable.

     Not much to tell about it. It's a good addition to any AK 'pistol', and helps a ton when aiming with one hand. Made of black polymer, seems fairly tough based on online reviews. My friend has one and loves it.


NOTICE: This is not a stock. It is a brace. It is a common mistake people make when trying to find a stock for their PAP pistols.


Email me with any questions.

Beautiful machine, barely shot it myself. It also has a mounted flash hider, which is only held on with an allen head screw, but prevents you from flipping the bayonet to lock onto the barrel.

448,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3447448,For Sale:  Military History Library @300 books,"Waxahachie/Midlothian, Dallas, Texas","$ 1,000","Listed On: Monday, November 3, 2014",Rifles,no type,30-06 Springfield,no type,no type,"These books include many written by those who were there. They include the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq. Several are written and self published by WWII veterans and are very hard to find. Includes the book written by the last Japanese soldier to surrender in the Philippines in the 70's. Many about survival and escape and histories and biographies of famous Generals, Patton, Wainwright, Chesty Puller, etc. Though most concern WWII, there are 15 or so about the Civil war. Among these are two volumes written by Jefferson Davis. There is also a volume written by Sam Houston and published in the mid 1800's. 5 volumes published by the US Army on Pacific campaigns.

There are too many to list or describe here, but If you are interested, I have them all cataloged in an excell spreadsheet which I can send. All of the books have been read, some many times, by me. Some are like new, while others are old and worn, but they contain knowledge which is being lost these days. The things contained in these books will never be taught in schools. I've been collecting these books and reading them for more than 20 years now. I'm getting older and I don't want them to wind up in some garage sale or donated to a library who'd throw most of them away.

If you're interested, I can send more pictures, but it may take a few days. Some are valuable, $20-$30 or more and I've never seen A copy of the Sam Houston book. Most would be in the $5 - $10 dollar range at half-priced books, and if a person wanted to, he could double or tripple his money selling them online. The titles in the photos are a cross section of the group. There is a heavy emphisis on the Marine Corps and some on the SeaBees too. If you tried to accumulate this collection, first of all it would take years, and counting shipping and gas to go to bookstores, it could easily cost $3000 - $5000, if you could find them.

I can't tell who may want them, but I'd like to see them go to someone who would read and appreciate them. I won't sell them separately. If I can't sell them all in one bunch, I'll donate them to the VA library. I've got a feeling they'll weigh 250-300# so crating and shipping might be an issue.

Hope someone wants them."

Great concealed carry gun about the size of a wallet but packs a nice punch. Have had no problems with any of the rounds. Comes with 1 
 6 round mag, the original box and manual and nylon carry case, a holster, 13 rounds of Golden Sabre HP PD ammo, and 36 rounds of FMJ Winchester. The Remington 770 has had 22 rounds put through it, and despite everyone's problems with this rifle, I have experienced none of them. The ammo feeds great and I have not had any issues with the action of the bolt. Yes it is no 700 but for a beginners hunting rifle or just a weekend shooter this rifle does great if looking for a larger sized caliber. The rifle comes with 38 rounds. 20 of these rounds are Silver ballistic tip ($43) a box. The ammo alone is worth about $65 and I am not factoring that or the accessories into the price. It also comes with mag 4+1, a case, 8 round stock holder. Would like 300 for the .380 and extras and asking 250 for the 30-06 and extras. If your interested will sell as a pair will sell them to you both for $500.  Firm on the price for each thank you for taking the time to look. Ill cover background buyer covers transfers. You can email or call/text at REDACTED with any questions or concerns. Please text first to see if I am available."

We use 416R stainless steel and our rifling shape is a series of arcs instead of square corners, as in the traditional style of Enfield rifling. This arc shaped rifling has long been held in very high regard for its accuracy, increased velocity, reduced gas cutting and ease of cleaning. Here you can see the difference between classic Enfield rifling compared to the 5 land and 3 land polygonal rifling.
Product Development and testing We use steel from one of the nations largest steel suppliers.We have an ongoing inspection process as a proactive quality control measure on our products. Our quest is to provide the best products we can and not miss an opportunity to learn along the way. -We purchase certified material and keep certifications on file. -We record material lot numbers and track each piece of steel through the entire manufacturing process. -We mark each barrel near the extension with our name, the lot number and the inspectors stamp. -We perform magnetic particle inspections and other non-destructive testing -We randomly employ destructive testing methods"

The Smith & Wesson M&P15-22 is a .22 LR variant of the Smith & Wesson M&P15. In contrast to the original AR-15, it is blowback-operated, rather than direct impingement. It is intended for recreational shooting (""plinking"") and hunting. It is made with a polymer upper and lower receiver, rather than the aluminum that is normally used in AR-15s. Its proprietary magazines are also polymer.[2] The handguards are also polymer, and feature quadruple Picatinny rails.[1] The M&P15-22 can be used as a cheaper alternative for training with an AR-15 style rifle, since the rifle itself is much less expensive than most AR-15s, and the ammunition may often be one tenth the price of normal .223 Remington/5.56x45mm NATO, allowing the owner to enjoy far more range time for the same cost in ammunition. While shooting .22 LR is not a perfect substitute for training with the rifle's ""true"" cartridge, it can be a good way to focus on basic marksmanship and handling skills without the cost or recoil associated with shooting larger cartridges. The rifle features a safety and bolt lock that operate just like an AR-15. The M&P15-22 can also be an alternative in jurisdictions that restrict magazine capacity for centerfire cartridges. The 15-22 is also offered in a MOE (Magpul Original Equipment) version complete with a Magpul MOE pistol grip, MOE stock, MBUS sights, and a threaded barrel. This is available in Magpul FDE (Field Dark Earth), and standard black. Because the M&P15-22 fires a rimfire cartridge, it can be used as a legal way to shoot large numbers of cartridges without reloading. The M&P15-22's lower recoil may also be used as a way to ease new shooters into the sport, allowing them to familiarize themselves with AR-15 controls without the fear of excessive recoil or noise. The 15-22 dissemblance is very similar to the Ar-15 and SW M&P 15. The lower receiver detaches from the upper with two captured pins. The lower then contains a standard M&P"

Here's the info from Galco . Hate to let these go but I need the cash. Not interested in any trades.
http://www.galcogunleather.com/miami-classic-shoulder-system_8_2_1211.html
Our Miami Classic™ is quite possibly the most imitated shoulder holster system in the world. A direct descendant of the original shoulder system first introduced by Galco in 1970 (then the Famous Jackass Leather Company), the Miami Classic has since become the favorite of professionals worldwide. 

A key component of this patented shoulder system is its spider harness. All four points of the spider harness pivot independently and are connected by our unique clover shaped Flexalon™ swivel back plate, which is a Galco trademark. This results in a perfect fit and lasting comfort for all sizes and shapes. 

This system is constructed of premium saddle leather and includes holster, harness, ammo carrier and a set of system screws. The Miami Classic is fully modular. Optional accessories and components may be purchased separately. 

Made for semiautomatic pistols and some revolvers, the Miami Classic is available in right hand draw in tan or black finish. 

To assemble a Miami Classic for revolvers, for left-handed draw, or a personalized shoulder system, select a holster, harness and ammo carrier from the recommendations below. 

“The History of the Galco Miami Classic Holster Rig used in the TV series Miami Vice” 

Harness fits chests to 52"".

Note: Holster system pictured with magazine carrier for semi-auto. Revolver systems include double drop pouch for loose cartridges."

The simple yet ingenius AccuTrigger system allows shooters to adjust the pull weight from 1-1/2 to 6 pounds, with complete safety against bump-off if dropped.The 212's free-floating, rifled 22-inch barrel has a 1 in 35-inch rate of twist and the action is pillar-bedded for stability. A recoil pad on the butt severely curbs felt-recoil. Includes sling swivels and a removable magazine that holds two 12-gauge shells."

The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Scorpion is truly unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

Introducing the P320, a polymer-framed service pistol designed from the ground up with the input of law enforcement officers. The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. 

Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. 

Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. 

With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. The reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous.
