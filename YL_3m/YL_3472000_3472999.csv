While this rifle may not be pretty it can be made into a great shooter if you so desire.

Original Bolt has been bent.  Welds don’t look as nice as some but the bolt and handle are rock solid.
Barrel has been threaded to 15x1RH and an adapter placed over those threads converting them to 14x1LH (AK threads).  Currently has J-Tac47 Compensator installed (goes for around $65 now, originally I paid more).  I have fired it with the break and it does make a noticeable difference in felt recoil, the J-Tac is an excellent muzzle break.
Comes with Simmons 4x32 Prohunter Handgun Pistol Scope and Warne 22 Caliber Medium Scope Rings for a scout scope setup.  I have not had to opportunity to do any sighting or proper adjustments with this scope.  I did use my laser to try and get the scope on paper but scope will need full adjustments at range.

With the scope, rings, threading the barrel (threading kit cost me $50) and the muzzle break that is over $200 worth of stuff without including the rifle itself.  The included ATI Stock does have wear and scratches which are visible in the photos.  Barrel itself is in great shape which you can see for yourself when inspecting the rifle.  Unfortunately I do not have the original iron sights which is why I purchased the scope.  It does come with the tool to check firing pin depth.  Asking $225 which is more than fair in my opinion.  I am unwilling to separate the scope and rings from the rifle however if you don’t want the included muzzle break I will take $50 off the price and replace the J-Tac with a Tapco Bird Cage AK Flash Hider.  I would consider trading for a stripped AR15 lower (no plastic lowers, please) plus a little cash depending on the offer.

I also have just over 400 rounds of new manufacture, non-corrosive, Russian made 7.62x54r available.  For an extra 125 I will throw in the ammo, a few original Russian made ammo pouches that I have and about 10 or so stripper clips for the Mosin.  That would be $350 for everything.

The Les Baer Tactical Defense Pistol (TDP) was a very limited run of 100 pistols distributed through Les Baer and American Tactical Systems back in 1997. 
It is considered by many to be one of the finest commander sized 1911's ever produced. 
Each pistol has a minimum of 40 hours custom gunsmithing to acheive perfect fit and function. The TDP is very comparable to the Wilson Combat Supergrade.

Round count is very low, as the slide to frame fit is still very snug and does not stick in battery.
The beavertail fit is excellent as well, no lateral movement and does not rub on frame."

There is some cosmetic wear mainly around the trigger guard/mag well area and some minor wear to the stock.  There is also a little surface rust on the barrel.  With the flash the camera makes it look worse than it actually is and it can be rectified with a little gun oil and some steel wool.  I’ll be cleaning it up a little shortly, I just wanted to get the ad up ASAP.  Other wise it is in great shape and the rifle shoots great.  I’ve only put about 50 rounds through during the time I’ve owned it and the barrel was cleaned after last use.  I seem to have misplaced the factory 10 round mag for this rifle.  I will continue to look for it but if I don't find it by the time of sale a replacement can be had for about $15 shipped from eBay (which is the best price I've seen thus far, you may find it cheaper elsewhere).

Asking $200 for the rifle.  Local sale, not looking to ship.  As a bonus I will throw in 200 rounds of American Eagle .22lr to get you started.  I have other items for sale, check out my other ads.  If you are interested in more than one item feel free to make and offer.  Thanks for looking."

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.
Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

I have put around 600 rounds through the rifle since I bought it about a year ago, for the most part it's sat in my safe since I got it. I will include 2 30 round steel magazines with it, as well as the factory 10 round magazine which has been fitted to work with the bullet guide that was installed. 

Here's a parts list of what's all on the rifle-

* 8.5"" ACE skeleton stock 
* 1"" ACE extended buttpad 
* CSS Round bullet guide
* ACE folding mechanism
* CSS Internal receiver block
* CSS Billet bolt on trigger guard
* Tapco G2 trigger group
* Roninsgrips Mongo Grip
* K-var Polymer lower handguard
* Ultimak gas tube optic mount
* Primary Arms Micro Dot
* VLTOR offset scout flashlight mount
* Surefire G2X Flashlight
* ACE folding mech sling swivel
* Magpul MS3 sling


I'd also be willing to sell the rifle for $1025 without the flashlight/mount, MS3 sling, and the red dot sight. The buyer must have a valid Ohio drivers license and be willing to sign a bill of sale. I'd also prefer the buyer had a valid CCW license if possible too."

Description:
Used by Special Forces, hunters and sport shooters
The CompM2, also known as the M68/CCO (when used by U.S. forces), is the standard sight for the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, and the armed forces of many NATO countries.
Designed for extreme conditions - submersible to 25 meters
The CompM2 is ready for use around the clock due to its compatibility with all generations of night vision devices (NVD)
When the CompM2 was released, it became the benchmark against which all other combat optics are measured. While primarily utilized by armed forces, the CompM2 is also available to hunters and sport shooters who want a professional-grade sight.
Holds up under the roughest physical handling and can withstand the most severe weather conditions and temperatures
Completely submersible and will withstand pressures up to 2.5 atmospheres allowing it to be taken up to 80 feet (25 meters) under water."

The Aimpoint PRO is designed with input from a distinguished group of current and former professionals ranging from the Army Rangers to Police SWAT, the Patrol Rifle Optic incorporates many never before seen features to maximize this sight's performance within the challenging conditions faced by modern military and law enforcement. A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness (absolute or lower 1/3rd) with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 (Quick Release Picatinny Gen2) mount for the PRO optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches and fingerprints.

It is in 12ga which was the only gauge that Lee offered. It is set up to load 1 1/8oz Trap loads using either Green Dot or Red Dot. It includes a copy of the original owners manual, a load sheet and a bushing sheet. The only bushings with it are the ones that are in it. The bushings are available from lee in a kit for about $20 and are the same ones used in their Load-All II. The load sheets are the same also. It works just fine as I had Lee rebuild it for me 2 yrs ago. (nothing was really wrong at the time. It needed the ratcheting collar around the center shaft so I asked them to go through the unit right away.) Once the turret is filled with hulls you can produce one fully loaded shell with each handle pull. A box takes about 15min. I have an exact duplicate of this loader and I just don't need two of them.

I will add 500 once fired Federal Hulls with this sale plus I am cutting the price by $15.
