Zero creep. The barrel is a Fluted 28in Pro-Hunter with a muzzle break. Most ARs thump harder then this big bore. Loves 150gr Noslers.

F SERIES. SERIAL NUMBER DATES IT TO 1959.  Here's a post from a Colt Forum describing the gun:
'The Frontier Scouts with the K serial numbered had zinc alloy frames, grip frames and loading gates which were much heavier than the aluminum ones. The K guns were bright nickel plated, available in .22 LR, .22 Magnum and .22 CAL (shipped with .22 LR and .22 Magnum cylinders) and had 4 3/4 inch (Frontier Scout) or 9 1/2 inch (Buntline Scout) barrels. They were introduced in 1960 and were made until about 1970. Many K Scouts were sold as ""sets"" of guns, sets being pairs of Frontier Scouts or Buntline Scouts or combination sets consisting of one Frontier Scout and one Buntline Scout.
In high condition, they are all desirable guns, but there were more of the K numbers Scouts produced than the Q numbered Scouts.'

In great shape and runs well, it's kind of a Glock/Sig lovechild with a polymer frame and sa/da hammer fired action that feels very much like a SIG.  Same size as a Glock 19.

It's lightly used and has only had about 200 rounds through it with it on the rifle, bought new earlier this month.  Does reduce recoil as intended, but I think I'd like to try something different.  These work particularly well on ar pistols and help tame the recoil and muzzle rise (while throwing 5 foot fireballs out the side!).  Will fit on any ar15 with standard threads or barrel with the same threads.  Will come with two washers, I believe one is a peel and one is a crush, but they are used and I can not guarantee they will work on your rifle, so you may need to get a new one.

I'd like to trade for Magpul Pmags, I'd trade for 3 of them in 30 or 20 round versions.  Might also trade for. 223/5.56 ammo, but would prefer mags.

Colt M16 flat top upper receiver specifically for rifle, not carbine (no feed ramps), Colt 20"" chrome lined 1/7 twist barrel.

Does not come with Bolt/carrier group but I have 3 for you to choose from.  I have Colt, FN and Armalite.  90-135 range.   I don't have/use PSA mystery bolts (BCG'S) So that means mine aren't cheap in price either.

I built and test fired this upper for a feature film last summer.  It was originally set up to run blanks (yes I cleaned that nasty carbon out of it). And in the end the Director was too scared to shoot any weapons so it was only carried by the Marines for a week or so.  So it does have a few very minor bruises and we did age the blades of the front sight and the last six inches of the barrel.    The rail system is brand new however.

If you want it a bit cheaper, I will remove the rail system and install standard hand guards and sell it for $500.00.   otherwise its $675.00 as pictured.

Call or text only.   I will not answer emails and no I don't want to ship this.   I want cash or a new transmission for my dodge ram. :)

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1942 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped in May of 1942. It is stamped with WB inside a Box for Colonel Waldemar S. Broberg, Hartford/Springfield Ordnance District, Army Inspector of Ordnance: July 1, 1941 - June 16, 1942. The WB inspected pistols are a little more rare for that time frame.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by the military, as the barrel has been re-stamped. This gun is in its original time frame finish (parkerized). All Proof markings to fit era. Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. It is amazingly tight and special fitted for accuracy. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

I love the versatility of this gun, it's made to be modified to shoot for left or right handers.  All the main components on this gun can be transferred to either the left or right side.  The manual safety button, magazine release button, extractor, ejector and cocking handle are easily reversible for right and left handed use.  This gun field strips with ease and takes only a few moments to be completely disassembled.  The Storm features a fold down front sight which is fully adjustable in windage and elevation along with an interchangeable rear sight that can be flipped to change to either near or far range.  Like the front sight, the rear sight can also be folded down if a scope is added.  The CX4 begs to be accessorized.  Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights.  It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories.  This gun also features left, right and bottom mounting rails.  I'd like to meet in my town of South Boston.  A bill of sale will be completed and you will need your driver's license.  First person to contact me gets it.  I will not wait a week for you to come get it,  first come first serve.  This is a very customizable gun.  I will include a website of someone i've done business with in the past.  They completely customize CX4's and make them very bad ass.  If you're looking to have this gun be any more unique and one of a kind then they're were you need to send it.

There were generally 3 types of markings that can be found on these pistols: 

1) Czech markings (as shown in the picture) which generally were made post-WWII, but some pre-war pistols may have survived the Nazi occupation without being re-marked. In the picture you can see that the left side of the slide looks very different from the Nazi marked ones (see #2 below). Additionally, the serial number is listed on both the slide and frame on the right side rather than on the left side like the Nazi ones. The year of manufacture on these ones can be found on the left side of the frame, in the case of the picture below, it is the ""47"" marking for 1947.

2) Nazi markings from both pre-war models that were re-stamped by the nazis as well as models made during the Nazi occupation. These pistols generally say ""Pistole Modell 27   Kal. 7,65"" on the left side of the slid, and they have the serial number listed on the left side of the frame. I do NOT want this type.

3) Neither Czech nor Nazi marked. These were produced immediately after the Nazi occupation from parts that were left over that had not yet been stamped with Nazi markings. I would accept this type.

Let me know if you have one to sell or trade.

There are less than 200 rounds through this gun. It was carried a gently IWB and stored in my climate / humidity controlled safe. Includes the original hard case, paperwork, two 7-round Walther mags, and replaceable backstrap to customize the grip. Photo shown is not a ""stock"" photo but is the actual gun for sale."

So I set a meet place/time/location and a day before we met he comes up with more excuses as to why he wants to reschedule. So we reschedule all over again, A couple days go by and he emails me again(like 4 days to be exact) he tells me he wants meet that week that only now he wants me to come to HIS area, now from here is when I started to see something was fishy about this guy, so I call off the deal because I've never dealt with anyone who acted as shady as bro did. So come to find out I'm doing a little research on the hellpups when out of nowhere I see the EXACT SAME pictures he has on his listing, off the bat I knew this guy is either trying to rob some hard working mans money or is trying to rob us for our guns.

Adams Arms Upper-
Carbine Tactical Evo 16"" 1/7 twist ratio Upper is a M4 Profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with a salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured by Samson Manufacturing and is a 10"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper.

I have for sale an M&P45C that has been treated to the best Apex has to offer. The gun has had a stipple job to the front strap and the large sized grip insert. The small and medium inserts are untouched. The gun will come in the S&W case and has the lock, docs, and spent shell casing. Will include 4 magazines, two with black pinky extensions, one with the FDE pinky extension, and one with the standard base plate.

The gun has had an Apex full trigger kit installed, hard forward set sear, sear block housing, and TFO front sight. The front sight fiber rod is damaged and will need to be replaced but works fine. The trigger pull weight is right at about 4.7# but can be set lower or higher by purchasing the appropriate springs from Apex. The trigger is by far the best I've felt on a polymer gun.

This gun does not have the manual safety or the magazine disconnect safety.

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

I purchased this new about four years ago. It has been kept in a safe, unfired since that time. The original Owner Warranty card is present and not filled in.
MSRP is $1,019.00.

Here is the God’s honest truth. Right now you can buy one of these on Gunbroker for $750.00 (that’s the cheapest I can find; others are more expensive), plus pay $20 shipping, plus whatever fee your local FFL requires for the transfer and filling out Form 4473. You can go through that process, or pay at least $850 after tax at a local gunshow.

Or you can buy this one, today for $725. 

You must be 18 or older, produce a CHL or TDL, be a legal owner, non-felon, and sign a Bill of Sale that I will provide.

Price is firm. If I receive no ‘I want it’ responses, then clearly I will need to lower the price if I want to sell it. I will do so if necessary. And if you see this listing, the gun is still available.

And folks, if you don't have the money and or need to ask your spouse, for the love of all that is holy, be adult enough to repress the urge to say ""I'll take it""; you'll save us both a lot of time as you dance out of your commitment for the next week. 

I am really easy to deal with if you honor your commitment. But over the last month, far too many of you guys have said ""I want it - please hold it for me until Saturday""...and I've done that, only to be told Saturday that a) your wife is unhappy, b) your daughter is in the Emergency room, c) your car engine blew up, d) well ""something came up"".

So here's the deal: If you commit, then call me Saturday morning with some weasley excuse because you don't want to drive from Katy, then I'm going to add your phone number, email and name to the top of this listing.
