Has Caspian Slide, and G.I. Spec internals, stainless steel barrel. Frame is Stainless Steel, slide is blued. Does have some minor holster wear. But is in excellent condition. Slide to frame fit is tight, and smooth as glass. This is actually one of the nicest fits I've ever seen in a 1911. The slide just glides as if it was on ice. I was not the original builder. I got it like this, and I gotta say its one of the best I've handled. I've put about 300 rounds through it with verious ammo without so much as a hiccup. Gun is a serious tack driver to about 50-60yards. Probably more, but that's the farthest I've shot it. Holds 2 inch groups at 50 yards. I really love this gun, but I'm a small guy, and its a little too large for me. Would like to trade for a Commander or officer size 1911. Not real picky about manufacture. I like RIA, ATI, PARA, ECT. The only thing I will trade for is a commander or officer size 1911. Not interested in anything else. And WILL NOT SELL. Comeswith 1 8 round wWilson combat magazine. No ammo, no holster. Just looking to trade my gun for yours, straight across. I'm valueing my gun at around $500.00 and I'm looking to trade for a similarly valued commander or officers size 1911.

  While many firearms owners have become skilled shooters, the truth is that a high degree of confusion remains as to when the use of deadly force is legally justifiable. With so many myths surrounding the subject and the complexity of the laws as they pertain to concealed carry, there is little wonder why both police officers and otherwise law-abiding citizens find themselves being prosecuted for actions they believed were both prudent and justified. 
Laws by their very nature are ambiguous, confusing, and often left to the interpretation of those who do not practice law and who may not even understand the law. To ensure you possess a comprehensive understanding of the law you could hire an attorney and pay hundreds of dollars for the consultation. If you are ever in a situation where you have no alternative but to use deadly force, a good criminal defense attorney's retainer fee can start at $30,000. Fortunately, the professional instructors at Patriot Training and Consulting can provide you with this information in an easy to understand format. In comparison, the cost of attending either your initial Concealed Carry Handgun training or Legal Issues Refresher training through PatriotTAC is a small financial investment to help ensure you don’t find yourself on the wrong side of the courtroom. If you don't think you can learn a lot from a concealed carry course, than this IS the course for you! For more information and to register, go to:

I received it from a trade about 2 months ago and have no interest in keeping it. The little I know about it I learned from Google however it is a double heat treated barrel, it has many of the proper stamps throughout the gun. From what I can tell it has not been re barreled and everything looks to be original with matching numbers. The stock is unaltered and has not been sportized. The metal looks to be 90% and the gun overall is in great shape for nearing 100 years old. 

The bolt slides flawlessly and the butt plate looks good with no real signs of wear. There is some damage to the rear of the stock. Possibly water or something else. I have not touched it with fear of devaluing it. 

 I don't have to sell this so please no lowballers. However I  open to trades as well. Primarily I am looking for a good hunting rifle with scope in .300 .308 or 7 mag or a 1911. Will do gun for trade and cash or my gun and cash for trade. Willing to look at all offers on all types of guns however."

The numbers match, as usual with these the magazine is unmarked but it operates smoothly with the firearm.

Includes 8 surplus stripper clips, a 20 round box of PPU 150 gr SP ammo, and about 20 rounds of old surplus ammo that still goes bang- I've shot about 20 rounds of the surplus ammo with good results.

No visible external importation marks, I just selected CIA as the manufacturer.

Now, when I say barely used I mean that I have put 27 rounds through the upper. This was to ensure functionality, reliability, and accuracy from the scope and RMR. The scope has been sighted at 100yds but will hit accurately much farther out (240 is the max distance I can go at my range). Great for hunting or just shooting long distances. The upper comes with the ammo I used to sight in the rifle as well as a lighter grain V-Max ammo that I used to test the functionality of the upper. Below is a list of the parts used to build the upper:

CMMG 16"" barrel, 1:7 twist, 4140 Chrome lined barrel: $180.00

Precision Armament M11 muzzle brake: $120.00

Laser Engraved ""Zombie Hunter"": $15.00

Mil-spec Carbine gas tube: $13.00

Mil-spec Barrel Nut: $9.00

NCStar micro red dot with 45 degree rail: $45.00

UTG 3-12x44 SWAT Accushot scope, 36 color illuminated Mil-Dot Reticle,
1/4 MOA, 30mm tube, weaver style mounts: $120.00

Magpul XTM Hand Stop Kit: $25.00

3 - 20rnd Magpul Magazines (Black): $45.00 ($15.00 each)

Jamison Brass & Ammo 150gr SBT: $105.00

Right to Bear Arms 110gr V-Max ammo: $15.00

This is not your standard run of the mill .300 upper so any deals or offers treating it as such will be ignored. I prefer cash but I will entertain any good trades. I'm looking for a new Glock 17 or a Smith and Wesson M&P in 9mm and will consider trade plus cash offer. 

I will also sell the upper with or without the scope or RMR so feel free to message me if you would like to know the price without those on there.

461,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3110461,For Trade:  Brand New: BOSE Acoustimass 5 Series III Speaker System,"Minnesota, Minnesota, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 18, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale/trade: Brand new in box white Bose Acoustimass 5 Series III speaker system. I redeemed credit card points for these and was going to install them in my kitchen, but then decided they may be a bit much for such a small room. I have documentation, receipt, and  they have full warranty. These are $399 + tax in-store as well as online, and have excellent reviews. Asking $300 and consider the value right around there for a trade as well.

Experience enhanced sound from Bose's next-generation Acoustimass stereo speakers. The Acoustimass 5 system in white delivers bass that's the deepest and fullest yet. Two single-cube speakers-smaller than ever before-are elegantly designed to fit virtually any decor. And the module easily hides away behind furniture or off in a corner, so all the lifelike sound seems to flow from the tiny cubes.

When you hear the Acoustimass 5 Series III speakers, you'll think you're listening to much larger speakers. Yet the spacious sound actually comes from two tiny cube speaker arrays and a hideaway Acoustimass bass module. The improved cube speakers offer enhanced performance, contemporary styling, and a smaller size than the Series II. And the improved module fills a room with even deeper, fuller bass. These Virtually Invisible speakers are the definitive answer to the question of how to combine spacious sound with space-saving design.

Though the Virtually Invisible speaker design may seem like a disappearing act, the performance is quite noticeable. Full, resonating bass and crystal-clear highs envelop a room in beautiful stereo sound. It's all the result of years of intense research and testing. The Acoustimass 5 speakers accomplish what no conventional speakers can claim: big, lifelike sound without big, bulky speakers. Now or in the future, Acoustimass stereo speakers can be turned into a home theater set by simply adding the compatible Bose VCS-10 center-channel speaker. For full five-speaker surround sound, add the VCS-30 center-surround speaker package.

Key Features
Direct/Reflecting speaker technology delivers lifelike spaciousness from a natural balance of reflected and direct sound-similar to a live performance.
Magnetically shielded speakers allow for speaker placement in close proximity to your TV without interfering with the picture quality.
Automatic protection circuitry prevents drivers from being overdriven and provides increased reliability while minimizing interference with the listening experience.
Syncom computer tested to ensure one of the highest levels of quality and reliability in the audio industry.

Rare Police Trade-In: Glock 22 RTF2 .40 S&W w/ Glock night sights

We are selling a police trade-in Glock 22 RTF2. The RTF2 models were made to order by Glock for law enforcement agencies only in 2009. The RTF2 models are Gen3 guns with deep ""fish gill"" slide serrations and a very aggressive grip texture. Most of the LE agencies that purchased the RTF2 models replaced them with Gen4 models that came out in 2010, because the grip texture on the RTF2s was so aggressive that it was destroying officer's uniforms, seatbelts, center consoles and anything else it rubbed against frequently.

This gun comes with factory Glock night sights (see photos), one 15-round magazine, the plastic box, Glock magazine loader, cable lock, Glock cleaning rod, Glock nylon cleaning brush, manual and fired casings (see photos). The fired casings have a collected date of 4/17/09. The plastic box has ""Segreto Glock 22"" written in black Sharpie on the warning label on the plastic box. We are assuming that this gun was issued to an officer with the last name ""Segreto"".

Note: We have a good stock of current-production 15-round Glock 22 magazines in-stock for $26.99 each. Let us know if you want to purchase additional magazines.

This gun is in 95% condition with some minor holster wear as is to be expected with a police trade-in. This gun has been detail-cleaned and inspected by a certified Glock armorer. This gun has been verified to be in its original factory configuration with no aftermarket parts or modifications. You can take this gun directly to the range after you take possession.

Illinois residents pay 6.5% sales tax.

Price reflects a 3.5% cash discount. If you pay by any method other than cash, or a cash equivalent such as a money order or cashier's check, you will not be eligible for the cash discount and you will pay 3.5% more.

We will not ship until we have received a verified payment. We accept cash (in-person only), cashier's checks, money orders and all major credit cards (no cash discount for credit or debit card payments). All checks must be verified with our bank before we will ship.

You can take possession at Metro Armory's licensed premises in LaSalle County, Illinois or we can ship to an FFL near you for $35.

Note: The picture of the Glock night sights were taken side-by-side with a Gen4 G19, with less than 1 year old Glock factory night sights, for comparison purposes. The Gen4 G19 is on the left and the G22RTF is on the right in the picture.

DO NOT BID ON THIS AUCTION IF THIS ITEM IS NOT LEGAL FOR YOU TO PURCHASE OR POSSESS IN YOUR CITY, COUNTY OR STATE. IF THE MAGAZINE(S) THAT COME WITH THIS ITEM ARE ILLEGAL FOR YOU TO PURCHASE OR POSSESS IN YOUR CITY, COUNTY OR STATE, YOU MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE THE GUN WITHOUT THE MAGAZINE(S) IN WHICH CASE THE MAGAZINE(S) WILL REMAIN THE SOLE PROPERTY OF THE SELLER.

We reserve the right to render any sale null and void if the laws of the buyer's city, county or state do not permit the lawful transfer of the firearm and/or magazine(s). We do not accept any responsibility for the actions of the buyer.

If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x6""
Text Cody @ 480-228-8195 or call 520-723-92five-five

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"
