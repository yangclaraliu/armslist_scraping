 Selling a hard to find collectable Glock 19 RTF2. It has the gill cuts on the slide. Before you reply please do your research on these. This one has had about 75 rounds through it. It is in excellent shape, has the small line on top of the barrel, where the slide makes contact. I have added an extended mag release, and an extended slide stop. Also has a grip plug and a Hogue slip on grip. Has everything from the factory, box, papers, lock, and 2 15 round factory mags. This is one that Glock collectors want in their collection. If you don't like the price then this is not for you.

Its a 49cc supposedly gets 100 miles a gallon, and can go 30-50mph depending on how much you weigh. Automatic clutch and 5 speed transmission.
I bought this new off the internet and am its only owner. The company went out of business shortly after I bought it and really this bike mainly just sits in my garage.

Less than 1k miles on it. It runs and drives fine but does have some issues.
It has minor rust in some areas, the accelerator sticks a little. Umm front breaks/mph link thing in the front rim sticks (idk makes an annoying noise when you drive). Carb is dirty.

Has electric (tho no battery) and manual kick start. Umm turn signals and horn and lights all work.

Basically this thing needs some tlc from someone who knows what they are doing. It hasn't been abused or anything, just neglected and sitting in storage. I drive it maybe 1-4 times a year around town.

Will meet in the city of Portland only. This thing weighs less then 200lbs so best way imo for you to take it home would be to just load it in the back of a truck.

Great deal for someone who knows what even only a little bit of what they are doing with bikes.

I'd rather just have some more guns sitting around as I would use them more than this.

Kimber Eclipse Ultra II

The Eclipse Ultra II is the only Kimber with a 3-inch barrel built on a stainless steel frame. All other 3-inch pistols have aluminum or polymer frames, and the extra weight reduces felt recoil. 

A unique Kimber that combines a 3-inch barrel with a stainless steel frame

Elegance. Hard to define but easy to recognize, elegance is a true measure of quality. Kimber Eclipse pistols have a brush polished finish over a stainless steel slide and frame, both accented with black small parts. More importantly, they perform as good as they look—and that is a bold statement. 

The true beauty of Eclipse pistols is in their performance. Match grade barrels and triggers ensure the level of accuracy that made Kimber the world’s most popular 1911. All are chambered in .45 ACP. Breech faces are polished for dependable feeding, and slide and magazine releases are checkered for fast, reliable operation. The Eclipse Ultra II is the only 3-inch Kimber with a stainless steel frame. Still, performance never looked this good. 

The Kimber Eclipse Utra II is the compact version of the Eclipse series. Like the other two models in the Eclipse line, it features 30 LPI front strap checkering, fixed Meprolight night sights, a premium trigger, as well as all of the other match grade features found on Kimber pistols."

The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™'s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.

Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 12+1 rounds of .40SW. You’ll find everything on the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®.

If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD® 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range.

I have a (LNIB) Sig Sauer 716 DMR Sniper Rifle for sale. I bought this rifle NIB around 3 weeks ago and put only 30 rounds total of 168 grain Hornady Match ammo thru it with a cleaning after every 5 rounds fired for proper barrel break in. This Sig 716 Sniper Rifle was giving me 1/2"" groups at 100 yards consistently. Very accurate for a Semi Automatic rifle.

This is a Piston Driven .308 Caliber Sniper Rifle with a 4 position gas regulator adjuster for different conditions and for Suppressor use. The rifle is nice and tight and functions flawlessly with no issues. 

It comes with Troy flip up sights, MagPul UBR stock, MagPul MIAD grip, Harris BR-S Bipod, Bipod Adapter, Sling, Rail Covers, 2- 20 round P-Mags, and a Hard Shell case. It has an 18"" Heavy Match barrel with a 1x10"" twist for Ultimate accuracy, And the barrel is threaded for your favorite F/H or Suppressor. It also comes with a Geissele SSA Match Trigger.
