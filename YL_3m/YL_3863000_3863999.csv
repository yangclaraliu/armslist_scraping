This is a setup I am not eager to part with. However I have decided to do a new 300blk build and need to finance it somehow. I have shot this out to 300 yds and its a dream. The trigger is crisp and great for long range, or just dumping rounds fast for some fun. The Trijicon Scope is crystal clear and one of the best adjustable scopes I have ever used. Its 1x power feels like a red dot sight, and the 4x power is great for reaching out and touching things. 

This has been a great firearm for me and has had zero malfunctions (FTEs, FTFs, etc). I have removed the grip tape from the magpul grip.

Very accurate with 55gr loads. In .223, this rifle holds 6 rounds in the internal magazine + 1 in the chamber. Rifle is in great condition, has only ~100 rounds through it. There was a recall on most recently produced Remington 700's and 770's in the past year, due to a quality control issue with too much glue used in some trigger assembly installations. This rifle did not have that issue, but I sent it in anyway since it was included in the recall and it came back months later with a service ticket. As far as I can tell nothing was done, and the trigger is just as crisp as it was new. All original and recall paperwork is included.

Mounted is a Vortex Diamondback scope, only a few months old, spending most of its time in the box waiting for the rifle to come back from recall. It is an excellent scope, very clear glass and light intake- you can really tell at dusk. It's a 4-12x with the BDC (Bullet drop compensator) reticle. The rifle is sighted in at 200 yards, with each dash below the crosshairs compensating for 300, 400, and 500 yards. On a still day its no problem to hit all the way out 500 yards with this reticle- great fun.

This is light weight, soft shooting, handy gun. Selling to pay for future college expenditures. I could meet a buyer at gun shows in Wichita Falls or the Metroplex area. Any questions welcome, call or text REDACTED or email"

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.



The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Firestar pistols are recoil operated, with Browning cam locking and short barrel recoil. Barrel muzzle is externally cone-shaped to achieve the best fit into the slide for improved accuracy. The .45acp M-45, is a single action pistol with a frame mounted ambidextrous safety that allows for ""cocked and locked"" carry (hammer is cocked and safey is applied). All Firestars featured automated firing pin safey and magazine disconnect safety. Single column magazine holds 6 rounds.

Firestar pistols are claimed to be ones of the smallest guns in their respective calibers, but, obviously not the lightest ones. The solid steel construction makes these guns extremely sturdy and reliable, and additional weight greatly improves recoil control and makes the shooting quite comfortable, despite the powerful ammunition and small size of the guns.

It is a great concealed carry pistol, and comes with the Uncle Mike's Tactical Holster, 2 magazines (one with extended finger rest), and a ST-17 In Waistband Leather Holster from Ted Blocker.

Manufactured in 1976, this stainless steel beauty certainly doesn't show its age. Seeing is believing. This thing is gorgeous... With pearl grips and the commemorative stamp ""Made in the 200th year of American Liberty"", it would make a great display piece, or be perfect for western re-enactments - fired only a handful of times -- it is a straight shooter and could serve as a workhorse as well. 6.5"" barrel, fires both .357 magnum and .38 special. Comes with Uncle Mikes holster. Serial # (33-12XXX)

This is a very nice pistol and is very accurate, but it is very picky about what ammo you use.
Of course it likes the high quality CCI, Winchester ect. it will shoot anything but some times will not feed correctly, it could be that the feed ramp needs a polish. 
This is a great little pistol and fits great in the hand.
My asking price I think is very reasonable at $225 with 100 rounds of ammo...."

Transfer can be done pretty much anywhere around Pittsburgh if during a weekday but if a night or weekend is required, I'd prefer to use Firearm Transfers in Ross (John charges $20).

I am going a different route with a second build and need a carbine barrel instead.  Prefer to sell for close to what I paid but will consider trading for an equal value and level of barrel.  Please no PSA OR DPMS barrels as those are good but not equal to this barrel.  These cone with a lifetime warranty from the factory and the melonite makes it a great barrel for long term use.  I have a gas tube that I will throw in with the price. 

SPECS FROM THE FACTORY:
This Voodoo Barrels AR-15 barrel features a Government contour that is slim under the handguard and heavy from the gas port forward, placing a little extra weight toward the muzzle for a natural, balanced feel when installed. It comes with a 5.56x45mm NATO chamber that's safe for use with both commercial-grade and military surplus ammunition, while its 1 in 7"" twist rifling allows it to properly stabilize medium- to heavy-weight projectiles of up to about 77 grains. Additional features include a mid length gas port for a longer sight radius and smoother recoil impulse, a pre-installed barrel extension with M4 feed ramps, and a 1/2""-28 threaded muzzle for the installation of a flash hider, muzzle brake or sound suppressor. 

This 16"" AR-15 barrel is constructed from Mil-Spec 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel, and has been finished inside and out with Voodoo Barrels' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel.

I was going to trade at the dealers but they want to low ball everything to make I profit.  Found that they would re-blue it and sell it for around $450-$500.  So I will make it easy on you.  I will sell it for $380 and that gives you extra money to have it re-blued yourself or just use it as it is.  Won't hurt a thing.

The magazine holds six 2¾-inch 12 ga. shells, when no plug is installed, unlike most shotguns of today which hold four or five shells.

They’ve always offered credible copies of the Smith & Wesson Chief’s Special. Some of our first were the model 30s of the 1960s. After 1968, and up until the mid 1980s, all the new Rossi J frame revolvers had 3 inch barrels. A 3 inch is optimal. It will hit point of aim better than a 2 inch, yields 50 fps more velocity, less noise, and more stability. Snubs always outsold them, still do, but the 3 inchers are a better choice. Any ammunition shown in our photos is not included. Here is Rossi’s descendant of its 68 series revolver, the R351 chambered in .38 Special. Manufacturer is Amadeo Rossi of Sao Leopoldo, Brazil, a Taurus affiliate; this .38 is marked Made In Brazil By Taurus. Type is traditional double and single action. Construction is entirely blue steel with the exception of the gray hardened steel hammer nose firing pin and rivet. Frame is J Size small frame, with Square Butt Grip frame and 3 screw side plate. Barrel is 3 inch heavy full lug type, with matte finish verticals and barrel-integral serrated blade front sight. Rear sight is frame integral fixed notch. Cylinder capacity is 5 rounds of .38 Smith & Wesson Special caliber ammunition, and Rossi rates its 351 series revolvers for +P ammo. Note the cylinder yoke’s detent latch, a Taurus inspired mechanical improvement that prevents cylinder wobble. Trigger is .290 smooth faced combat with semi-target, shorter spur .400 serrated hammer. Weight empty is a well balanced 23 1/2 ounces with center of gravity at the trigger. Double action trigger pull is smooth and consistent, 12 pound vicinity, with a crisp 6 pound single action pull. Safety system consists of a transfer bar that prevents the firing pin from touching a cartridge primer unless the trigger is fully depressed, and also Taurus’s innovative internal hammer lock. Note that we have installed a set of Sile Italian Walnut Grips for Smith & Wesson J Frame Square Butt, modified and fitted to this Rossi. Small amounts of grip frame will show, as the photos show, but the Siles look infinitely better than Rossi’s factory issue rubber grips, see our attached comparative photo of an early 1980s 3 inch S&W 36 with Herrett’s Grips. Note that a 36A Speedloader Will Not clear the rest ridge on these. From its letter G serial number prefix, this 351 was manufactured in 2012 or 2013, perhaps a special run, since the 3 inch variant is not even in Braztech’s Archive. This revolver is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or showgirl from Firearms Industry trade shows like the annual SHOT show held in Las Vegas. It is in its original overlabeled factory box with instruction manual and two keys for its hammer lock. Note that the box top is labeled, Factory Reconditioned. This simply means that if this Rossi develops mechanical problems, Braztech will repair it at no charge, but they will not give a freebie refinish. It does not need any refinish anyway. Surface detractions are negligible, only faint occasional edge whitening and cylinder rotation marking. Grip frame exposure past the grip panels’ edges is minimal, as the photos show. We rate this 351 as Excellent in Box, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. The only comparable Blue Steel 3 inch 5 shot revolver on the market is the occasionally produced 36-10 Classic in 3 inch; if a person can even find one of those, it will severely damage $1,000.00.We’re offering the Rossi 351 Blue 3 inch in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates for only  $ 269.00.

Developed during WWI to supplement 1911 auto pistol production, the Colt Model 1917 is based on the New Service double action revolver modified to chamber the same .45 ACP cartridge used by the Colt Automatic. Loading and ejection are fast using spring steel ""moon clips"" to hold the cartridges. This early gun has the bored through cylinder chambers so the moon clips are a must. It wears the standard 5-1/2"" barrel that is ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY"" marked along the bottom. This revolver was overhauled at some point between the World Wars and was reblued (before Parkerizing became the standard). The frame, yoke, cylinder and ejector assembly have been arsenal numbered to match although the original Colt factory serial number is also matching inside the frame and yoke. Overall condition is good, with some finish loss and spotting from a chemical spill (or possibly blood) as well as some thinning to the grip straps. There are some handling marks but no significant pitting. The brown plastic grips feature silver Colt medallions and are likely WWII or post-war replacements. The revolver functions alright although there is some play between the frame and yoke when at rest. Lock-up is good with the trigger held to the rear. The timing is slightly late in single action but works perfectly fired double action. The bore is very good with strong rifling that is light frosted (but free of deep pitting). A well worn black stained 1917-dated U.S. holster is included."

This reciever is built in house by Waffen Werks in Knoxville, Tennessee with a complete matching numbers Bulgarian parts kit, all the parts are from one rifle not a bunch of mismatched parts that have been frankensteined together. The rifle kit is from the famed Circle 10 factory in Bulgaria.  The barrel is 16"" and chrome lined with the standard 24mm muzzle threads and has an authentic Bulgarian chrome lined AK-74 muzzle brake, not an imatation brake that commonly seen these days.  The rifle is equipped with a Tapco G2 trigger group that has no trigger ""slap"".  The reciever is equipped with the stadard left side scope rail for mounting optics and in my opinion is the best way to mount an optic and be able to retain your zero.  The rifle with come with an authentic Bulgarian sling and Tapco 30 round magazine as pictured. The furniture is Bulgarian wood and has the desirable tiger stripes on the front handguard. I was originally going to change to polymer furniture but really liked the look of the wood so I kept it.  The rifle shoots very accurately with the 5.45 and I can easily hit 300 yard shots with iron sights (the rear sight goes up to 1000 meters) and further with optics as the rail is big enough to mount a variable scope.  The rifle is also covered by a company called DDI who bought Waffen Werks and gives warrant on all their rifles (which I never needed to use but is nice to have.). I also have 210 rounds of Wolf 60gr 5.45x39mm ammo that come with the rifle along with 3-30 round magazines (1 burnt orange tapco, 1 bulgarian brown, 1 bulgarian black) and 1 tapco 10 round magazine for bench shooting.

I am asking $550 for rifle, 4 magazines and 200 rounds of ammo or $500 for just the rifle and magazines. I am selling because I am trying to reduce the amount of calibers in my collection. You won't find this rifle cheaper combined with mags and ammo included. I also have 300 additional rounds of ammo I will sell for $70 if you buy the rifle.   You can contact me by the reply email or text me at 724seven146020. I am also willing to ship the rifle at the buyers expense (I will ship direct to PA citizen or an FFL for any other state.)

From Springfield Website: ""The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.

Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™. ""

Ok.  Seriously considering trading something of mine for an FN 5.7 pistol or other high quality firearms. Sig Sauer etc. Considering my AR engraved stag lower with the 2nd amendment, cmmg parts kit, magpul grip and CTR stock. Stag 16"" upper flat top, LPGB, bushnell red/green T dot. Yankee hill rear flip up magpul mbus front flip up , single point bungee sling.  About 300 rounds through it maybe 400. Cleaned and maintained after each use.  Only wanna talk trades for an FN 5.7 pistol not really interested in selling it. Value would be in the $1100 range with 3 pmags and 100 rounds included. In Overland Park kansas so if you're in MO and we strike a deal you can bring your pistol here to an Ffl to complete both transactions being mine is a LG. I can go up with cash or more mags and ammo if you have something I want. Thanks for looking.

$600 firm or would consider a trade for Sig Sauer P226 or P229 (9mm) or P220 Carry (45 ACP) and have some $$ to boot. Would also consider trade for XDM, FN FNX or FNS, or maybe Sig P938. No trades for .40 S&W, please. Would prefer 9mm but would consider 45 ACP in a few models. 

This is a high-end gun designed for conceal carry by Sig and is $950 new on Bud's, so no low-ball offers please.

959,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3863959,For Sale:  Savage Model 10 Predator 260 Rem,"Bentonville, Fayetteville, Arkansas","$ 1,000","Listed On: Monday, January 5, 2015",Rifles,Savage Arms                                                                                ,260 Remington                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Had this rifle a little over a year. Calling it a tack driver is an understatement. I reload, I've found that it REALLY likes the Nosler 100 and 120gr Ballistic Tips. I also found out that mature does do NOT like the 120gr Ballistic Tip. It turned her lungs to mush from 130 yards. I hate to get rid of this rifle. The 260 Rem is my all time favorite cartridge. You can size brass easily from 243, 7mm-08, and 308 (the parent cartridge). It sends a very ballistic coefficient bullet out past 1000 yards with the same flight path as a 300 Win Mag, but with far less recoil and money. Its the ultimate short action cartridge for everything from the Elk and below here in North America. You can load 85gr Sierra HP's all the way up to 142gr match/soft points depending on what you're after. Its very versatile. 

Anyways, I'm rambling. It sits below a set of Leupold rings, attached to a Nikon Monarch 4-16x40 scope. Its a very very clear scope on par with my Leupold VX3's. I've shot this rifle out to 550 yards with ease and that's not even stretching it. 

This will make somebody a very fun deer/coyote rifle or simply paper punching. Savage is known for exceptional accuracy and its true. It comes with the Accustock and Accutrigger standard in this rifle. 

$1000 takes it all. Its in exceptional condition and well worth the money. I've decided to take on a new AR15 SPR project and its proving quite costly. My loss is your gain.

Give me a call or text, we can work out a deal, I also have loaded bullets available tuned to this rifle. I can also ship this to your FFL if you're not local, we can split the cost. This is a turn key operation. Thanks"
