Any questions shoot me a txt. No calls please. REDACTED. 180 obo is what I'm looking for. I can accept paypal too if that helps. If you have any other knives lemme know and maybe a trade can happen with boot going both ways. Thanks

The gun is Semi automatic  Built on original US GI parts that were modified by Israeli Military industries to operate in .308 caliber. This gun was built by John McGuire master gunsmith. The 1919A4 is recognized as the finest weapon of this type being built today by the finest builder known today. This gun comes with the A6 kit which allows you shoulder fire the gun or take the stock off and fire it off of the bipod. The gun also comes with 3 100-150 round cloth belts. The gun has had one 25 round belt run through it to test it and thats it. The gun is so tight (as a new gun should be) it needs to be oiled and then fired. This gun will last forever and you will never get tired of it. I also have tracer and ball ammo that can be purchased separate from this listing.

The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.
The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.
The M6A2 SPR comes with two individual rails that can be used to install a forward vertical grip and a tactical light. A third individual rail is also provided that is specifically designed to accommodate a quick release sling mount. Included in this add-on rail is a small wrench and set of screws to ensure the proper installation of each individual rail to your rifle.

I also have a stainless .270 barrel for sale for $125 . I bought this new a few years ago. Shot maybe 40 rounds. Functions great but does show some wear on stock and forend, as you can see in pics.

Comes with Nikon Prostaff 3-9 X 40 scope with Bullet Drop Compensator

Here's some details.

The new APEX is, quite frankly, the best break-action, multi-barrel interchangeable rifle system on the market today. Just by shouldering the APEX, the serious shooter will notice a vast superiority to its competitors in both balance and fit. But the real test comes with the shooting. And it is in the shooting that two very important features make the APEX really shine.

First, every APEX barrel is made by Bergara Barrels™, which provide a level of accuracy performance that is unequaled by any muzzleloader on the market today – due to its premium, custom quality. These Bergara Barrels, all made of the highest quality 416 grade stainless steel, have quickly become recognized as some of the most accurate production barrels in the world. And while many of the world's most highly regarded center-fire manufacturers use Bergara barrels on their guns, only CVA offers them in a muzzleloader. It is these Bergara barrels that enable CVA to guarantee our APEX series muzzleloading rifles to be the ""The Most Accurate Muzzleloader You've Ever Shot -- Or Your Money Back."" (Click for guarantee details)

Second, APEX’s ambidextrous butt stock is designed specifically for scope shooting, with a height of comb that positions the shooter perfectly in line with the optics. The result is a rifle that shoulders and points as naturally as your favorite shotgun – just like it’s an extension of your body.

As for versatility, the APEX can be quickly and easily set up with a wide range of Bergara Barrels in 15 different muzzleloading and center-fire calibers. Plus, every APEX features CVA’s trigger guard actuated breeching mechanism, which is extremely simple to operate. And its innovative trigger design provides an incredibly clean, crisp pull that is adjustable from approximately 3 to 4.75 pounds. And for ease of cleaning, the APEX features the patent pending CVA QRBP (Quck Release Breach Plug); the only such system that really works after the gun is fired. Every APEX also includes a Quake® Claw® sling and a custom DuraSight® Z-2 Alloy™ rail mount.

>>>> Caldwell LEAD SLED Recoil-Eliminating Shooting Rest <<<<
New in the box - never assembled. Model 820216

A LEAD SLED is a strong, steel device that holds a rifle, slug gun or other high-power gun in place as you shoot. This tool takes the recoil of the shot, protecting your shoulder and eliminating the instinct to flinch, which can ruin your aim. If you are a veteran shooter with a bad shoulder, or a beginning shooter learning to perfect your form, the lead sled can protect you from injury.
HOW TO USE
1. Place the lead sled on a platform that comes to the level you would like to shoot, or on the ground if you wish to take a shot lying on your stomach. The lead sled itself is only about a foot tall from the bottom tray to the gun holder.
2. Place your 25 pound bags of lead shot (or sand) in the tray at the bottom of the lead sled. These bags add weight and help the lead sled take the recoil of the shot.
3.Place the butt of the rifle in the back pad. Place the front of the gun in the front pad. This placement should be comfortable when you are holding the butt of the rifle with your dominant hand and holding it on the neck with your supporting hand.
4. Turn the dial in the middle of the lead sled to raise or lower the position of the gun. Once again, this should be at a comfortable height when in shooting position. Tighten the center lock when you have the gun in its correct position.
5. Load your gun, come to aim with the help of the lead sled and fire. Lead sleds take approximately 90 percent of the recoil. If you still feel significant recoil, you may not have placed the gun properly in the sled."

Working the action, it feels much sturdier when compared to a new 870 with the same size barrel. It has a 20 inch barrel with rifle sights and an extension giving 7 in the tube and one in the chamber for 8 total shots. It is a Parkerized finish. 
 I purchased this gun for a home defense weapon and wanted my 104 pound wife to be able to handle it also so I put a new Black Hawk Sped Ops recoil reduction stock on it to shorten it and cut down on the recoil. While she can handle the recoil, it's still a bit too heavy for her to handle comfortably. 
It shot very well when I grouped it with Winchester Military OO buck. Opening quickly from 5 to 10 yards to about 6-10 inches, nice for close, quick, poor light conditions, but still kept all 9 in a silhouette target at 25 yards. With Federal Truball Vita-Shok slugs, I sighted it to hit the center of a 6 inch target at 25 yards (3 inches high). When I backed off to 100 and held 6 o'clock it hit exactly at 6 o'clock in the black. Can't expect more than that from open sights with a rifle. 
I put an MI Garand sling on it and it works nicely with the quick release sling swivels. I will also include the original wood furniture though there is a small crack in the pistol grip that I would pin if I were to use it. No problem with the pump grip. All the sighting in was done with the wood on, not the new Black Hawk stock.

Action is tight and typical S&W smooth. This gun came from the California Department of Corrections and has a CDC serial number professionally stamped on the left side of the frame. These guns were used by wardens and staff officers so they were carried lightly and fired infrequently for qualifications. Comes with new Pachmayr Compac Pro grips with exposed backstrap. This compact gun will make a good concealed carry or home defense weapon and is very accurate for a snubbie. Sorry, no box or papers. Price shown is for a face to face cash sale in the Aiken area."

The wood is also in great condition with use marks one would expect form a depression era hunter.  This is one of the more desirable Winchesters with the crescent metal butt stock, Williams style side mounted adjustable peep sight, and saddle ring.

I am asking $1,200 (no trades please) for the rifle and 200 rounds of ammo.  The ammo is $28 per box at Green Top.  My price for this deal is $20 per box. I will include a .50 cal ammo can with the deal.  Without the rifle I have no need for the ammo and therefore not willing to separate.  I believe I have the rifle and ammo priced slightly below value and therefore the price is pretty firm.  The only reason I am selling is to fund a father daughter project.

When St. Louis City PD switched from .38s to the 9mm Beretta, a group purchase was offered to the officers for a couple of different S&W 9mms for off duty use.  This 6946 is one of those weapons.  Stainless steel, Trijicon sights and DA only.  Like the Beretta, it was also designed, per SLMPD, to shoot with the magazine removed.  It even has a caution on the side of the weapons stating just that.  The idea was for these weapons to be as close as possible to the Berettas carried by the City officers while on duty.  Other than the unique features, there is nothing that signifies that this weapon was a special purchase. (i.e. no SLMPD stamping or Police Use Only engraving)

This is one of those rifles that you can tell it's an heirloom quality piece just by the way it feels. It has a solid Walnut stock with beautiful cut checkering. The barrel is 20.5"" long and heavy profile. The action is super smooth. The trigger is extremely light. It is by far the most accurate 22LR that I've owned. That list includes Savage, Ruger, Marlin, and Browning rifles. 

This gun is perfect for bench shooting and varmint hunting. 

One thing to note about the 455 series is that if you want to switch barrels or calibers all you need to do is buy the barrel kit and swap it out. The receiver, stock, and bolt will work with 22lr, 22WMR, and 17HMR barrels. 

It comes with what you see. The rifle and the original 5 round CZ magazine. 

Other than a few small dings in the stock, it's in good shape. 

This gun is $420 on Bud's. That doesn't include the FFL transfer fee. I'm asking $350 OBO. 

I might be open to trades, but I'd prefer cash. I'm only selling because I need the space.
