The gun was hardly shot because he had arthritis and was unable to shoot .45, hence why I have it.  Seriously, this dude was old and frail, not sure why he had it.....  From what he told me it has set in a case and in his safe.  The only thing that makes this gun not in PRISTINE condition is, I guess his arthritis gave him issues when putting the gun together because there is an idiot scratch from the slide stop.  It is not a deep scratch where it has damaged the metal.  Just rubbed off the coating.  Unless you are looking, you wont even see it.  

I went to the range and put two boxes of shells through it.  Its is a colt, its a tight fitted frame/slide, provided great groups, and is reliable enough to eat ANY type of ammo.  4 mags included. Speed loader included.  Old man sold it to me without grips so i ordered a pair of vz grips.



The gun is up for trade.  I have to many 1911's and I am more attached to my 70 series gold cup.  Make sure your trade value is around $1000-$1100.  Interested in CARRY pistols. I would like something new to rotate in my carry pistols.

This gun has been sitting in my dad's closet for many years. He is getting on in years and recently decided to thin the herd. He used to shoot trap with this shotgun when I was a kid. Those days are long gone and so are his days shooting trap. Don't know when the last time it was fired. Could be decades ago. Will need to be cleaned and inspected before firing again.

Check out my other listings. They are all my dad's guns. Compare my prices and you will see they are much lower than others on any website. I will pay up to $50 towards shipping and handling. The shotgun will be professionally packaged in bubble wrap and shipped UPS Ground.

Call me if you would like to talk. Will gladly ship to your FFL. Thanks for looking.

UPDATE: This shotgun has now been inspected by a professional with many years experience on these Brownings. Lock up is tight. This is a fine firearm. These shotguns routinely sell for $1500+."

We at Vintage Firearms buy every sound, viable one we can find for our customers. This gun, sn200517 built in 1915, was purchased as a gun to clean up and restore. We only buy guns for this purpose that are sound and will make a near perfect restoration...or why bother, right? I have decided to list this gun as it is because we are backlogged in our work and there are guys out there just looking for a good shooter at a good price, and that is what this gun is. One of about 2400 total A Grade Fox 20 gauge guns made, and produced during the time when some of the best Fox guns were made, it has a good amount of honest wear on it. Also a bit unusual is that it was ordered for heavier loads, with its 28"" #2 weight barrels and weighing 6 1/2lbs. It is still light for a 20ga. but has F/F chokes and a minimum barrel wall thickness of 36 thou, so if it comes to late season pheasants or any heavier load, this is the gun. We can alter the chokes for you if requested, and in fact if you like the gun, we can do any part of the restoration you may desire. Once the gun belongs to a customer and needs attention, we go right to work on it, so any work requested will be done within a few months. The gun is ready to hunt just as she sits, and you can pretty her up a little at a time as the budget allows. A great Fox at an affordable price, with great stock dimensions for modern shooters."

 You like guns?
 You want to continue to own guns here in Virginia?
Or would you like to see Virginia go the way of states like New York with strict gun control that doesn't work.
We have a Governor here whos campaign was financed by billionaire Micheal Bloomberg, one of the most anti-gun Americans in the country. Governor McAuliffe has plans for gun control. Other law makers have plans for gun control too.
YOU CAN STOP THEM!!!!

Look ..... We have one day of the year when we can let the law makers of this state know where we stand on gun control.
And the anti-gun people in this state will also use this day to push for gun control.
We need to outnumber the gun control people on this one day.

That day is Monday January 19th  2015. 
Its LOBBY DAY at the General Assembly Building in Richmond.
Lobby Day is always on Martin Luther King jr Day, a holiday. Parking in the area is good. Kids are off school, bring them, its educational and they need to be seen too. Bring the wives.
Virginians can lobby their lawmakers for anything they want.
We need to be there to lobby them for GUN RIGHTS!!!!!
The anti-gun people will be there to lobby them for GUN CONTROL.
We need to outnumber them and make more noise. 
If they get their foot in the door on gun control we are in trouble.

What can you do?  JUST SHOW UP. The VCDL will be there organizing groups. If you wish you can go into the General Assembly building and let your lawmakers know where you stand on gun rights and encourage them to support gun rights because gun control doesn't work.
Take a look at these links to the crazy laws that are being pushed.

H. Heiser triple loop holster. By the markings on the holster it is a #512 ca. 1910 to 1925. The 5 denotes that the holster is baset weave. It is a very pleasing brown and is a little stiff. The leather does need cleaned but I wanted the new owner to do clean it. The holster is right handed and it came with a 1st generation Colt SAA that I bought. The problem is it doesn't do me any good because I am a lefty. These Heiser holsters have become very collectable and bring crazy money. I'm not looking for that. I would be willing to trade this one for a top quality dark brown left handed holster for a SAA with a 5.5 inch barrel and cash or even a complete left handed rig or double rig.

Here's the breakdown:

-DTA SRS Gen I chassis
-OD Green
-monopod

-.308 kit:

-22"" fluted barrel
-factory brake
-bolt
-1 mag
-Exactly 380rds. 168 and 175 FGMM only

-.338LM kit:

-26"" fluted barrel
-factory brake (not shown)
-thread protector
-bolt
-1 mag
-Zero rounds. I am the second owner of this rifle. It was purchased from a friend. I have no reason to doubt him. I have never even installed it.

-EXTRAS:

-custom bolt knobs from a member here. One of each kind he made. Originals included.
-custom butt pad from a member here
-Atlas bipod with QD lever and custom, sharp as fuck, SS feet.
-DTA factory soft case with shooting mat. Mint (except for some cat hair. Sorry)
-Operators Kit

-Some other factoids:

-Rifle was sent back to DTA when I first bought it to have the monopod installed. While it was there, they went through every screw and spring and replaced anything that looked out of spec. The trigger is very nice.

-As some sharp eyed members might notice, I had a small section of the top 1913 rail professionally machined off . When I had my S&B 5-25 mounted in a Spuhr mount, the objective bell touched the rail. It looks fine, like I said it was professionally done by my gunsmiths. The rail is of course, easily replaceable.

-The rifle has a couple of safe marks but is in very good shape. I'd rate it 95%.

I know it's Gen I. You all know it is still heavily supported. And as long as you don't try to install the barrel like you're dropping clothespins into a milk bottle (I may have dated myself), the pin system is fine.

-I actually love this rifle. It was my first high end bolt action as I am relatively new to the hobby. But I just got my first Surgeon Scalpel and I have an EDM .338LM/.408CT, so I really don't need this. I am not a collector, I'm more of a get the one, best gun I can for what I want to do. That said, if I never sell it, no big deal. It's that nice.

-TERMS:

-NO TRADES at this time please
-MUST go from me to your FFL . NO exceptions.
-I will NOT separate anything at this time, especially the little goodies I know some of you are eyeing. ;)
-If for whatever reason you purchase the rifle and are not satisfied as to the stated condition, just return it and I will refund you all of your purchase price plus your return shipping and transfer fees. I know that's still a PITA but life is too short to get upset over metal and polymer. Fair as I can make it.
-I ship UPS Ground with tracking number to your FFL. Insurance and/or upgraded shipping is extra.
-I do not mind shipping all of the accessories directly to you separately. Some times, goodies get ""lost"" at gunshops. Like a black hole.

Very slight bluing wear at muzzle only.  Locks up tight, smooth light trigger action, very accurate.  This gun may have been carried, but I don't think it's been shot much.  According to serial number lists it was made in '52 or '53.  I did not get the original ""diamond"" grips when I bought it about ten years ago at Trail Creek, so it is equipped with very similar Altamont Magna type grips and a Tyler grip adaptor to maintain vintage style.  I think I have some other rubber grips around if that's what you prefer.  I've only fed it light hollow base target wadcutters since I've owned it.  Need money for doctor bills.
I don't have the ability to post pictures, but will drive a reasonable distance if you have a serious interest.

This is an original Polish PPS-43C in a semi-auto version in the 9mm caliber. It is considered a pistol due to overall length and the 10 inch barrel. The PPS-43C is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied.  This historical firearm has been re-designed to shoot from a closed bolt position.  The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard.  The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel.  The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type.  The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake.  This firearm is an ATF approved pistol.  The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position. 
It comes with 4-35 rd mags, a sling, case, and a Zombie Stryke Green Laser from NcStar. It is super easy to clean. It come apart in three pieces only.
I have shot aluminum, brass and steel ammo. It all cycles fine. This is fun weapon to shoot, it attracts a lot of attention at the range and is very accurate. The laser helps get you on target when shooting from the hip. I am not trying to make any money I'm just trying to recoup the money I have in it. If you are interested in this weapon give me a shout.

Controlled round feed with claw extractor. Most likely a Springfield 22"" barrel. Chambered in .30-06. Tasco 3-9x40 scope. Weaver rings. Pachmayr White Line butt pad. Leather sling.

This rifle has been sitting in my dad's closet for many years. He is getting on in years and recently decided to thin the herd. He says he acquired it from a friend in a trade years ago. Don't know when the last time it was fired. 

Rifle has a serial number, but no other markings. Probably a custom build. Because of that, I am selling it for the value of the action and nothing else. The wood stock shows lots of use, like scratches and wear marks. 

This rifle would need to be thoroughly cleaned and serviced before firing. Of all the firearms I am selling for my dad, I know the least about this one. That being said, I am pretty sure if it is loaded, the safety disengaged, and the trigger pulled, there will be noise and a flash at the muzzle.

Look at my other listings. Compare my prices to others out there. Call me if you would like to talk. Thanks for looking.

Growing up my father has always had a pre 63 Model 70 in 270, so when I graduated from college I had my first job and decided to built a custom version of that gun. I found the firearm that I was looking for, and gave it to a local gunsmith when I lived in Wisconsin. After about a month and a half, I received my firearm back, and it was better than I could have ever expected. I had him fit it with a custom laminate stock with a limbsaver pad mounted on it and he also bedded to the action. He also trued the action, and mounted a set of Leupold rings and one piece base. When I got it back, I had a cheap scope laying around, mounted that, and bought 2 boxes of core lokts to see what it can do, but never got around to trying it out. When I moved back home my father gave me his gun, and this one just sits. I have over $1500 invested in the gun. I also have the original stock for the gun to go along with it. The original stock is missing the pad on the back though. I am open to trades, but am looking for higher end firearms. If you have any questions feel free to ask me.

I bought this gun roughly a week ago with intentions to use it as a second carry pistol, however, I have changed my plans and am now wanting a new shotgun for trap shooting. As you can see from the pictures below, the pistol is brand new and in such condition. I am including in the sale the following items: M&P 40C, factory hard case with three backstraps and accompanying paperwork, one factory ten round magazine, one factory 15 round extended magazine, a used but nice right hand in the waist Don Hume leather holster, and a full box of Hornady Critical Defense ammo. I am looking more for a cash sale in order to purchase a new Mossberg 500 ported model. My bottom dollar firm no haggle cash price for the entire package is $400. This pistol new runs $485 plus tax so $515 new plus the holster and ammo so my price is more than fair. If you are offering a trade please keep in mind that the trade value will be higher. The only trades that I am interested in are the following: Remington 870 with field barrel and rifled slug barrel with rifles sights in 20 or 12 gauge, a Mossberg 500 with a rifled barrel and an 18.5"" barrel in 20 or 12 gauge, a Mossberg 500 12 gauge with a factory ported barrel in new condition, or I MAY entertain other pump shotgun offers. Please keep your offers and expectations real. I do not need window shoppers or those who want to voice their opinions on price. Also, please note, all scammers and insultingly low offers will be ignored. Again, my price is more than fair as are my trade preferences. If you are interested or would like further information and/or pictures please respond to ad. All buyers must present ID at time of sale/trade (fellow CCW holders preferred) meet within 15-20 minutes of the Mason area, cash only if buying, and legally be cleared to own a firearm in the state of Ohio.

As you know it's a rare ak to find, especially in Massachusetts, they stopped importing them in 94 thanks to the Clinton ban. The norinco and polytech guns were known and are still known to be of super high quality, pretty much the closest you can get to a full blown military select fire akm. It's had a couple thousand rounds fired through it by me since I've owned it over 4 years, and isn't lnib by any means, but it's a great solid shooter and will probably continue to for hundreds of years lol. Never ever had any issues with it whatsoever, and it's very accurate for an ak, I can take out clay pigeons all day at 100 and 200 yards with it, much much better the. The crappy wasr10 ""ak"".  It has a choate machine and tool dragonov polymer stock set on it now, but I have the origional wood thumb hole stock with it as well. I have a couple pre ban standard cap mags that will come with it as well. I'm looking to sell it for 1200 since I'd like to move it quick so I can buy my polytech lol.

This is a rare M44 that has all matching numbers as most Romanian M44 carbines rarely had matching numbers. Bore is excellent and the bluing has held up great. The stock needs refinished. It's common for these stocks to show more damage than others due to the quick production and quality of the wood. Only ~70,000 of these guns were made so this is definitely a great collector's piece and a great shooter. I will send pictures via email if requested. Thanks"

The BLACKOUT® flash suppressor is the most efficient design available. The proprietary features eliminate muzzle flash, even on CQB-length barrels. The BLACKOUT® is inherently stronger and more impact resistant than four prong designs, while not being subject to the rapid erosion of closed-ended units. A high strength corrosion-resistant aerospace alloy, and ultra-hard Nitride finish provide the highest level of durability. Military tested and selected. There are two different options for 5/8-24, a deep and standard socket. Deep socket is for .75"" barrels and smaller(profile behind the threads) and the standard socket fits all profiles."

I believe the rate of fire is around 800 rpm, possibly faster.  it is select fire : semi and full auto.  I dont know the original round count. I have fired it only on one occasion to check functionality and reliability.  and yes, it runs like a champ.  I never had one hiccup with the factory brass case ammo.  it is very fun in full auto mode but goes through the ammo quickly.  It comes with 4, 32 round magazines and a briefcase that has seen better days-thats what it came in when I bought it.  There are a few scuffs here and there but nothing major, mostl ikely they are from storage wear. This weapon has been well cared for and kept clean.  The price is what it is, there will be no negotiation. If youre not willing to pay it, then please move on.  I do not want any trades of any kind.  this weapon is for a cash sale only, no exceptions in the terms of the sale will be made for anyone for any reason.  the buyer is responsible for all transfer fees and the purchase of a class 3 tax stamp.  If you dont know whats all involved when buying a machine gun, I suggest you contact a qualified gun dealer or research it online.  There is a considerable amount of paperwork and a wait period.  The buyer must pay up front before the weapon is signed over to the dealer during the application process and no refunds will be given alothough I do guarantee this weapon works awesomely and is fun to shoot. can send pics of magazines with speedloader, and briefcase if needed."
