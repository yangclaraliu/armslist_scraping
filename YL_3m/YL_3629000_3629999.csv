Has turret caps, but one is fatigued. It hasnt completely broke, and I think a little glue will save it.  I also know these are collectible and better that I dont alter it.  Ill let the buyer decide that.
The scope is a US made, not Japan, and I think it is near a production date of 1973.
They range drastically in price, so contact me with something fair and we can negotiate.

This is a Madsen Model 1947 rifle, built by the Danes as part of a 1958 military contract for the Columbian Navy, as indicated by the markings on the chamber ring. This rifle is also known as the Columbian Model 1958. These rifles are often referred to as the “last bolt action military rifle”, as they were based on new engineering from scratch. Strangely, the Danes did not adopt this rifle as their own. Instead, they sold it to developing nations with limited budgets. The muzzle brake, upgraded sights and recoil pad are original.

Beretta J92M9A0M M9 9mm LTD 15+1 4.9"" Synthetic Black Grip Bruniton Barrel

From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women
of the U.S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two
decades of distinguished service and reliability. The Commercial M9 pistol
is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own.
This M9's distinctive military-style markings on various components closely
resemble those of the M9 pistols used by the U.S. Armed Forces, and its
""Dot-and-Post"" sight system clones that of the military M9. These two
features as well as the unique M9-prefixed serial number set this
Commercial M9 apart from the Beretta 92 FS pistol.

The Beretta 92 FS semi-automatic pistol operates on a short recoil, delayed
blowback system, leading to faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy, and
greater reliability. The chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion
resistance and ease of cleaning, and the deeply-recessed combat muzzle
crown protects the rifling. The open top slide virtually eliminates jamming
and stove piping and allows one cartridge at a time to be loaded should the
magazine be lost or damaged. The rear sight is designed to provide a front
projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide
single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table or
door. Beretta's exclusive Bruniton non-reflective black coating is a
superior corrosion and wear-resistant finish, and the reversible magazine
release is positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or
left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. The 92 FS pistol is the
most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history, and this model
is made in Italy.

The motor has been completely gone through. Bored 10 over. Due to that reason it is ran with a stronger gas oil mixture. The guy I got it from unhooked the auto oiler. Mainly because he doesn't trust them. He stated: He would rather replace a fouled plug as opposed to a piston job. A very fast, clean 4 wheeler. The only thing I noticed that needs attention is the ignition switch needs the screw cap to hold it in place and the back tires will soon need replacing. It does smoke slightly when running, But, that is due to the gas oil mixture. As I said the motor has been rebuilt. Things needed: Lawn and garden tractor, or a 16ft x 7ft heavy duty dual axel hauling trailer with 1 to 2 ft side rails. Must be in excellent shape.Things of trade interest. VW Beetles, Dune Buggies, older car truck projects a possibility. Larger 4 wheelers and or possibly Motorcycles. Titles are a must with cars, trucks and motorcycles. Contact me if you have something.

The Springfield Armory XD-S combines an ultra-slim profile (0.9"" wide) with
enhanced point-and-shoot performance, allowing for more accuracy and
greater control without having to adjust the wrist. This pistol features a
single-position Picatinny rail, low-profile rear and fiber optic front
sights, two interchangeable backstraps, and a deep-penetrating Melonite
finish that protects against corrosion. The XD-S also boasts multiple
safety features, including the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger
System, a loaded chamber indicator, and a grip safety. The disassembly
lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol, and when the
disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
These features come together to create a superior slim pistol, and the XD-S
comes with a durable rugged case and two stainless steel magazines.

Perfect function.  Among the most accurate production, S&W origin M41 ever seen.

Finish is about 95%, due to 2 areas of defect in the bluing on the left that are very hard to see in the photos and a third imperfect area at the pin above the grip area.  These are two light splotches of discoloration to the blueing on the left side and the area around the pin, that are very difficult to see.  An image with these enhanced and marked can be emailed if requested.

As a later A series gun, this one does NOT have a cocking indicator.

For those considering a Hammerli (Walther) Trailside or Xesses but who want a far more accurate and durable gun, this and the other S&W 41 are a ""must consider"" alternative.  Heavier than a plastic gun, they also are far more durable and more accurate.  Single stage trigger, but adjustable pull weight.

Includes SN matched box, but with no innards.  Please note, the gun has German proof marks, and US re-import marks.

FFL transfer only, even if buyer has an IL FOID card.

The early A series were made by S&W in their first if many transitional buyouts. The company had been taken over by Chris Craft / Bangor Punta at that time. Some drop in quality, but still excellent and among the best made in the USA.  This gun is slightly more accurate than the prior ""true"" S&W guns, and probably better than anything made in the next series guns and later.

These guns are ""similar"" to the Hammerli 208 and 212, and are based on the same original versions (Walther Olympia, itself based on the Reising Target Pistol most likely).

They are not as accurate as the 208, do not offer the adjustable trigger, but at least parts are easier to find.  Cost is about the same as the Hammerli 208 or Walther GSP.  This is the heavy barreled version, so feel is a bit heavier than the Hammerli 208 with an 80 gm weight.  Also, the barrel is a little shorter.

Two non-letter series (true Smith and Wesson before the sequence of take-overs) also available. Email for information. Price is higher, comes with SN matched box.

Other target guns (Hammerli, Walther, SIG-Hammerli P240, SAKO) also available. Please email if list is desired.

A detailed catalog of all of the several S&W41 (1 A series, two no letter guns) and additional high resolution images of this gun can be emailed, if you provide an email address.

The price and manufacturer are somewhat fluid- I would pay more for a Colt/ less for Taurus, etc. Also I have a Sig Sauer Mosquito 22lr semi auto pistol in desert digital camo that can be up for trade if needed. It is likely valued a little less than what I am looking for therefore I am willing to barter/ negotiate. just looking for something used/local. If anyone has a nice 357 for sale I am interested.

.32 ACP +P Ammo - 75 gr. Hardcast F.N. (1150fps/ M.E. 220 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box

The 32 ACP auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society as a defensive cartridge, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 32 ACP suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and examined nearly all available 32 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 32 ACP frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks sufficient penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face, with modern, frangible 32 ACP ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek. I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the pain, as that frangible bullet would have stopped somewhere in my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible bullet and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and won't know that part of his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So, whatever 32 ACP ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 32 ACP is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down instantly. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your loved ones, is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed this 32 ACP+P load to keep you and yours alive under the worst of scenarios.

This 32 ACP+P ammo will better all American made 32 ACP+P ammo by 110 fps to 150 fps with a heavier bullet than any other American made 32 ACP ammo.

Item 30A/20 is a 75gr. HARD cast bullet with a flat nose. It is traveling over 1,000 fps out of my 3.4 inch Beretta Mod. 70. We've used a flash suppressed powder so that you won't be blinded by your own gunfire in the dark. This is significant as well over 90% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light when the criminal element is out and about. Also, this flat nosed, nonexpanding, hard cast, bullet will penetrate deeply and will do much more damage than the typical round nosed FMJ bullet. Round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through living tissue, doing little damage as opposed to a flat nosed bullet. The flat nose not only wounds much more than a round nosed bullet, but it actually keeps the penetration straight and thus deeper. Notice the below velocities from my personal 32 ACP pistols. These are real world guns and thus the speeds are realistic and not the exaggerated speeds you'll see produced from laboratory test barrels. What you see with Buffalo Bore Ammo advertising, is truly what you get in the ""real world"" where it matters. You can expect 20+ inches of straight line penetration in flesh and bone with this load. If you are worried about over-penetration with this load, DON'T! You chose to carry a tiny under-powered 32 ACP pistol and the trade off is that now you are going to have to stay alive using this pistol and over-penetration will be the least of your worries if you end up needing this gun to save yourself or your family.

A. Berretta Mod. 70, 3 inch bbl.- 1001 fps

B. Kel Tek, 2.5 inch bbl - 910 fps

C. Seecamp, 2 inch bbl. - 856 fps

The above bullet speeds are 110 fps to 150 fps faster than the Winchester 71 gr. FMJ ammo on the American market. Not only is our bullet heavier than any other American made 32 ACP ammo, but it is moving about 15% to 20% faster - with that heavier bullet!

FlexTech® Technology Recoil reduction technology that features a soft touch comb that takes the bite out of muzzle rise, while the smooth surface finish allows the cheek to slide forward during firing. Over molded finger grooves in the stock and rubber grill pads in the forend give you firm control of the rifle in both wet and dry conditions. Sing swivel studs are molded into the stock and forend to eliminate the possibility of pulling out. T/C’s FlexTech® system is just one of the many advancements given to the new Pro Hunter.

I have another in fair condition and got so excited when I saw this one I bought it immediately to replace the other.  Of course, I don't really need it and will probably end up selling the other too.  I will try to get by with just my other four .45s. I would like to find a NAA revolver with both cylinders.  The Star PD is one of the earliest of compact high power handguns predating the polymers and providing a familiar feel to 1911 shooters, which were very common when it came out. It has an alloy frame and is in .45 ACP. The previous owner put friction tape on the front and rear of the grip, which feels good in the hand.  It is very much like a 1911, breaking down in similar fashion but without the grip safety.  (http://www.alpharubicon.com/leo/starpdserger.htm)  Jeff Cooper said it was a gun to shoot a little and carry a lot.  It is slim, light and trim.  It has an adjustable sight.  The bluing, which is too expensive for many new guns, is in very nice shape.  It seems very tight although I have not shot it.  Some of the internet self-appointed experts will say it is not as good as the almighty Glock (what could be) but the PD retains a faithful following among those who have actually had or fired one.

The new PPX M1 offers a smooth trigger, ambidextrous magazine release, rugged construction, and the famous Walther ergonomic grip. Walther Performance Design comes to the defense of your pocketbook. Similarities to the tried and true Walther 99 series pistols is obvious. The PPX, however, is hammer fired, as the photos will show; and its ambidextrous, easily reversible magazine release is button type not lever type like the 99s were. Disassembly lever, further, is somewhat Sig-gy-fied or Beretta-fied. Manufacturer is Carl Walther of Germany. Importer is Walther USA of Fort Smith, AR. Construction is high impact polymer frame with stainless steel slide, melonite coated steel barrel, and steel parts including the levers, releases, and .350 serrated face trigger. Trigger pull is a smooth, constant 6 1/2 pounds, and every shot is the same. Double action only or full time double action means the hammer does not stand in a cocked position. Hammer stays forward after the weapon is snapped. Barrel is 4 inch, made of 3 components, with 360 degree beveled chamber mouth, and with full length serrated polymer return spring guide. Sights are stake-on front, dovetailed rear anodized three dot. Height is 5.6 inches from the magazine floorplate to the top of the rear sight. Slide thickness is 1.185; 1.250 thickness at the frame’s levers. Grip frame is finger grooved front, attractive stippled texture for a positive grip in extreme weather. Weight empty is 27 ounces. Length is 7.3 inches from the muzzle to the rear. This pistol comes with two factory magazines, made by Mec-Gar with the Walther banner. Capacity is 16+1 rounds of 9mm ammunition. Walther, then, has produced an attractive, very well built service or defensive pistol with its PPX. Replacement pricing for similar pistols is in the $600 vicinity in our area. We’re offering the brand new Walther PPX M1 9mm in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 339.00. 2% discount if payment is with USPS Money Order & not credit card.

I have an STI Duty One 5.0 in 9mm for sale! It is a beautiful piece and hate to see it go, but I have a wedding to pay for.. It has gunsmith work by the one and only Mike Cyrwus, from Accurate Iron. Also has a Wilson Combat ambi-safety and a S&A magwell installed. It has around 500 rounds through it, so it's pretty much brand new.  It comes with all of the paper work, box, and original magazine.  I have 3 extra wilson combat mags and a Streamlight TLR-1Hl that the buyer can buy for an extra price.

Rossi shotguns are available in 12 and 20 gauge models, weighing just over 5 lbs, and a 4 lbs .410 bore, all accepting either 2 3/4"" or 3"" shells - Standard or Magnum. The .410 and the 20 gauge are offered in even lighter youth models scaled down to fit young shooters.

Unsure of upper manufacturer, but it came off  a Rock River gun I got in a trade many years ago. Lots of people are really hung up on the manufacturer of every piece and part these days. The gun does NOT have M4 feed ramps (due to its age). The upper/lower finish match up fairly well in spite of the age difference. Very interested in trades toward high-end handguns (HK/Walther/Sig/etc.) with boot going either way to make it work.  This gun would be a perfect platform for someone to finish their customized.
