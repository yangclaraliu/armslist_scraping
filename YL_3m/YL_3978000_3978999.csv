This gun was made in the late  70's and is in really nice shape. These gen 1 revolvers are much better and more sought than the current models because of these reasons. Weight Only 16 Ounces.Yet here's real durability, for the frame, cylinder, barrel and all critical moving parts are made of chrome-moly machined steel. Weight saving alloys are used only for non-critical parts.6 Inches Long, 4 Inches High. The Undercover is a pleasure to carry. The silhouette is thin and the butt nicely rounded. Unbreakable Firing Pin. The pin is made of indestructible beryllium copper. Add to that the flame hardened breech face. Hammer Blocked For Safety. This feature means absolute assurance against firing unless the trigger is in full rear position. It won't fire even if it's dropped. 8 Groove Rifled Barrel Instead of the conventional 6, 8 grooves help achieve an unusually high degree of accuracy. Rapid Fire Capability. A very short double and single action aided by a 55 degree hammer arc plus a minimum travel trigger pull are distinctive features. $350, call or text REDACTED"

***PhaZZer® Does Not require a background check, activation, or registration (per ATF and U.S. DOJ) except where required by law.  Products are operational immediately upon receipt.



PhaZZer® Enforcer Conducted Energy Weapon (CEW) is a less lethal law enforcement-level self-defense weapon that provides a similar effective take-down power as any Electronic Control Device (ECD) on the market. The Enforcer CEW features an enhanced safety circuit, simplicity of use, comfort, effectiveness, reliability, and consistency at a cost-effective price. PhaZZer® Enforcer offers the following product advantages over the competition:

·    PhaZZer® Enforcer has implemented a ""safety shut down circuit technology"" that automatically shuts the CEW down at the end of the 3rd five second trigger application or when aggregate exposure to the body exceeds 15 seconds. Most up to date medical studies have indicated that this is the new benchmark for standardizing guidelines for responsible and reasonable usage of CEWs deploying into a live target. The safety shut down circuit can be can be overridden by the user by simply recycling the safety switch to disarm, then back to armed mode in a split second. This design is meant to create a psychological awareness during high stress self-defense and/or public safety situations and will limit liability to the user, LEO and/or Agency.

PhaZZer® has taken a different approach for the Enforcer battery system compared to competitive brands. Enforcer CEW contains a rechargeable and replaceable 7.2 Volt Lithium Ion Battery System that allows for approximately 3000, five second electric shock deployments for the lifespan equating to substantial savings for each weapon compared to battery replacement needs through competitive products. (We suggest you see what was spent in your department or agency on Taser® battery purchases in 2011/2012 and that is the amount you will save in battery purchases going forward).
PhaZZer® Enforcer has received a positive response to the high intensity LED light compared to the Taser® X26®, or Taser® M26®, Taser® models which have a low illumination output LED. The superior Enforcer LED flashlight ultimately eliminates the need to use a separate flashlight in dark areas leaving the operator's other hand free to keep on a sidearm as a backup.
PhaZZer® Enforcer CEW is a more cost effective option than the Taser® X26. While retaining all of the physical qualities, highest quality components, core capabilities, and top of the line workmanship of Taser® ECDs, you will find that our CEW program will provide a police department, security firm, bail bond agency or individual with MSRP savings of approximately 40% in comparison to the Taser® X26 which is the primary ECD of choice preferred by most in the United States LE market.

I am selling my Smith and Wesson 99 Compact in .40sw.
The gun is in excellent condition and has less than 200 rounds thru it.  I just had the slide coated in Cerakote Graphite Black, picked it up this week.  It looks fantastic.   The frame is in great shape.  Overall the pistol is in excellent cosmetic and  functional condition.  

Let's be very clear...the SW99C is virtually identical to the Walther P99C.  The primary difference is the Walther has a square trigger guard and the SW99C has the rounded trigger guard.  This model is a very early production one.  What this means is that it has the very desirable Walther Made frame (German built) and it is stamped ""Made in Germany"".  The slide is the only part stamped Smith and Wesson.  Later models were made entirely by Smith.  This model has the AS (anti stress) two stage trigger and it's very nice and very smooth.  

Pistol comes with two genuine Walther Mags both are 8 round.  One has the finger rest, the other is flush fit.  

Price is $450.  No trades, sorry.  I prefer cash, but I can take Visa/MC but it's 2.5% more to cover fees.  Msg me with any questions.  I will ship but only to an FFL and I must have a copy of the FFL holders license before I will ship.

Next up is a 1946 Izzy M44. This rifle is beautiful. All numbers match and are easily visible. Bore is nice and shiny with sharp rifling. This thing shoots true though I will say the bolt is just a touch sticky.

It has a factory synthetic stock which is practically brand new as well the original wood stock, a factory stainless steel barrel and a full aluminum receiver and trigger assembly, not the cruddy newer plastic ones. I have stripped and cleaned off the black paint to reveal a very nice polished aluminum look which really makes the gun look great! I have also performed the auto bolt release modification which is a great upgrade! I have a Ruger BX25 mag as well as the original 10 round mag. I have a stainless aluminum scope mount base as well as aluminum scope mounts which attach the 4x32 power Bushnell scope. 

Looking for a nice .17hmr, .223, .243, .270, 30-06, .308 or other guns.
Located in Stanton, work in Grand Rapids.
Thanks for looking!

PS. I can only load 1 pic due to file size. I have several more available that can be emailed or sent to text apon request.

It will also come with an OWB factory holster and hard case. In addition to the factory 6rd mag I have added a 7rd extended mag (which was $40) with pinky rest which makes it much more comfortable at the range. This is a great pistol I have only put 150rds of 115g fmj and 40rds of Speer gold dot 147g jhp down the pipe. This pistol has been well maintained and has had zero non-staged malfunctions so 100% reliable thus far. Its a very nice compact pistol with a great single action trigger which makes it extremely accurate for such a small package. The only reason I'm letting it go is its a bit small for what I like.

Its a winchester model 69a bolt action rifle. Shoots .22lr , .22 long , and .22 short. Comes with 1, 5 round mag. The mags are pretty available on ebay , u can find 10 rd ers as well. 

The bluing is basically 100%, as is the condition of the stock. (Has original buttplate as well) Could of even be re blued way back when. I cant believe how minty it all is. Shoots perfect and is beyond accurate. No pitting or rust . Few minor scratches on stock. You would have no idea this gun was from the 30s!. This is a real find. 

What makes this rifle extra special is that it was made in a short run of these that werent made with a serial number on them (somtime in the 1930's). This increases its desirability to collectors and value by quite a bit. No dros or ffl transfer is necessary for this gem. Cash and carry ( this is just about the only scenario you can still do this) 
This Rifle isnt just a safe queen or a wall hanger ,, if youre looking for a perfect shooting .22 bolt this will fit the bill and definitely last many generations to come! 

was quoted by a collector this thing could easily go for 5-600$ for this run of the model 69a and its condition. So send me fair trades with pics!

Must meet face to face in orange county.

13"" Black Rail.

Description: ""The Troy Industries AR-15 Alpha Battle Rail is a modular, free floating handguard that incorporates light weight, strength, simplicity and versatility into a slim, aesthetically pleasing package. Building off of the legendary TRX Extreme design, the Alpha Rail maintains the distinctive look and feel of the original, but utilizes a vastly improved low profile locking mechanism for installation onto the host rifle. The new locking system makes use of the factory barrel nut, meaning its removal is no longer necessary. 

The Alpha Rail is constructed of 6061-T6 aircraft grade aluminum that is finished with a mil-spec hard coat anodizing for durability. With a full length top rail and the ability to accept modular rail sections along the handguard's circumference, the Alpha Rail is highly configurable by the end user and able to accommodate any number of tactical accessories with ease. Each handguard comes complete with 3 detachable rail sections and all of the necessary hardware. Made in the USA.""

For sale is my Norinco SKS with original wood stock and bandolier belt. The gun is complete with all matching serial numbers which make it rare in the collectors market. I also prefer Norinco to Yugo sks models because the Norinco models have a chrome barrel that is anti rust. There is literally 0 rust on this gun and it shoots extremely well with tight groupings at 100 yards with the built in iron sights. I bought the gun at a gunshow in the 90's and have had it ever sense. It's in perfect condition. 

Gun also comes with the following : 

-50 round clip 
-original 10 round mag
-4 new boxes tuula ammo
-2 boxes Norinco ammo 
-rail mount 
-bandolier belt 
-sport stock


Am willing to trade for: 

-Nice semi auto shotgun or over/under
-AR-15 (which I would be open to throwing in some cash for difference)"
