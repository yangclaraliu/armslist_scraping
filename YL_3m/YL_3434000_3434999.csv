I purchased this new a few years back and haven't used it enough to justify keeping it.
Less than 300 rounds through it, and I am concentrating on long guns now. 
In excellent condition. Comes in original box with all the original paperwork, and the original factory magazine. 
I prefer cash, face to face with a bill of sale.  If you need me to ship it, we can do an ffl transfer through my local gun shop to yours.
You pay for the shipping and the ffl transfer.

e-mail me if you have any more questions.

I will also include around 60 hollow point rounds for it. I love this gun and am only trading it because I would like to try something different. I would like to trade the gun for another type of handgun but I would be open to all kinds of trades. No bolt action or hunting rifles though. Let me know what you have and I will consider it. I would also be willing to add cash to the sale on my part if your trade is worth more than mine and I like it enough. Worst I can say is no!? I will sell it outright as well for $525.

Additional Info:
Insight Technology's AN/PSQ-18 Day Night Sight (DNS) is an enhanced weapon sight and fire-control system designed for the M203 400 mm Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL). The DNS provides improved firing accuracy over the current quadrant and leaf sight systems for both point and area targets, from 35 to 400 m. Advanced worm gear technology coupled to a real-time data display allows for quick and accurate adjustment in 5 m increments.The DNS attaches to the M203, sliding over the barrel and connecting to the launcher tube to maximise boresight accuracy. It comes with an additional MIL-STD-1913 rail interface, which can be attached to either the top or side of the unit for the use of optical sights or laser aiming devices.For night operation, the DNS incorporates two co-aligned infra-red lasers for precise aiming and target illumination. The DNS provides cant information to the operator, and, in day mode, a bi-colour LED illuminates green when the DNS is oriented vertically and red when canted left or right. During night operations, conducted with Night-Vision Goggles (NVG), the DNS aiming laser will pulsate when canted and will become steady when vertically oriented.A mechanical range scale provides manual adjustment in 20 m increments for firing without a battery or in backup mode. The M203 AGL retains its rate-of-fire of five to seven rounds per minute. The operator can select from five operational modes and has been tested against US Military environmental specifications."

I'm interested in trading my highly sought after (in certain circles) .357 Target Model.

By my estimation in my family history and a little help from the folks at the Dan Wesson forum, I've got it pretty close to early 77'. As a picture can say a thousand words, I've included 3000 words for your viewing pleasure and as you'll see there's nothing hindering the beauty emanating from it!

Being previously owned, I have to list this gun “as new”, however it can easily pass for new. I acquired this exceptional weapon at an estate sale, and the heirs said it has less than 100 rounds through it. Suggested retail on this gun is $1,459.00. Dealer cost is $1,125.00, and make sure you add 15-20% profit margin. I am asking only $1050. A savings of over $300.00! Please contact me regarding availability as I have this listed on two other sites.

Walther's P22 is one of the most popular rimfire handguns in history. This polymer framed gun has some of the best ergonomics of any pistol and is a joy to shoot.

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

Its not custom if you piece all the parts together from whatever you can't find. Nor does it make it more valuable. You will never get your money back from something you bought retail. If you list your rifle higher in price than a LaRue tactical or an LWRC, you are smoking crack. I don't care what cool guy paint job you have or what shitty off brand scope or bipod you put on it, hell you could put everything you can find, I'm still only concerned about the rifle. Guys if you are looking for a rifle and don't know much about AR-15s ask, or look up forums. Spikes, bushmaster, DPMS, Olympus Arms, DEL-TON, these are all bottom of the barrel everyday lowers and uppers. Thats just a small list, I could go on. Nothing wrong with them, they work fine if you want a truck gun, plinker, SHTF, but by no means should you pay over $650 unless it was A LOT of high end after market parts, like name brand triggers, free float hand rails, compensators, and buttstock. Still I wouldn't pay over $1200-!400 depending on what you get. Do yourself a favor and look to buy a matching set, they usually fit better, i.e. upper and lower. I have built my own and guess what, I sold it cause it wasn't near as nice as my LaRue. AND i should it to a friend at a loss, right in the middle of the AR scare of 2013."

Please stop buying over priced ammo and guns on this site... 

It is disgusting what some of you are asking people to pay for ammo that is now available in most stores and online. Seriously I was able to walk into Walmart the other day and they had 1000rd boxes of 22LR for $52.00, not $100.00 that I see people trying to sell here.  BTW - Dicks Sporting Goods, Bill Jacksons and Gander Mountain almost always have 22LR in stock you just have to ask because they do keep it behind the counter.

And some of the unrealistic prices I see on guns.... I am sorry but just because you bought a gun you don't like anymore, does not make it worth more than you paid. A gun is like a car it depreciates in value until it become a collectable, and not all do.... 

My best advice is to do some research before you buy firearm. A quick Internet search should tell you what the price is for a new gun and if it is lower than the price someone is trying to sell you a used one for.... well you get the point. 

Sorry to vent but I am tired of seeing these ridiculous prices."

Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands.

This listing is for ONE magazine; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. New York City requires written permission from NYPD for magazine shipments. The Raven MP-25 saw its heyday from its introduction in the early 1970s until it singlehandedly cornered the cheap 25 market and fizzled by the early 1990s when a fire destroyed Mr. George Jennings’s original manufacturing facility in California. Since then, the Raven style has been duplicated by kindred companies Phoenix and Bryco. With over 2 million manufactured, the Raven is still a considerable part of the firearm population in the United States; and when dealers like us get them and their magazine is lost, we can’t sell them. Hence our stocking the Triple K Manufacturing company’s magazines. Construction is solid blue steel magazine body, steel springs and steel floorplate and follower actually constructed better than the originals. This magazine holds 6 rounds of .25 ACP or 25 Automatic Ammunition. Triple K, with almost 70 years in business, advertises their magazines as Bench Tested, with Perfect Feed Springs. Like all new products, these magazines come with a factory warranty from Triple K Manufacturing, 2222 Commercial Street, San Diego, CA 92113. We’re offering these Triple K Magazines each for only $ 24.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City.

I have an Alexander Arms 6.5 Grendel M4 carbine that has been test fired with 20 rounds of Hornady 123grn AMAX. The carbine has a 14.5 barrel (believed to be made by Sabre Defense) with a welded and pinned 1.5inch flash hider to bring this to the legal minimum limit of 16 inches.  Alexander Arms has discontinued the production of this type of upper and barrel length. The value of the carbine is $1499.00 approximately as they no longer offer this barrel length. The carbine comes with a silicon cleaning cloth, instruction manual, (1) ten round magazine, brand new rear Troy Back Up Iron Sight, and KNS anti-rotation pins. If you are concerned about ammo or magazines. I have two boxes of 123 grain Hornady AMAX and four Alexander Arms branded magazines that would be added to the offer. If you live in Colorado then I can only supply the ten round magazine. Same thing for those of you behind enemy lines in other draconian states (New York-Mass, Ect). The ammo is still in the case it was shipped in and is valued at $24.00 per box of twenty and the magazines are worth $20.00 each. If you decide that this offer is something you would like to move forward with then I will ship the carbines through my FFL to your FFL. I do have multiple photos to be emailed to you if you are interested.
 I want to thank you for taking the time to read and consider this, if you have any questions please email me and let me know."

An earlier model that is NOT subject to the factory trigger recall, this unique rifle comes with synthetic stock/stainless action and barrel, detachable mag, beautiful scroll engraved receiver and jewelled bolt, and even has stainless sling swivel studs! Trigger internals have been polished by a gunsmith according to the previous owner (pull has not been lightened) resulting in one of the crisper, cleaner trigger breaks of any rifle I've owned! There are a few light use marks on the stock and barrel, but is in overall great condition. Comes topped with a set of blued Leupold rings/bases and an awesome Leupold VX3 2.5-8X36 scope with factory soft cover. Eyepiece has one small piece of rubber trim missing (caused by the cover), but otherwise the scope is in near perfect shape with excellent glass. This rifle is a combination that is tough to find, yet is an awesome lightweight all weather hunting package! Asking $900 OBO sale/$950 trade for the complete package, and will consider interesting trades or trade plus cash. Let me know what you have, and thanks for looking!"

Would be great for those of you who are finding the LOP on the intermediate length buttstocks a bit too long or just want to go with the standard Warsaw length AK stock. Or if you are converting one of the ban-era milled AKs from the thumbhole stock and want to go with a lightweight polymer stock vs. the heavier wooden stocks, this would be perfect.

First 2 photos are of the actual stock.

It has a skelentonized lower receiver, stainless steel 6"" barrel, all top quality parts. This weapon has never been fired. 

A very large handgun based upon the M16 rifle. It has a special recoil spring and buffer, so that the usual long spring housing at the end of the frame is eliminated. Just like the M16 it fires the hardhitting 5.56 NATO cartridge, although its power is slightly diminished by the shorter barrel. This gun is made entirely from extruded aluminum, which helps greatly in keeping the ultimate weight down.

The gun typically comes standard with a ten round magazine, but of note is that any pre-Brady bill M16 magazine will fit. This means that, if you can find the magazines, you can fit 20 or 30 shot magazines in this gun without problems.

Weight: 3 lbs (1.4 kg) 
Caliber: 5.56 mm N (5.56 mm NATO) (treat damage rating as one dice less than when fired from a rifle) 
Barrel: 6 inch (15 cm) 
Action: Single Action 
Range: 440 ft (132 m)

This pistol was made in Israel by IMI. I have found a couple more things. The takedown tool, the owners manual and a sales brochure that includes this finish.  These are very hard to find. It took me quite awhile to find this one. 44mag to me is the most easy to shoot and of course find ammo for. To me it is a piece of art that is functional.
