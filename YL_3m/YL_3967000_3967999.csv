Close Quarter Battle. It allows very fast target acquisition and engagement at short range while providing aiming capability out to 300 meters equal to or better than iron sights. The sight can, however, be used in conjunction with an L-3 Eotech Optical Magnifier. When an Optical Magnifier is used, the effective range is extended to 600 meters."

It's a short bed with a camper shell with all the glass intact. The camper is made for a short-bed ford so it fits perfectly, no overhang or misalignment. I just put on 4 new Firestone LT315/75/R16 (35x12.50), less than 500 miles on them. The tires are mounted on 4 new American Racing R16x10 crawler steel wheels. I replaced the stock intake with a Dual-Port aluminum Offenhauser intake and a 390cfm Holley 4-barrel carburetor, topped with an Edelbrock air filter. I also replaced the stock exhaust manifold with a split manifold and TRUE dual exhaust with brand new catalytic converters and Glasspack mufflers (It isn't an excessively loud truck). The exhaust is also a side exit in front of the rear tire. I put a new no-name tachometer on the steering column and a smaller Grant race steering wheel (No tilt column). I have two brand new HID driving lights mounted on the brush guard that are twice as bright as the headlights. It has an aftermarket rear bumper with a built in hitch and tow hooks. I recently lined the bed with nice carpet to keep my dog from sliding around, either way it's really nice carpet cut to fit. The bed has a diamond plate kit on the top of the side rails, the front of the bed and the tailgate. The interior is in really good shape. I'm sure I'm forgetting something so just shoot me an email if you have any questions of it you'd like to take a look at it.

Don't bother wasting my time trying to set up an appointment then backing out on the last minute. I am tired of these idiots who would say that ""they are interested, they have the money, and that they will buy it"", but will say no 15 mins before the meeting time. I have put alot of money into this, I hate to see it go but I need the money.

And also please understand that we have to go through FFL. That means that the transaction has to happen through an FFL holder, usually a gun shop. My preffered gun shop is West Coast Armory. Either the one in Everett or Bellevue. So don't ask me to drive to Bellingham or Tacoma. An also please understand that an FFL transaction means you have to pay an FFL transfer fee, which is $50, and that you have to pay tax.

I will not have to explain everything that I said above when you contact me. And when you contact me, I only want to talk about the price, and meeting time and place.

After Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Brazil in 1980, the Taurus 92 9mm pistol was created to improve on the Beretta design. The specially-designed drop hammer-forged ordnance-grade alloy frame won't crack or allow the slide to come off, and a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode and
also functions as a DA decocking lever. The Taurus 92 also features a loaded chamber indicator, the Taurus Security System, a Picatinny rail, and fixed sights.

I have been slowly getting the tractor to a running condition during that time.  Tonight (1/27) I tried the snow thrower for the first time, previously I have been using the plow attachment while playing with the tractor.  It is a Case 446  Hydrostatic drive tractor. No clutch or transmission to shift !  Hi and low speed selectable rear axle. Hydraulic lift of the plow, mower and snow thrower.  Includes 54"" plow blade,  48"" snow thrower and 44"" center mowing deck with drive mule.  At some point in the tractors past a 12 hp Kohler engine was installed.  The engine runs excellent and is fairly quite.  I have plowed my driveway with the tractor and had no problem with a shortage of power. Tires are old and cracked from age but seem to hold air.  The tractor is heavy and with the tire chains there is plenty of traction  I do not need the tractor and want my space back.  The mower deck has not been tried yet but would assume it works as well.

The Model 840 was derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

The key with the PWS Mk107 is having a 7″-barreled AR that works, and works at the same reliability level as longer-barreled ARs. This is where the PWS long-stroke piston comes into play. The PWS proprietary system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating-head piston that is attached to the operating rod. Bravo 

Company’s BCMGUNFIGHTER Charging Handle is used with the PWS uppers. The extra purchase gained from the large BCM latch allows for better weapon manipulation during reloads and any malfunctions encountered. The Mk1 series is built to be a true combat carbine. With no unnecessary gas adjustments and only one moving assembly, proponents point to the Mk1 as the most rugged, simple and versatile piston operating system available. The Mk1 series is available as complete carbine, rifle or as a “drop-on” upper receiver for use on the lower receivers of existing M4/M16 style lowers, which is the path chosen for this review.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity."

The Model 845 was derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

The gun comes with two clips, one functions flawlessly and the other works well but occasionally has a misfeed, both came with the gun when I purchased it about 8 years ago.  The one that functions flawlessly I believe is stock, the other is slightly different so I am assuming it is after market.  In the time I have owned it I have put about 100 rounds down the barrel.  I have always enjoyed shooting it, but being my only 45 I feel it is a bit too big to shoot comfortably, so I am offering her up for what I paid for her.  The grips are custom, the previous owner made custom grips commercially so he of course fitted this gun out with custom grips.  Overall a clean firearm with no rust or blemishes on the finish.  I will ship to an FFL but the buyer will have to pay my FFL fees and theirs.  I would prefer the purchaser to have a Michigan CPL so we can fill out an RI-60 form for the transfer, otherwise we will have to go through an FFL and the purchaser will pay all associated fees.  If you are interested please email, text, or call me at four zero two, four one eight two two six three.  The pistol is located in Cedar Springs MI, only the phone number is from Nebraska.  Thanks for looking.  Terms of sale are cash upon pickup, as-is, where-is, no warranty expressed or implied."

The gun comes with two clips, a WWII style holster, a cleaning tool, and a spare barrel.  When I purchased the gun it came with the 7.62x25 barrel stock, I had the second 9mm barrel made and fitted to the gun.  The 9mm barrel is on the gun in the pictures, I wanted it to stick out a bit in case I ever decided to thread it and put on a suppressor or anything.  Both barrels use the same clip and work flawlessly, I have run about 300 7.25x25 rounds through it and probably 200 9mm rounds with no issues.  This is a great versatile gun to run military surplus or standard 9mm ammo through.  I have seen the 9mm barrel alone go for $125 plus, so this is definitely a desirable combo.  I am selling because my wife and I recently started a family and I just do not get out to shoot anymore, so I am thinning out the collection.  I figure it is time to let someone else enjoy this firearm.  I will ship to an FFL but the buyer will have to pay my FFL fees and theirs.

If you haven’t looked through a thermal sight before you are in for a treat.  There is no comparison between this thermal sight and Gen 3 autogate night vision.

If your serious about doing it right, this is the game changer.

It doesn't fit my needs so I am offering it to another skilled shooter who will put it to good use and maximize its capabilities. If Dad put more than 200 rounds through this weapon I'd be surprised; the gun is in near-mint condition.

 Designed from the ground up by Kimber as a concealed-carry personal defense weapon, the Pro Covert II with its aluminum frame weighs only 28oz empty, and measures 7.7"" by 5.25"" by 1.28"". Kimber's Covert pistols come with Tactical Wedge tritium night sights and digital camo style Crimson Trace Lasergrips - if you can see, you can aim. With a match-grade 4"" steel barrel (1/16 Left hand twist) and match-grade aluminum trigger (4-5lb break), the Pro Covert II will raise your personal defense capabilities to the next level.

 In addition to original cleaning brushes and manuals, I will also throw in an Ace Case suede pistol case, 20 rounds of Winchester .45ACP 230gr SXT JHP ammo and three extra 8-round KimPro Tac-Mags. MSRP for the gun is $1,657. Asking $1,100 for the whole package.  Sorry, don't need any more firearms so no trades."

513,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3967513,For Sale/Trade:  RARE Colt M 1911 A1 NATIONAL MATCH,"Broken Arrow/Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma","$ 4,500","Listed On: Tuesday, January 27, 2015",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"RARE Colt M1911 A1 early model national match pistol. This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1943 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped to Springfield Armory in February of 1943. It was Issued to an enlisted serviceman at the time. (Trying to find out who it was issued to now through different channels.) There are specific clues on the gun that tell you who it MIGHT have gone to.. There is AA inscribed (Not stamped) on the ivory grips and on the frame Next to GHD. GHD is significant because Col. Guy H. Drewry inspected ordnance from June 17, 1942 to July 15, 1945 For COLT.

After having multiple collectors and Colt dealers at the gun show look at it. ""AA"" is believed to stand for ""All American"" 82nd Airborne. Which would match the dates the gun was issued, and the eagle carved on the Ivory grips. 82 Airborne was the first Airborne division in US Army history and had three major drops, made their first drop in July of 1943 to invade Sicily. Second was Salerno on 13 September 1943. The third was the invasion of Normandy Jun 1944.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by a gunsmith. At some point it was re-blued, and fixtures were 24k gold plated and Ivory grips added. It has been determined the gold was added many many years ago as some has worn off in spots. Bluing and finish is still very nice... Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. I have put 100 rounds through it and drives tacks. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

I have many pictures if you want more. FTF in tulsa area only.. 4,500$ cash obo.. All reasonable offers considered. Email if interested. Will trade multiple guns.. Please list your offer and values of guns. email or text 918-four02-zero854."

I purchased this new from dealer's NOS. Gun has only had a box of shells through when I originally bought it to test out. It cycled like a pro even with low power loads. Has been stored in safe ever since. Only took it out last year to takedown relube and replace buffer. Though it was still servicable I figured since the gun was apart might as well replace. Less than 2000 imported and getting harder to get a nice one. Most you see for sale have the lever safety and are beat to hell. Plus you have no idea if the buffer has been replaced or not. Even if it has how many times was it fired with a busted one before it was replaced. Since I purchased this in new unfired condition I can assure you it has only had about 8-10 shells max down the barrel and I checked the buffer before firing the first time having read up on the buffer issue before my purchase.

There is a Magpul pistol grip, with the 1911 profile for less wrist strain (more vertical then standard). I'll throw factory pistol grip back on and knock off 20 bux if you want. The lower is an ATI HYBRID lower, SECOND GENERATION. They have anti walk set screws on trigger pins, and aluminum reinforcements on buffer tube and rear pin. That means all stress bearing locations are aluminum. ALSO INCLUDED BUT NOT IN PICTURE is flip up aluminum sights I had sitting around in the parts bin. Forget the manufacturer.
