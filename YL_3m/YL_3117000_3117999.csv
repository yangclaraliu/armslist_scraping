The HK45 was originally developed as a product improvement of the highly regarded USP45, first released in the 1995. The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls. The Tactical version features a 5.16"" long barrel with threaded muzzle for easy installation of sound supressors or flash hiders, and Meprolight three dot Tritium night sights. This HK45 Tactical features a rare Desert Tan/Flat Dark Earth frame and matching slide finish.

The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45 Series is a new paradigm for Heckler & Koch handgun design and is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Here is a worthy specimen of Smith & Wesson’s best metal frame 9mm, the model 5906, the highest form besides the TSW that a standard production model 59 descendant reached, with second / Square trigger guard configuration. Smith & Wesson sku was 108176. This pistol has been professionally reworked, bead blast refinished, and test fired by Black Ice Coatings in Utah. Its TET serial number prefix dates its manufacture to 1989 or 1990. Construction is stainless steel, with classic satin stainless .260 serrated spur hammer with matching .304 smooth combat trigger. Sights are Novak low profile 3 dot, dovetailed into the slide front and rear. Grips are new factory replacement flat type. Magazine is later production, orange follower 15 round and may be Law Enforcement marked. Residual wear is minimal. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent, note that bushing contact evidence on the muzzle area of the barrel is only moderate. We estimate that this 5906 has been fired fewer than 1200 rounds, annual qualification. The distinctive configuration of the barrel and the full-length stainless steel guide rod made these among the most accurate 9mms ever produced. Weight empty is 37 1/2 ounces. Own this excellent steel frame stainless Smith & Wesson 5906 in the photos or one of it's virtually identical mates	for only	$ 489.00.	Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where the 15 round magazines are restricted to law enforcement, we will sub a factory or Mec-Gar 10 round magazine; or $20 off with no magazine, buyer’s call.

Spikes Tactical is well known for some of the highest quality and most accurate AR15 rifles and uppers made. They use all mil-spec or better components. Their quality control is outstanding and the fit and finish of their products are second to none. This is a factory built Spikes upper complete with all Spikes Tactical parts, including the well know and highly regarded Spikes Bolt Carrier Group. Complete specifications are listed below. It has never been fired. It has the Spikes Spider logo laser engraved on both the BCG and the upper receiver, and the barrel is marked ""ST"" along with all the other specs in the rollmark. It has a 16"" barrel and mid-length gas system, which is pretty much better in every way than the standard carbine length gas system. Longer hand guards for more versatile hand placement, longer sight radius, and they are also softer shooting and run smoother due to the longer gas system which equals less felt recoil and less wear and tear on components as well. Throw this on a $150-200 lower receiver and you will have a top quality and sweet shooting AR15 for the price of a cheap off-the-shelf Bushy or Windham Walmart or Academy Sports rifle.

Height 8.26 inches (209.8mm) The actions by the US Government banning the importation of many advanced semi-automatic rifles has prevented rifles like the HK91, HK93, and HK94 from being brought into the US. However, the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms has certified the SR9 Sporting Rifle, SR9(T) and the PSG1 Marksman's Rifle as legal for importation and civilian ownership.
The SR9 continues the tradition of the HK91 but with several important modifications that make it the ideal sporter, target rifle, and heavy-duty hunter. Polygonal rifling is standard on the SR9, the same bore profile found on the PSG1 Marksman's Rifle.
Also standard is the new MSG90 buffer system, a significant improvement over the older system found on HK imitations. This makes the SR9 rifle one of the lowest recoil semi-automatics in the world. It is equipped with a specially designed thumbhole stock constructed of kevlar-reinforced fiberglass that is both durable and ergonomic."

I've run less than 50 rounds through the set up.  It's a tight lock up and has a solid feel to it unlike other dedicated .22LRs i've owned (Sig Mosquito, Walther P22, M&P22, and other's i've handled).

Slide locks back, and slide release gives a snappy forward rack.  Full sized magazines and same controls as a Glock give great analogous training.

This one comes with:

-Complete G19 Lower
-Extended Slide Catch / Slide Release
-Original AA Case, Lube, etc
-3 Magazines.  1 G19 and 2 ""G17"" will sit a bit past flush
-Target Sight Model
-Adjustable
-Low Round Count
-Runs great on recommended ammo. I prefer Remington Golden bullets b/c they're affordable and can be found locally.


I can ship to an FFL for $5 continental US.  I'll eat rest of the shipping costs."

We all want to avoid life and death encounters – but if you are unfortunate enough to find yourself in one – you don’t want to have to worry about the performance of your firearm. With all the combat proven features of a typical CQB, the Tactical Elite provides the additional advantage of a fully supported hand-fit, heavy flanged cone match grade barrel. The extra weight of the heavier-than-standard barrel gives the shooter softer recoil and faster recovery time between shots. Possibly the easiest .45ACP pistol to shoot well in today’s market, it is the highest performance self defense pistol available. When nothing less than 100% functional reliability, fast handling, rapid shot-to-shot recovery and accuracy is demanded, you want to have a Wilson Combat® Tactical Elite On Your Side®.

The Smith & Wesson K-38 Combat Masterpiece, Revolver Model 15 is a six-shot double action revolver, with adjustable open sights, built on the medium-size ""K"" frame. It is chambered for the .38 Special cartridge and is fitted with a 6-inch (152.4 mm) barrel, though additional barrel options have been offered at various times during its production. Originally known as the K-38 Combat Masterpiece, it was renamed the Model 15 in 1957 when all Smith & Wesson revolvers were given numerical model numbers. It is a shorter barrel version of the Smith & Wesson Model 14 Target Masterpiece and essentially an adjustable-sight version of the seminal Smith & Wesson Model 10 (""Military and Police"") revolver with target shooting features. The main production run of the Model 15 was from 1949 through 1999. It was discontinued for approximately a decade until 2011, when a re-tooled version was re-released under S&W's Classics Revolvers line.

Photos are representative, but they are a pistol from the same department; buyer will receive the one in the photos or a very similar specimen. Heckler & Koch earned our respect during the Reagan Era with their PS and P7 series pistols. In 1993, HK’s military technology entered the civilian and law enforcement market with their USP, Universal Self-Loading Pistol. A .45 ACP variant came online in 1995, along with a chopped down Compact version – this one, the USP45 Compact. German Date Codes indicate this small batch of USP 45C Variant III pistols were manufactured between 1997 and 2009. Each one served with the detectives and plainclothes officers of the Roanoke County Police Department in our Sister State of Virginia from its issuance until the present year, when the Department changed to .40 S&W Pistols from another manufacturer. Manufacturer is Heckler & Koch gmbh of Oberndorf, Germany. Importer was Heckler & Koch of Sterling VA. Factory number is 215920, ancestor to, and very similar to, the currently produced 704533 HK45 Compact. Type is blowback single and double action, hammer fired semi-automatic pistol, linkless Browning type as the manual puts it. Construction is steel slide, barrel, and internal parts housed on a steel embedded polymer frame, with a total of four points of steel to steel contact. Forward area of the frame is grooved, but for German, not Picatinny, rail apparatuses. Return spring is buffered flat coil steel. Finish on all metal parts. Sights are Tru Dot factory Night Sights, both dovetailed into the slide. Barrel is 3.8 inches 6 groove right hand polygonal, 1:16 rate of twist. Overall length is 7.09 inches from the muzzle to the grip frame strut area. Slide measures 1.14 wide at the ejection port. Sight radius is 5.6 inches. Height is 5 1/4 inches from the top of the rear sight to the magazine floorplate. Magazine is original factory HK steel bodied with dovetailed back construction. It holds 8 rounds of .45 ACP caliber ammunition, so 8+1 with standard magazine and extended magazines are readily available. Weight empty is 28 ounces, with center of gravity at the ambidextrous magazine release. Trigger is .400 polymer with 3 center serrations; hammer is factory bobbed .325 steel. This USP Compact has a firing pin safety. Unlike the Variant 1, this Variant 3 does not have a lever safety, only the decocker. The single side, right hand shooter control lever acts as a decocker in the down position, so that the operator can safely end a firing session. Trigger travel is 5mm on Single Action, or 11.5 mm on double action. Double action trigger pull measures 10 pound vicinity; and the single action pull is a relatively crisp 4 1/2 pounds with minimal felt creep. Each pistol has been well maintained, and surface detractions are moderate, with faint holster contact whitening on the slide, slide operation whitening and buffing to the barrel surface, carry polishing to the grip frame, and some edge whitening to the hammer spur. We classify them as Very Good Condition, 80 to 85 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. We estimate each weapon was fired 700 times for annual qualification during its tenure, no rounds at all for an HK USP. Replacement pricing on this pistol is over $1,000 in our area, and there aren’t any to speak of.  We’re offering the pistol in the photos or one of its substantially identical mates, however, 	for only	$ 659.00.

This classic Smith & Wesson .22 caliber target revolver had its beginnings way back in the early 1930s and is now discontinued, yet it is still an extremely popular item among both shooters and collectors. It serves the needs of target shooters wanting a companion piece to .38 caliber target revolvers as well as filling a niche for a field revolver suitable for small game. A more accurate .22 wheel gun has never been made, and S&W was entirely correct in calling it a “Masterpiece.”

A medium-size frame (factory designated as the K-frame) .38 Special revolver with target sights was first offered by Smith & Wesson in 1899. This was the .38 Hand Ejector Target, sometimes called the .38 Military and Police Target. It quickly became a favorite with many competitive target shooters, and many U.S. Revolver Association records were set with it. Over a number of years since the introduction of that arm, a growing demand developed for a .22 caliber version that would have the same feel and balance as the .38. In addition, a lot of sportsmen thought that would be a good idea for field use as well.

I have owned this rifle for many years and am cleaning out my safe to fund other projects. The furniture is Desert Tan and easily replaced with the included spare set of H&K factory black. The rifle has the famous HK 600 yard turret sighting system and amazing reliability and durability. Adding to that will be 10 actual HK mags, a hard foam lined case and a spares kit that includes all of the parts that are great insurance against a someday malfunction such as trunnion springs and rolllers.  I also have a number of additional mags at $7 each.  PLEASE NOTE THAT DESPITE THE LOWER MARKINGS THE ACTION IS ONLY CAPABLE OF SAFE (no fire) and FIRE (semi-auto action only)  THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF MODS FOR ANY OTHER MODE OF OPERATION.

Here's a chance to own what many think is the best NATO chambered battle rifle ever built. Rugged and durable, the semi-auto PTR-91 is a direct follow-on to the HK91 G3 NATO spec rifle built by Heckler & Koch with parts interchangeability and significant quality improvements. Every replacement part is widely available from a number of vendors. Here is a recent link describing the amazing accuracy and reliability of this rifle. 
http://blog.cheaperthandirt.com/ptr-91-rifle-slam-dunk/

The PTR company began building this clone on actual HK tooling and it is considered the best HK91 clone - even better in many cases as they have added telestocks and other upgrades to the basic rifle. 

No trade proposals please since I am moving my collection away from the G3. Buyer must be an AZ resident with ID, CCW preferred. No prohibited possessors please. Thanks.  Email response goes to my phone, be sure to include your contact info."

Introduced to the firearms market in 1927, the Colt Official Police is a medium frame, six-shot, double-action revolver with a six-round cylinder, primarily chambered for the .38 Special cartridge, and manufactured by the Colt's Manufacturing Company. The intended specific target market for the Official Police was mainly law enforcement agencies and it became one of the best selling police firearms of all time, eventually in the 1950s coming to exemplify typical peace officer weaponry.[1] The Official Police was also used by various U.S. and allied military forces during World War II.

The Official Police was machined of fine carbon steel, with bright royal Colt blued as well as nickel plated finishes, and was offered in 4, 5 and 6 inches (100, 130 and 150 mm) barrels. Built on Colt’s .41 or “I” frame, it was manufactured in a variety of chamberings including .22 LR, .32-20 (discontinued in 1942), .41 Long Colt (discontinued in 1938), and the most common and popular, the .38 Special.[1][2] Colt’s “Positive Lock” firing pin block safety was a standard feature of the revolver, preventing the firing pin from striking the primer unless the trigger was deliberately pulled.[1] The pistol’s sights consisted of a blade front with a fixed iron open rear sight, which was a simple V-notch shaped groove milled into the revolver’s top strap. The top strap had a matte finish to reduce glare down the sight plane

IT SHOOTS DAMN NEAR FULL AUTO AND IS A DIRECT DROP IN TRIGGER UNIT FOR AR-15 RIFLE PLATFORM. 

The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™’s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.
 Listers basic review of this product : This tigger is designed for those who want a high rate of fire but want to control their shots for maximum efffectivenes. This trigger has a small learning curve to master but will fire at rate close to a full auto with more control for more shots on target. If you want to just dump magazines as fast as you can (spray and pray) this is not for you. This trigger is very crisp. I had 4 other people try this out at the range and they had a blast. They really liked having the ""auto"" 3rd selector mode.

Brand new in package Magpul Battery Assist Device (one finger bolt release) lever. No modification to your weapon is made, it just mounts on the existing bolt release paddle. Will sell for $30 cash, or trade for a brick of 22lr.

Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.

Not cheap, crappy, poor brands, etc. I only use good stuff (I hope one can appreciate that). I have a Sig Sauer .22 LR Mosquito Stianless for sale, Ruger LC9 and H&K USP .45 full size stainless for sale/willing to trade, etc.
