The trigger pull is enhanced with a JP enterprises JP Reduced Weight spring kit. Combined with the nickel teflon trigger, disconnector and hammer, this makes for a smooth, crisp trigger break. The barrel is a Daniel Defense 14.5 inch light contour 1 in 7 inch rate-of-twist chrome-lined barrel with a Cavalry arms Cav comp pinned and welded to BATFE specs giving the barrel an overall length of 16 inches. The barrel is torqued to spec using a Core 15 Stressproof barrel nut. The gas system includes a Spike's Tactical Melonited Carbine-length gas tube mated with a Brownell's low-profile gas block. The Bolt Carrier Group is a WMD NIB-X nickel boron plated as is the charging handle. The fore end is a Samson Evolution keymod free-float tube 12.5 inches in length. In order to obtain maximum recoil mitigation, we finish the rifle off with a Mako G-shock recoil-reducing collapsible stock on a Brownell's commercial receiver extension tube. The float tube is topped with Magpul MBUS flip-up sights. All together, the CAR-lite is approximately five pounds. Simply put, this is a light-weight and handy little rifle you have to shoulder to appreciate. Note that this is our demo. If you chose to purchase this model, we will build it from scratch. The approximate wait time is three weeks from start to delivery."

Other minor things of note, has the 5th amendment dust cover and a ""don't tread on me"" laser engraved into the trigger guard. Even with the slightly raised reflex mount the backup sights are still clear through the optic and are dead on for shorter range. It has some character, so minor scratches here and there seeing how it's actually been used and not a safe queen. Comes with one full magpul magazine with green tip ammo.

Here's the link for the reflex if your curious.

Everything was installed with care and the gun itself has been well maintained. In extra parts alone your looking at around 700-800 dollars. Add in cost of the rifle, you're looking at 1300+ dollars. My asking price is 1000 for the lot, optic included but I'm willing to barter on prices. Trade wise I'm not too interested in pistols/shotguns unless you've got a VEPR 12. Rifle wise I'm looking at other battle rifles, CETME, FAL, PTR91, VEPR's in .308 or 54r, etc. But cash is preferred. Gotta fix up the bike because go figure as soon as the nice weather gets here, it breaks down.

The weapon light is a Elzetta C Charlie 333 900 lumens weapon light. This is the brightest tactical light you have ever seen day or night. Check out Elzetta on the web and take a look at this light on you tube. It is sitting in a Elzetta ZSM mount with optional side rail.  The best part of this little beast is the Aimshot LS8300 laser. Try to find or buy one of these. There sales are restricted to only SOCOM and other SOF on military letterheads only. They are no longer being sold to LE Agency's. You can contact Jeff at Aimshot in Atlanta to verify. This one was to me by a Friend of mine who is a SFO deployed to Afghanistan right now. Its the brightest laser you have ever seen mounted to a rifle and one of the best built. You can follow the beam even before dark and after dark it looks like something from STAR WARS. Yes it will light a match and get you in trouble real fast. Comes with two tail caps and zero tool not like the other junk lasers you see on here this one is the real deal. Trade value is 2400 but if you have one or more of the items below I will be glad to work with you if you are willing to do the same. Thanks so much for looking.

The rifle functions great. The stock is nice with minor dings and scratches. The bluing is original and excellent. The muzzle and crown are also excellent, and has not been counter bored. The barrel is not the best ever, but definitely has life in it. Has good, even, rifling all the way through, but has some pitting, which is not unusual on a 70 year old WWII rifle.

It  has a Geissele SSA trigger in it that has only fired a handful of rounds. If you are not familiar with the trigger, it is a very high quality trigger that is very smooth and excellent for rapid semi-auto shots. For all practical purposes you can consider the trigger and the rest of the lower brand new and essentially unused. This is a great deal especially when you factor in the cost of the trigger.  Regular lowers with regular triggers will cost you near $200 after tax. The cost of the trigger alone before tax and shipping will cost you $210. You can snag both from me for $350.

If you are a Skeet shooter or big bird hunter it is a top end piece. Action is tight as a tick and been family owned since new when my stepfather shot trap for Winchester so not many rounds went through the skeet gun. It has one impression about 2.5"" long on the right side but is not a cut or gouge and the only mark on the gun, blueing is immaculate as well as the engraving. They sell for between 1100 and 1500 depending on condition. I may consider a trade for a gun and cash but would have to be a Sig Sauer or a quality 1911 and partial of cash. Any dealer costs for those out of state will be the responsibility of the buyer as well as shipping."
