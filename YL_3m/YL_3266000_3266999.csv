It has a 22"" barrel.  The barrel looks good with a light, and the guns shoots accurately from my experience.  I have not shot it very much, but when I have it operates well.  The bluing is probably 80-90%, with just some light speckling in the bluing on both sides of the receiver from improper storage. The wood is in good condition, with very nice unique wood grain, especially on the right side of the butt.  The butt plate is original Rossi.  This is an early production, with serial number G178XXX.  Later models would only shoot .22 LR, where as this one shoots any length .22 rimfire cartridge.  I think the tube magazine will hold about 12 or 13 LR cartridges.   CB 22's are fun because the little gun will hold over 20 of them!   The report of subsonic rounds is less than most pellet guns.

This is the take-down model, which means the receiver splits in half with the turn of a thumb screw.  The longest part (the barrel/part of the receiver) is then only about 25"" long.  The butt and the other part of the receiver is even shorter.

The only trade I would probably be interested in is for a Webley .455 or some other interesting large-bore revolver.  I might also be interested in  unique antique /repro singe-shot rifles (but no break-top NEA's T/C's and similar newer guns).  I expect to add money plus the Rossi to the deal for the right trade - most of my interests are worth more than the model 62, and I understand that.

I will need to see ID and will fill out a bill of sale for my records only.  

I would also be willing to ship, but we would have to go through and FFL, and the buyer would have to pay transfer fees and shipping costs.

this is a saiga 308 with a 21.8"" barrel. Some folks consider these more desireable than the 16'ers.  with the 16 you are burning aloooooot, of gunpowder outside the barrel.  

i did a conversion on it, which is described partially here:

surefire gun mags 25 rd
promag archangel stock
usa made weaver 4x32 scope
generic (gotta be honest here folks) chinese scope mount


these promag stocks are great, especially on the ak. the cheek weld has 6 positions, and the buttstock has 4, varying in lenght from ""warsaw"" to ""nato"" length.

The MK 116 is a very nice piston driven system chambered in .223 Wylde and using the PWS proprietary piston design. This rifle has a 16"" barrel, a 13.5"" PWS keymod rail system, and the rifle weighs less than 7 lbs. As noted in the title, one of the key upgrades is the Geissele Super Dynamic Enhanced two stage trigger with a smooth 2 lb. first stage and then a crisp 1 lb. second stage. In addition to the trigger upgrade, I've added 45 degree rapid transition backup sights, a competition muzzle brake/compensator that significantly reduces muzzle rise and allows the shooter to take full advantage of the trigger for accurate rapid fire and follow-on shooting, and a 1-5x tactical scope and offset mount. 

I'm the original owner of this rifle, which was purchased in November of last year. I've shot the rifle a few times but it has had no abuse and I estimate the number of rounds fired would be no more than 500 rounds. In addition to the items discussed above, a Drago rifle case is also included with your purchase.

These parts will fit BOTH guns.

First, is a superior quality extended, ported barrel in .40 cal. This barrel is manufactured for the guns listed and is a drop in replacement.

made using the finest material available (type 416 Stainless Steel)

Machining processes are accomplished on CNC equipment for the highest ""close tolerance"" production

Heat treating is done in a vacuum furnace for a clean, consistent hardness of 43-45 Rc.

Barrels are bored and rifled using ECM process (Electro Chemical Machining). This process produces greater accuracy (+/- 50 millionths of an inch!) and a superior finish (16 RMS or better). It also creates less stress than button broach cutting resulting in a more accurate and durable barrel.

The end result is a good looking, top quality barrel with consistent, accurate, long-lasting performance.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second, is the best and last replacemeny spring / guide rod system you will ever buy.

When firing a modern pistol, the slide flies backward at great speed, and then comes to an immediate stop against the frame during recoil. This force and impact to the frame is constantly weakening the slide and vibrating the internal parts, causing cracks and malfunction and turning movements in the shooters wrist. This sudden impact causes a violent muzzle jump which temporarily throws the gun off target and upwards.

The Frame-Saver Dual Action Recoil Springs offer these advantages:

Impact: The elimination of the slide impacting the frame at high speed preserves the structure of the firearm - and your rather significant investment!

Muzzle Control: By changing the final backward movement of the slide from a sudden stop to a progressive stop, muzzle jump is greatly decreased by 40% giving you more control.

Function: No interference of ejection port or any feeding problems.

Progressive: This is a system designed to reduced the backward motion of the slide in progressive stages after the gun is shot. The effect of this system is that the recoil is reduced by 40% making your follow up shots much easier to shoot. This is a VERY effective system.

Stability: Better stability for your barrel. Stainless steel guide rod replaces plastic or inferior metal guide rods for superior barrel support and function.

Better Accuracy: Progressively slows down your slide from heavy impact against the frame. Works just like a car shock absorber, reducing the slide impact. Lower impact means less recoil, accurate recovery of the weapon for on-target accuracy is better achieved, shot after shot. Even expert shooters can benefit from lower recoil.

Lower Frame Shock: The slide is one of the heaviest components in a semi-automatic pistol. Upon firing, the slide slams back with great energy against the frame. Frame Saver Dual Actions springs can lower this slide impact dramatically, preventing excessive wear, cracked slides and damaged frames.

Drop In Fit: Direct replacement for your factory spring assembly. No modifications required.

One such improvement is a brand new 16"" 1:7 twist DRD hammer forged chrome lined barrel that I had installed in place of the original barrel in early June (poor timing on my part but at the time I had no plans to move abroad). In any event, the rifle has been taken to the range twice since installing this new barrel with roughly 100-200 rounds having been fired. I had originally purchased the rifle in October of 2013. A hard case is also included with the purchase of this rifle.

Other upgrades include the Magpul UBR Stock, Magpul Pro Sights, a Fortis compensator/muzzle brake, and a Geissele Super Dynamic Enhanced Flat two-stage trigger with a smooth 2 lb. first stage and a crisp 1.5 lb. second stage (Note that the Geissele trigger is not pictured as it was just installed and the trigger shown in the pictures is a Timney). The rifle originally came with a shorter 13"" rail, but I had this replaced with a new MI Gen 2 quad rail when the new barrel was recently installed. In addition to these upgrades that greatly improve the function, accuracy, and aesthetic of the rifle, a Weaver 1-5x tactical scope with offset mount and a Sight Docter mini red-dot sight is also included. Another nice feature is the upgraded BCG which is a Titanium Boron (TiN) Bolt Carrier Group. You can see the gold coloring of this BCG in the photos and in addition to improving the look, this bcg is very tough due to this coating, quite easy to clean and maintain, and functions flawlessly. 

As I'm preparing to move abroad where I will not have any use for my weapons, I'm selling two rifles, including this one, and one 1911 handgun. This rifle had originally sold for just over $1600 when I purchased it last fall and the value of the aforementioned upgrades has been well over $1,000.  The price of $1,550 includes the optic, but I'm willing to sell for $1,450 without the optic and with a JP single stage trigger.  Happy to negotiate however but prices are pretty firm.  Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!"

Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the GLOCK 21SF delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 AUTO round with 10/13 round magazine capacity. Countless law enforcement units swear by the G21SF pistol, and that's why this powerful, lightweight, all climate workhorse is standard issue from the North to South Poles. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control—especially for shooters with smaller hands."

Mark 6 3-18x44mm M5B2 (34mm) TMR FFP with LaRue Tactical SPR / M4 Scope Mount QD LT104 - $2500

The Mark 6 3-18x44mm sets a new standard for high performance in a small, lightweight package. with a length of just 12 inches and weighing in at 23.6oz, this optic sets the standard for high-end riflescopes and is 20% shorter and 20% lighter. In addition, the Mark 6 series offers state-of-the-art tactical features that are common throughout Leupold's Tactical product line. Hands down, the most commonly used phrase we hear from tactical end users is, ""smaller, lighter, faster"" when describing the perfect optic. Leupold Tactical Optics; we listened. And delivered.
The LT104 is the best mount made for attaching high-power riflescopes onto flattop-style AR15's, period. The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief. The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping.

Remington Model 700 XCR Long Range Tactical Rifle (TLR) in .223/NATO 5.56 cal. Features a X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger and 416 stainless steel barreled action with Black TriNyte® PVD coating, providing a diamond-hard layer of defense against the elements. It comes with the new stock design. Inside, it's a true performance-enhancer, with a dual-pillar bedding platform that free-floats the barrel for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. The black synthetic stock contains a high nylon fiber content which gives the stock superior strength and rigidity in the harshest of conditions. Also helping is a full-length aluminum bedding block, tactical beaver-tail fore-end and a recessed thumb-hook feature for optimum off the bench shooting performance. Nice 40-X externally adjustable trigger. The barrel features wide tactical-style barrel fluting for rapid cooling. Caliber: .223/NATO 5.56 Remington. Barrel Length: 26 "" Heavy Fluted. Capacity: 5 + 1. Trigger: Single Stage. Safety: Trigger guard safety. Length: 45 3/4"". Weight: 8.5 lbs. Stock:  Finish: Black Steel. Twist: 1:9"". It also comes with Harris Bi-pod and Remington Shooters Edge 4-4x12 fix mounted scope plus hard-shell molded plastic Gun Guard protective case. I have included a few boxes of AR and Federal .223 rounds.

Don’t be fooled, the .223 is a laser of a round. The round won't drop. You will never need a big heavy expensive round when you can literally shoot the eyes out of every target.  And or just target shoot all day at distance without breaking the bank. . . . Not only utilized by the US military, but this is commonly the weapon of choice with law enforcement agencies using a .223 on swat teams and hostage situations all over the world. . Most wouldn't use a 308. . . . . . 

This TLR is in excellent condition with low round count. Trigger has just been polished and striker pin rounded.

Introducing the SIG556xi, rewriting the standard for modularity, reliability, and performance for the modern rifle platform. 

Based on the legendary SG 550, the SIG556xi will change the way military, law enforcement, and responsible citizens look at adaptable rifles. Utilizing the time-tested rotating bolt and adjustable gas piston operating system, the SIG556xi allows operators a choice of caliber, barrel length, handguard/stock configurations and lower receivers. 

A removable barrel allows the operator to select the necessary length for a given mission. Adding the appropriate bolt, the SIG556xi can be changed to any of three calibers, 5.56x45mm NATO, 300 Blackout, and 7.62x39mm NATO. Users can also quickly change out the non-serialized lower receiver, allowing the use of either AR-style STANAG magazines or rock-and-lock AK-style magazines. The SIG556xi upper receiver is the serialized part, making the lower an easy to purchase part. 

Polymer handguards accept all Magpul® light and rail kits, while the aluminum and carbon fiber handguards accept 2”, 4”, and 6” M1913 rails. Barrels are available in 10”, 14.5”, and 16”. Truly ambidextrous, the SIG556xi features an ambi safety selector, magazine release and user swappable charging handle (right- or left-handed). Optional receiver end plates allow for the use of either AR receiver extension tubes and buttstocks or M1913 compatible stocks"

 Additional Description: The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand.

SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. This is a limited edition version with G10 Grips - hard to find, extremely sharp looking!

So this time around I am selling my Kevlar bullet proof level 3A vest (BLACK). It's a lightweight feeling vest stops various soft shell bullets meaning most guns that don't have pointy edges meant to pierce a vest such as a 50. Caliber. I primarily used it in the last 8 months on weekends only Fri, Sat, Sunday's while working as a bouncer here in the Bx. I am selling it although it's just barely making a year old because I no longer work as a bouncer.
This vest made me feel comfortable doing the job I was doing and it cost me $750.00 back in late Sept. 2013.
It was purchased from a gun store in Riverdale.
Also note it is completely legal to wear a Bullet proof vest in NY state so long as you do not have a felony history or are in the process of committing a crime while wearing it.
It gets stored laying down flat never hung up on hangers or wires. It's always kept clean and includes the extra TRAUMA PLATE."

It is definately a head-turner at the range.  
Now, I will sell it for $900 but only with the 2 factory 20rd mags and hard case, as well as a speed loader and third hand drum mag loading tool.  I have two ""L"" type 50rd drums available for it as well, and 5 extra 20rd mags in a canvas mag pouch as seen in the pictures.  Unfortunately the drum mags are kindof hit and miss when it comes to reliability; but they may just need broken in.  Of the 5 20rd mags that come with the canvas pouch 4 of them have been modified to fit (mag catch hole extended upward) by a previous owner with a dremel.  The fifth mag appears to be completely unaltered.  I will sell the drum mags for $200 apiece and the spare 5 mags for $100.

Simple but durable, the 54 uses a floating action riding on rails to achieve a totally recoiless system that stands up to the pounding of our 1100 fps system. Not only does this arrangement prevent transmission of felt recoil to the shooter, it also permits the rifle to excel in the accuracy department. When the rifle is fired, the action moves back lightly within the stock, absorbing the recoil, and permitting the pellet to exit the barrel before any of the spring vibration affects its travel. This system dramatically improves the accuracy potential of this magnum air rifle, making it a first class choice for either long range pest control or the precise demands of field target shooting. This side lever cocking magnum rifle's other features include adjustable trigger, adjustable rear sight, scope rail, Monte Carlo stock with cheek piece and checkering, and an automatic safety. Lifetime warranty.

Enables attachment of FA762K suppressor to the M1A, M14, Mk 14 EBR, Springfield Armory Scout, or any 7.62 mm (.308 cal.) semi-auto or bolt-action rifle with M14 spec muzzle configuration. This adapter functions alone as a high-performance muzzle brake when the suppressor is removed. Machined from heat-treated stainless steel, finished in a tough, corrosion-resistant coating.
NOTE: SureFire muzzle brakes and flash hiders also serve as adapter mounts for our Fast-Attach® sound suppressors. If you do not plan to attach a SureFire sound suppressor to your firearm, we recommend choosing a shorter-length muzzle brake or flash hider. SureFire muzzle brakes and flash hiders that mate with our overlap suppressor models are longer in order to extend rearward over the barrel, a feature that is unnecessary unless mounting an overlap suppressor.
Features:
- Provides rock-solid suppressor attachment in seconds without tools
- Also serves as a precision adapter mount for SureFire FA762K suppressor
- Machined from heat-treated stainless steel, finished in a tough, corrosion-resistant coating
- Extreme resistance to heat and gas/particle erosion
- Installation requires no permanent modifications to most weapons

The M73 Picatinny rail forend replaces the original forend of M4-type carbines (and similar firearms), allowing the user to mount a variety of accessories. CNC-machined from aerospace aluminum and given a Mil-Spec hard-anodized finish, these forends with integral MIL-STD-1913 specification rails are stronger and dissipate heat much better than the standard forends and provide rock-solid weapon fit and accessory mounting. The precision rails enable consistent ""repeat zero"" of any accurately dimensioned devices attached to them, such as SureFire WeaponLights.

There have been several requests for a full power 44 mag. Load that recoils substantially less than our other Heavy 44 mag. Loads, but will still penetrate deeply and be deadly on game animals.

When S&W introduced their model 329PD, we noticed that some of those scandium revolvers would experience sticky extraction with our Heavy loads and the recoil in the light weight scandium 329PD guns was horrendous, to say the least. This recoil would some times cause bullets to ""jump crimp"" thus tying up the revolver. 

In order to alleviate the recoil, crimp jump and sticky extraction, we have developed this load. It is still full power, but uses a lighter weight, super hard cast, gas checked bullet and will still penetrate very deeply in big game despite its lighter weight. This load is ideal for those of you who carry the S&W model 329PD. This load will not lead your barrel.

This load falls well under SAAMI pressure specs and is safe to use IN ANY 44mag. While we love to hear from our customers, please do not phone/email us and ask if this load is safe in your particular 44 mag. - it is - providing your gun is in normal working condition.

Now there exists a serious full power 44 mag. load that will penetrate big bones (including a bears skull) and drive deeply into living organs and tissues, that has minimum recoil.

See the below ballistics fired out of my personal revolvers.

S&W 329PD (4 inch)---1264 fps

Ruger Red Hawk (5.5 inch)---1357 fps"

Would be interested in trades on a gas golf cart or high end 1911. I'd rather have the golf cart though. Let me know what you have. 
**EDIT 7/30**

There were some concerns about the trigger recall.  So I've ordered a Timney 510 to drop in.  This should put all those questions to bed.  The Timney is an excellent upgrade.  Pricing changed to reflect new trigger.

**EDIT**
There's been a few questions on my pricing, so I did a breakdown.  Prices new and approximate, including tax:

Rifle:  $675
Stock:  $250
Bipod:  $70
20 MOA base, Rings (weaver), oversize Badger Ordnance bolt knob = $115
Scope:  $485
SKD Pig Stock Pack:  $50
Timney 510: $130

Total:  $1775.

That's what I have in the gun, according to my receipts, and that's why I priced the rifle like I did, especially considering the low round count.  Well less than 100 rounds down the pipe.

I'm happy to discuss and am entertaining offers.  Thanks for looking!"

Small Frame First Model:  .22 caliber short, 6-shot.  Birdshead grips in hard rubber: the Columbian with a vine pattern in the top circle, the Kolb with a K in the top circle.  Approximately 25% had pearl grips, which were indistinguishable between makes.  Nickel was the standard finish, but 10-20% were blued.  There was a headspace adjustment screw on the front of frame just beneath the cylinder pin.  The Cylinder pin catch was mounted in the frame.  Mainspring adjustment screw on front of grip strap.  Length was 4 inches overall, with a 1-5/16 inch barrel.  Marked: PAT. FEB.2.92-FEB.4.96 / BABY HAMMERLESS / PATENTS PENDING.  Three different hammers were installed, which can only be distinguished by disassembling the guns.  Probably over 50,000 of these were produced.  Duplicate serial numbers are common.  Some of the late production first model small frame guns were marked NEW MODEL on the top strap and on the box--according to Frank Sellers this indicates that it had “the last type of hammer, with Kolb’s patented pivoting firing pin.”  The same marking was used on the early 1910 small frame revolvers."

The FN Baby Browning is a small blowback-operated semi-automatic pistol designed by Dieudonné Saive based on a design by John Browning (among Browning's last designs) and chambered in .25 ACP (6.35×16mmSR). The pistol features a six round magazine capacity and is a striker-fired, single action, blow back mechanism. The manual thumb operated safety locks the slide in the closed position when engaged using side thumb pressure.

History

Fabrique Nationale (FN) introduced the revolutionary model 1905 in 1905. Despite the name FN used for this pistol, it was later marketed as the ""M1906"", the ""V.P. .25"" (V.P. denoting Vest Pocket), and most confusingly, the ""Baby"" model. This pistol was introduced more or less at the same time the 6.35x16mm .25 ACP cartridge became widely available. The term ""ACP"" stands for ""Automatic Colt Pistol"". This cartridge was among the first automatic pistol cartridges to be utilized worldwide. It was designed with a ""semi-rimmed"" shell casing made of brass. The rim of the shell casing had a slightly larger circumference than the base of the cartridge and an extractor groove was cut directly above it. The shell casing head was spaced on this small rim; however, the utilization of the rim in this design complicated the mechanics of the cartridge because the rim would sometimes get hung up on the extractor groove of the cartridge while still in the magazine.

The M1905/M1906 vest pocket pistol incorporated a grip safety mechanism that constituted the entire rear section of the grip. This particular safety mechanism required a significant amount of hand palm pressure to disengage and allow the trigger to release the striker to fire the pistol. Colt produced a nearly identical pocket pistol, the Colt Model 1908 Vest Pocket, which incorporated a small safety lever on the left side of the receiver which locked the trigger. In addition, this safety lever mechanism locked the slide about a half inch back from the front of the pistol to enable easy disassembly. FN also added this safety lever mechanism to its pistol, but did not add the magazine safety mechanism that Colt introduced in 1916.

M1 carbine
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The M1 carbine (formally the United States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1) is a lightweight, easy-to-use, semi-automatic carbine that became a standard firearm for the U.S. military during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and was produced in several variants. It was widely used by U.S. and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces, and has also been a popular civilian firearm.

If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. I also sell the side plates which are 6""x6"" and 6""x8""
Text Cody @ 480-228-8195 or call 520-723-92five-five

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

FWIT, Henry is still making the 17hmr so they are not rare as some think they are. I have been in communication with henry on this matter. I just prefer to trade at this time. ALL MARLINS ARE WELCOME I will do muti gun trade as well if interested in all the ammo. but the gun and ALL  ammo is worth min of 1K according to today prices."

The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights.

The PK380 is not just good looking. It is small and good looking. That makes the PK380 excellent for concealed carry. Its small grip is ideal for shooters with small hands. The slide is easy to operate, making it a good choice for women. The light weight goes unnoticed in a pocket or purse. Credit Walther Performance Design for another hit. Small is indeed beautiful!"

Description

The Marlin Model 60SB is a semi-automatic rifle chambered in .22 LR. Marlin has sold more than 11 million Model 60s since its introduction in 1960 and dubs it “the most popular .22 in the world. The Model 30SB is one of the eight sub-models and what makes it unique from the standard Model 60 is that it’s made of stainless steel.

The Model 60SB features a 19″ barrel and has undergone Marlin’s Micro-groove rifling that carves 16 grooves in the bore. The Model 60SB offers a Monte Carlo walnut stock with a pistol grip. The Model 60SB has a patented “last shot” bolt hold-open system, meaning the bolt will be held in the rearward open position after the final spent casing is ejected. The receiver features a steel charging handle and the tubular magazine holds 14 rounds. The Model 60SB has a folding rear sight and ramp front sight and Wide-Scan brand front hood. Has never been fired & includes original box with all manuals and lock as well as a NEW scope and 100 rds of CCI ammo."

Hold the PX4 Storm Compact and you'll immediately realize that this handgun can do it all. Perfectly sized and balanced, it is equally suited for concealed carry, home- or personal defense as well as recreational shooting. With its full grip, full-capacity magazine, accessory rail and interchangeable backstraps, you will get a further sense of its versatility. But it is at the shooting range that this double/single-action compact handgun will truly wow you: thanks to its rotary barrel system, recoil dissipates radially, resulting in much less thump in your hand and super-fast follow-up shots. 

Simply visit your local dealer and purchase a new Px4 Storm. Any size, any model, any caliber."

 I knew they were jam-o-matics when I bought it, but was proud as could be and I did carry it around for a month or so to show it off (even though it jammed) when I was finally of age to own one.

I am not interested in any trades (not even .22 ammo) and will not take any less than $100 because I know it is basically new and some folks know exactly how to make them run like a top. 

I would prefer to do a FTF deal in the West Plains area. If a face to face sell is not possible it will have to be shipped to your FFL dealer via my FFL dealer. The fees for this and shipping will be done at absolute cost. Remember your FFL dealer will be charging you a fee also. Face to face is cash only and I need to see a 'concealed carry' license.
