Sling, folding vertical fore grip and 3 30 round steel mags. Mags are USA brand but do run flawlessly. 
This rifle is dead nuts reliable. Has never hung up on ANY ammo, steel case, brass, reloads from Brass King, runs everything. It is a 4"" rifle at 100 yards with 55gr. standard loads, slightly better with heavier bullets, which isnt bad for a mini, I think it would benefit from an Accu-Strut or some other such device. The scope is just an inexpesive plinker scope, but the rail is mounted rock solid. Asking $700, or trade for AR platform rifle or pistol, must be metal reciever and flat top. Thanks for looking."

This is the very hard to find pre safety model with the golden trigger. I have owned this for several years and it has always been stored in my warm air circulate safe. It has only been fired a handful of times and is in almost mint condition. The metal is perfect but there are two very light scratches on the stock from rubbing on another gun in the safe. Very light but they are there. Otherwise, this gun looks as new. It is a very nice gun with the JM stamp and manufactured in 1979 which was the first year this .357 was produced. Will also include a nice brand new $35 soft case. I would rate this rifle at 98%. Would have a very hard time finding one nicer.

The FNX-45 is the result of years of innovative product development and advanced engineering techniques. Modeled after the FNP™-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

461,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3342461,For Sale:  Complete Legal Protection for Armed Self Defense,"Salt Lake City, Utah, United States",$ 9,"Listed On: Monday, September 1, 2014",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"What happens after you pull the trigger in a self defense situation?  I feel so strongly about helping people protect themselves and the service I am about to share with you that  I WILL GLADLY PAY FOR YOUR FIRST MONTH OF SERVICE!

With my background in law enforcement and as an instructor for Concealed Firearms Permits, Firearms Training and Self Defense training, my students ask me a lot of questions about armed self defense.  One of the most common questions is about what to do AFTER a self defense shooting.

For a long time, that was a hard question to answer, because it involves what to say or not to say, finding a good lawyer, saving up a few thousand dollars for legal fees, and so on. There are a hundred ways to do the wrong thing and end up in trouble even if you legally defend yourself and/or a loved one.  Not to mention the emotional and psychological effects that you may deal with after defending yourself and/or a loved one.

Recently, I’ve just been telling people to join Second Call Defense.  My wife and I are members and I strongly urge you to join as well. Remember, I’ll PAY FOR YOUR FIRST MONTH!

Second Call Defense is an organization that provides complete legal protection for armed self defense. If you have to defend yourself with a gun, all you have to do is call 911 to report the incident then immediately call the Second Call Defense hotline.  Starting at only $8.95 a month.

An actual attorney will answer the phone 24 hours a day / 7 days a week, to help you deal with the immediate aftermath, including how to properly deal with law-enforcement. They will also research attorneys in your area and refer you to several of the best within 24 hours, immediately wire a retainer to the attorney of your choice and make arrangements for bail if things get that far.

And if things get really bad and you end up prosecuted or sued, your membership also includes criminal defense reimbursement, accidental shooting protection, and depending on your level of membership, civil suit defense protection and civil suit damages protection, all of which is backed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) endorsed insurance program.  In addition to all that, they also provide psychological support, dependent upon your level of membership.

This protection covers you everywhere within the United States.  Have peace of mind no matter where you are, be it in your home, on vacation or even traveling. 

I have several friends and acquaintances, both civilians and law enforcement, who I know personally, that have been placed in a situation where they have had to use lethal force to defend themselves or others.  Many of them have had to deal with law suits and other legal ramifications, and several have spent tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, on a fully justified self defense situation, in which no criminal charges were ever filed.  Not to mention the emotional and psychological aftermath of an armed self defense encounter.

like I said, I strongly urge you to join. And yes, I will pay for your first month.

HERE’S WHAT I SUGGEST:

1. Click here to go to the Second Call Defense website at:  
http://www.secondcalldefense.org/plans-and-pricing?affiliate=20469

2. Select the membership level you want. Then click the JOIN button for that level.   YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY GET YOUR FIRST MONTH FREE.

The way this works is: you will see a charge for your first month on your credit card bill, but you’ll get a check for the full amount of your first month in your Membership Kit mailed to you about a week after you sign up. That makes your First Month Free.

You can change your membership level or cancel at any time. But please, at least try it for a month. It’s the easiest and most practical way to answer the question “What do I do AFTER a self defense shooting?”

Whether you carry a concealed weapon on a regular basis, only once in a while or just keep one in the home for defense, this service will give you the peace of mind you need.  Don’t chance losing your hard earned savings, your home or your quality of life.  Join today, it’s an investment that could protect your future and save you a lot of heartache later.

If you have any questions, email me or give me a call.

Sincerely,

Lower features from manufacturer-The SP 223 Billet lower feature a unique design geared towards the serious tactical shooter. The oversized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, beveled mag well, ambi bolt drop and user friendly features make this lower the best on the market. To ease assembly Seekins Precision eliminated the use of roll pins, hammers, punches and replaced them with custom screw in dowel pins. We installed an upper tensioning set screw, a set screw for trigger reset, relocated and retained the rear take down pin detent under the grip. Our ambidextrous bolt control allows the shooter to quickly drop the bolt or from either side of the firearm. The unique magwell design allows positive mag changes and allows the use of most all mags including Magpul P-mag and Surefire high capacity mags.

SIG P220 Combat TB Threaded:
The P220 Combat with threaded barrel is designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards. The P220 Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the threaded barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Outfitted with a true M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE night sights.

Its in great shape with minimal wear. These have 4.25in commander length barrels and has a lightweight alloy frame making it much easier to carry as a cc pistol. Also has cocobolo hardwood checkered grips, flat mainspring housing, extended beavertail safety, 3 dot sights, skeletonized adjustable trigger, extended safety lever, and ring hammer; basically all of the features that most people want on a 1911.
Comes with two factory mec gar magazines, case, barrel bushing wrench, fobus paddle holster, and all factory paperwork and accessories.

Its a great gun but I've had a few 1911's and I'm just finding that I'm not a big fan of the platform. I'd like to trade for a different semi auto handgun of some sort in 9mm, .40, or .45. Would be interested in Glock's or XD's + a little cash. Would particularly be interested in a Beretta 92 compact, CZ75, SIG P226 or P229, or Stoeger Cougar in any of those calibers + cash as well. Would be interested in a .38/.357 revolver as well, particularly a Ruger GP100 with a 4 inch barrel. Pretty open though so let me know what you have, No tauruses or kel tecs though, and I'm not interested in rifles or shotguns. My ONE exception would be a .357 magnum lever action rifle.
