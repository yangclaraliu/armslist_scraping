15,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3796015,For Sale:   KWC 357 6 Inch CO2 BB Revolver,"South Dakota, South Dakota, United States","$ 1,500","Listed On: Tuesday, December 9, 2014",Handguns,no type,357 Magnum                                                                                ,no type,Revolver,"Type: BB air revolver.
Manufacturer: KWC.
Model: 357.
Materials: Mostly metal with some plastic construction.
Weight: 2.75 pounds (1218 grams).
Barrel: 5.5 inches, non-rifled.
Propulsion: 12 gram CO2.
Action: Revolver, single & double actions.
Ammunition Type: 4.5mm steel BB's.
Ammunition Capacity: 6 rounds.
FPS: 400fps.


The trigger pull on the KWC 357 6 Inch CO2 BB Revolver is good in both single and double action, even better than the Dan Wesson and S&W 327 TRR8 shell loading revolvers, most likely because the spring tension that pushes the inner barrel to make contact with the cylinder is noticeably lighter on the KWC 357. Even the hammer is smoother and has less wiggle, just a better trigger and hammer mechanism overall.


 The KWC 357 6 Inch CO2 BB Revolver being mostly metal has a very good build quality, perhaps even better than the Dan Wesson and S&W 327 TRR8 shell loading revolvers, even the weight of the KWC 357 came in close to a half of a pound more! The only real plastic I could find was in the grips and the shell tips. Fit and finish was also good with no noticeable chrome wear or sloppy workmanship. It will be interesting to see how the Chrome finish wears over time...

The KWC 357 6 Inch CO2 BB Revolver overall is a close copy a the real steel 357 styled revolver. I did notice the rear portion of the receiver (between the rear cylinder and hammer) to be a bit longer perhaps to accommodate the CO2 valve length, but other than that this pistol is super close to the original 357 styled revolver it is based on. Again being all metal gives this CO2 BB revolver very realistic weight and feel and the loadable brass shells make using this gun almost exactly like using a real shell loading revolver but for much less cost per shot and of course a lot less recoil on the hands."

* Weight: 1.6 lb
* Caliber: .177 Pellet
* Blowback action

The PX4 Storm looks, feels and shoots just like the real firearm. This 16-shot repeater will have you shooting as fast as you can pull the trigger. There's an 8-shot rotary clip on one end of the stick mag and another one at the other end. After you're done shooting the first clip, flip the mag for the rest of the shots. Since it shoots BBs or pellets, you'll have more flexibility with ammo choice. A 12-gram CO2 is easily loaded into the grip and gives you plenty of shots before you need a refill. There's even an accessory rail under the barrel. Like the handgun, it has real blowback action giving you a feeling of power that most airguns only hope to achieve. Once you start shooting, you won't want to stop, so get lots of RWS pellets, BBs and Walther CO2. Comes packaged in a sealed clear plastic Clam Shell. CO2 cylinder not included.

I have a Lee Hand Press ready to go for 9mm and all that you will need is bullets of your choosing. My Lee Hand Press was used only one season for loading hunting rounds at the range. I have a progressive setup and no longer have use for my Hand Press. It will come with everything listed below and as stated above it is ready to get you going with only the bullets of your choosing. This is a great setup that requires no table/bench to mount the press. That’s right if you have a understanding wife or want to take the chance you can actually reload on that precious kitchen table. Great press to learn on or take to the range/hunting trip. This unit was purchased last March for $273.xx and do not expect $273 in trade but am listing original amount to give you an idea of what was originally valued. Below are all the components and info.

For those who don't know they are the chinese variant of the Mosin Nagant M44 with folding bayonet. It looks and operates the same as it's russian counterpart. These particular ones I have for sale are not pretty by any means and were both made in 1954 one has completely mismatched serial numbers the other has one serial number that doesn't match. there is deep pitting in various parts of the both rifles. If you can find spare parts they could probably be ok shooters. some of the metal is raw from when I cleaned them. they are still pretty dirty. I don't have the proper cleaning gear or hazmat disposal to give them a proper cleaning.  I gambled and bought a few of these online recently cheap so i'm going to sell them cheaper since I don't think these will fire without blowing up in your face, so if you do buy one please take it to a gunsmith before firing. I'm asking for $40 dollars each. I don't have to sell so the price is firm. BILL OF SALE REQUIRED! Please don't ask what store I bought them from. I don't want to check the stores stock and find out a gun that I  want was sold out ;)   I'll have pictures soon.

A little history of this gun
Following World War II, the Browning Hi-Power became the leading military pistol in France, England and thoughout Western Europe and was copied behind the Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe.
FEG of Hungary, the Hungarian national military arms manufacturer, copied the Browning Hi-Power 9mm design during the Cold War and supplied the Hungarian army with small arms. FEG also improved the BHP 9mm design by replacing the Browning Single-Action trigger (with its awful heavy pull) with a Double-Action/Single-Action trigger design copied from Smith & Wesson.
KBI Inc. of Harrisburg, Pa., imported FEG Browning Hi-Power pistols into the U.S. starting in the 1980s, first the 9mm and later the FEG .45 ACP. The FEG .45 ACP GKK-45 has a DA/SA trigger and is a slightly larger version of the classic Browning Hi-Power in 9mm, scaled up for .45 ACP.
KBI Inc. is owner of Charles Daly and though it is no longer importing FEG pistols from Hungary, the company still provides parts and service for all FEG pistols KBI previously imported.

SUPERPERFORMANCE™

This is another of the spherical powders Hodgdon® Powder Company and Hornady® Manufacturing introduced to answer the frequently asked reloading question: ""Can I buy the powder used in the Hornady Superformance factory ammunition?"" Superformance delivers striking velocities in cartridges like the 22-250 Remington, 243 Winchester and 300 Winchester Short Magnum. Velocities well in excess of 100 fps over the best published handloads and even larger gains over factory ammunition! Because this propellant is tailored for specific applications, the number of cartridges and bullets is limited, but where it works, it really works!

Now you can load your ammunition with the same powder that Hornady uses in their factory ammunition. Hodgdon SUPERFORMANCE was developed for rifle shooters that reload for the 22-250 Remington, 243 Winchester, 300 Ruger Compact Magnum (RCM) and the 300 Winchester Short Magnum (WSM) and others (see below). This powder travels faster than most traditional powders. SUPERFORMANCE powder is a smooth metering spherical powder that flows freely through a powder measure.

243 Winchester

I will come to your home to do all the work you require. I have all the necessary tools, and common replacement parts, and will travel with them. I will do your repairs as you watch, and will provide a visual teaching as I work if you choose to watch and learn. You retain control of your weapon instead of leaving it for days, or weeks, waiting for someone to 'look' at it. I will diagnose and fix, or diagnose and recommend without your weapon leaving your possession. No waiting, one way or the other, as 'YOU' are the only customer.

My only fee is $10 for the house call. Slightly more for outlaying areas around Tucson (negotiable). The remaining fee, or fees for what needs to be done, will be negotiated, on the spot, prior to my work beginning. I am very, very reasonable with my prices, (money is tight for all of us) and I will work with you to ensure your satisfaction. Fixing it right the first time, and, ensuring 'you' spend the least amount of your hard earned money are my two prime goals. I also have a shop location where you can bring your AR platform weapon and get it diagnosed, and the recommended fix, as a free consultation for you.

I used all quality parts.  FOR THOSE WHO THINK OLYMPIC IS SH*T: I went with them because they have been manufacturing AR-15 since 1982 and pioneered things like Flat top receivers, free float hand guards, pistol chambered AR platforms, and AR pistols. They have also been around longer then 80% of modern AR platform manufacturers. Not to be a jerk, but I cannot stand uneducated people bashing quality stuff because of something they heard in a gunstore or read on a blog, and now believe they are an expert on the subject.

• Hogue aluminum free float tube with rubber ""Overmolding""
• Flat top upper receiver with picatinny rail

Also included is a Plano Bone Collector locking rifle case with foam cut to fit.

This rifle is in excellent condition, with only a few light handling marks on the receiver and barrel (too light to pick up in pictures, but typical for this finish). I don’t have an exact round count, but I would conservatively estimate under 1,000. This rifle has been a safe queen, and deserves to be in the collection of someone who will appreciate her.

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

Brand New: Vortex Razor 20-60x85 HD Angled Spotting Scope, Promaster XC525 Professional Tripod, and The Manfrotto 700RC2 Mini Video Fluid Head.

These items are brand new and were purchased on Black Friday. Absolutely everything that came with the items, you will receive, even the ""do not ingest"" gel packs. The only item that came with a tag, the tripod, still has the tag attached. All come with manufacturer warranty: Razor = Lifetime, Manfrotto = 5 years, Promaster = 1 year.

I spent hours doing research to come up with the perfect backpacking digiscoping setup. You can buy the items separately or altogether.

I suggest calling S&S Archery if you want to talk with them about why this is the ideal setup. 

Will I buy this exact same setup in the future? I aim to. I just have no business buying optics at this unemployed point in my life.

The Vortex 20-60x85 Razor HD Angled Spotting Scope is just amazing. Read some reviews. They're everywhere. The ones I found most convincing were those of people comparing, side by side at the shooting range, the Swarovski Spotters to the Razors and then choosing to look through the Razors.

The Promaster XC525 tripod is ultralight, stable, and has a 22 lb load rating which is incredible for a tripod under 2lbs 12oz. It specs out really well and has great Amazon reviews and other reviews. Super tall, no bending over.

The Manfrotto 700RC2 Mini Video Fluid Head is a top notch head for digiscoping, and is good for other purposes as well. It is stable and has a very effective pan handle to make adjustments. It is also has several positive reviews floating around. Plus, Manfrotto has been around forever.

The scope is yours for $1190.

The tripod is yours for $160.

The head is yours for $80.

Altogether yours for $1400.

In the pictures, I have the Manfrotto head attached to tripod. The tripod comes with its own three-way head, which I have read is pretty good, but I haven't tried it.

Sig Sauer now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380 ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-sized SigLite Night Sights means the P938 handles like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release, and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. The Blackwood edition pairs a natural stainless steel slide and black hard coat anodized alloy frame with Hogue Blackwood grips.
