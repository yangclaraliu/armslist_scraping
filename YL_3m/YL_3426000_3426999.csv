Pistol functions great and is very accurate. Trigger is nice and I have never dry fired. Bore is in great shape.

Comes with a magazine and 50 rounds of dependable military surplus ammunition.

Cool factor: this pistol is loud and blows fireballs out of the muzzle.

All matching serials, manufactured in 1953. Reason for selling, it hasn't been shot much by me and has been a gun safe queen."

 - New springs in all 3 mags
 - New extractor assembly
 - New extractor springs
 - New recoil springs
 - New high visibility fiber optic sights. Green rear and red front sight. Really draws your eye to the front sight for fast target acquisition

 I have decided to consolidate calibers and focus more on the less expensive 9mm and 5.56 over the more powerful but pricey 45 and 308 cartridges, so this one has to go.

If it sells locally (FTF) to a properly permitted NY resident, I will do my best to make arrangements to meet you at an FFL in the Rochester area, preferably on the west side, for transfer. I won't drive 3 hours to meet you. If it has to be shipped, it MUST go from my FFL to yours, and the buyer picks up the tab. (This is NY, folks, not Georgia) Thanks for looking.

VERY little use, this is a nice Sentinel Snub model R-108 9 shot SA/DA .22 revolver, 2"". The R-108 is one of the later versions of the line, so it has the ejector that is spring loaded for return (The early ones didn't have this and you had to manually return the ejector before closing the cylinder, or end up gouging the heck out of the frame). There is a very light cylinder ring, and very little if any finish wear, tight lockup, this really is a nice one, gang.. The original birds head grips have no cracks or dings (kind of an oddity as well). My thought is that this is a very low round count handgun. Great little carry along for a walk in the woods, to keep in the nightstand, or any other reason to own a good shooting little .22. These short barrel versions are pretty scarce, especially in this condition.
 I would like to get $300 or thereabouts for this one, or, since Livingston County has just approved centerfire rifles for use in big game season, I would consider an even swap for a similarly valued rifle. 
FTF to properly permitted individuals, all of the NY rules apply, transfer to be made either at my local LGS here in York, or perhaps on the SW side of ROC ...buyer pays transfer. I will consider shipping, FFL to FFL ONLY, all costs on the buyers dime , ppd. only"

Kit includes stock, extended mag release, metal tri-rail system and instruction booklet. 

These turn the SKS into an amazingly balanced, close quarter combat weapon. The feel of this kit is incredible. 

Pictures are examples of installed bullpup kits. Yours will be new, in the original box with instructions, ready for you to customize and install. Each new bullpup comes in black and includes everything you need to install. Kit requires no changes or permanent modification to the SKS, only removal of the original stock and rear sight leaf (Both can be easily be reinstalled). You can switch between the original stock and the bullpup stock easily, with an allen wrench.

Kit has four picatinny style rails for mounting scopes, red dot sights, vertical grips, lasers, flash lights and other accessories. This is the new, improved model of the bullpup kit that includes thumb screws for easy dis-assembly when cleaning you rifle, steel hold down latch, and anchored flip door hatch. The extended mag release allows you to quickly remove external magazines. SKSs are pictured with Tapco mags.

I have written some additional instructions on how to prep the SKS for the kit. These will be included as well.

These kits turn your SKS in a bullpup that rivals the Steyr AUG, K-3, QBZ-95, VHS, FAMAS, IMI Tavor TAR-21, Dragunov SVU, SAR-21, SA80 and the FN F2000.

I can meet in Lillington on Tuesdays, or Fuqua most other days.  Price is firm.

The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle. Like the other .22 LR firearms offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. The estimated retail price for the 416 pistol is $459.

Operation

A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK 416 Pistol. The dust cover functions and the bolt remains open when the magazine empties. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’."

If you’re looking for a versatile carry pistol that is packed with features, has amazing capacity, and performs flawlessly, look no farther than the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is the smallest of the XD(M)® line, but it’s by no means the least. It boasts the same superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make larger XD(M)®’s easy and intuitive to use in a slightly abbreviated package. And you’ll be amazed at how fun it is to shoot.
The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact has a 3.8 inch barrel mated with a shortened compact frame. When combined with the versatility of XD(M) Gear® X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazines, the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is ready for daily carry or a day on the range. Put in an X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazine, and you have a 19 round full-sized 9mm pistol (16 rounds in .40SW, 13 rounds in .45ACP). Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact (11 rounds in .40SW, 9 rounds in .45ACP). Like all XD(M)®’s, the XD(M)® 3.8″ Compact comes with three interchangeable backstraps, dovetail sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel.You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M)® a safe pistol in responsible hands.
If you want a gun for daily carry as well as a trip to the range, but you only want to buy one gun, try the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. You’ll be amazed at how controllable it is to shoot and how easy it is to conceal. It’s two guns in one.

Here is a link. http://www.chiappafirearms.com/product/2632 to give you some specs.

This really is an all in one 12 gauge.  From skeet to burglar to rabbit to bear.  I will miss it.....   But the rent wont pay itself so my poverty is your gain.  She is priced to sell quick.

It is a Chiappa Arms not a Winchester or Mossberg. There was no selection for it in the Manufacturer slot so I put Winchester because the folding stock I put on it was intended for a Mossberg or Winchester.  It is similar in style and construction to the Winchester Marine.  

Again this is priced to move so if you want it send me a text, email or call.  Everything in the photos are included (ammo is lead 00buck).
Let me know.  Thanks.
