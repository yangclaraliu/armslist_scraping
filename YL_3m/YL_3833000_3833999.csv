Want to extend your effective shooting range at distances where bullet drop and wind drift become critical? Take a look at the Viper HS LR riflescope. The LR stands for long range â and we mean it. This riflescope features an exposed target-style elevation turret built for dialing elevation at extended ranges. The capped windage turret maintains the scopeâs sleek lines and prevent it from hanging up on clothing, rifle cases or pack scabbards.

A forgiving eye box with increased eye relief gets shooters on target quickly and easily. Built on an ultra-strong 30mm one-piece machined aluminum tube for increased windage and elevation travel and optimal adjustment.

Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

The spiderweb strap system ensures comfort and secure fit. The mask has a straw that fits nato cantens (whatever that means job never told me I'd wear it that long) .

Ask for the GuaranteeDÂ® Lifetime Replacement Warranty.

Limited Warranty Terms and Conditions
Davidson's, Inc. warrants to you that if any gun sold by Davidson's ever becomes defective, Davidson's will replace the gun at no charge, subject to the following conditions. This warranty applies only if Davidson's Supply Company sold the gun to the retailer from which you purchased it and extends only to the original purchaser from the retailer. In order to be eligible for warranty coverage, the original purchaser must complete the warranty registration online or return the warranty registration card to Davidson's, Inc., at the address shown below, within 30 days from date of purchase. If no replacement is available, we will repair the original or offer you a similar model (to be determined at our discretion) free of charge. This warranty extends to any and all parts of the gun as originally sold by us, but does not extend to guns altered or rebuilt after their original purchase, or guns used other than for their legal intended purposes. DAVIDSON'S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACING OR REPAIRING THE NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE GOODS (TO BE DETERMINED AT OUR DISCRETION). WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EITHER DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. To obtain performance under this warranty, you must return the product to the retailer from which you purchased the product and pay the cost of shipping the product to Davidson's. If the retailer is no longer in business, you may contact another Retailer Near You or us directly at Davidson's, Inc., 6100 Wilkinson Drive, Prescott, Arizona 86301, REDACTED. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.

*BRAND NEW GUN:
Davidson's will ship your replacement firearm the very next business day for all in stock items. You are only responsible for return shipping costs to us (ie: getting the firearm to Davidson's through your retailer we do not accept shipments directly from end consumers.) Handguns are shipped out for next day delivery while long guns are typically received by your dealer within 3-4 days of shipping. If we do not have a replacement or you elect to get the same repaired firearm back, your firearm will be sent to the factory or an authorized warranty station for repair. If your firearm is repaired, the time frame until we return your firearm will be longer. Your dealer must have a valid FFL with original signature on file for us to ship and a current account with Davidson's.

Limited Warranty Terms and Conditions
Davidson's, Inc. warrants to you that if any gun sold by Davidson's ever becomes defective, Davidson's will replace the gun at no charge, subject to the following conditions. This warranty applies only if Davidson's Supply Company sold the gun to the retailer from which you purchased it and extends only to the original purchaser from the retailer. In order to be eligible for warranty coverage, the original purchaser must complete the warranty registration online or return the warranty registration card to Davidson's, Inc., at the address shown below, within 30 days from date of purchase. If no replacement is available, we will repair the original or offer you a similar model (to be determined at our discretion) free of charge. This warranty extends to any and all parts of the gun as originally sold by us, but does not extend to guns altered or rebuilt after their original purchase, or guns used other than for their legal intended purposes. DAVIDSON'S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACING OR REPAIRING THE NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE GOODS (TO BE DETERMINED AT OUR DISCRETION). WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EITHER DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL.

When I received the gun it was in pretty bad shape, so I sanded the stock, then stained it a nice red mahogany, and finished it with a varnish, and now it looks like something. The gun is missing one small screw in the front brass but it does not effect how the gun works. It does have dings and Knicks in the wood, but nothing to serious!

I have shot this gun two times using BLACK POWDER because it is a BP ONLY gun. I used 40grs of Goex BP, and shot it both one handed and two handed, and it really doesn't kick too much.

The 1903 was the standard US rifle, but when the US got into WW1 in 1917, it was faster to convert the Remington Eddystone plant producing the British Pattern 14 (P14) to 30-06, so they produced the US Model of 1917. Alvin York preferred the 1903, but shot a lot of Germans with the 1917 on the day he earned the CMH. The 1917 was used by more troops than the 1903 in WW1."

The Benelli SuperNova embodies a modular design concept in a pump action shotgun. With the optional SteadyGripâ¢ stock, this 12-gauge shotgun can be transformed into a high-performance turkey gun or mount a fully-rifled slug barrel for tack-driving accuracy on deer. Itâs like having several Benelli shotguns in one. Thereâs even a barrel with rifle sights for home defense and a SuperNova Tactical fitted with a ghost-ring rear sight and pistol grip. 

At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the new SuperNova super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova isnât just tough on the outside. With its dual-action bars and two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel, the SuperNova is rock solid to the core."

The chassis has 280k on it and only 70k on rebuilt motor and clutch. It has a DINAN supercharger kit installed but the bearings and seals need to be replaced. It also has a DINAN stage 3 suspension kit and throttle body and a 2nd gen AA Tuning exhaust. The front bumper has a crack on it and clear coat is peeling from some parts of the car. 

It was involved in a hit and run accident and sustained a little damage to the drivers door and side panel. Damaged is all cosmetic and it still holds a clean title. Also, you can't open the doors from the outside, but you can open them from the inside and the interior is practically gutted as I intended this to be a track car. It also needs rear rotors and it possibly has a air leak. Registration is due in December and smog is good for another 2 years.

It still runs and pulls hard, even without the supercharger running. This M3 needs a little TLC, and all of the repairs needed are not major. I have the pink slip in hand and I'm asking for $3,600 FIRM and I'm not interested in selling the supercharger kit separately. I'm interested in trades as well, just not interested in trading it for another car since that's the reason I'm selling my M3. Trade value has to be $4,300. I'm interested in high end or exotic weapons. I'm also interested in trading it for an ACR and a SCAR or one or the other, plus cash on your end. This is an ACTUAL and RUNNING E36 M3 with a ton of aftermarket mods. It doesn't need to be towed or anything. This would make an excellent autox or track car!

Series 186 are the first 3 numbers.  Full serial number puts it made in 97/98.

Fires, cycles, shoots perfectly.  Very clean chamber, inside the barrel and rifling look great.  Has a one-piece pistol-grip synthetic stock.  Rubber hand grip added as well as the textured padding on the fore-grip.

I took off the heavy and clunky rail system that it had and cleaned it all up and the gun looks quite nice as seen in the pictures.  Rail system is CTG made for a mini and comes with the gun.  Buyer can keep it or sell it.  Sorry, only have the one magazine for it, but it is new.

This rifle is light and well-balanced. Ready for whatever the new owner wants to do with it, or just keep it as is and use the peep/iron sights.

It cleaned up so nice and looks so much better without that rail on there, I'm wishing I hadn't lowered the price to $480.  

Price is firm and for today only.  Will be away from computer, so emails won't be seen or read until tonight.

Fires, cycles, shoots perfectly. Very clean chamber, inside the barrel and rifling look great. Has a one-piece pistol-grip synthetic stock. Rubber hand grip added as well as the textured padding on the fore-grip.

I took off the heavy and clunky rail system that it had and cleaned it all up and the gun looks quite nice as seen in the pictures. Rail system is CTG made for a mini and comes with the gun. Buyer can keep it or sell it. Sorry, only have the one magazine for it, but it is new.

This rifle is light and well-balanced. Ready for whatever the new owner wants to do with it, or just keep it as is and use the peep/iron sights.

It cleaned up so nice and looks so much better without that rail on there, I'm wishing I hadn't lowered the price to $490. But that is where it is.

The Spike's lower has a complete Daniel Defense parts kit including the trigger group. The upper comes with a Noveske full auto BCG. The AR has a Cobra Tactical AR pistol Flash Suppressor that pushes all of the gas forward and away from the shooter similar to the Noveske KX3 Flash Suppressor and a KAK extended pistol buffer tube making the SIG stabilizing brace a little longer on the back which in turn makes it more comfortable to shoulder fire the gun.  The gun comes with everything that is in all of the pictures below and I am asking $950.00 cash for this gun but will entertain other offers so please text me at REDACTED."
