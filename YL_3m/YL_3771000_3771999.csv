I only had two cameras hooked up so two are still new but all are like new. The entire system comprises of 4 x CIB CUC8795 day/night security cameras. I found the night time IR illuminator and resolution good out to the alley which was about 50 yards. Each camera comes with 50ft cord and plugs into DVR for power and video link. CIB DVR is a 320 gb DVR which recycles itself automatically every 30 days about. Thats about how long 320 gb lasts on this system. Also comes with 19"" polaroid LCD that was new in 2013 and is the screen in the picture. Comes with all chords and manuals and mouse/remotes and I tested all systems prior to listing today and you are free to do the same. Cameras are 600 TV lines. I have about $800 into the system though it appears it is worth about $350 now with depreciation. This is 2012 technology and I spent the first nine years of my career in surveillance and reconnaissance with both the US military and several intelligence agencies and these are good, clear, reliable cameras for the money."

The night viewing distance will depend on how much supplemental and ambient light is available. Can be handheld, mounted to an NVG arm for use with a tactical helmet (not included) or weapon mounted to a standard Picatinny scope rail (rifle mount included). Included are a Picatinny weapon rail adapter, eyecup for scope, and a nice camouflage soft cushion carrying case to protect the unit.

Thank you. 

Excellent condition Italian SxS express double rifle in the excellent chambering 9.3x74R rimmed cartridge. Beautiful color case hardened receiver with beautiful wood. This 9.3mm bullet is.366"" (think of it as a .366 H&H Nitro Express) and will kill anything in the American continents including the grizzly and polar bears. I bought this rifle from a famous gunsmith who used it to kill 2 Cape Buffalo in Africa in 2013. He also installed and regulated a set custom sights which are much more attractive than the originals. I will also include 2 boxes of custom loaded ammo with 286 grain Nosler partitions and 300 grain solids worth about $200. If you have always dreamed of double rifles like I have, this is your least expensive option for a real, awesome Double that is well regulated to shoot tight groups at 70 meters with both barrels hitting Point of Aim with factory Hornady ammo. 
You will not be disappointed with fine rifle, and while it will cleanly kill a Cape Buff, it is not overkill for wild hogs, Elk, polar bear, grizzly, musk oxen, lion, or whitetail deer. This is a great all around cartridge and you will love it.

This is a legit 9mm MP5 not that 22lr look alike. Made by Turner Fabrications who has been making MP5's for a long damn time, its the closest you will get to an Genuine HK MP5 without taking out a second Mortgage! Note, HK does not make MP5's anymore, they havent for awhile, finding one for sale is near impossible, and if you do it is going to cost a but load. This thing is in perfect condition and functions flawlessly.

$3000 cash or trades listed below. You will pay over $4,000 to buy all this new after its all said and done, Get mine and save $1,000.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here it is:
-MP5, All parts German HK, minus the US made Receiver(LSC Manf.)!!!!! There is one NIB on Gunbroker right now being sold by Turner Fabrications for $3100(Gun and 1 Mag!), I'm asking $3000 for everything listed in this ad!!!

-Fluted Salt Nitrate barrel, Threaded 1/2x28 and 3-Lug for multiple suppressor mounting aoptions.

-NAVY SEF trigger group/housing (this MP5 shoots Semi-Auto ONLY tho)

-Has a ""Action 3"" bolt group with F style bolt carrier, this means it will fire F/A with a NFA Registered F/A Trigger pack. These bolt groups are banned from further importation and cost about $1,000, check hkparts.net(SOLD OUT) to confirm for yourself. Couple this with a registered F/A Sear installed in a F/A pack and your ready to blast rounds. Obviously NFA Rules apply if you take this route, and it costs $$$.

-MFI Low Profile claw mount($130)

-3 Mags ($50 ea)

-Bushnell TRS Red Dot($100)

-Brand New Folding stock($140) in separate box, I was going to make this MP5 an SBR but spent money on a suppressor instead and just haven't done it yet. I probably will if I keep it, so get it while its a Non-NFA Weapon and SBR it yourself!

-Included in this ad is 1,000rnds of factory 9mm, most are American Eagle, some Remington and Winchester too($300 @ $0.30/rnd). The ammunition container pictured is one of my 9mm containers and contains 2,000 rounds which you will be getting half of. I will sell an additional 500rnds($150) or 1000rnds($300) if you want more. 

----Note, installing the Stock on this ""Pistol"" makes it a SBR(Short Barreled Rifle), which needs to be Registered with the NFA branch of the ATF. Do not install it without registering it first, you will be getting pounded by a big fat guy in prison if you do and get caught.

Made in Germany, the legendary Weihrauch HW45 is considered by many to be the Holy Grail of air pistols. One of the most powerful air pistols, its modern and compact design, look and feel are a close match to the .45 Colt 1911, one of the most famous service pistols in the world.  Weihrauch also markets this air pistol as the famous Beeman P1…but I’m told that whenever those might again become available, they’ll be coming from China…and will sell for about $460.
The Weirauch is still made in Germany, but they are even harder to find than the Beeman.

Choose between two velocities without pumping, using the two-position spring piston system. Precision adjustable 2-stage trigger, micrometer fiber-optic rear sight adjustable for windage and elevation, 11mm dovetail rail to accept scope, smooth black finish, and ambidextrous walnut grips with diamond checkering. .22 caliber, weighs 2.5 lbs, 11” overall length.  1.75 lb trigger pull. 460 fps.

This pistol is virtually new.  I am the original owner, purchased it just two weeks ago, fired about a dozen pellets.  This is a beautiful pistol, but I have determined that I need the velocity of a rifle for what I want to do.  This may be the only Beeman P1 / Weirauch HW45 available anywhere.  $400 cash and it’s yours, with original box and literature."

Sig only made the P220 Carry in the SAS SAO variant for a short time. They still make the P220 in the SAS variant and in the SAO variant separately, but not in a single pistol. The SAO is designed to be carried hammer back, safety on (cocked and locked like a 1911). This particular variant is hard to find because it's no longer made. It's in impeccable condition (15 rounds through it - Safe Queen). Zero wear on the rails or barrel (look at the barrel in the second pic)! Comes with the original grips as well as ($100) Hogue G10 grips. They look a little like carbon fiber - very sharp. Also comes with a Fobus polymer holster - never carried.

Army records indicate that there were only 60,000 of these knives ever made between 1910 and 1917. In 1917 the Plumb Co. of St. Louis and American Cutlery of Chicago were also commissioned to make  a variant as well.

The big difference in the knives is that the 1910 is the only one that has a Thumb Release Scabbard Catch to insure that you don't lose the knife and that it was milled and later variants were brazed.  This knife has the S.A. Initial on the lower part of the blade with Flaming Ball and was manufactured in 1912 with Bauer Bros. Leather and Canvas Scabbard over sewn pig skin with brass belt tangs for military belt and is dated 1917. On the reverse side of the blade you have U.S. with serial number 9604.

Overall length is 15"" with blade length 10.25 inches. Blade width is 2.125 inched and blade thickness is 0.25 Inches.

These are much better than what you'd find rummaging through Mosin crates around town.  I am picky about the Mosins I acquire, and these two are very fine examples.  If you are looking to start a Mosin collection or add to it, these are excellent examples.

Of note, the Tula has ""XO-46"" marks (more collectable) and has a beautiful post-war laminate stock, and the M44's barrel is is in outstanding condition for an M44.  I haven't fired either one since I acquired them.  The 91/30 will come with a bayonet, and they both will come with ammo pouches, an oiler, and two stripper clips.

I have more pics available since I can only upload three.  And it goes without saying, but you must be able to legally own these weapons."

But do you really want to pay $270 for just the quick disconnect?

Here is a great solution for any rifle with rails or weaver mounts.  I have tried a ton of different mounts, rings, and scopes over my lifetime love of guns and optics.  I TOTALLY believe in spending the money when it counts and I own a lot of high end optics, firearms and accessories.  But there are definitely times when you don't want to spend the money, can't spend the money, or it just doesn't make sense to spend the money for a second or third firearm when it comes to optics.  Anyone can tell you what the best stuff is (yes answers vary), but what if you just want something that will perform as required and is a less expensive option?  There is a lot of junk out there that you should stay away from.

This is a solution that I have found is a tried and true option.  It isn't high end, mind you, but it also isn't $1,000!  

MONEY BACK GUARANTEE!!!  I have tested this and found it is a very acceptable low cost option.  If you disagree, RETURN IT!  I'll take it back for a 100% refund!  However, I think you will find that this is a very well performing solution and you will be very happy with it.  If not, SEND IT BACK!

Love this gun but it is just too big for my hands.  I have my eye on a Glock 22 40 cal I want to buy so I want to sell this and help fund that.  

I have probably put close to 200 rounds down the pipe and have not had a single FTE or FTF.  Anyone who has actually owned one of these knows that the naysayers out there probably haven't and just dismiss this brand out of hand because it is so inexpensive and honestly, not very attractive looking.

The caveat though, is that I need to sell the ammo with it and the two extra mags I bought for it.  Here's the package:

Handgun w/ all box and papers - including original receipt.
Approx 480 rds of ammo, mostly FMJ but there are 35 rds of jacketed hollow points as well.
Three magazines.
1Pr Custom Walnut Grips w/ Hardware (Never installed) bought new

I paid $200 for the gun, prob $20-$25 per box of 50 rds, $20 for each additional mag (genuine Hi-Point mags) and $30 for the custom, hand-crafted walnut grips.

Price for the package is firm at $400.

983,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3771983,"For Sale:  1911 Colt Government Model Commercial, 1912 4-Digit  First Year Issue","Vancouver, WA, Southwest Washington, Washington","$ 7,500","Listed On: Wednesday, December 3, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a First Year Issue 1911 Colt Government Model Commercial, with a four digit serial number C1623, manufactured in 1912.
 The Colt Government Model was introduced in 1912 and was quite successful. When WWI ended there were many veterans who were comfortable with the big .45 Auto and N.R.A. sponsored shooting matches became quite popular. However, shooting bulls eye targets at fixed ranges demanded a level of accuracy that was often missing from the standard Government Model. Early 1911 gunsmiths like Pachmayr and Buchanan would fit better sights and barrels to improve performance. A survey of the Colt shipping records of the 1920’s show many special order guns with tweaked trigger pulls, match barrels, and wider sights to improve functionality.

 The Colt Fractory Letter included with this piece of history authenticates this 1912 Colt Government Model serial No.C1623 and that it was originally shipped from Colt in a shipment of (1) to W.F. Sheard of Tacoma Washington on January 22, 1913

 On my limited research I found that W.F. Sheard was a gun dealer in Tacoma Washington, who patented and manufactured several different rifle sights. His sights were available on some of the Winchester 1894 rifles. In 1900 he was granted a patent for his gold-bead front sight, a professional shooter, trophy hunter, guide, outfitter, taxidermist and fur trader whose customers included the Vanderbilt's, Astor's, and Russian nobility. He was also something of a big-game hunter. He had a shop located in Livingston, Montana, 1882-1893, and Tacoma, Washington, from 1893.

 From the information contained in the Colt Factory Letter this 1911 Colt Government Model Commercial 1st Year Issue could have been a personal gun used by W. F. Sheard or a Special Order gun that was customized by him for someone else??? The front sight looks like a Dovetail Sheard sight that could have been invented by William F. Sheard. The Lanyard loop mag did not originally come with it and was bought later. It still has original finish on the Slide and receiver and on some of the small parts it has its original high polished bright Fire blued (Cobalt Color) appearance as on the Colt Commercial #1 to #2400.
 There’s lots of research left to be done on this amazing piece of History that’s looking for a good home that can appreciate its historical value and pass it on to future generations.
