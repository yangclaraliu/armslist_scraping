Got one of these here Chinese mopeds you see everyone in town riding on, needs a few things to be 100 percent but it runs, rides, drives, and functions perfectly as far as the engine goes. It needs what appears to be a cable or something cause the gauges don't work, so the speedometer, gas gauge, and tachometer  don't work, I literally never even bothered to fix it since I know it has roughly 1300 miles on it, doesn't go faster then 50mph  and gets about 2 weeks of riding on 3 dollars of premium gas. Also it was knocked over but not crashed so the front brake doesn't work, again I didn't care cause I use the back brake anyway. All in all everything mechanically is pretty much perfect, I get around town really well on it, and all the lights, signal and horn work fine. These are 100 percent street legal, don't require a motorcycle license, or insurance or registration or a helmet to ride. I am asking $400 pretty firm, these retail right around 700 pre tax and then have to have a full service tune up after 400 mile break in for another 200 bucks, all maintained and ready to ride home now. Will include owners manual, original title, and 2 performance air filters, as well as a new spark plug. It was just serviced and got a new drive belt installed."

The helmet is in decent shape. The inside pads were washed and then put back in not too long ago. The helmet hasn't been used since then. I paid almost $280 for this helmet New not including the goggles and other accessories, so this is a great deal. This helmet is very comfortable and well insulated for colder temps. I also used this helmet for snowmobiling and it comes with a HJC pad/mouth cover which helps keep your face much warmer and keeps your goggle's from fogging. The goggles are Thor Hero and come with a clear lens installed. The goggles come with an extra clear lens, a blue lens, yellow lens, smoke lens, and a mirrored smoke lens that's seen better days. It has a Go Pro camera mount already installed too! I also have a nice protective storage bag for the helmet which it's been kept in when not in use. I no longer have any toys so it's time for the helmet to go. I'm willing to sell for $100 obo or trade for the following items listed below.

Got one of these here Chinese mopeds you see everyone in town riding on, needs a few things to be 100 percent but it runs, rides, drives, and functions perfectly as far as the engine goes. It needs what appears to be a cable or something cause the gauges don't work, so the speedometer, gas gauge, and tachometer  don't work, I literally never even bothered to fix it since I know it has roughly 1300 miles on it, doesn't go faster then 50mph  and gets about 2 weeks of riding on 3 dollars of premium gas. Also it was knocked over but not crashed so the front brake doesn't work, again I didn't care cause I use the back brake anyway. All in all everything mechanically is pretty much perfect, I get around town really well on it, and all the lights, signal and horn work fine. These are 100 percent street legal, don't require a motorcycle license, or insurance or registration or a helmet to ride. I am asking $400 pretty firm, these retail right around 700 pre tax and then have to have a full service tune up after 400 mile break in for another 200 bucks, all maintained and ready to ride home now. Will include owners manual, original title, and 2 performance air filters, as well as a new spark plug. It was just serviced and got a new drive belt installed."

I originally bought the gun for summer carry but it just sits in the safe. It is a great concealed carry set up, however, I seem to prefer an even smaller .380 IWB, so it has actually been carried very little. It is past the ""break-in"" period but does not have a high round count (eveyone knows that shooting small pocket pistols is not the most enjoyable experience at the range). It has been very reliable and is in very good condition (I take care of my gear).

The ""KB"" markings on the underside of the slide, date to 1991, made in W Germany,this is a full size Sig Sauer P226 in 9mm with the 4.4 inch barrel and Triple matching serial numbers. (Frame, Slide and Barrel). The European guns had all three serialized, its not required in the US.
This is a ""Certified Pre-owned"" with very minor external barrel wear. The slide and frame are 98% easy. Tight barrel lock-up and tight slide to frame fit.
Includes three 9mm magazines; One original ""zipperback"" 15 round, One later model 10 round, One MecGar 15 round.
Has factory grips and a set of Hogue panel grips.
Has Meprolight Night sights. I compared these to my P229 Elite that is 2 years old and can not tell any difference. Very good night sights. Still bright.
Nice Clean pistol with the Red Sig cardboard box and Manual.
Cash Price is firm at $649. Not looking for trades.
Really, I am not looking for trades. Sorry.
The Night Sights are a big factor in the price, these not a set of old/dim Sig Factory sights. This will make a great Nightstand gun as you can locate it easily in the dark. :)

I love this rifle, I really do, as I've had a lot of fun times shooting it, and I bought it from a close friend back home before I moved out on my own, but things change, I've started shooting it less and less, and now I've got to sell something to make room in my safe. 

Anyway, its a surplus, original, un-molested SKS with ALL matching serial numbers (the stock, receiver, and most parts on the rifle are serialized), and even has the old school rifle-grenade launcher, with flip-up sight! For the curious its completely 100% legal to own with no paperwork or anything, although the grenades that it shoots would be a little harder to get your hands on, haha. It also has the cool fold out bayonet.

I've fired 500-600 rounds of Wolf & Tula without ANY problems, EVER. It cycles smooth and operates like a brand new rifle! Its made to eat the cheap steel cased ammo and does it all day long.

Its getting VERY hard to find original SKS's like this, especially with the darker colored stock, most of these have lighter brown stocks, while this one is dark brown/reddish.

I also have a 35 round promag, duckbill mag that goes with it if you're interested!

Looking for $550 obo, will consider serious offers, or I might be willing to trade for a CZ75 in 9mm, Beretta M9A1 type pistol in 9mm, or perhaps a SIG 556 rifle, 556R rifle, O-PAP ak, .223/5.56 ak or maybe even a magpul furnitured AR15 carbine, with cash from me to go with the rifle, needless to say.

Lowballers, people that wish to trade me drugs or stolen electronics stuff, etc for it need not apply. I dont *have* to sell this, although I certainly would for the right price. You must be 18+ and legal to own a rifle in Texas. Let me know what you've got!"

This new and unfired Taurus Raging Judge comes in the highly desirable blued finish for much easier cleaning and maintenance than the gritty stainless finish most of these come in. It's 3-inch chamber allows you to use 2-1/2 inch or 3-inch .410 shotgun shells, along with it's even more desirable concealable 3-inch barrel size. In addition to those calibers, this Taurus Raging Judge also accepts the additional .454 Casull round which will effectively deal with any dangerous game in North America.

As you can see in the pictures, the receiver has both the Imperial Russian eagle as well as the Soviet crest stamped on it. That's because the receiver is from a 1901 Izhevsk rifle. The Russians were very good at reusing good parts, so put the receiver back into service with a later produced barrel. The rifle is sitting in a good condition pre-war stock, with the screwed in escutcheons. 

The rifle also has the re-arsenal stamp /1\ (Triangle 1) which was formerly thought to have been an East German (DDR) marking. It has since been identified as referring to the facilities at 1861st ABV Moscow Military District - Liski.

I had a brand new front disk brake installed(over 80% left easy) and new 300 dollar michelin bobber tires(the best you can put on these scooters) that don't have more than 2000 miles on than, as well as a brand new battery. There is cosmetic damage to the plastic pieces that are really meant to take up the damage, but the paint is all and all in decent shape. I don't have my license here or the plate for its so its been sitting for about 2 months, so theres smoking coming out of the exhaust but some sea foam and burning through this tank of gas and it'll be 100%, however this does not hinder the engines strength it still gets up to about 40mph.

Developed for .223, but also works for all other cartridges, using Nikon’s Spot-On ballistics program ($5 download to your phone), which calculates those aiming points (and intermediate distances) based on your cartridge, including handloads.

The serial number starts with 582XXX. This is the thicker barreled version. 
This Mini 14 comes with 4 genuine Ruger magazines, three 20rd mags and one 30rd mag. 
I installed a custom Trushot-Technologies barrel stabilizer which helps enhance accuracy and eliminate shot stringing. I also installed a front sling stud for bipod mounting or sling. Original front sling mount was removed, but reinstalled for selling. Also included is the picatinny rail shown in the photo, and two sets of Ruger steel scope rings,(1” and 30MM) which can be used with picatinny rail removed. The tuned trigger is amazing! I doubt you will ever find a mini 14 trigger like this one. It has a light but definite first stage, and light crisp second stage, it has a very short take up and reset. In side by side comparison, this trigger is very similar to Geissle SSA-E trigger which really helps with accuracy on the bench and offhand shooting. The action and trigger on this Mini is the absolute smoothest I have ever felt on any Mini 14, and accuracy (with the work done to this rifle) is better than what you can get off the shelf. Group in picture was shot was at 100yds. 
The rifle is used, but only to the extent to test the upgrades. I am confident that the owner of this Mini will not be disappointment.

Asking $850 with all items mentioned included. No trades please.

This item is for sale ONLY to those who currently are legally allowed to purchase firearms in the state of Oregon. I would prefer to sell to an Oregon CHL holder. I will want a copy of your currently active ODL for my records and signed bill of sale. If you are not allowed to legally own firearms in the state of Oregon please do not respond to this offer.

Bore was neglected when I got it, it mostly cleaned up after a good brushing. I don't have the means to remove the stock and soak it in solvent. Groups just fine with the FTX bullets.

The 44cal bullets come from the reloading section of Cabela's, and are much cheaper per hundred than a ""muzzleloading bullet"" I believe they were $40/100, whereas Powerbelts (and Hornady XTPs) from the muzzleloader section are $30/20. Greatly reduced costs, and generally better performance because you are tailoring your bullet weight to where you want it to match powder charge and twist rate in the barrel. I use the same setup in my Encore and it is deadly to 250 on deer, 300 on paper.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable back straps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

I need cash to pay my mortgage, only trade I am interested in is for a 1911 in 45 + cash, an XDS45 with the kit + cash or a Sig or HK in 45acp plus cash. I want a Good one, 600-1000 dollar range; like Sig, Colt, Kimber, Ruger (SR1911 only), Springfield. I am open to color and layout but prefer fullsized or commander in stainless. Trades will work like this; retail price of mine 1500 minus retail price of yours, you make up the cash difference. Make an offer we will go from there, I am only interested in trades in 45acp but will consider a nice 9mm. Don't even bother offering a different Caliber handgun. I am also not interested in an even trade unless it is for an M1A, ACR, SCAR or a Tavor.
