""Just so you can stop sounding like an idiot. The magnet test is irrelevant here because the jacket is bi - metal and attracts a magnet. This is wolf white box and most definitely not steel core""

I think what liam is trying to say above is the jacket is steel with a thin layer of copper and that is why it is magnetic.  I don't know if that is true or not, but it sounds possible.  I do know that the whole round attracts a magnet just like the ad says.

End update.


I have five twenty round boxes of Russian made hollow point SKS/ AK ammo.  The boxes are labelled L.C.B. for lead core bullet but a magnet tells me they are steel core with steel shells.  Visually you can see they are hollow point.

This is personal ammo that I am selling because I don't need it anymore. 

5 boxes of twenty rounds each hollow point ammo for $5 per box."

The Beretta 21A Bobcat is .25 ACP (6.35 mm) ammunition. It has a simple blowback operation, with a single and double action trigger mechanism, and exposed hammer. It has a magazine release button in the left side grip, located between the grip retaining screws. The frame is made out of aluminum alloy; the slide and barrel are either carbon steel or stainless steel, depending on the model. Beretta claims that the pistol is intended for off duty police and pistol carry permit holders that seek a highly concealable, but reliable pistol. Thus in effect, the handgun is designed for self-defense.

User-friendly design is common to all Beretta small frames. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber without racking the slide. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by giving an easy and absolutely safe way to check the bore and and remove a live cartridge. Jamming and stove-piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas.

The AMT Backup was first known as the OMC Backup. This early variant was produced in .380 ACP caliber in El Monte, California. OMC produced a short run of these pistols before the molds were purchased by Arcadia Machine & Tool, who took over production.

The original AMT Backup was produced with a single-action trigger mechanism, while the later Backup II used a double-action-only mechanism. These pistols were manufactured by AMT and later Galena Industries (until November 2001).

This pistol was designed to be carried as a backup gun by law enforcement and security professionals or anyone desiring a small concealable weapon. Its marketing slogan was ""the smallest, most powerful"" backup weapon available.

The OD green G17 is hard to come by and is priced as such.

Interested in trading for: 
- Glock RTF2 w/gills (17/19/23) 
- other Glocks

Cash price is $550 firm."

COLT PISTOL MODEL .25 CALIBER .25

The Model 1908 Vest Pocket is a compact, hammerless, striker-fired, semi-automatic single action pistol. Manufactured by the Colt's Manufacturing Company from 1908 to 1948, it was marketed as a small concealable firearm which could be easily tucked into a gentleman’s vest pocket for unobtrusive carry. Created by famed firearms designer John Moses Browning, the Model 1908 followed Browning’s earlier European version, introduced by Fabrique Nationale de Herstal as the FN Model 1906. Both pistols were chambered for the Browning-invented .25 ACP (Automatic Colt pistol) cartridge.

A Henry rifle is just cool.  The only excuse for not having a Henry H001 is because you have a Henry Golden Boy.  True story.   :)  The benefit of a model H001 is they are meant to be brought to the range, to the woods, or to the back yard and shot, unlike many Golden Boys which just sit in safes and remain pristine - these are shooters.

KEL TEC PISTOL MODEL P-32 CALIBER 32 AUTO

The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.
The P-32 has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

About the Model 686 >
Smith & Wesson introduced the 686 ""L"" Frame Revolver in 1980. It is simply a Stainless Steel Version of the very popular Model 586 which was either Blued or Nickel Plated. The model 686 had the Goncalo Alves Hardwood grips standard until 1994 when S&W Switched to having Hogue supply them. Ascetically, I think the Wood looks much better.

This particular 668-1 has the ""M"" Stamp for the recall work being done by the factory. The recall was for the Firing Pin Bushing as it was found to weaken when using a steady diet of .357 Magnum Loads. It has the 6"" barrel with Full Under-Lug. I am not the original owner so I cannot speak of round count but I personally put 24 flawless rounds through it myself. The changes for this revision (-1) are the ""Radius Stud Package"" and the ""Floating Hand"". The Single Action trigger on this beautiful S&W Wheel Gun is Amazing.

I was a gunsmith many years ago; this was one of my personal rifles. I used it for a display at shows and then I hunted a couple deer seasons with it. The rifle only has about 2 boxes of ammo thru it.

This gun started out as a Savage sporter. I removed the factory med weight barrel and replaced it with a heavy barrel that was properly head spaced to the action. The barrel was re-crowned, threaded 5/8-24 and a LR-308 flash hider was added. Everything is trued up and smoothed out. The entire barreled action was cleaned, stripped down, aulm oxide blasted and coated with KG Teflon Gun Kote OD green. The bolt is coated in KG Teflon black along with the DNZ scope mount. The trigger has been lightened and is crisp, but not so light to be unsafe for hunting or field use. The rifle is mounted in an OD green and black spider web style B&C stock. The bipod and case is included with it.

I was a gunsmith many years ago; this was one of my personal rifles. I used it for a display at shows and then I hunted a couple deer seasons with it. The rifle only has about 2 boxes of ammo thru it.

This gun started out as a Savage sporter. I removed the factory med weight barrel and replaced it with a heavy barrel that was properly head spaced to the action. The barrel was re-crowned, threaded 5/8-24 and a LR-308 flash hider was added. Everything is trued up and smoothed out. The entire barreled action was cleaned, stripped down, aulm oxide blasted and coated with KG Teflon Gun Kote OD green. The bolt is coated in KG Teflon black along with the DNZ scope mount. The trigger has been lightened and is crisp, but not so light to be unsafe for hunting or field use. The rifle is mounted in an OD green and black spider web style B&C stock. The bipod and case is included

The optic is The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the US Army's M4 weapon system (14.5"" barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator."

I was a gunsmith many years ago; this was one of my personal rifles. I used it for a display at shows and then I hunted a couple deer seasons with it. The rifle only has about 2 boxes of ammo thru it.

This gun started out as a Savage sporter. I removed the factory med weight barrel and replaced it with a heavy barrel that was properly head spaced to the action. The barrel was re-crowned, threaded 5/8-24 and a LR-308 flash hider was added. Everything is trued up and smoothed out. The entire barreled action was cleaned, stripped down, aulm oxide blasted and coated with KG Teflon Gun Kote OD green. The bolt is coated in KG Teflon black along with the DNZ scope mount. The trigger has been lightened and is crisp, but not so light to be unsafe for hunting or field use. The rifle is mounted in an OD green and black spider web style B&C stock. The bipod and case is included

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

Scope is Nikon Buckmaster 4.5-14 x 40 with a Mil-dot reticle. For those unfamiliar with Mil-dot, it's a fantastic way to calculate holdover.  Many ballistic tables will give holdover in mils.  There is also a method to calculate distance and a booklet explaining this and ""mil-dot master"" will be sent with the rifle.

Blue Book of guns has MSRP at $720 for the Rifle and $575 for 100% condition and Amazon is selling the scope new at $325.

This rifle is in immaculate condition.  The barrel went through a very slow and strict break in process right out of the box.  Mostly a hunting rifle.  Very low round count. Estimated round count under 200.

Hoping to get $650 for the rifle and scope combo.  

More pictures of anything you want upon request."

For sale to legal Wisconsin residents only, I will not ship!

I am offering up my now banned from importation Molot VEPR 12 shotgun.  This shotgun started life as a fixed wooden stock model but as you can see I have since converted it.  The gun has a Bonesteel collapsible/left side folding M4 stock, Red Jacket Mojo muzzle brake, Chaos quad rail forearm and Tapco G2 fire control group.  Original parts included as well.

The gun comes with 3 original Molot 5 round Russian magazines, 4 SGM 12 round magazines and a Truglo red/green dot sight.  

I have only fired about 50 rounds through this gun and it has cycled everything from cheap #8 trap loads to 00 buckshot to slugs without a hiccup and without needing to adjust any gas settings.  The VEPR 12 is the gold standard of the AK shotguns with a thicker RPK style 1.5mm receiver and a self-adjusting gas system, AR style loading, chrome lined barrel,  chamber,  receiver shaft and  gas chamber and last round bolt hold open.

This truly is a great shotgun!  I have over $2000 invested in this gun!"
