If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x8"" Text or call Cody @ 480-228-8195 or call 520-723-92five-five
(Please serious buyer's only)

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the complete set of Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates would be $300.00"

Manufactured to the highest quality standards and featuring a patent pending design, the LANTAC DGN556B Muzzle Brake offers improved recoil management and muzzle rise over competitors products.

Full auto fire is possible with massively reduced recoil and muzzle climb, meaning that all shots fall on target.

I will pay for transfer if the deal is right. 

The Duty One has long been a great seller for STI but in 2013 they took the opportunity to incorporate Customer suggested changes into the model before expanding the line to include the 3” & 4” versions. “The new Duty one line is a unique evolution”, said STI’s President and CEO Tim Dillon “We went out and redesigned our light railed guns to surpass the design and quality of any railed 1911 style on the market today.” Changes include new ‘grid’ serrations and matching front strap which are as stylish as they are functional, abbreviated front cocking serrations, a redesigned tactical rail, smaller engravings, and new G10 mycarta grips. All 3 versions are built on forged steel, standard width frames with STI’s innovative new picitany rail system. Flat checkered mainspring housings provide an excellent hold and the controls are STI International’s singled sided thumb safeties and STI International high-rise beavertail grip safeties. The Duty One features include traditional 1911 styling with lowered and flared ejection port, STI TAS adjustable low-snag rear sight and the STI ramped front for an easy sight picture. The barrels are either a 5.01” or 4.26” fully supported STI International ramped barrel with match grade bushing or, in the case of the Duty One 3.0, a 3.24” bull barrel. All Duty One pistols come standard with STI International commander style hammers and patented STI International trigger systems.

This stuff is great in any semi-auto I have put it through, including a Ruger SR-22 and Ruger 10/22.
Price is firm. Local pick up only.

With the standard Colt stock, the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30.5 in (77.5 cm) in length and weighs only 6.8 lb (3.08 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Furthermore, the hand guard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. It is built with a 16.1"" 1:7 twist barrel. The 6920 comes equipped with a Magpul MBUS backup sight. Includes olive green Colt manual, lock, quick release sling swivel, and a 30 round Gen2 PMAG"

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

It is chambered in 10mm and has the blind markings so it does not have that ugly wolf showing on top of your ejection port. All the markings are on the underside so they do not show when the barrel is installed. I ordered this back on the 6th of January and after 3 changes to the backorder availability date it just now arrived. Unfortunately I no longer have my Glock so I am just trying to get most of my money back and save some other 10mm enthusiast a few, maybe several, month wait. I paid $169 for the setup with blind markings and delivery but will let it go for $140. When my truck is out of the shop I will be more available to travel within reasonable distance for a deal but today I am limited to the Maple Valley area. I will knock $10 off a deal today in Maple Valley just to help off set fuel cost on your end though. So $130. 

Feel free to email me with any questions and I can probably send a picture or two upon request but with the exception of it having no Lone Wolf logo on top of the chamber it looks no different than what you see on their website.   

Thanks for looking and happy shooting to you all.  -""Cheers!"""

It has internal holding straps to hold your hand gun in place if it is mounted on a wall, under a desk, table or chair via the mounting holes on the bottom. It has a foam lining to protect the Firearm. It takes about 1-2 seconds average to open the safe. It can store 100 finger prints so you can store all of your fingers plus your Spouses and your Best Buddy's prints too!
This meets the California law of transporting a Handgun in the cab of the car or truck. You can also move it from the vehicle to the range and meet the Range rules of entering the Range with your firearm in a locked box. It includes a security cable that can be connected to the seat frame making it very difficult to remove from the Vehicle while locked. The Safe requires 4 AA batteries that are NOT included and will last about 1000 scanned openings. It has 2 tubular keys to open it should the batteries fail. I have many of them around the house ready incase of an Home invasion or wild animal attacks on my dogs. Easily will fit in most night stand drawers.

This rifle in made in the style of a Hawkins rifle and has a wooden stock. Included with the rifle is a camo soft case made by the Allen Co.  

There is a full box of Proxen Power Pellets plus some extra pellets in the tubes, because I used the pellets instead of loose powder I had trouble with the pellets firing. Until I replaced the #10 percussion nipple with a hotter # 11.  There is a new nipple on the rifle and 2 new still in the package, along with a full box of #11 percussion caps (might be 10 or 11 gone).  

There are 3 different weight bullets with the rifle. There are 10 – 300 grain bullets and sabots (I had hoped to go Elk hunting). 12 Power Belt Bullets and sabots, I want to say 250 grain, still in the package unopened. There are 11 bullet and sabots I think these are 200 grain I have shot a couple of these.

There is a Thompson Center Black Powder Cleaning Kit, and a powder horn. This is a real horn and can be made to work, I have never fooled with it because I use the pellets.

There are two knives from Smokey Mountain Knife Works. They have Fake Plastic handles and Damascus blades.  I had hoped to replace the handles with dear horns and make sheaths from deer hides, but sickness has stoped that...

I have an surplus military magazine pouch I use for a “Possables Bag”, that hold's all the powder, bullite, etc. the knives,  powder horn and cleaning kit fit in the case with the rifle.

The best I can figure I have $150.00 in the rifle and probrbly $180.or $190.00 in the accessories, for a tota of somewhere around $330.00 or $340.00.

These rifles, like all Belgian Brownings, have beautiful fit & finish. This gun is in excellent condition with only a few of the usual handling marks. The 5 round Magazines for these older Belgian models are going for up to $200 each last I looked & this rifle comes with THREE of them!
The catch is; one mag is a little 'iffy' & prefers to hold only 4 rounds, but the other 2 function flawlessly. These guns are renowned for quality & accuracy. Asking price is $850, or will trade for silver----unless you have a better idea."

I don't respond to emails asking ""will you take any less?"" or ""what's your bottom dollar?” I'll gladly negotiate over a trade by email or phone, but not cash price.  The only time I negotiate cash price (if it is even negotiable) is when money is on the table.

Any transaction will be F2F in a public place, and I'll want to see an Ohio DL confirming you are 21 and an Ohio resident. I'll also want a signed receipt to keep stating you are legally qualified to buy the gun under Ohio law and any other laws that might apply (this is your responsibility to know), and am willing to give you a signed receipt for your records. I collect and shoot firearms for a hobby. This means sometimes I have firearms to sell that I no longer want, or didn’t appeal to me as much as I expected once I got them. When I do sell one, my goal is to do everything by the book; I've no intention of violating the law. Thank you for understanding."

 The .223 Wylde hybrid chamber was designed by Bill Wylde of Greenup, IL to exploit the accuracy advantages of the .223 Remington commercial chambering without pressure problems or compromising the functional reliability when using the high velocity 5.56x45mm NATO militaryammunition. It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when 
 using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers.

Rifle was first a Spikes AR that was factory built
The buttstock was swapped to a B5 SOPMOD for the nicer cheek weld when using the scope. The handgaurds were removed and swapped to the Troy Alpha rail and I have rail sections for it still. The front and rear sights included would be my MBUS pair, and not the PRO ones I got recently. I have 10 magazines for it, 9 PMAGs and 1 H&K translucent one. The charging handle is a PRI GasBuster for suppressed shooting if your into that, or it simply offers a nicer charging handle with the extended latch. KAC VFG is siting under my rail which helps with an extended hold on the rail. The optic is a PA 1-6 GenII in a PA deluxe extended mount. Has a sling mounted attached to the buffer tube. 

Also have 500 rounds of Wolf Gold and 500 Tula steel cased for sale with it or added into it for the right deal.
