 The TRAVIS HALEY SKIMMER ENHANCED CARRY TRIGGER SYSTEM gives your Glock the performance of a stock 1911. Manufactured using 100% OEM parts, all of the metal components are individually hand polished to a mirror finish for consistent, reliable action. The mated surfaces glide freely, adding a smooth short transition into a predictable wall. The trigger break is crisp and clean, reducing muzzle movement. This is made possible by our unique pre-travel reduction modification, which is non-adjustable. Multiple inspection points are part of the production process. This system is completely drop-in with no fitting required. Designed for Carry Use.

Kimber Tactical Pro II.

I purchased this new a few years back and haven't used it enough to justify keeping it.
I am concentrating on long guns now. In excellent condition. Comes in original box with all the original paperwork, and the original factory magazine.
I prefer cash face to face with a bill of sale, but if you need me to ship it we can do an ffl transfer through my local gun shop to yours.
You pay for the shipping and the ffl transfer.

Call me if you have any more questions.
Thanks.

FROM SIG WEBSITE - ""With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.  With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.  Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.

I'm looking to sell this package deal because I just don't need this rifle and have no need for the other components. I've looked all over and I believe for everything in this package it is a fair asking price but I am more than happy to negotiate. It has never been fired and I have the original packaging. I have two other AR-15's at my disposal so this one is uneeded but I see it as a possible start up kit for anybody looking for a high quality AR with a lot to use right out of the box. This is the official page from DPMS if you would like to view it.

A fusion of their most advanced performance features in both tactical and
varmint rifles, the Model 700 Varmint-Tactical Rifle (VTR) is a
revolutionary system optimized for extended range precision and mobility.
Its triangular barrel contour is a product of years of rigorous research
and development focused on reducing weight, enhancing rigidity and
promoting rapid heat dissipation. To decrease recoil and muzzle jump, this
uniquely contoured 22"" barrel has an integral muzzle brake that’s machined
in during production. Along with the barrel design, brought together a host
of other cutting edge features on this super accurate Model 700 platform.
The results are nothing short of astounding. Chambered for the inherently
tight grouping 223 and 308 calibers, each model engineered with a rate of
twist optimized for tactical style bullets, the Model 700 VTR is compact
and swift handling thanks to its sleek lines and short action. The
legendary “three-rings-of-steel��� and the many other superior design
elements of this rifle deliver the highest degree of out-of-the-box
accuracy available today. Plus, it’s matched with the new X-Mark Pro
Trigger system for the ultimate in crispness and shot control. For improved
consistency, the green synthetic stock has a vented beavertail forend that
promotes rapid cooling. Its overmold accents provide a firm gripping
surface, and the dual sling swivel studs permit convenient attachment of a
bi-pod and a sling.

It's a solid shooter grade rifle. made in 1940, Non matching serial numbers. The M38 is the same rifle as the M44 and Type 53 in every respect save it never had a side folding bayonet. These were generally issued to rear echelon troops with little need for a bayonet.

This is a second year of production rifle. This one is not as much a collector (very little interest there for a mutt like this) but as a general shooter, hunter. base for a custom build, it's the place to be. Condition is fair to good. the bore is weak, but still serviceable. (If you want to replace it for an accurized target shooter or whatever, i can put you on a site that has original and custom bull barrels for sale) Someone has replaced the rear sight blade with a mojo peep style. No import stamps.

It is what it is, a solid shooter that you can go several directions with.

Most battle firearms don't have the same magazine, some do. But in battle serial numbers weren't an issue, just working order..lol Just some additional info: I have been told when taken apart a nambu, you may want to purchase new set of recoil springs since you don't know when they were changed last time and save the originals for collect-ability reasons. New nambu recoil springs on ebay are are around $15.00. I didn't change them, because i didn't think it needed them. I've never shot it myself, i find bullets are hard to find. I bought it just for collection, but love to shoot my ww11 collections also, but bullets are just hard to find.. I'm willing to trade for another ww11 firearm or sell out right.  Ship to your FFL or C&R $30.00 or just come by and pick up.

The Colt Python was discontinued in 2005.  I as well as many other gun enthusiasts consider the Colt Python the best premium revolver ever made.  It features precision adjustable sights, a smooth trigger, solid construction, and extra metal.  The firearm is in almost new condition, no scratches, the bore is shiny with sharp rifling. The signs of wear are just about nonexistent since I only put maybe 40 rounds through it and it's been put away for many years.  The timing and lock up are tight, end play is great and action is smooth! This would be a great addition to any collection!  I don't believe I have the box since I have had it in a gun pouch wrapped in an oil cloth but I will check.  Photos may show lint and/or smudges but they ARE NOT scratches."

Hey all,
I have up for trade or sale a sweet 1911. This is a Taurus PT1911 in used but great condition. It has a few marks on the muzzle end of the slide, but nothing too bad. I would keep this by I really am looking more for a compact 1911 than a full size. This will come with 2 magazines, factory box, and factory barrel brush. Need to meet up in Norman on this one due to my schedule. 

In terms of trades, I am somewhat open. I would consider a Kel-Tec PMR30, Decent AK (no 74s), XDS in 45, Ruger GP100, a nice Marlin 30/30 (plus boot), 223/5.56 semi rifles and even other semi-auto rifles or other handguns. I would consider a Bolt action rifle, but it would have to be pretty slanted in my favor for me to do it because aside from that lever 30/30 i only want another semi-auto. I would even trade up to an entry level AR. Some trades will need boot on your end, some will need on mine. I also have a substantial amount of JHP 45 ammo that I could sell with or add to to even out the values. For any questions or to make an offer shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

Dillon Precision is famous for their high quality equipment and incredible NO BS lifetime warranty. Right from their website, ..... they don't care if you are the 1st owner or the seventeenth owner.... the equipment has a lifetime warranty that will go with the equipment where ever it goes. I can't think of any other company that stands behind their products and customers like this. They don't want serial numbers or registration cards.... they want to make it right, and right now. I have personally dealt with their customer care department and was very pleased and impressed. We discussed the issue, the customer care operator worked with me to troubleshoot an issue, two days later I had a brand new replacement part on my doorstep without paying a dime (for the part or for the shipping). I didn't even need to send back the old part. Needless to say, I can't say enough about their warranty policy. Second to none!

As you can see, it's decked out and ready for more accessories. I've put about 200 rounds through it, and it's operated flawlessly and is amazingly accurate. Best part: it takes standard Glock mags, either the 17 round ones or the 33 round ones....AND the aftermarket 33 round mags work perfectly in this pistol.

As you can see from the links above, this kit would be about $1400 before shipping and transfer costs, AND the upper is currently backordered. So if you want this now without all of the waiting, fees, and paperwork, contact me.

In terms of trades, I love Glocks, and I'm also looking for a Walther P99 (9mm only) or an HK P7. I might consider a swap on a high-end 300BLK AR. I am NOT interested in bolt rifles, 1911s, shotguns, or cheap crappy handguns.

I am willing to separate them and sell the upper and lower separately, but I can sell the lower only to a resident of Alabama over the age of 21, and I'm not willing to drive very far outside of Birmingham. A bill of sale will be required, and having an Alabama county carry permit will make things go a lot more smoothly."

Due to a recent policy change at work (one I'm not happy about), up for sale is my EDC Kimber Super Carry Ultra custom.  

3"" barrel, chambered for .45 ACP, with ambidextrous thumb safety and several Kimber custom job mods: enhanced trigger job (lighter pull, ~3.5 lbs, zero slack), match grade barrel, scallops instead of checkering for grip on both the front/back strap and slide, and premium slide coating (Keratote if I'm not mistaken).  Dehorned all the way around for snag-free carry.  Not a sharp or semi-sharp edge on this pistol.  

Purchased Xmas 2012 (I'm the original owner), with ~350 rounds put through it.  I deploy often, so it sits in my safe for months at a stretch.  It IS my EDC, and has slight holster wear on the slide finish.  However this does not in any way affect the function of the gun.  

Comes with 2x 7-round Kimber magazines, each with extended Wilson floor plates.  I have the original floor plates, as well as extra bumpers if you want them.  

Comes with the 2x holsters shown (a RH straight up/down or FBI cant ride with spare mag holder and a Crossbreed IWB clone).  Also comes with factory original hard case, take down tools, a handful (~10) snap caps, 20x rounds of 50-grain civil defense rounds (HP, muzzle velocity ~2,000 fps, shatter and discharge energy completely upon impact, similar to the Hornady critical defense rounds), and about 300 range-quality ball rounds....I'm getting out of .45 so you get it all.  

Asking $1,100 firm.  It's worth it.  If you're on the fence or not convinced, come meet me at my range and test drive it for a few mags.  I'd do the same if I was considering spending my hard-earned money, so I have no objections if you want to do so.  

All the basics apply: must have drivers license or state/military ID and a CCW or some other ID.  Must be willing to sign a basic bill of sale for CYA purposes.  I'm in Arlington and can meet within a reasonable distance.  Weekdays after 7pm and weekends are pretty open.  REDACTED.  Email anytime, or call/text between 7am - 10pm.  Please no calls or texts after 10.  Sorry, but I don't do Paypal or Bitcoin or any other online forms of payment.  Strongly prefer F2F, but will ship to your FFL if you're willing to pay costs both ways.
