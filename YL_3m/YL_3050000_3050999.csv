I have a Robin Hood No. 1 pocket revolver. It is chambered in .22 short, and was made in 1876 (So no FFL needed). I'd say it has about 80% - 70% of it's Nickle plating left. It holds 7 rounds and has a 2 inch barrel. 

The cylinder rotates freely (it was designed to) and the lock up is slightly loose. This is an easy fix, however, as the hand can be removed and peened slightly, then filed and it will be in perfect time. It could be fired without doing this, however this is not recommended. I may do it myself if I get around to it.

What I have here is an investment and collector grade 100% correct according to ""US WW2 M1 Carbine production 7th ED book"". This rifle is unreal and has been a centerpiece of my collection for years. They simply dont get much better than this. If you dont know carbines you cant appreciate and if you do youll wonder why I am selling. I am retiring to the Phillippines and I am selling all firearms baring a few. 

I have included only few pictures as there is simply too much to list as far as type this part etc. If you are a serious collector I will spend the time going over it with a fine tooth comb with you. For staters, the wood is a high wood, with carthouches and 2 prong hand guard. Original sight, bands, parts, milled lower, etc. Every piece has been verified by the book. A rifle only 2000 digits off with the same specs sold on Gunbroker a little while ago for $2650 with 17 Bids.  11-43 Production. No import marks of course..

I am not considering any trades.

PACKAGE INCLUDES:

1. Rifle with Repro Sling
2. 2 WW2 Mags
3. 600 Rounds (Brass, FMJ in Boxes )
3. Repro WW2 Rifle Bag with zipper.

If you ever wanted a true, original M1 Carbine with all the trimmings this is it. The rifle runs perfect although It has been a safe queen for years on my watch. I hate to let it go but I must. 

Please Fellas, Serious buyers as this is a premium firearm. At this price I am giving it away considering it comes with $300 worth of ammo.

Ammo and clips are clean and in very nice shape. There are some dark spots intermittently on the brass but not many considering this ammo was made in 1939. 

Ammo itself is brass case with cupronickel jackets and it does attract s magnet. There are five 20 round clips in the box. 

The box is in fantastic shape and it's well & clearly marked. Box was sealed until I opened it to inspect the ammo and take these pictures. I had a hard time deciding on whether to open or not, but felt I needed to inspect everything before I listed it. 

This is quite collectible today and original 7.35 Carcano ammo sells for $45+ per 18 round box on GunBroker all the time. 

I believe this particular ammo is even more collectible & valuable loaded on the Breda clips in their original 1939 box.

I purchased this P226R back in 2012 as the tacpac. Cost nearly 1200 then. Last year I sent it off to Bruce Gray who does some of the best custom Sig work in the US. He set me up with his short reset and lighter competition trigger and upgraded the extractor spring. I got it back and shot 300 rounds. Loved it but needed more done. So I sent it to TJcustomgunworks. There they did a whole package of reduced recoil spring, shortening the ejector, custom hammer spring, reduced weight, deburred the slide and made it smooth as can possible be to rack the slide. Also polished and deburred the feed ramp. Total cost of work done on the gun with parts close to another 1000. Only 600 rounds shot. Price is firm and no trades will be considered at all. Price is set at $1000. I also have for sale in Arizona. Pics will be sent only through text in order to make sure buyers are serious. Thanks.

I'm selling this one cause i picked up another a few weeks ago and i plan to upgrade it and use for competition. Sale includes custom kydex holster, 3 mags, and the sig tacpac holster. Gun is in great condition with signs of wear on the barrel from shooting 600 rounds.

I got it back and shot 300 rounds. Loved it but needed more done. So I sent it to TJcustomgunworks. There they did a whole package of reduced recoil spring, shortening the ejector, custom hammer spring, reduced weight, deburred the slide and made it smooth as can possible be to rack the slide. Also polished and deburred the feed ramp. Total cost of work done on the gun with parts close to another 1000. Only 600 rounds shot. Price is set at $1000.

From that i can say this thing fires great with a nice pattern.  The only reason I'm selling it is its just not my style of weapon, i dont have much use for it.

I can't conceal this pistol (or any other double stack for that matter) so it isn't really doing me any good. I would prefer the middle sized CZ or clone models for a truck/range gun, or maybe a p938 or 1911 for conceal. I do not like polymer of striker-fired pistols at all please."

(Bipod and Pelican Case not included). Built: 2009. Action: FN SPR, .535 magnum bolt face, Right Hand, Short Action. Action and first 1.75 inches of barrel has been glass bedded with DevCon steel bedding. Stock: McMillan TMP adjustable- features sniper fill, adjustable length of pull and comb, extra front bipod stud, textured grip and fore end. Original black paint (was painted using camo spray paint which can be removed). This stock was designed for a government agency (I believe possibly for the FBI's HRT when they were testing the SPRs). Mcmillan only made a limited number of them. Barrel: Douglas air gauged #6 light target straight taper, .75 at muzzle, recessed target crown, 1:10 twist, chromoly. Rail: Picatinny, FN Manufacture. Rings: 30mm, MED height. They are of either IBA or Badger Ordnance manufacture. I cannot definitively recall but those are the only two sources of rings I purchase. Finish: Dark Charcoal Parkerizing. Note: there is a very thin scratch in the finish along the stock line on the non-bolt side of the action; presumably from when it was being glass bedded. Overall, the rifle is very comfortable to shoot and balances well in non-standard shooting positions. The rifle received a proper break in using a 1-1-1-1-1,5-5-5-5-5 procedure. It has less than 150 rounds through it. I do have all receipts for machine work upon request.  Thanks for your interest."

The rifle is in great condition and fires great.  Barrel is in good shape, and it is very accurate.  All the Serial Numbers match, except the bayonet, if I remember correctly, which is normal for these weapons.  Bolt is very smooth. I know I still have the strap that comes with it, and I believe I also still have the oil can as well.  At our local outdoor range, at 100 yards with the stock iron sites, I can explode pop cans every single shot with this. I do have a fastener on the forestock for attaching a bipod to it as well. Bipod is NOT included. I also have a butt stock pad on the end, which I will include if you want it.  Also included is 300 rounds of Military surplus FMJ ammunition and 20 rounds of modern boat tail soft tip ammunition as well.  150.00 firm.  These weapons are selling for more than that now over the past couple years, not including any ammo with them.

 A fun skill building & networking event with an informal competitive spirit and just a great excuse to gather with friends and shoot some steel targets. 
 ......

 We are bringing Northeastern Colorado together thru this monthly Long Range Shooting Event. 
 Good Fun is Mandatory!

 Shoot one to two different stages, when everyone is finished you probably can even run them again – your choice. The courses of fire will involve the Pawnee Sportsmen's Center 1,000yd Steel Target Range AND some Natural Terrain. There are always bragging rights and many opportunities to learn more about the sport and improve your gear, ammo, rifle. Mile High Shooting Accessories will have staff on hand to speak with about Long Range Shooting.

 This event is considered an Outlaw Long Range Event even though we follow pretty closely all standard competitive shooting safety rules. What makes it really super cool is that a stage(s) of any given match uses the Natural Terrain of Pawnee Sportsmen's Center (1,800 acres and one of Colorado's largest range facilities) in the courses of fire. This Long Range Event is meant to be fun for all levels of shooters – beginners are encouraged and always welcome.
