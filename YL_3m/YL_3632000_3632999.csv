It is a one of a kind, heavy piece that is stunning in appearance.

I will throw in the remaining .45acp ammo I had for my hi point .45 that I no longer have. Asking 650 but will negotiate. No trades. Need the cash for bills. Also if you pay asking price I'll throw in a new set of lee 4 piece die set I used to reload 10 shells. Also have a 1 lb bottle of accurate #5 I'll throw in for 30 and I paid 39 for it.  Must buy gun to get deal on dies and powder. Text or call is best. I'm jason and have done business often on here. Mostly buying but not selling. Non felon of course with valid ID is all I ask. CWP a plus but not a deal breaker as long as you have your I'D and sign bill of sale. Send any offers but I will tell you know I have a pawn shop that's offered 500 for me to pawn it.

It is chambered in 9MM and has a 6+1 capacity.  The barrel length is 3"" and the overall length is about 5 and 1/2"".  The unloaded weight is 15.9oz with a magazine inserted.  It is double-action only, and there is no eternal safety on this firearm.  The trigger pull weight is 6.5 pounds.

This was purchased new from Cabelas just over 2 years ago.  I've put about 600 rounds through it, and it's never giving me any problems. It has been cleaned and oiled regularly and shows almost no signs of wear at all.  

This is a very small handgun and is a perfect choice for concealed carry.  I have often worn it in an OWB holster under a t-shirt.  It can almost be completely concealed in the palm of your hand.

This includes the firearm with the original magazine, trigger lock, box with instructions and all other paperwork, extra magazine, and two holsters.  The magazines have had the original flush floor plates swapped with polymer floor plates with ""pinky"" extensions which add about 1/2"" in length and allow you to  get a much tighter grip.   I have added a textured grip from Talon Grips, which also add a bit of stability to the grip (this can easily be removed).  The holsters are both leather, one is a black OWB belt holster and the other is a Galco IWB soft leather holster.

This 450 Marlin ammunition is safe and is designed for use in ANY/ALL 450 Marlin firearms in normal operating condition.

We always use factory stock firearms to determine our published velocities, so you get true, actual field velocities with our ammo -- not exaggerated long laboratory test barrel velocities.

1.     Item 22A (430gr. Hard Cast Penetrator)

1901 fps Marlin 22 inch barrel
1860 fps Marlin 18.5 inch barrel
2.     Item 22B (405gr. JFN Expander)

1974 fps Marlin 22 inch barrel
1930 fps Marlin 18.5 inch barrel 
3.     Item 22C (500gr. FMJ-FN Barnes Buster Penetrator)

1600 fps Marlin 22 inch barrel
1558 fps Marlin 18.5 inch barrel


You'll note that these 450 Marlin loads are generating slightly lower velocities than their 45-70 counterparts. This is because the 450 Marlin brass (as made by Hornady) has a heavier web  and as such the powder capacity was lessened, so the amount of propellant we can fit into the case is slightly less than with Starline 45-70 brass.

Item 22A -- utilizes a flat nosed hard cast non-expanding bullet that will penetrate 5 to 6 straight line feet in muscle and bone.

Item 22B -- utilizes a bullet that expands to an inch or more at our velocities and hence penetration is limited to about two feet in flesh and bone. This is the single most effective hog and black bear load ever devised in 450 Marlin. I won't use it on animals weighing over 800 lbs as it won't give adequate penetration at bad angles for animals for animals over 800 lbs. If you'll limit yourself to broadside (double lung) and CNS hits, this load will work on animals up to 2,000 lbs.

Item 22C -- utilizes a FMJ-FN bullet designed to penetrate 5 to 6 feet in flesh and bone."

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

An economically priced rifle that's earned the title of ""most popular 22 in the world."" Since the Model 60 was first developed in 1960, it has continuously represented a great value. It has a 19"" Micro-Groove rifled barre, cross-bolt safety, manual bolt hold-open and a patented automatic ""last-shot"" bolt hold-open, a safety feature that locks the bolt half way open after you've fired the last shot, allowing you to see clearly into the open action. And with features such as its sleek hardwood stock, a brass inner magazine tube, which completely eliminates the rust problems you come us against with steel tubes, and a precision-crowned muzzle for enhanced accuracy, it's easy to see why the Model 60 continues to be one of America'a best selling rifles.

Specifications:

- Caliber: 22 Long Rifle Only
- Capacity: 14-shot tubular magazine with patented closure system
- Action: Self loading; side ejection; manual and automatic ""last-shot"" bolt hold-opens; receiver top has serrated, non-glare finish; cross-bolt safety; steel charging handle

Magpul ACS (Milspec) Stock The patented Magpul ACS (Adaptable Carbine/Storage) – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. A streamlined, anti-snag profile shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. Similar to the Magpul CTR®, the ACS also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy*. Dual, rear accessible, water-resistant battery storage tubes and an integral storage compartment in the butt of the stock provides multiple storage options. The ACS comes standard with a 0.30"" thick rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

The rifle with the chassis installed has 50 rounds fired. The XLR chassis is a wonderfully sturdy setup and I have very much enjoyed using it. I beleive it compares well to other chassis that sell for $1000. The SWFA Super Sniper Series of scopes are unbelievably well built for $300. They have some of the strongest turrets you will find on a scope under $1000. The SS x10 was created out of a contract solicitation from the Naval Surface Warfare Center. The SS won the contract and are built TOUGH. There is a great video giving an in depth explanation of the SFWA scopes here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fe4l_CAthI . Everything put into this rifle has been top notch and it has performed to those standards. Unfortunately I must part with this rifle as I require funds for life. I built this setup to get into medium-long range shooting and expected to do well out to 600yards and beyond with time, practice and learning.

This setup is Sub Moa at 100 yards with reloads and match grade ammunition. The scope is zeroed at 300 and out performs my shooting capabilities. I had good luck with 168gr Sierra matchkings and 180gr sierra match king projectiles with tac powder.

out, or has a burr somewhere.  Just never sent it back to find out.

If you know the SAA insides, it should be a very easy thing to remedy and
have yourself a real gem from about 30-years back.

Above average in fit and finish next to most of today's comparable CAS units.

Has original factory box and owner's manual.

This is the most insanely overbuilt trailer in the history of mankind! This thing rides on 37"" Goodyear runflats and has a 16 inches of ground clearance (just like the HUMMWV). On top of that, it can hold (according the the data plate) 1940 Lbs in the bed....yeah right! The M1102 trailer, which is IDENTICAL (except for the data plate) is listed as being abale to carry a payload of 2740 Lbs. So, this thing can, in reality, carry at least that much. The military also states their ratings as the off-road rating, which is always half of the on road capacity. Loading it above what the data plate states is at your own risk, but when you see this thing, you'll realize it can haul a house.

The condition of the trailer is REMARKABLE! It's all aluminum bed is in amazing shape, and may never have been issued (it certainly wasn't shipped to a combat zone and abused). All of the parts are there, including the rear landing legs. The jerry can holder is attached and all the lights work. I have converted the tail lights to 12V (just changed out the bulbs) and have replaced the 12-pin military connector with a standard 4-pin connector. The wiring is still all there if you have a military truck and need the 12-pin plug. Has surge brakes that help a ton when carrying a heavy load. The trailer itself only weighs 1460 Lbs!

It is in .223 caliber so if you have an AR-15 you need this. It comes with a Burris 2-7 handgun scope which by itself is worth $300. It will shoot great groups up to 200 yards at least. It is in very nice shape with some scratches and dings as you would expect. If you have never shot a rifle caliber handgun they are a ton of fun and not that bad with recoil. This one has the canon type breech load that centers the barrel nicely.  It is now on consignment at RSM firearms in Belvidere if you would like to see and handle it.
