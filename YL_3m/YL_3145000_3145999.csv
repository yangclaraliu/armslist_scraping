This rifle is a good option for those that have local laws forbidding pistol grips and high capacity magazines. I will ship to all States that this rifle and the magazines are legal. FFL only. This is a RARE ""Hunter"" model that has a longer barrel and milled receiver. The bipod works well with long magazines - I did not lock it out in the photo, that is why the long mag touches the ground. The bipod will keep it above the surface. I like that the covers can be switched to attach a scope when you wish. This AK Hunter deserves a scope! I purchased the Japanese made Bushnell Scope overseas and you will not see many like it. I find Japanese scopes to be an excellent value, but also just plain excellent."

This rib is used to raise the existing rib, allowing a more upright head shooting position.  A number of these are available on the internet.  Look for yourself.  Please understand that the rib was not made by any of the internet guys.  I made two of the ribs myself out of 6061-T6 and had them professionally anodized flat black. The other is on my shotgun and is working fine.  The rib is 24” long, ½” wide, ½” high and weighs 6 ounces.  

I prefer to attach these with double sided tape used to attach car parts but RTV adhesive can also be used.  We can talk about it when you buy the rib.

The original trigger pull from the factory on these guns is around 8#s, the Apex kit reduces it to near 4#s. These are great shooters at the range and also great for CCW.

Please contact me if you are interested and no, I will not accept a lower bid. Please read the description (taken from the Ruger site) located below:

""The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitride finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.""

 One of the greatest self defense guns ever produced., Like new only fired a few times.

 Made for the very serious business of self-preservation the 605 is built to the Taurus Zero Tolerance standard in design, fabrication, fit and performance. Meaning there is simply no tolerance for parts that do not perform as if someone's life depends on them. Using the powerful .357 Magnum ammo this quick-draw revolver has plenty of muscle to back it up. Features include fixed sights, crisp single-double action trigger and a transfer bar for added safety.

Car is worth what I'm asking for it in it's present condition.

It's a 1990 Plymouth Acclaim, it was bought new in 1990 by my grandmother, and driven less than 3,000 miles per year. It's the 3.0 V6 and 4spd Auto O/D. We are the second owners, it has less than 60,000 miles on it, but for some odd reason, sometimes the transmission will lose all forward gears, but work in reverse, other times it will drive fine. Car runs damn good, and when it drives it drives good, does need shocks and struts, has new front Rotors, and Pads, new Headlight Bulbs, lights converted over to 9007 from 9004. Driverside front window fell off track and busted, Glassworks in Tulsa quotes $180 to come out and install the window.

Has Cruise, Heat, A/C needs charged, power windows, locks, mirrors, heated mirrors and rear window defrost, real top of the line for 1990, and the Acclaim beat out Toyota and Honda as the midsize car of the year for that year.

When criminals, bad guys, insurgents, or terrorist are a constant threat you need to have the best gear possible. When considering your firearm selection quality, reliability, dependability, and necessary features are key factors we look for. Beretta is an excellent choice when purchasing for combat, duty, or defense. Beretta firearms are made of the highest quality components using modern processes and machinery to ensure you have the very best firearm on hand when you need it most. No matter what your need or shooting venue; Military, LEO, Lawful Citizen, Hunter, Competitor, Beretta Firearms are just what you have been looking for. 

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. 

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. 

The Nano's sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

Weighing a mere 13 ounces, it is fed by a six round single column magazine. The pistol’s fixed open iron sights were rather small and rudimentary, but typical for small hideout automatics of its era and adequate for the short range at which it was intended to be used.

It has night sights, Hogue grips, Sig Laser (X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser), extra magazine (extended with pinky rest) and two holsters. The first holster is a Foxx IWB custom made for this gun. It includes the comfort pad. Extremely comfortable holster. I only buy this brand holster for IWB carry because of the comfort and adjustability. This will not fit the gun if the laser is attached. I'm kind of wary about lasers dying when you need them most, so I don't use them. The second holster is something I bought just because. It's a Sneaky Petes holster made for the P938. This holster will allow you to leave the laser attached. Both Holsters were 60 dollars each not including shipping. I'll throw in two mags full of HP ammo.

This is the gun of guns. If you want a piece of American history here it is. Most folks know this gun after Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry made it famous. Now this one is one of the 8-3/8"" variety rather than the 6-1/2"" but for all practical purposes I think the 8-3/8"" is a better choice. With the longer barrel you get a better sight radius, better velocity, and will extend your hunting range if that's your game. The 8"" guns seem to tame the recoil a little better as well over the shorter tubes. The 29-5 was the first model that came with the endurance package standard so this one is here to last. These guns are only going up in value but unfortunately I need some extra cash at the moment so she needs a new home."

If you've never owned a Colt you will understand after handling this one why they have a cult following.  This one has exact replacement stag grips and also includes slightly oversize rubber grips.  One picture is with a S & W chiefs special to illustrate size. Made in 1979.  The person who had it before me stored it poorly and it has some spots of rust and pitting above the grip handles.  Does not affect functioning.  If you want a gun that you can depend your life on this is it, it's hard to argue with six rounds of .357 magnum hollowpoints.

698,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3145698,"For Sale:  NEW: RPP Marlin Big Loop Lever for pistol grip models 308MX, 336, 338MX, 444, 1895","Cypress, TX, Houston, Texas",$ 139,"Listed On: Monday, June 16, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Our Ranger Point Precision big loop lever was designed to put functionality first, with a strong secondary emphasis on style. We felt that current offerings placed far more emphasis on style without addressing practical concerns. 

The Marlin Big Loop Lever is precision CNC machined in chro-moly steel, and military-spec coated in KG Gun Kote for superior wear and corrosion resistance (Gun Metal Blue, Stainless or Flat Black).

Note: Our levers fit all Marlin rifle pistol grip models (308MX, 336, 338MX, 444, 1895) and come assembled with plunger and are made to be a drop-in fit. Ocassionally, minor fitting may be required. Instructions are included.

What Makes Our Lever Better?
1) Current ""big loop"" lever offerings incorporate a loop that is very tall and circular, but the aggressive upper curve still makes gloved fingers bunch together. We made more space fore and aft by flattening and extending the upper curve, allowing the fingers to rest naturally along the pistol grip.

2) The overly tall design of current levers has two effects that we don't care for:
a) it creates an odd lag time when opening the action, while the hand leaves the grip and the fingers travel downward before smacking abruptly into the lower rung of the loop (with bare hands this can get uncomfortable quickly); and b) the loop adds significantly to the height dimension of the rifle and becomes the lowest point. Finish scratches are inevitable, and handiness is sacrificed for style.

3) Our design introduces additional space into the trigger guard area, where it is vital. Gloved fingers are a pretty tight fit in factory trigger guards. That should make anyone nervous when the hammer is back. We also decreased the dimension separating loop and guard, allowing the fingers to sit naturally, close together. In the overlay photo below you can clearly see the generous new space we've introduced in key areas.

4) Aesthetically, we designed our lever to blend more naturally with the lines of the stock, complementing rather than contrasting the attractive curve of the pistol grip. Our design may not pop out as much other big loops, but we feel that it presents pleasing, natural lines that look right.

It is new unfired direct from the factory. This is serious fire power. From the factory: The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

This rifle was made in 1874 with a low serial number of 23308.  It has been updated with a 1879 Buckhorn rear sight, the low arch breech block, and barrel appears to be from around 1879 so it is not in original factory condition but was most likely arsenal refinished at some point.  Unfortunately, the stock contains no cartouches and was also probably arsenal refinished at one time but it is definitely an original Springfield stock with some minor dings and chips.  

Given the rifle's age, it is good condition with a very light pitting in the bore but the bluing is still very strong on the barrel and most of the parts.  It locks up tight still and is complete.     Though I have not shot it yet, ammo is tricky to find since this is a black powder gun, I have run some snap caps through it and the action and ejector work great.  

Since this was made before 1898, it is considered an antique and no FFL is required to purchase this rifle.  I am willing to ship this rifle anywhere in the US and I have a pay pal account setup to make the transition easier.  If you live in Georgia or the surrounding areas, i would be willing to knock an additional $50 dollars off if you want to meet me somewhere and pick it up directly, cash only please.

 pt840 description from taurus:

 This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

The reason it is considered ideal is due to its completely unique safety system, namely the ""squeezecocker"" control surface built into the front of the grip. When the operator picks up the firearm, the main shooting hand instinctually squeezes the panel rearward, and this action cocks the striker rearward while unlocking the sear for use. The panel is spring-loaded, which means when pressure is reduced, it snaps forward, decocking the striker and locking the trigger. This system is also designed to release the slide when it is locked rearward. This design eliminates the need for a decocker, external safety lever or slide stop lever, making the sides of the firearm completely flush and reducing overall width. The barrel is fixed (does not cant upwards) which means despite the firearm's compact size, it is capable of printing groups of 2 inches or less at 25 yards. This accuracy is easily comparable to many high-end automatic pistols in production. It has classic three white-dot sights dovetailed into the slide. I purchased it New in 1996 and have fired approximately 400 rounds through it without a single jam.Will include extra mags and nice holster.OREGON Residents ONLY
