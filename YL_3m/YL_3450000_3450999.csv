I go to school in Grand Junction, so i am there daily monday-thursday. I have 15+ years experience and am offering this service for extra funds while im going to school. If i receive a knife, please give me 48 hours to have it sharpened. It could be finished sooner, but i never know what my workload looks like at school through the week. I never use electronic sharpeners or V shaped fixed stones. I have 2 stones (medium/fine grit) i use frequently and a more coarse stone for really bad blades.  I normally charge $5 for a normal sized pocket knife in average condition. I may charge a few bucks more if the blade edge is below average or if the blade material is D2 machining steel. I do NOT sharpen serrated edges, so if you bring me a knife with one, i can sharpen the plain edge, but nothing else.

--Knife only with no box. Rarely carried in fantastic shape with original edge.

This next generation Para-Military knife features a number of inspiring revisions. The revised handle has a thinner profile at the end to improve the ergonomics and the ambidextrous four-way reversible pocket clip rests deeper in the pocket as well. The blade has an elongated profile, with an increased cutting edge, finger choil and thumb ramp. Implementation of a new Bushing Pivot System generates fluid action and more consistent manufacturing tolerances. The Para-Military still has the solid and confidence inspiring Compression Lock on the handle spine. Lastly, the size of the lanyard hole has been generously increased, giving the use more carry options. This all results in more than just change for the sake of change, it's a real improvement on an already great knife.

I'm getting a Microdot instead of this ACOG. 

If you haven't used the 4x32 ACOG before, the eye relief is very minimal - so you really have to look down through the straw. Military shooters or people familiar with this optic know what I mean. Otherwise, this is a great optic. I use a 3x30 ACOG on my other 16"" gun, and I don't have a need to keep something this nice as a ""backup"" for other nice optics.

His email is REDACTED and REDACTED.  He's either a felon, a fool, or possibly a flake, you decide.

We negotiated a reasonable deal on a handgun I have posted and he said he'd call me in the evening to set up a time and place to meet. Instead he started texting me endlessly at 2 AM from two different numbers asking for more pictures, trying to renegotiate the deal, and trying to meet in the morning instead. When he called me back in the morning to set up the meeting, he gave me a sob story about his car being broken down and tried to get me to meet him at his ""nieces"" house.  I refused and we set up a public place he could take the bus to. Then he complained he didn't have cash after all and offered to make up the balance in ammo. After waiting an hour at the spot with no word I tried calling, but both the cell phones he had texted/called me from weren't his and the people had no idea where Jamal was. He called me later that evening from a third number and said he had found a ride and offered to come to my house and throw in some extra ammo for the deal. I refused, once more set up a public place to meet and told him to call me once he was there and I'd drive over rather than waiting for him. Never heard from him again, thank God.

Seller beware! Whether he's trying to rob you (or worse), get a handgun because he can't legally buy one, or is just a total flake, it's probably best to stay away from this particular guy.

These are made in Turkey and imported to the U.S.
Pistol is a clone/improvement over the Smith and wesson/Walther p99 9mm. 
Pistol has seen approximately 50 rounds. Bought for personal carry but am getting into cowboy action shooting...so some of my handguns need to go.
Pistol comes in factory with case with all factory accessories. 
Includes: 
 Pistol 9mm 
1) 2 17 round magazines
2) Magazine loader
3) Cleaning brush and patch pull-through rod (made of vinyl)
4) Holster with belt clip and paddle clip (paddle installed on holster)
5) second backstrap for bigger hands
6) 3 front sights these are different heights to adjust for aim, plus sight removal/install tools.
7) lock and key
8) Padded, form fit case.
Pistol has a decocker on top of slide that works well and has a 2 stage trigger that removes the creep and slack of most striker fired pistols. The striker has a red rear face that protrudes from the slide to show it is cocked. This is one of the only true double action striker pistols i have found. The first stage of the trigger removes the slack. Once pulled to that point it catches on the second stage, the second stage has the typical slight creep but is a clean and predictable let off. Pistol recoils nicely and Has had no malfunctions being fed winchester white box and self defense ammo. 
Ive started playing cowboy on the weekends and am in need of boosting my six gun collection. will trade for cowboy action six gun. either cap and ball, a cap and ball converted to cartridge or single action 6. would truly love to trade for a Ruger old army or vaquero in 45lc/38spcl or an 1860 army converted to cartridge

This was my father's and was stored in his home in Dallas until recently. I know very little about its history. I have not fired this pistol. I simply looked it over, did a simple function check, took pictures and posted the ad here There are two chips missing from the left side wood grip, everything else appears to be in excellent condition. To the best of my knowledge the round heavy barrel has been discontinued by Browning, is has been replaced with a Slab-side style.

Grips of all sorts, all other sorts of target and tactical accessories and different barrel options are available for this pistol online. It is a very versatile .22lr platform.

I bought a new USC Carbine and had it professionally converted to a semi-auto UMP in .45ACP. It is fully legal with the appropriate parts replaced with US-made ones. This is a fun rifle to shoot and is incredibly accurate once you get the EOTECH Red-Dot Sight dialed in.

Comes with 7 25-rd magazines, sling, and carrying case. This is a great price for an excellent shooter.

FAQ

1. Yes, I am the original owner.
2. The conversion was done by Tactical Excellence who no longer does these.
3. The conversion consisted of replacing the sear with a US-made one and replacing the follower and base plate on four magazines making it full compliant with legal regulations.
4. The original parts come with the rifle.
5. No trades this time around.
6. The price is for the rifle with the EOTech sight. Less than the full price is without the EOTech sight.
7. I don't remember which EOTech sight it is but will post that this weekend when I find the original box.
8. I'd prefer to make this a local sale but will consider shipping to an FFL for a full price offer. Shipping costs will added accordingly."

These are arguably the best receivers made for these guns as the IMBELs are hammer forged and build for military spec under license from FN. Austrian STG kits are also considered the best in quality as they saw little field use and are generally imported in great shape. The receiver alone will cost $400+ and the STG kits go for $800 minimum plus the cost of having a gun smith head space it and install the barrel. Fit and finish is excellent and it shoots great, I have never had a feed or ejection failure of any kind. It comes with a railed dust cover and 1, 20 round magazine. I have additional magazines that can be worked into a deal.

I have fired between 200 and 400 rounds total.  Its a lot of fun to shoot but I decided that I'd rather have an AK74 or 47.  It comes with a refinished stock, two 40 round magazines and one drum magazine.  
The longer barrel makes this AK variant very accurate at range unlike 16"" AK's.  

Also, Its my understanding that Century Arms recently completed manufacturing of these.  The last to come out had the standard wood WASR stock, no bipod or carry handle.  This one has the correct Club Stock and bipod....no carry handle.  It also has the improved compensator. 

Must have proper Nebraska purchase permits etc.
Possible trades are for AK74 or 47's.......Not interested in Romanian WASR's."

I recommend fin fur and feather for buying your consumables, they have great deals on all ball ammo bullets that they sell by weight. No instructions or reloading manuals come with the set. The instructions are online in pdf format and can be downloaded for free, or watch someone show you how to do it on YouTube. The 9mm and 45ACP carbide die sets come with load data for some of the most popular powders and bullet weights. I have hardly used the dies. 

I also have 600 to 700 brass, the majority of which have been tumbled. Mostly 45ACP and 40S&W,  around 250 each, around 100 9mm brass and some 380. Might be some odd rifle brass mixed in there. 

The kit is used. There is some surface rust on some of the metal pieces on the reloader but no damage. The dies are virtually brand new. The brass is almost all once fired with a few twice fired mixed in. 

I know how much the kit costs brand new, around $200 from amazon. The dies are also around $35 per set. Brass ranges in ammo but averages around $40 for 500 depending on caliber. I'm not looking to make money on selling the set, just recoup some of the cost of buying it myself. I'm looking into building an AR15,  so anyone looking to trade parts would be my first choice on a trade. 

My prices are always negotiable and I would except trades or a mix of trades and cash. I'm not going to be an a-hole about negotiating, if it's good its good and if it isn't that's fine - no harm done. If you have always wanted to get into reloading, this set is a great buy. I can't afford to reload because I tend to shoot a lot more when I do, in affect - causing me to spend more money. If you do shoot a lot or are just looking for a hobby,  it would be good for you. I live in Circleville,  South of Columbus,  but work in Columbus so I can bring it when I go to work if you live there. I'm willing to travel halfway in any direction within reason. I can provide my drivers license and ccw,  as well as current homeland security background check proof - but no materials able to be used for identity theft will be provided. Understand that I am a nice guy but will not be very nice at all if someone tries to rip me off. Email me to get a conversation going if you are interested,  then I can provide a mobile phone number. Anyone wanting pictures can look at them on amazon."

This particular Enfield was manufactured in Maltby, U.K. (you can tell by the manufacturing numbers). Wood stock is all original and because so, the wood does have some nicks and shows its age but otherwise is in very good condition. 

I do not believe that magazine is original as there are some filings over numbers on it, but it is rare to find a magazine that was original to the rifle.

I am selling an Eagle Arms Golden Eagle. I have had it for over 10 years now and it has just sat in the safe. Originally I purchased it to collect but have since switched gears and I'm looking to build another platform. The rifle has maybe 5 rounds through it from being zeroed and some handling marks. The guy that I purchased it from had two Eagle Arms lowers that he sent back to the factory to be built as Golden Eagles in 1992 and I have the letter from Armalite as to verify this (for states still behind the line). The Golden Eagle was a competition rifle and has extra heavy barrel under the handguards (barely fits). 

In full disclosure, I want to say that I put a different trigger group in the rifle not too long after receiving it so I am not sure if it is the 2 stage NM trigger from the factory or not. I've had so many AR's over the years its difficult to remember... sorry. (First world problems.. I know). ;) 

Please feel free to contact me if interested or have questions and thank you for taking the time to look.

They've just been collecting dust.  The prices are pretty good, if you consult Google, so I'm not leaving much wiggle-room for negotiation.  

Canon XL1 that I received as part of a trade.  I have never used it to record, but I have powered it on and verified that it works. It has all the cables necessary to hook it up to a TV, but it does not have any media to record, you'll have to buy that on your own. It also comes with a carrying bag.  I'm asking $300 because I just want to free up some space.  You can look on Amazon and Ebay and see the price is more than fair.

2nd item is a skill slot machine.  The manual and operator key are included. It cycles tokens which are included.  They're about the size of a quarter, but I've never tried cycling a quarter through it. It's too loud for my apartment.  Perfect for a man-cave, and could use some TLC with it's lights, but it works. I'm asking $150 for the slot machine.  

3rd item is a Tipman 98 custom.  It's stock, with no modifications.  I haven't shot this gun in a very long time.  It could probably use a good cleaning.  It comes with a co2 tank and it's hopper. I'm asking $75 for this item."

Please visit us for all your shooting needs. We are just starting out and will need some patience to really get going but we are a fully functioning ammunition maker with all permits and insurances in place.

We have our calibers on the shelf right now at several local gun stores, and would love to serve them and the training public for years to come.

 We have 60 years as a family building our own and using them to take game and trophies, we are ready to share that knowledge and fun with our community at large.

We are trying to raise enough money to really buy a spot in the supply chain for this area in colorado and surrounding. We have access to and some stock of mostly anything you would want and can likely sell it to you cheaper than a retail outlet could.

We will not however be underselling our local gun stores as they are just as important to our rights as this company.

We have connections set up for helping you with gun parts and reloading components at prices lower than most and if you are local, no shipping.

We are offering the chance for regular people to help build a real munitions company, with the end goal of having the ability to make ALL of our own components and even to include rimfire ammo.

At this point a crowdfunding effort is necessary to achieve our goals before we the people are regulated out of this industry altogether. Together we in Colorado can ensure we are not ever again subject to shortages and the like. This will take work and time, but my fancy clubs are worth feeding, aren't yours??

Please join us on our journey to freedom, via rewards based or equity based crowdfunding. Yes you can end up owning part of a munitions company. This can pay in money or ammo(is there a difference?) 

Thanks to all for your support already, we have been here as a family since the start, proudly fighting, and would be honored to have you with us!"
