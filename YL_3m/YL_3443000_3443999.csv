I installed a TPS xp tactical 20 moa base (steel) in order to give you plenty of elevation for long distance work.

This rifle is amazingly accurate and can easily do sub moa groups. I usually shoot 175 SMK’s and have easily taken it out past 1000 yards on silhouettes. Feel free to ask any questions, request additional pictures, or to make an offer. Thanks for looking!"

Here is the description from the kahr website:

The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.

The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.

The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

 Note: The finger extensions shown in the picture are not yet polished or anodized so the one shown doesn't represent the actual silver-grey anodized color. The pictures strictly show what they look like and how they fit to the mag. The extensions are polished prior to hard anodizing. The silver color we offer is a silver-grey to more accurately match the Solo color scheme. Again, you can also order these in black.

I have two listed here. One from me one from my wife. 
This one is for my wife. Both are the same. Let me know if you are looking for two. 

Cash only, no trades. 

Here is the description from the kahr website:

The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.

The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.

The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

This was my first Sig and I liked it so much, I have bought several other Sigs.  It shoots great and the single action trigger pull is exceptional.  I am just looking for something different.  This gun has had probably 5 mags ran through it.  These are great entry level Sigs, so good the US Army purchased some of them as well.  It is like new with no scratches or dings.  There are 50 155g American Eagle target rounds, 50 155g Federal premium bonded tactical hollow point rounds and 25 180g Federal Hi-shok jacketed hollow point rounds."

Whether purchased here or somewhere else we urge every buyer to have any used firearm they purchase inspected by a qualified gunsmith before firing. The buyer is also solely responsible to determine the safety of products other than firearms as well. We make every effort to accurately describe the product as we see it but we are not gunsmiths.

RETURN POLICY: Items are sold as-is unless otherwise listed. All firearms come with a 3-day (M-F) inspection/return privilege.

In case of a return, the buyer pays all shipping costs. This does not cover items damaged in shipment; you must save the damaged shipping box and file a claim with the appropriate shipping company. All returned items must be in the exact condition that they left us. Inspection does not include firing of the firearm, if the buyer does fire the firearm at any time during the inspection period, the sale is considered final. Inspection consists of external examination, functioning the action by hand to see if it operates, checking the bore and having the headspace checked by a gunsmith. No further disassembly is permitted, including but not limited to turning any screws or removing any punch pins.

I have put around 600 rounds through the rifle since I bought it about a year ago, for the most part it's sat in my safe since I got it. I will include 2 30 round steel magazines with it, as well as the factory 10 round magazine which has been fitted to work with the bullet guide that was installed.  

Here's a parts list of what's all on the rifle-

* 8.5"" ACE skeleton stock 
* 1"" ACE extended buttpad 
* CSS Round bullet guide
* ACE folding mechanism
* CSS Internal receiver block
* CSS Billet bolt on trigger guard
* Tapco G2 trigger group
* Roninsgrips Mongo Grip
* K-var Polymer lower handguard
* Ultimak gas tube optic mount
* Primary Arms Micro Dot
* VLTOR offset scout flashlight mount
* Surefire G2X Flashlight
* ACE folding mech sling swivel
* Magpul MS3 sling


I'd also, be willing to sell the rifle for $1050 without the flashlight/mount, and the red dot sight, if I go the selling route. The buyer must have a valid Ohio drivers license and be willing to sign a bill of sale. I'd also prefer the buyer had a valid CCW license if possible too."
