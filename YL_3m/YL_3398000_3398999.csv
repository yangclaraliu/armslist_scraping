>>>>>> ******If this ad is still on Armslist, the knife is still available for sale.******<<<<<

I bought this knife at the Denver Gun Show over 2 years ago, I carried it for a while and I never use it for anything except to cut open the tape on boxes.

This is heavy duty construction with six very small torx screws holding it together, and a pocket clip held on with larger torx, for easy access when needed.

All you need to do is slide the lever on the side to open & close it, it opens and closes very fast, please use with caution.

This knife is approximately 4 & 5/8"" long closed, 1/2"" thick, 1"" wide, the blade is 3 & 3/8"" long with a weight of 3.9 ounces, with the pocket clip, this is a heaver than the plastic knifes but it will last 100 times longer.

This knife could save your life if you find yourself in a dangerous situation in our dally activities, especially at night.

If interested, reply by email or call 303-428-5312 for more information. I would trade for .22 magnum 40 grain ammo.

Quick summary of the Pros/Cons for the Glock 20C: 

Pros: 

-Reliable (not a single failure to date) 
-Accurate (more accurate than 99% of the shooters that own one) 
-Durable (10mm Glocks seem to do better than their competition [EAA/1911/ect...] in handling the 10mm wear) 
-Easy to maintain 
-TONS of aftermarket support 
-15+1 capacity 
-Glock's customer service is great 
-Durable finish 
-Cheap replacement parts, should you ever need them 
-Low Bore Axis resulting in a relatively soft shooting gun 
-Easily modified to fit the shooters' preferences 
-Requires very little cleaning/lubrication to run reliably 
-Muzzle flip and perceived recoil are minimized vs the standard G20 allowing for faster follow up shots 


Cons: 

-The C model is much louder 
-The ported barrel may make your front sight turn black (mine doesn't seem to but I've seen others that do it after 2 or 3 rounds) 
-The ported barrel causes a decrease in muzzle velocity 
-The grip is large and may be too large for some shooters to grip properly"

>>>>>> ******If this ad is still on Armslist, the knife is still available for sale.******<<<<<

I bought this knife at the Denver Gun Show about 2 years ago, I carried it for a while and I never use it for anything except to cut the tape to open boxes.

This is heavy duty construction with 6 very small alloy torx screws holding it together, and a steel pocket clip with 2 larger alloy torx screws holding it to the knife for easy access when needed.

All you need to do is slide the lever on the side to open & close it, it opens and closes very fast, please use with caution.

This knife is approximately 8"" long open, 3 & 3/4"" closed, 9/16"" thick, 1"" wide without the switch, 1 & 1/4"" wide with the switch, the blade is 3 & 3/16"" long with a total weight of 3.9 ounce, this is a heaver than the plastic knifes but it will last 100 times longer.

This knife could save your life if you find yourself in a dangerous situation in our dally activities, especially at night.

If interested, reply by email or call 303-428-5312 for more information. I would trade for .22 magnum 40 grain ammo.

A note on the extra magazine. I used this magazine and it fed inconsistently. I don't know if this one has a problem or if this type is finnicky in general. I prefer using the rotary magazines in all of my 10/22's anyway for the flush feel so this mag has just been sitting around.

I bought this when I returned from Kuwait about 2 years ago from my step father and I just never really get a chance to use it. I recently found out some life changing news so it's time to start letting go of some things and this unfortunately is on the chopping block. It has the soft case as well as the 3 mags that this package comes with. Ive put less than 200 rounds through it myself and I don't think my father put much more that that through as well. I've attached a photo where you can see that the barrel is just slightly starting to show some minor use. Never carried and never holstered this pistol has been successfully keeping its soft case free from terrorism. Please feel free to make an offer I'll entertain anything reasonable. Also please note this IS NOT a base model FNP 45 It's the competition model which comes as this whole package(for those of you that are going to price shop).

Several people have asked what CPO means. CPO is a term the SIG factory uses to signify ""Certified Previously Owned."" The SIG factory reconditions certain previously purchased guns and then Certifies that the gun is in excellent, working condition and sold with one year warranty to the new owner. Often times police departments buy batches of SIGs that never see service then trade them in when The dept goes to a different caliber, model or manufacturer. I can't prove it, but suspect that my gun was unfired when turned in."

I would definitely not consider this a toy but I also would not shoot at deer with it.  It would probably kill a zombie with a headshot.

Following from web site...........LWRCI's new Skirmish Sights incorporate a host of practical features in an innovative new design. All the sharp edges on these ultra-low profile sights have been rounded to prevent snags and cuts to the operator, while the folded profile of the sight has been kept to only half an inch.

Both sights can be raised using gross motor skills. The sights lock securely in the up position and are lowered by pressing a button on their left sides. The sights are constructed for 7075 aluminum which is hard coat anodized and 4140 steel that is then treated with our NiCorr surface conversion technology. The 7075 aluminum is much harder and stronger than the 6000 series aluminum used in other manufacturers' sights. Additionally, the bearings and detents are all hard chromed making these sights nearly impervious to corrosion.

Mountable to any 1913 picatinny rail, the LWRC International Skirmish SIghts feature locking helicoil which requires no additional thread lock for installation and will stand up to thousands of rounds of recoil and rugged use.

Front Sight Features:

The front sight features a standard M4 style adjustable front sight post and is protected by HK style wings. This provides for the perfect circle in circle sight picture.

Rear Sight Features:

Unique dual aperture rotary post: Large aperture for 100-300 meters; Small aperture regulated for shots from 300-600 meters. The rotary post's narrow profile provides for greater peripheral vision and allows the sight to be folded flat with either the large or small aperture in use; thus eliminating the blinding that can occur with traditional folding dual aperture sights. The post rotates and is held securely in place by a spring loaded positive detent. Windage adjustments are 1/2 MOA per click at 100 meters. Windage adjustments can be made with a flat head screwdriver or with the rim of a cartridge case. The surfaces on the rear of the sight post and its protective wings are grooved at either 20 or 40 lines per inch to eliminate glare. Call 360 8four0 fourseven8one"

Barrel has M4 feed ramps, 16 in carbine length 1/8 twist barrel with flash hider and A2 front sight. Rear sight is MBUS flip up style.  The lower is an aluminum forged SAA with a PSA polished lower parts kit. The 5.45 x 39 ammo build allows you to get shooting time at a price far below what you would pay for .223/5.56 ammo.  The ballistics and shooting experience is virtually indistinguishable from a 5.56 chambered AR.  It can be converted to MilSpec 5.56 simply by changing the barrel and the bolt (Bolt carrier is the same).  

Rounding out the build is a Magpul MOE front hand guard and the legendary Magpul UBR telescoping stock.  Google Magpul UBR for details.  They are almost impossible to find for less than $250.

It comes with a (5) ASC 30 round mags dedicated to the 5.45 x 39 round.  You can use std AR15 mags but you have to load them a few rounds short for them to function properly.  The ASCs feed flawlessly at full capacity.  

The price reflects the fact that this is a serious battle rifle built with premium components, not a mall ninja economy model.  I built two of them for my son and me to shoot a few years back a since he will be in Germany for the next 4 years, its time let someone else have some quality trigger time.

Rifle is $850 and I can include about 1000 rounds of recent manufacture 7N6 ammo in a spam can for an extra $175.00.  I have extra 5.45 x 39 ammo if you want more so let me know."

For sale is a Bulgarian Makarov in 9x18. The finish is restored using black high-gloss  Enamel, baked at 180 degrees in an oven for 24 hours. This will not fade, crack, or peel, ever. The exterior bluing of the pistol was worn and completely gone in some places, risking exposure and rusting. The action and internals are silky smooth. The barrel and bore are like-new. The bore maintains a mirror finish, with very sharp lands and grooves, and the sights aim true at 50 yards. Due to the fixed barrel, this handgun is extremely accurate. Please see pictures for detailed view of the new finish and bore. 72 rounds of FMJ 9x18 ammunition included. One magazine included. It has not been refinished, as it maintains most of it's original finish. Spring on magazine is strong.

Trijicon HD Night Sights as pictured are an added cost of $100.00.  I can replace them with the factory sights if you prefer.  I have the proper tools to do so and am a certified Glock Armorer.  I can also add factory Glock night nights for the 21 that are off of another .45 ACP Glock that I own for an added cost of $75.00.  They came on a Glock 30 that I purchased last summer and were removed when I purchased my Trijicon HD sights.  

The custom work and add on's to this pistol are as follows:  To build this package without the night sights on your own would be almost a thousand dollars.  The grip is more ergonomically friendly now and very comfortable in the hand.

Two things are bad with this gun.  The ""Bolt"" or slide as I call it is cracked, as it was not intended to be shot with hi velocity ammo-Standard Velocity Only, or so I have read.  it was cracked when I got it,  and the original 12 rd.  magazine is missing.   I have been holding onto it, as he stated he had the magazine, but it was really misplaced as it is gone and can not find it?  Replacement 10 rd mags can be found for 43.00.   Other than that the gun and grips are in really nice shape.  The Bakelite grips appear to be in Fine condition, with no scratches or damage.  I am not a gun guru, and have not fired this gun.  I can tell you it seems to function fine.    I can take pics of it for you, if you specify what you are looking for.   From what I have read, they made a little over 10,000 of these.  This one has the serial number of 10,xxx, so I would say it is one of the last ones built?  I don't really know what to value it at, I would say somewhere between 250.00 and 800.00?  Going off of Numrich's gun site, the parts I have , that they have available are either available or out of stock-This gun by their parts guide would be valued at 358.20 - in parts.  I have a buddy who does my FFL paperwork, so if you would need shipped, we can do that for you as well.  PLEASE- come look at the gun if you are interested or  email.   Make me an offer.  Thanks"

Two things are bad with this gun. The ""Bolt"" or slide as I call it is cracked, as it was not intended to be shot with hi velocity ammo-Standard Velocity Only, or so I have read. it was cracked when I got it, and the original 12 rd. magazine is missing. I have been holding onto it, as he stated he had the magazine, but it was really misplaced as it is gone and can not find it? Replacement 10 rd mags can be found for 43.00. Other than that the gun and grips are in really nice shape. The Bakelite grips appear to be in Fine condition, with no scratches or damage. I am not a gun guru, and have not fired this gun. I can tell you it seems to function fine. I can take pics of it for you, if you specify what you are looking for. From what I have read, they made a little over 10,000 of these. This one has the serial number of 10,xxx, so I would say it is one of the last ones built? I don't really know what to value it at, I would say somewhere between 250.00 and 800.00? Going off of Numrich's gun site, the parts I have , that they have available are either available or out of stock-This gun by their parts guide would be valued at 358.20 - in parts. I have a buddy who does my FFL paperwork, so if you would need shipped, we can do that for you as well. PLEASE- come look at the gun if you are interested or email. Make me an offer. Thanks"

I have my beloved 4.5"" XDM chambered in the mighty 45 ACP. The XDM offers the best ergonomic experience possible in a polymer platform. With multiple interchangeable back straps, the XDM can be perfectly tailored to fit your hand. As it shares the same perfect grip angle as the standard XD and the 1911, the XDM points effortlessly and naturally. Aggressive mega-lock frame texturing and major grasp slide serrations keep the XDM in your hand and operational under any conditions. The slide and frame feature aesthetically pleasing contours that make it a more concealable pistol.

The XDM pistol from Springfield Armory sets the standard for what a polymer pistol can be. The XDM has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XDM 4.5” Full-Size is the perfect pistol for those who are looking for full-size performance, sight radius and handling. - See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/xdm-4-5-45-acp/#sthash.tllmD7iW.dpuf
