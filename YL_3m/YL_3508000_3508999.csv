Long out of production, the 951 is what some might call a utility gun. Made for the lowest end of the market, this single-shot bolt action shotgun is chambered for 2 1/2 and 3 inch 410 gauge shells.

Manufactured by the Savage Arms Corporation from early 1960's until perhaps 1971, it is essentially the same shotgun as the Stevens model 51 except that it has a hard plastic butt plate instead of the ventilated rubber butt pad found on the Stevens Model 51.
Brass 410 Ga. Shells.

Springfield Model 951 Bolt Action Shotgun
Springfield 951
Overall Length (inches) 	43.5
Weight (lbs) 	5.1
Action Type 	Bolt Action Turn Bolt
Length of Pull(inches) 	14.5
Barrel Length (inches) 	24.0
Cartridge 	410 gauge, 2 1/2 and 3 inch shells
Magazine Capacity 	Single shot

All Springfield Model 951 and Stevens Model 51's came with a fixed full choke. There is a simple automatic safety which engages when the bolt is opened. After a cartridge is chambered, the safety tab above the bolt handle must be pushed down to fire the gun.
To remove the bolt, the receiver/barrel assembly must be dismounted from the stock and the bolt stop screw removed from the bottom of the receiver.

51,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3508051,For Trade:  I'll cut a deal to whoever wants a saiga ak74,"Livonia, Detroit, Michigan",Offer,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 17, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,I have been recently laid off my job. I have a saiga ak74 on layaway. I do not have the money to get it out of layaway by the 25th. I owe 316 and I'm not interested in ak74s due to no interest in buying the ammo online and preference of 7.62x39. It's back end converted and takes ak74 mags. So the deal would be i can pay about $100 maybe more. So if someone would be interested in paying 216 and trading say a wasr or some low end ak you'd get a quality Russian made ak which are banned. If you have trust problem with this i can leave collateral with you. Something of importance to me that i will need back or write up a contract and I'll sign. Either way I'd rather not lose payments i made on this rifle and be gunless.

i will take offers for it a day or so or few hours. I detailed and cleaned it like always. used breakthrough solvent and frog lube.
Cleaned the bolt, the nooks and crannies and then give it a good spanking at the range.

Very fun to shoot. A piece of history is with in reach. 7mm Mausers do not show up local very often. This was made in loewe Berlin for the chialean army.
There is one currently at gunbroker at 325 but that one is more original than this one. Offer accordingly. Same action different look and feel.

please also go look at completed auctions.

This is  not a fire sale so the right person must want it. I have already been offered 150 for it which is what I paid for it. I bought 5 boxes of ammo at 25 and tax each. I am going to continue to blow through it until gone than sell the rifle again, or who ever wants this can buy the rifle and the ammo plus some beer and pizza money for me.

I have checked all the pawn shops and gun stores local and there are none of these around. It would have been nice to get it all original but i must say the person that changed it did an ok work. The finish should be better. I may begin that work depending on boredem and darkness ."

I say parts kit because legally it cannot be assembled into a rifle until 6 more American parts are installed. A FAL needs a 7 or more American made parts to become compliant, I've already added the American made Combo device/flash hider.  My goal was to keep this rifle as original as possible on the outside and use American made on the inside. If this is your kit you can assemble it anyway you wish.  If you need guidance or assistance I can help as time permits. 

These rifles were imported and BATF ruled that they could not be sold as rifles but as kits with the uppers going to one distributor and the lowers and bolt carrier groups going to another.   I've gathered the rare components now the rest is up to you.

This kit may have been fired for testing purposes only in Argentina but has never been issued and then sitting in my gun safe since 2007. If you've ever wanted to own as close to issued, FAL licensed manufactured rifle this is it.

The bill of sale will state that this was sold to you as a parts kit and not to be assembled until it has the proper amount of 922(r) parts needed for BATF compliance.

If you don't know about DAK. It's double action with an added ability to pull the trigger with a heavier primer strike if there was a malfunction or soft primer strike.  Double Action is very smooth and I shoot this just as good as my DA/SA Sig.  It comes with 2 12 round Mags and case.   This is an awesome home defense gun as it has no safety and trigger pull is the same on every shot.  Only reason I am selling it is we shoot a lot and want to go 9mm and 45acp so we don't have to buy 3 types of ammo.   This is the softest shooting .40 I have shot.  It's shoots softer than most Polymer 9mm.

Using the regular mag, it makes for a nice concealed carry weapon. Also comes with an extended mag to make it full size. Be legal and I will do a bill of sale.
The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.
The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber.
Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

FX45 Fatboy Lightweight .45ACP 3.2 Inch Flared Bull Barrel Blue Finish Combat Sights 12 Round

Designed on the 1911 platform with a wide-body frame. Ambidextrous safety. 3.2 inch flared bull barrel with blued finish. Carbon steel slide with front and rear serrations. Lowered and flared ejection port. Combat sights dovetailed into the slide. Dual recoil-spring system. extended slide catch. Beavertail grip safety. Skeletonized aluminum trigger. Lightweight alloy frame. Ultra-thin polymer grip panel.

Manufactuer: American Tactical Imports
Model: FX45 Fatboy Lightweight
Caliber: .45 ACP
Barrel Length: 3.2
Capacity: 12 + 1
Finish: Blue
Hand Gun Web Model: FX45

Overall length under seven inches, 5.5 inches high and only 1.33 inches at its widest point, the FX45 is easy to conceal even under light clothing. But it’s a true 1911 and has all of the excellent features John Moses Browning designed into his original pistol: single-action trigger, excellent ergonomics and well-placed controls that are easy to operate.
The machined steel slide has dual sets of grasping grooves, and the ejection port has been lowered and flared to ensure that spent cases get out of the way surely and quickly.
But the most modern feature is that it uses a bushing-less barrel with a flared muzzle section. Another departure from the original is a telescoping, dual-spring recoil system on a full-length guide rod. Both of these features ensure tight and consistent barrel/slide lockup for improved accuracy and functioning. It also greatly simplifies disassemble.
The low-profile rear sight has a large, easy-to-acquire square notch and is angled to prevent it from hanging up on clothing on the draw, and its rear face is serrated to reduce glare. The front is a square blade with a white dot insert.
The alloy frame pares the Fatboy LW’s unloaded weight to a mere 22 ounces, and the frame is undercut at the trigger guard to permit a high grip on the gun.
The ambidextrous thumb safety levers are smaller than normally seen on a 1911 but can still be operated positively. An extended beavertail grip safety with a palm swell provides superior handling while ameliorating recoil—a nice feature on a .45 pistol weighing so little. Aggressively checkered, polymer grip panels allow a secure grip."

Here are brand new Factory FN 16 round Stainless magazines for the FNH, FNP-9 standard service pistols chambered in 9mm caliber.

The body configuration prevents them from being converted to standard. Each magazine holds 16 rounds of 9mm ammunition. These magazines are made for the standard service size FNP-9. On the compact variants like the FNP9M, they will work and go into battery just fine, only they’ll protrude because the M variants have shorter grip frames.

I don't think it's the matching bolt. Wounded Marine told my dad that the bent bolt made it a sniper rifle, although I can't prove that and I see no taps for a scope. Wood is rough, but it was in battle and hauled through rocky caves. What you see is what you get. I will throw in the Type 30 Kokura bayonet that came with the rifle. It has the original cleaning rod too. I have a ton of pictures if you want to see more. Rifling is strong, bore is super for it's age. Action works well. It has the old style knurled safety, so I'm pretty sure it is 1930's manufacture."

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY 
     This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges.  Here are brand new Factory FN 10 round Stainless magazines for the FNH, FNP-9 standard service pistols chambered in 9mm caliber. All these are brand new factory magazines that FNH closed out when it switched production from the FNP to the FNX series pistols a couple years ago. Manufacturer is FNH USA of McLean, VA, and Columbia, SC. Construction is entirely stainless steel body and springs with high impact black followers and floorplates. The body configuration prevents them from being converted to standard. Each magazine holds 10 rounds of 9mm ammunition, six fewer than the standard number 47103. Buyers in jurisdictions where the standard 47103 is permitted may sub for the same price as long as we are in stock on those. Please message first and let us check stock if that is what you want to do. These magazines are made for the standard service size FNP-9. On the compact variants like the FNP9M, they will work and go into battery just fine, only they’ll protrude because the M variants have shorter grip frames. These magazines will not fit an FNX or FNS pistol. They will not fit an FNP in .40 or .45 Caliber. They will not fit the dump lever of a John Deere 1947 H Manure Spreader. They will only fit FNP pistols chambered in 9mm caliber. Replacement pricing  on most all FN factory magazines is $59 per or more. Our single magazine price is $39 per. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $33 each. Own 3 	for only	$ 99.00.	Not for sale to residents of New York City.

This rifle has a crisp trigger, no breaks or cracks in the stock with the regular imported dings and bumps to be expected. Side folding bayonet is extremely tight and rock solid when it swings out. A very cool design feature.

Many of the VZ52's were ruined visually by coating them in a flaky bedliner paint (see GunBroker), but this one was left unscathed. Most in this country are marked ""SHE"" for the Bohemian production facility, but this is significantly less common. Bolt locks back positively, the action is VERY smooth considering the age/technology that made it, and magazine rocks into place solidly without a fight.

I am paring down my weapons to rifles my wife can hold more easily, and this is outside the range of her arms (my efforts to make her lift more... failed). I really like to even pull this rifle out to look at, and it is a hit with enthusiasts and people who know nothing. It just has a great feel. Some have compared it to the SKS, but I feel like it is further upstream with a feeling more like an M1 variant. Definitely could be a stock refinishing project."

He is attempting to discourage gun trades by making deals and not showing up at mutual meeting place. Basically a Craigslist flake on Armslist.

Recently he planned a meeting in Edmonds, as I was to walk across ferry from Kingston and meet. He said was caught in meeting, wanted me to wait till he got there, and take a ferry an hour and a half later back to Kingston. I did not wait and returned on next ferry. What the hell was a beautiful day, and the view cost me $8 bucks. Not bad for being stood up, but than he arranges to come across the to Kingston to trade the same day at 7pm. Guess what? He said was getting on ferry, and never contacted me after that, glad I never went down to the ferry dock to meet.

He is at it again, responding to another add of mine, he just has no idea its me, and he is responding to a secondary email I setup just for these situations. My turn to burden him.

Designed as a drop-in upgrade for the standard AR15/M4 pistol grip, The MOE-K Grip (Magpul Original Equipment) provides an extremely low profile and compact design with a steeper grip angle compared to more traditional styles. The more vertical grip angle is optimized for use on PDW (Personal Defense Weapon) configurations and improves comfort and control on short LOP rifles that bring the primary hand in closer to the shooter's body. The slim profile and lack of backstrap 'beavertail' also makes it an excellent choice for shooters who prefer a smaller grip circumference.

All mounting hardware included. Will also fit most 7.62 NATO AR10/SR25 style of rifles.

        This listing is for ONE magazine, but winning buyer can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges.  Probably more than any other cheap 25 Automatic, the Galesi Vest Pocket .25 Automatic was imported in sufficient numbers prior to the 1968 Gun Control Act to ensure a good many are still in service.  We have been unable to find factory magazines now for almost two decades. Here, then, is the only game in town: Triple K Magazines made in the U.S.A. to take the place of the old Italian magazines.
