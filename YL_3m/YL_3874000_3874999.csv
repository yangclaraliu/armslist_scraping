When you look at the pictures, you'll see a ""pattern"" on it...that's just gun oil - I've had it stored in a vacuum sealed bag after lubricating it, so the bag left an oily imprint that can easily be wiped off.

It includes 3 factory magazines in the standard compact 10 round capacity. The condition is very good.  For this price, it's a great deal...and yes, the price is VERY FIRM, so I will not respond to cash offers less than my price, so please don't waste your time (or mine).

274,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3874274,For Sale:  UPDATED: Incomplete TGO AR Pistol Build/Parts For Sale,"Nashville / Springfield / Middle Tennessee, Nashville, Tennessee",FREE,"Listed On: Friday, January 2, 2015",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Due to the overwhelming response to break up the package and sell separately, you will find the list below. The completed lower receiver MUST be sold as is. I am not interested in stripping it down to sell every little part individually. Everything is brand new. The build was never completed, so nothing has been used.

I have included the prices I paid for each item. Those prices do not account for transfer fee, background check, taxes, shipping, my time, etc. Please keep that in mind. If you are looking for a budget AR, this probably isn't for you. This wasn't going to be the most expensive build ever, but the build I had planned didn't include much of a budget. With that being said, I did my very best to find the best prices on each item.  

As most of you know, CMT Tactical gave us a steep discount on the group buy for the TGO (TennesseeGunOwners.com) upper and lower receivers. For those of you who weren't around at that time, we paid about $270 for the stripped upper and lower receiver set. That's about $135 off the regular price. In the figures below, you will see that I am honoring the discounted price we paid. All sale prices include shipping, except the lower receiver. That must be a FTF transaction.

The lower must be the first thing to sell. The buyer of the lower has the option to also buy the upper and/or everything else. 

I already have some potential buyers for some of the parts. If you are interested, let me know. If someone has already shown interest in the item you want, you will be next in line. If someone wants everything, the total would be $1000.

As I said earlier, I'm only selling this to fund a camera and gear. If I were going to trade for anything, that's probably the only thing I'm interested in.

I live in Springfield, work out of Nashville (Briley Parkway & Elm Hill Pike), but travel all over middle Tennessee during the week. I may be coming to your area soon.

This is Walther's new design, it has a unique gas recoil reducing system in it that allows it to have a fixed barrel for increased accuracy in addition to being easier to rack for smaller stature people.  I haven't fired it so I don't really know if this system works, but the theory is sound and has been used to great effect in Steyr's GB pistol.  The gun's very slim and I'd imagine it'd be very easy to carry, but again, I don't really know since I've never tried to carry it.  I'm selling it because I bought it on impulse and really don't need it.

I bought the 4 accessory top kit: picatinny rail male, night sight, spare original top and the picatinny rail female. (the one that lets you attach it to the bottom of a rifle)
I got the belt clip as soon as it was available and it really makes a great little holster for the gun. 
It cycles FAST and because of that it is ammo picky as well as magazine picky. You can't just slap in a bx25 or a clone and have it work. I bought the 2nd spring kit for a bx25 and assembled it. It fires well with the extended mag in it. The original bx10 works well also.
I attached the pic rail to the top and affixed a red/green holo sight that has 4 recticle options. It makes for very rapid target acquisition. 
I like the gun, but have a few too many now.

The photos are Leupold factory photos.  The VX-3, is a top of the line Leupold.

These scopes come with a coupon, which you can redeem, for a custom bullet drop compensation dial, from Leupold (CDS=Custom Dial System).

We take all major credit cards.  We will also take a check, but we will have to delay shipping for a couple days; on out-of-state checks.

We are a retail store, so our items are subject to sale in the store.  When that happens, we pull the on-line ads as soon as possible.

If you don’t see what you are looking for, please call us at REDACTED(four 0 two-three seven six-three four 0 seven).  We can sell most scopes at very reasonable prices.

Below, is Leuplod's speal, on this scope:

Ingrained with the thrill of the hunt, the new VX-3 drastically improves optical performance, mechanical function, and durability. We've pushed it to the limit, so you can push yourself to yours. And now with the Custom Dial System (CDS), you can now own a scope that precisely matches your rifle's ballistics.

Extended Twilight Lens System: Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Extended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold’s index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. 

Your eye is already handicapped, when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Extended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When we combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.

DiamondCoat 2: Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we’ve ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.

2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing: While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered rifle scope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.

Lead Free: Leupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction.

Generous Eye box: The generous Eye box makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the rifle scope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high power, the longer eye relief and more generous Eye box gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.

Blackened Lens Edges: Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.

CDS (Custom Dial System): Leupold CDS models allow you to quickly dial your elevation to different sight-in ranges with a custom adjustment matched to your specific ballistics information. The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers. Every CDS dial features ¼-MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-3 even more accurate and rugged.

How the CDS System Works:  The CDS System works by laser-inscribing your scope's elevation dial to match your load, velocity and conditions. Your scope will be in perfect synch with the way your rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads. Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account.

BAS (Ballistic Aiming System): Leupold’s Ballistics Aiming System is comprised of five specialized reticles – Boone and Crockett® Big Game, Varmint Hunter’s, LR Duplex, LRV Duplex, and the new SA.B.R. reticles – which take into account the variables crucial to accurate, long-range shooting. A special ballistics indicator ring allows users to customize their power settings for their cartridge’s ballistics, then saves that setting for easy reference in a hunting situation. 

With multiple aiming points, for longer ranges and varying wind speeds, and infinite power selector settings to match your rifle’s ballistics, the Ballistics Aiming System can help you master the art of accurate, long-range shooting. It has proved so successful in helping hunters learn how to shoot accurately at long range, we’ve expanded your BAS options with additional reticles offering many of the same benefits as the original reticles. We’ve also made them available in more rifle scopes than ever. 

With practice, the Ballistics Aiming System will teach you how to gauge the distance to your target, where to place your reticle for that distance, and even how to compensate for wind deflection. With the Ballistics Aiming System and some practice, you’ll consistently make shots you wouldn’t have attempted in the past. Accurate, long-range shooting is probably one of the most difficult hunting skills to master. For many hunters, it remains a combination of hard-won experience, intuition, and a little luck. 

Together, the reticles of the Ballistics Aiming System give the hunter very useful tools for successful hunts with clean and efficient harvests. By practicing with the Ballistics Aiming System, all hunters can add science to the art of long-range shooting, and master this important skill. One System, Five Unique Reticles, The Boone and Crockett Big Game reticle and the Varmint Hunter’s reticle use the same principles to help you hone your long-range shooting skills, though each has been tailored to meet the needs of big game or varmint hunters. With practice, using each will become a natural part of your shooting. 

Unlike other range estimating reticles, the calculations made here are incredibly simple, and take the guesswork out of long-range shooting. Each reticle provides a series of aiming points. The first aiming point, the intersection of the Duplex® reticle, is to be used at 200 yards with most common cartridges, and 300 yards with several flatter shooting, longer-range loads. The Boone and Crockett Big Game reticle and Varmint Hunter’s reticle also provides you with two different power selector ring settings, indicated by large and small triangles on the power selector. These allow you to select the hold points best suited to the cartridge you are using. In some cases, the smaller triangle setting can be used with your slower, heavier bullet load, and the large triangle setting with your faster loads in the same rifle. 

With the LR Duplex and LRV Duplex reticles, a shooter can tailor the reticle to his or her load by varying the magnifications, thus altering the subtensions. With all four reticles, remember: practice, practice, practice!

Our line of hunting scopes feature over 20 different popular reticle configurations including Leupold's own line of Ballistics Aiming System reticles. If that weren't enough, most Leupold scopes may be configured with your preferred reticle through the Leupold Custom Shop. For a truly unique optic have our experts create a custom ballistically matched reticle tuned specifically for your rifle, load and shooting conditions.

The gun will be sold in the FN case that it came to me in as well.

I am the original owner of the gun.  I first purchased it from a gunshop in Norfolk, and have been the sole owner ever since.  I can provide further details if desired.  I have put maybe 1500 rounds through the gun, and it has broken in very nicely.  I cared for the handgun very dilligently, and have always cleaned and oiled it after each shooting.  The gun is in excellent condition, aside from the normal wear expected from shooting it.  As such, I am asking $570, but will also consider any reasonable offers.

The FNX-9 is an amazingly reliable and accurate firearm, and it has taught both myself and my wife a lot about shooting, and my first handgun.  I'm sad to see it go, but my wife starts medical school soon, and we could use the money to help with the registration and moving process.

I can be reached either by email at REDACTED, or by cellphone at REDACTED, and I welcome any questions you may have.  I can also provide additional pictures and information upon request. Thanks for your interest!"

This came to me right from the factory last week as a replacement for the first one I bought that was having problems with mags dropping free.  
These have a lifetime warranty and they took my original pistol back to have their gunsmith examine and they found an issue with the frame so replaced my original free of charge with this new gun and also perfromned their gunsmith ""reliability tuning"" on it as is documented in the paperwork.
While I was waiting to get my RIA back I came across a custom STI 2011 (3 times the price..) on one of my forums that was exactly what I was wanting so treated myself as a xmas gift...
I had already purchased 4 additional OEM mags with basepads specifically designed for this gun/magwell - (4x$40 = $160) https://us.advancedtactical.com/shop/product-detail/.38-Super-9mm-17rnd-magazine-w-Basepad/
These mags ran perfectly in the original gun and it is a very soft and accurate shooter.
I also had purchased an extended mag release (I also have the original) - ($28) https://www.dawsonprecision.com/ProductDetail.jsp?LISTID=80000C46-REDACTED

This gun is a solid steel beast with 17lb mainspring and 10lb recoil spring which all equate to 9mm feeling more like 22magnum.  This gun is designed to shoot on target quickly with very little recoil.  I dumped my $1k custom G34 that I used t0 shoot in compeition after I got this and was sold on the platform.
I have not fired this new one but confirmed all 5 mags drop-free and will provide all the paperwork from RIA detailing their reiliability tuning and 350 rds test fire.
I would keep it but but will have $2500+ into my new STI & mags when all is said and done.."

When you redeem the coupon, which comes with the scope; you have your choice between a ""zero-stop"" dial, & a regular dial.  The “zero-stop” dial; is far better for hunting.

If you don’t see what you are looking for, please call us at REDACTED (four 0 two-three seven six-three four 0 seven).  We can sell most scopes at very reasonable prices.

Below, is Leuplod's speal, on this scope:

Ingrained with the thrill of the hunt, the new VX-3 drastically improves optical performance, mechanical function, and durability. We've pushed it to the limit, so you can push yourself to yours. And now with the Custom Dial System (CDS), you can now own a scope that precisely matches your rifle's ballistics.

Extended Twilight Lens System: Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Extended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold’s index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. 

Your eye is already handicapped, when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Extended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When we combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.

DiamondCoat 2: Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we’ve ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.

2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing: While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered rifle scope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.

Lead Free: Leupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction.

Generous Eye box: The generous Eye box makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the rifle scope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high power, the longer eye relief and more generous Eye box gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.

Blackened Lens Edges: Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.

CDS (Custom Dial System): Leupold CDS models allow you to quickly dial your elevation to different sight-in ranges with a custom adjustment matched to your specific ballistics information. The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers. Every CDS dial features ¼-MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-3 even more accurate and rugged.

How the CDS System Works:  The CDS System works by laser-inscribing your scope's elevation dial to match your load, velocity and conditions. Your scope will be in perfect synch with the way your rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads. Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account.

BAS (Ballistic Aiming System): Leupold’s Ballistics Aiming System is comprised of five specialized reticles – Boone and Crockett® Big Game, Varmint Hunter’s, LR Duplex, LRV Duplex, and the new SA.B.R. reticles – which take into account the variables crucial to accurate, long-range shooting. A special ballistics indicator ring allows users to customize their power settings for their cartridge’s ballistics, then saves that setting for easy reference in a hunting situation. 

With multiple aiming points, for longer ranges and varying wind speeds, and infinite power selector settings to match your rifle’s ballistics, the Ballistics Aiming System can help you master the art of accurate, long-range shooting. It has proved so successful in helping hunters learn how to shoot accurately at long range, we’ve expanded your BAS options with additional reticles offering many of the same benefits as the original reticles. We’ve also made them available in more rifle scopes than ever. 

With practice, the Ballistics Aiming System will teach you how to gauge the distance to your target, where to place your reticle for that distance, and even how to compensate for wind deflection. With the Ballistics Aiming System and some practice, you’ll consistently make shots you wouldn’t have attempted in the past. Accurate, long-range shooting is probably one of the most difficult hunting skills to master. For many hunters, it remains a combination of hard-won experience, intuition, and a little luck. 

Together, the reticles of the Ballistics Aiming System give the hunter very useful tools for successful hunts with clean and efficient harvests. By practicing with the Ballistics Aiming System, all hunters can add science to the art of long-range shooting, and master this important skill. One System, Five Unique Reticles, The Boone and Crockett Big Game reticle and the Varmint Hunter’s reticle use the same principles to help you hone your long-range shooting skills, though each has been tailored to meet the needs of big game or varmint hunters. With practice, using each will become a natural part of your shooting. 

Unlike other range estimating reticles, the calculations made here are incredibly simple, and take the guesswork out of long-range shooting. Each reticle provides a series of aiming points. The first aiming point, the intersection of the Duplex® reticle, is to be used at 200 yards with most common cartridges, and 300 yards with several flatter shooting, longer-range loads. The Boone and Crockett Big Game reticle and Varmint Hunter’s reticle also provides you with two different power selector ring settings, indicated by large and small triangles on the power selector. These allow you to select the hold points best suited to the cartridge you are using. In some cases, the smaller triangle setting can be used with your slower, heavier bullet load, and the large triangle setting with your faster loads in the same rifle. 

With the LR Duplex and LRV Duplex reticles, a shooter can tailor the reticle to his or her load by varying the magnifications, thus altering the subtensions. With all four reticles, remember: practice, practice, practice!
For a truly unique optic have our experts create a custom ballistically matched reticle tuned specifically for your rifle, load and shooting conditions.

Like our highly regarded, reliable SDU-5E, the MS-2000(M) meets all military specifications, including MIL-L-38217D and CID A-A-59176, and it has many improved life saving features to meet multiple mission capability. ACR features five distinctive versions of the MS-2000(M) that meet the most up-to-date requirements of the military and fit virtually any application.FEATURESShield extends/retracts for omni- or uni-directional visibility.  Waterproof factory tested to 10 meters (33 ft)IR filter blocks all visible light (lets through only IR light)Raised polarity indicators allow correct battery replacement in low or no visibility conditions.  New braided steel retainer keeps battery door from being lost.  Operates on 2 standard alkaline AA batteries - disposal causes no environmental impact.

General Info:
Springfield Armory SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.
