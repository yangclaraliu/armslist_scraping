PLEASE NOTE: I've had some trade offers for firearms that are worth a quite a bit less than the rifle.  I'm willing to trade for a firearm that's worth less than my rifle but when you ask about the trade please include how much cash you're willing to add to the trade to make up the difference.

All Illinois FOID rules apply.

For straight out purchase I will ship to your FFL on your dime.  Trades must be face to face.  Willing to travel to meet Buyer half way for the right deal.

PICTURES: The rifle color in the first picture is very light due to fluorescent lighting.  2nd and 3rd pics are more realistic color.  Flip up sites in pictures have been sold separately and do not come with the rifle."

GP100 with 4.2 inch barrel, Jack Weigand scope rail, four speed loaders, and Ruger plastic case. I am the third owner of this revolver and I can only assume that it has seen some use in it's life. Having said that, it is a Ruger, so it's akin to a Sherman tank with a pistol grip. There are several areas on the gun showing some burnishing from holstering, with similar burnishing marks on the top strap from the scope rail, and assorted light marks here and there. There is a nick on the left side of the top strap about amidships of the rear sight assembly. The cylinder shows wear on the notches, but lock up is good and I have not experienced any problems in use. The forcing cone is in good shape, and there is no evidence of flame cutting on the top strap. I have added shims to the hammer and trigger internals, and a reduced power hammer spring to lighten the double action pull. The original spring will be provided. 

To reiterate, this is not ""new in box,"" or ""only six rounds fired."" This is a well-used revolver that should be serviceable into the next century (if our descendants are allowed to have such things then, which is doubtful).

Lastly, I am disinclined to travel very far. I live in Poulsbo, so I would be willing to travel
as far as the ferry terminal at Bainbridge or Kingston.

KEL-TEC PISTOL MODEL P-3AT CAL .380

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

WALTHER PISTOL MODEL P22 CAL .22LR

The P22 may be fired double action at about 12 pounds of force, and operates as a single action with slightly more than 5 pounds of force. The P22 operates by blowback where pressure generated by a firing cartridge is countered by a combination of the inertial weight of the slide assembly and the force of the recoil spring. The action will not open until the projectile has left the barrel and the pressures have dropped to safe levels.

It was purchased new by my dad when it was released, and has been owned by him until he had to move to California and could not take it with him.  He passed it on to me, but .22 really isnt a caliber I am fond of even for plinking.  It comes with the factory 30rd mag and a ruger 10/22 10rd box mag(it will accept and 10/22 mag on the market).  It has not had any failure to feeds or failure to eject, this firearm got alot of bad press for jams, but if you kow how to seat a magazine properly then there is not problems there(insert the magazine till it clicks then rock it forward about 1/8"" it will click a second time), you do that and there are no problems with it at all.  Those steps were printed and delivered with the gun.  It has the threaded barrel with the factory knurled thread protector on it(threaded barrels were ony available pre-ban, the post ban were all non threaded).

The total round count through this piece is about 600-800rds since it was bought new in the late 80's(i would have to ask my dad for the exact date and place of purchase).  Included in the puchase is 1050 high velocity rounds, the original manual and case.  One 30rd intratec mag and one ruger 10/22 10rd box mag.

$369
Manufactured by the Czechoslovak firm Česká zbrojovka the vz. 82 replaced the 7.62x25mm Tokarev vz. 52 pistol in Czechoslovak military service in 1983. It is a compact, double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blowback action. This type of action allows the barrel to remain solidly fixed to the frame, resulting in improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like the U.S. M1911 series). The low bore axis of the vz. 82 provides for less muzzle rise and quicker follow-up shots. For added convenience, both the frame-mounted thumb safety and the magazine release are ambidextrous. The vz. 82 was the first service pistol to feature both these features. The bore is chrome plated, which gives it three advantages: longer barrel life, resistance to rust from the use of corrosive ammunition, and ease of cleaning. Another feature of this pistol is the use of polygonal rifling in the barrel bore. This replaces the traditional lands and grooves rifling design with a rounded, smooth polygonal pattern which has a more ""hills and valleys"" appearance.

LaRue Targets are made of the highest quality materials and are produced on computer numerically controlled (CNC) machinery that gives consistent high quality.

The overall dimensions are 28 inches high, 32 inches wide and is made of 3/8 inch steel plate that is hardened to 500 Brinnell. Silhouette plates are rated to accommodate 7.62mm NATO, but have been shot them with .300 Winchester Magnum at ranges as close as 200 meters without ill effect.

LaRue targets are battery powered and will cycle through approximately 1,800 down and up cycles before requiring a recharge. After being hit, the target returns to the upright position and automatically shuts off until the silhouette is again hit and knocked down. This is the primary reason for the systems long battery life. It also precludes having to turn the targets off and on, although there is a master on/off switch.

The targets are weatherproof and can be left out without damage. Users have reported leaving LaRue targets exposed to the weather over a year's time without affecting their operation. LaRue Tactical stands behind the quality of its targets and will repair or replace any target that is found to be defective.



Some of the main advantages over traditional targets are:

Battery Powered. Automatically resets 1800 times between charges.

Man Portable. 72 lbs total weight.

Self Contained. No assembly required, no set-up, no hoses, no wires!

Battle Tough. 3/8"" thick 500 Brinnell target. Withstands .223s and .308s.

All top of the line components.  One surprise is that when firing outdoors I found the KX3 really improved the sound for me as the shooter, it was much softer than I expected.

I bought this rifle used 3 or 4 yrs ago from the local gun store. It belonged to the owner of the store. He is the one that had the nice dura coat tiger stripe pattern put on.

He had fired two hundred rnds through it, and I have put less than a hundred myself. To be honest the only reason I bought it was because of the tiger stripe finish as I have 3 other M1a’s. It has mostly sat in the gun safe and I need to fund another project.

The gun shoots well and functions as it should. No malfunctions during my very limited shooting. 

The dura coat is worn in one (see picture) spot from bench shooting. The sight are well marked with orange paint (done by previous owner). There is a square of black skateboard tape on the metal butt plate. It does an excellent job of reducing slippage with the slick military metal buttstock."

This is a pre-1964 rifle (manufactured in 1952), which is very desirable because quality declined after 1964. 

Very good condition, no pitting and bluing looks great. One minor nick in the stock, but it is very hard to see because it is small and the wood is dark (see picture).

Comes with a weaver scope mount and a cheap tasco scope. 

Will also throw in 20 rounds of .30-30

The wife wants this one gone, so I'm a motivated seller. Cash preferred, but open to trades."

If it has not been used that much I am still willing to work out a deal, just ideally want to get one that has been through its breaking in period and for a somewhat decent deal since i know how hard they are to come by, in California at least. I am willing to drive out to meet you. I live in the San Fernando valley but I will drive to Orange County and Riverside to meet you at an FFL. If you live farther I would be willing to meet half way to your location. I would like to inspect it in person.

Chambered in .12 ga 2 3/4 or 3 inch. This gun has ran flawlessly with around 3000 rounds through it. I have kept it in very good condition, always cleaned the day after the range, and cleaned well. 

This model features the XS ghost rings sights (i could hit 8 inch group at 100 yards with slugs) and the door breach choke barrel. It patterns buckshot and bird well, you can shoot trap with it all day and hit proficiently. 

Comes with the Esstac Shotshell card system, a velcro shell delivery apparatus that seems to me as the best side saddle system available on the market for a tactical shotgun. They are conveniently sized to fit in AR mag pouches perfectly. Also included will be the TAG shotshell carrier. This rig holds 21 rounds of .12ga and can be worn on a molle plate carrier. 
Also included is mixed ammo, mostly buckshot, 25 slugs and some bird shot. around 130 rounds total.

This is a great deal to get you started with your tactical shotgun loadout. If you are looking to make a minuteman loadout based around a molle system, this will suit you better than anything.

**PLATE CARRIER NOT INCLUDED, JUST THE FRONT MOLLE SHELL HOLDER  AND THE ESSTAC SHELL CARDS**

I bought it new in early 2011 and I've taken good care of it. It probably has around 1500 rounds through it. The only time I've had issues with it was when I used Frog Lube, otherwise it has been rock solid as Berettas often are. This gun comes with 3 holsters--2 Blackhawk and a Versacarry for concealed carry. As you can see, one of the Blackhawks has the STRIKE attachment for putting it on a chest rig or anything with molle. This is a great way to carry the gun as it's one of the more heavy ""modern"" handguns. 4 of the mags are Beretta 15 rounders, 4 are mecgar 18 round, 1 is mecgar 20 round. I also have the Beretta steel guide rod and extra springy spring. I've used the polymer guide rod way more as I think its ultimately better, but the metal guiderod is good if you're running some of those crazy Buffalo Bore rounds or want the recoil dampened a bit. Each to his/her own though. I also put those amazing Hogue grips on the gun which bring the gun to a whole other level in terms of comfort and control.

925,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3728925,For Sale:  H&K VP9,"Traverse City, Northern Lower Peninsula, Michigan",$ 640,"Listed On: Monday, December 1, 2014",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,no type,Pistol,"HK VP9 Striker Fire 9mm - M700009-A5


In development for more than four years the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9 but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns producing both the VP70 and P7 series designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs.

The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short light take-up with a solid single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9 you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accomodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting security military and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous longterm durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And the VP is remarkably value priced.Mention the name Heckler & Koch in knowledgeable circles and immediately eyebrows raise and heads nod in recognition.

HK has earned the respect and admiration of the world’s most elite military and law enforcement operators through its “no compromise” commitment to firearms innovation and performance. But what really makes an HK pistol different from other pistols? Maybe the fact that Heckler & Koch maintains the most thorough testing regimen for new products in the firearms industry. Little known outside of Heckler & Koch facilities and offices throughout the world is a highly structured HK testing program that strictly follows well-established company protocols and procedures. Under development for more than four years the HK VP9 has been subject to just about every test imaginable — NATO AC/225 and U.S. NIJ drop tests water dust mud and sand tests that duplicate the most extreme environments and harshest operational conditions in the world.
VP pistol function and abuse tests included firing more than 10000 rounds of a wide variety of international ammuntion types through sample pistols. During these tests — accuracy wear and tolerance readings are taken to establish the capabilities performance and realistic service life of the new VP9 pistol in all environments. Unlike some manufacturers HK test fires all VP9 pistols for accuracy function and proofing (for international and German industrial certification) before they leave the factory. This passion for testing is just one morepart of what separates HK from the pack.
