One last note, measured from the end of the buffer tube to the end of the barrel with the flash hider removed the gun measures right around 27 inches, and therefore is classified as a firearm rather than a pistol and could legally have a vertical forward grip installed. I never did because I don't shoot as well with a forward grip, just pointing it out for potential buyers.

This rifle is Romania's Version of the famous ""Dragunov"" Sniper rifle, Semi Auto with Two 10 round magazines. As of 2010, these rifles were no longer Imported into the US (permanently). Many say this is by far the best Rifle that has ever came from ""Century Arms"", and are now a rare find/investment rifle, or a great shooter. $1250-$1300 is going rate for these when NOT getting ripped off, but I see them as high as $1600-1800 on Gunbroker if one is even listed.)

 I'm selling cheap being the $125 scope doesn't come with it and I would like to buy a Rifle which I already have ammo for. This was the ""Oddball"" in my collection, although I couldn't decide if I wanted to keep it ""Like-New"" or shoot targets out to 600 yards, but I've decided to sell it.

 It has ALL Matching # Parts all the way down to the dust cover, Two ""10 round Mags"" (Highest capacity mag they make for this rifle.) This Precision ""PSL-54"" has been in ""De-humidified storage"" for 5 years and every 6 months I have lubed the Rifle/Bore. Rifle feels/looks Brand New, only 8 rounds of ""Winchestor Brass ammo"" were put through this rifle and then it was stored. In the Eastern Countries, Its a ""Sniper Rifle"", in the US, its called a ""Designated Marksman's Rifle"" being the US has more advanced sniper type Rifles.

This ""PSL-54"" was imported from the ""Cugir Factory in Romania"" and is in 98% condition (I say that being 8 rounds fired were through it, had no ear plugs so didnt fire anymore and has been stored ever since...Its literally ""LIKE-NEW"".) Has beautiful blonde wood also and a tight action/ tight receiver unlike any AK pattern rifle I've ever felt (which AKM's normally have a wobbly Bolt Carriers, this PSL has no wobble nor even any wiggle to it.)

 Comes with 2 magazines. It doesn't have the ""PSOP- 4x24 SCOPE"" that normally came with this model (Low end Russian ""PSOP"" scope), but luckily you can purchase a better PSOP for $100-150 if you want a traditional Russian Scope that is better than the standard scope that came with PSL's.

 I'm Selling this Rifle for the rock bottom price of $950 FTF (Face to Face). These Rifles are going from 1200-1800 right now online being they are Rare and will only continue to rise in price. People are either hoarding these, or selling them high priced like ""Saiga"" Rifles. I've listed this at a rock bottom price. I would like to sell this to fund another Rifle of a different caliber. 

Absolutely NOTHING wrong with this awesome Rifle, it just needs a new home. Again, it LITERALLY is ""LIKE-NEW"", was going to include the box but cannot find it at the moment but am still looking so may have it when its time to sell.

EMAIL ME IF YOUR INTERESTED (and for more Details/Pics)!! If I do not sell it locally within a couple of days, I will remove listing and place on Gunbroker or a Forum Market, but being things are easier face to face, I would rather avoid the Bidding process, Money Orders, and Shipping charges involved with Gunbroker. Although I will do so if I have no takers within a couple of days.

Hope to hear from you, I am in the Fayetteville Area so if you are nearby, Email me and we can talk about the Rifle more in depth.

Thanks for looking!!"

If you aren't familiar with the Cougar design it is the precursor to the Beretta PX4 and uses a rotating barrel action to improve accuracy and lower recoil. Identical to the Beretta Cougar aside from the name on the slide; Beretta transferred the tooling and manufacturing equipment to Stoeger, Stoeger being a subdivision of Benelli, which is in turn owned by Beretta. Has the same manual of arms as a Beretta 92/M9, so its a great choice if you're looking for a more compact version for carry.

Has some light holster wear from being carried but overall is in good shape, bought new about two months ago and only has about 200 rounds through it. Will come with two 13 round magazines. Depending on what you have I can also include an extra 15 round magazine (modified Beretta 92 mag) and some 9mm ammo.

Just picked up a different compact carry gun, so I'd like to swap this for a bigger 9mm. Looking for a mid or full sized 9mm. Primarily looking for a polymer framed striker fired 9mm such as a Springfield XD9, Glock 17 or 19, Ruger SR9, or M&P9 but would consider similar 9mm's in this size range. Only looking for 9mm's though, and no Taurus or Kel Tecs please, with the one possible exception being a PT92. Would be fine with adding cash for a higher value trade, so feel free to let me know what you have.

If not interested in trading I will sell it with the three mags and 50 rounds of 9mm for $350 FIRM.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested, texts preferred.

This rifle has been cleaned inside and out, firing pin protrusion has been set, headspace has been checked and is well within specifications. This rifle is ready to shoot. Bayonet, ammo pouch, tools and sling included. As with any firearm, it is recommended to have a qualified gunsmith inspect this rifle before you shoot it. No license required for in state (residents) face to face transfer. I do ask for a copy of your drivers license and that you sign a statement indicating you can legally own a firearm. Desire cash but would consider a trade for a Springfield XDs in .45ACP and make up the difference in cash (only for instate FTF transaction). If you reside out of state, I would have to ship it to an FFL - C&R ok and will only accept a money order for the rifle and the actual cost of shipping to you.

This ad is for a drop in (no fitting required) Storm Lake Threaded Barrel w/ Threaded end protector. 416R stainless Barrel is 4.48"" long (stock is 3.78"" long).  Under 50 rounds down barrel.

Advantages over stock - 

The added length will bring your projectile velocities up to the full size Glock 20 levels.  

The Storm Lake barrel also has a fully supported chamber so you can shoot full power 10mm loads without getting ""glock smiles"" in the brass"".  If you reload you want this.

Match grade broach rifled bore allows you to shoot jacket or hard cast lead bullets.  These types of bullets can lead up the stock barrel or tumble when shot thru a stock barrel.

No Trades.  This is less than I paid so price is firm."

Also, it is NOT stamped ""TEC-DC9"" or ""AB-10"". It is the true Tec-9. I am putting it at $500 trade value. This gun is nice enough to meet the price. Also, to add to the equation is this Police Trunk Pack. I purchased it on the promise that it would fit my Hummer H3... Well, it didn't. I am looking maybe $250 trade value for it? In total, what I would love to get for trade value is $800, but realistically it is more like $700. I really would like to trade for something new."

I liked this scope, but the reticle is better suited for faster CQB type shooting and I had it on my RECCE rifle. I changed to a more traditional reticle.

Would be the perfect scope for a 16"" AR that is used for home defense and also plinking on a 200 yard range.

The Larue mount in the picture does not come with it. I did find some nice low scope rings that I can include though. On an AR-15 the scope would mount, but it will sit low so you wouldn't be able to fit flip-ups below it, see attached photo."

Designed by SF veterans, the ODS uses your natural hardwired instincts to align vertical and horizontal lines to create a self-aligning front and rear sight picture. They are steel. The front is clawed like a wolverine to bite into a pocket seam, jeans, belts or anything you might need for a speedy emergency one handed slide clearing. If this isn't the sight for you, I'll take them off and put them on another Glock. Factory sights still available and will come with the package.

Selling the Gen 4 G34, wrapped in a Brooks Tactical Get ""A-Grip"" suede feeling wrap. The wrap cushions and grips the hands like a glove - and then gets sticky/tacky when wet with sweat or blood (I have this on my carry weapon too). Non marring if you want to take it off - I have all the original beaver tails and backstraps if that is your fancy. Also including a Kydex for OWB range type carry. Comes with 3x 17 Round magazines. These haven't even left my house because I have 20 or so Glock 17 mags to use for training and range time. They are pristine.

So: G34 Gen4 goes for $650 @ Buds (best price I could find w/ free shipping). ODS for Glock are $159 @ Amazon plus shipping/tax. Brooks wrap is $30 everywhere. Kydex was about $50. Comes out to just shy of $900 if you bought this retail... not including shipping/FFLs/tax. I'd like $750. For the whole package, that is firm. If you want to talk about different sights or something, we can discuss.

 Includes all the factory-original stuff: hard case, both 15-round magazines, cleaning gear, paperwork, and test fired shell casing.
 As can be seen on the photo, the finger ridges have been smoothed out, a mod that many folks prefer to do with these later generation Glocks, because these finger grooves are annoyingly misplaced and don't align well to most adult hands. This also makes something like a Hogue grip sleeve fit much better.
The plastic factory sights have been replaced with a set of steel XS Big Dot Sights. The front sight dot is glow-in-the-dark tritium, that glows brightly and has years of life left in it.
The original plastic sights are in the case, and are a fairly easy switch (though I can't imagine anyone wanting to do so, since this is a set of $90 steel sights.)
Again, the pistol is in virtually new condition, with just a few hundred rounds through it (saving you the cost of breaking it in) and has always fired 100% reliably and accurately, and I have no problems with a test fire if you have someplace safe and convenient to shoot.
Buyers must be over 21 and legal Georgia resident, and willing to prove it with valid  Ga. drivers license.
I'm also a Georgia resident, and have my Georgia carry permit, so everything's good on my end.
No shipping, no checks, no drama. If the ad is still up, I still have the pistol, I won't respond to spam e-mails asking if ""the item is still for sale"".

822,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3923822,For Sale:  Model 1841 Harpers Ferry 1853 Attic Find,"South Hills, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","$ 2,100","Listed On: Monday, February 9, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The barrel is 33"" long, bore measures .54 Cal. using my calipers and the rifling is in really nice shape. From the research I found these barrels were browned and this one has some surface rust over that. I know better than to ""clean"" it with anything harsh. When I wiped it with a light oil some of the rust/dirt came off and you can see the brown finish in places. It looks like this rifle was kept in the attic and not out in the barn. 

Lock stamped Harpers Ferry, 1853, behind the hammer and and has the eagle in front of it. The barrel tang is stamped 1853. There is a letter s stamped on the right barrel flat just in front of the bolster.

The letters W W over P are stamped on the left side of the barrel. I can see some other markings behind those but can't make them out. From the little I was able to learn these were proof marks. They are there but tough to make out. It has the correct brass front sight and rear V notch.
It does look like someone, at sometime in its life, dropped the rifle muzzle down. You can see that in the pic of the muzzle/rifling.

The letters J L B are stamped on the left of the stock above the trigger and inside the patch box. There is a spare nipple in the box. The ramrod is a steel tulip tip.

This rifle was used. There is some checking in the stock behind the lock. It looks like the wood has dried out and the grain lines opened up a little. They really don't look like cracks but it's tough to tell. The are various nicks and dings in the wood but no other splits or cracks that I can see.

The lock functions fine. The hammer spring is really strong and there is no play or slop in the trigger. There are still some fine traces of the case color on the lock behind the hammer. 

The steel has no pitting in it just an overall brown ""patina"". The brass is tarnished but not beat up. The rear band has a small scratch in it and the butt plate has a few dings in the top edge.

Includes 100 rounds of ammo.

100 rounds fired. Excellent condition. I'm the original owner and bought it brand new. Shoots great and definitely is a fun gun. Two things are to mention. 1. When I bought it new, I noticed the front sight was a little loose. Contacted the seller and he said I can go through smith and wesson and get a free replacement. I never went through it with as it started to not bother me. Sight still works however. 2. Today when taking the photos, I saw part of the grip on the backside has a small chip in it. Don't know how that happened as I was always careful handling it. Never setting it on a hard surface and always in a case.

Because of those two minor imperfections and gun being used. I am asking $650 and I will include 100 rounds of 44 magnum ammo.

I would be wiling to meet and drive around a half hour on the interstate, however due to too many flakers recently. I will have to only meet you in grovetown.

I want to sell just for cash and would not like to trade this one. If seriously interested, contact me through text or phone call at REDACTED, and we can try to work out a deal. I'm already taking a loss on the sale, but I've enjoyed the gun and now realize it is not needed in my collection anymore.

Pistol comes with case, 2 magazines, thread protector, and faux suppressor barrel extension. Pistol is in excellent condition with less than 200 rounds through it. Both Taclight and thread protector are H&K brand. Adjustable sights. 10+1 capacity. 

Enhanced versions of the USP, the USP Tactical models are designed for users who need the features found on the HK Mark 23, but in a more compact pistol. Both pistols approach the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel with a rubber O-ring, adjustable trigger, and adjustable target-type sights. Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. 

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. 

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes."

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3923998,For Sale:  Astra Model 400 9mm Largo or .38ACP. (NOT 9mm Luger),"Central, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 280,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 12, 2015",Handguns,Astra                                                                                ,38 Super                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Serial # 712XX 

The Astra Model 400 is known for its ruggedness and reliability. This gun is very clean, with no rust and a clean bright bore. There is slight tarnish on chromed trigger.

Comes with 93 rounds of ammunition.

Good as a collector or shooter.

While Ammo has been a bit scarce in the past, large lots of 1960's and 1970's ammo show up now and then. The good news is that at the last few gun shows that I attended, I noticed that some reloaders are now stocking newly made Largo ammo. New Largo brass is available from Starline, and it can be reloaded using 9mm Luger dies. You can also custom load .38 Super to shoot in this gun

Gun will function with .38 Super ammo, but don't do it, as the pressure in commercial .38 Super is higher than with Largo ammo, and you might damage the gun or yourself.

My research indicates that this gun was made in 1937. I have shot it, and it functioned perfectly for me.

Since this gun is over 50 years old, it is considered a Curio and Relic it DOES NOT require a background check for private transfer under Colorado law.

I will, however, require a valid Colorado photo ID.
