Both have the Bluetooth Sena SMH10 Intercom devices installed. The helmets are in excellent condition and so are the Bluetooth Devices. The helmets have the flip down sun visor and are modular helmets. This allows the rider to pull up the face mask to do things such as drinking or eating without taking the helmet off. One helmet is a LARGE and one helmet is a MEDIUM. These helmets were used by my wife and I. I have sold my motorcycle, so I am selling my gear.

These are the most comfortable helmets my wife and I have ever owned. We have owned them for about a year or so. The helmets are not cheap and cost $600 dollars each brand new. The Sena Bluetooth Intercom system works very well and costs around $299 new.

Everything is in great condition!!!! We are very clean and neat people so the helmets have been taken care of inside and out. Also, the liner of the helmets come out for cleaning.

These helmets truly are top of the line. Very comfortable for long distance riding and the intercom system allows you to visit with each other, listen to music, and take phone calls.

My loss is your gain for a great set of helmets and intercom system.

$750 takes it all!!!!!! You wont't be disappointed. Look up the prices new if you wish, you will find that this is a great deal.

The helmets are listed on Craigslist....link below.

This is a Glock 34 I purchased new from an FFL dealer a few months ago. It was assembled by a Glock master armorer who was the gun smith for the store and was never fired. He put a ton of money into it, but ended up selling it to the store for a huge loss to fund a new build. Their sticker price was $999, but I know the owner and got it for their cost. I don't do shooting competitions and I have many other guns made for home defense work, so it's just a super-accurate range toy for me. I can put all 17 rounds through 1 1.5"" ragged hole at 15 yards.

Total round count is 250. All federal and UMC brass case. Zero failures.

Here's all thats's included with costs:
Gen 3 Glock 34 with three 17 round mags and unfired factory barrel - 620
Slide professionally cerakoted black, tough as nails finish - 50
Vickers enhanced mag floorplates - 45
33 round stick mag - 45
Talon Grips - 18
Glock OEM extended mag release - 5
KKM Stainless match barrel - 190
Seattle slug for balance and a mag funnel effect- works well- 45
New tritium night sights - 100
Upgraded extractor and other internals - 100
Full length stainless guide rod and spring - 40
Tuned match trigger breaks at 3.5-4#, crisp with great reset- 110
New bladetech OWB right hand holster - 70
Plus 5 hours of gunsmith time polishing internals and assembly. - you determine value
His stated cost before tax was around $1400 I bought the stick mag separately because why not?

Also box, paperwork, mag loader, brush, cleaning rod, all the factory fresh stuff etc. It's basically a new gun.

Whole package, $775 FIRM. Was listed at $850 earlier, but reduced for fast sale. Will not last long. It's a steal at this price. Not even the cost of the gun and stainless barrel let alone the sights, trigger, etc.

Cash only unless you have some really awesome gun you don't see every day. FAL, G3, Lugers, HK p30, auto ordinance Thompson, or other cool guns with character. No AR's- I have too many already. Trades must be transferred through an FFL. I have CPL.

As per I-594 this gun must be transferred into your name at your choice of FFL in Snohomish or Skagit county. You pay transfer costs. I hate it just as much as you do- no exceptions. Will ship to any FFL dealer (where legal) for $50, overnight air.

Contact me with questions through email only so everything is understood and in writing. I don't respond to phone numbers, gibberish, or lowball offers. Can meet at Cabelas in Tulalip for viewing, or request additional pictures through email.

I have a new Armalite Super SASS I am looking to sell. I purchased this gun with the intention of getting into long range shooting, but other hobbies have taken my time and I never got out to shoot this thing. It is all set up to tack drive. With this set up, you can shoot 1000+ yards. This is an armalite factory rifle, not a parts kit franken-gun put together in a garage...

I have spared no expense on the optics and mount, so this is a true long range precision rifle, ready to shoot sub MOA. Please note, the Atlas Bipod is not included in the sale price. Since purchasing this rifle several months ago, it has spent all of its life in a climate controlled safe. Never shot and never dry fired. Its ready for your break-in ritual...

Below is what I paid for the items
Armalite Super Sass	$2,767.94
ADM AD-RECON Mount	$179.00
Hogue Pistol Grip	$20.00
DMR Bushnell Tactical Elite 3.5-21x G2 Ret. FFP Scope	$1,299.00
Total	$4,265.94

I'm asking $4000, as I know I will not get 100% of what I have in it even though these rifles are VERY hard to find. I have personally never seen one locally...CCW Holders are preferred, but I will expect to see proof of Ohio residency if not a CCW Holder. As this is a higher end rifle, I prefer to do a transfer at a gun shop so this is a safe and hassle free transaction for both parties. I am a straight shooter, and I appreciate the same respect from you."

These were imported by CAI of Georgia, Utah. They were used by security forces, so they show some wear. This is a DA/SA pistol, with very good original the sights (not night-sights) and the action works very well. The slide on this is heavier and thicker toward the muzzle end compared to a CZ, so it has less muzzle jump when fired rapidly. It is a consistent shooter. Most all of the internal parts are interchangeable with the CZ platform (EAA, Tangfolio) and this takes the CZ double-stack mags. I will include a 15-round magazine (no ammo) and the box I got it in.

Asking $65

Down behind enemy lines? Left to fend for yourself? These are the scenarios that inspired the LMF II. Former military man Jeff Freeman led the charge to engineer this fearless new 10"" survival knife. And we field-tested with the troops.

This knife is as adaptable as the personnel who carry it. Use it to cut through the skin of a fuselage. Or sever a seat belt. Or egress through the Plexiglas of a chopper. Plus the LMF II does a slick job cutting firewood and building shelter.

The over-molded handle successfully limits blistering. There is complete separation between the tang and butt cap so the knife absorbs the shocks from hammering and prevents the shocks of electricity. Smartly situated grooves and lashing holes let the LMF II convert to a spear. The low-profile sheath facilitates movement limits noise works for parachuting and attaches to a belt or Molle vest. The patented integrated sharpener means edge retention in the field.

To ensure dependability, Ultra Carry lightweight aluminum frames are machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. Each model has standard Kimber features like rounded and blended edges, beveled magazine well, extended thumb safety and bumped beavertail grip safety. Magazine capacity is 7 rounds in .45 ACP. They fit almost any size hand and point naturally. Best of all, the crisp, clean single action trigger eliminates long travel, heavy pull and the guessing that goes with it. For concealed carry, nothing beats a 1911–and no 1911 beats a Kimber.

I won't do to you what the person who sold this rifle did to me.  After asking the guy several times if the rifle had any problems and him assuring me that it ran with no issues, I found out very quickly that the rifle did have function problems.  Specifically failure to eject.  I'm selling this gun for less than a FAL parts kit would cost you.

With a lot of elbow grease I have gotten the rifle to run much better but it is not 100% by any stretch.  I have been shooting it on the 3-4 gas settings and using PMC and SA surplus with the best results.  The gun runs better now but for some reason the gas adjustment retaining clip pops off randomly and that will cause a failure to eject.  New springs are $10.  I'll be perfectly honest and say I'm not 100% sure that is the fix.

I have taken elk, deer, and hogs with this rifle in spectacular fashion. One hog that was standing about 130 yards away when hit did a total flip in the air and landed upside down on his back!

I handload for this rifle and will pass along the load data to the next lucky owner. 
For local buyers, I can include custom loaded ammunition with premium Hornady bullets for an additional charge. 

The cash price is $900 for the rifle only. 

The scope is a Leupold Vari X III 6.5-20X40 AO that I sent back to Leupold to have the reticle matched to my ballistic handloaded data for this rifle. In addition to the middle crosshair, there are four additional mil dots that correspond to various distances out to 500 yards. VERY ACCURATE!!

The new buyer will also get the original box and paperwork for this rifle.  
I would rate this gun at 98-99% 

I recently took this rifle in on a partial trade. The original owner only put 50 rounds through it and I shot it 10 times myself.

This rifle is very fun to shoot and VERY accurate even with cheap factory ammo. 

The Leupold scope on this rifle is a Vari X II 4-12x40 AO that looks brand spanking new and of course comes with a limited lifetime warranty that follows it from buyer to buyer. I have the original box and paperwork for this scope as well and I would rate it at 98-99%.

The cash price is $800 for the rifle. Add $400 more if you want the scope.

I priced this rifle at Academy and it's $999 so you can save $200 + tax and still get a like-new rifle.

The original factory box contains the original Ruger lock and extra factory add-on butt plate shims so that you can customize your length of pull.

I will not sell the scope by itself.

This private sale means there is no tax or paperwork required but a bill of sale will be conveyed to the buyer upon request.


Trades possible. Just make sure your offer is of equal or greater value.

I bought this RIA 9mm 1911 from a gun shop in Concord,NC used. It had 2 cheap aftermarket mag's with it. I got it home and test fired it, and it was jamming pretty bad. I thought it was the mag's so I tried my mag from a Taurus 1911 9mm and it worked much better. Found out I could not buy Taurus mag's separate from their gun. Took the gun to a gun smith and he worked on it but it still would jam and sometimes failed to extract the spent case. He said I needed OEM mags for the gun so I ordered 2.  The gun still fails to load the next round about twice in a mag full. Its like the bullet is being pushed nose down and hanging on the barrel lip, and still will occasionally fail to extract a spent case.
   So if you like to work on lost causes I got a good one for you. To get this gun you must have a Permit to purchase, a NC CCW, or a FFL.

THE LEGEND CONTINUES, The legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic is a semi-automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic features the original Swiss folding stock, as well as a polymer ergonomic forend.

The Classic’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ barrel.
SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger
housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. The SIG 556 Classic brings back the look and
feel of one of the world’s most sought after military rifles but on a platform available for law
enforcement and responsible citizens

This rifle also includes a SigSauure STL-300J Forgrip with Flashlight and Laser! SIG Sauer Stoplight Tactical Light and Laser is an extremely versatile and powerful light/laser combo.

You also have the option to activate the red laser for positive target engagement. The SIG Sauer Stoplight is designed to be mounted to the forend of an AR-15 style weapon that has a Picatinny rail. The Ergonomic rubber Overmolded grip provides great stability and comfort. {The wired remote switch is not included. Requires 4 3V Lithium Batteries.} ($180 Value) 

Iron sights adjustable for near, 100 meters, 200 meters, & 300 Meters. Has Picatinny rails for added options on forend and top rail for Red Dot or Scope. 

The rear of the slide had normal wear (see pictures). Other than that shows no cosmetic damage. Shoots like new.

accuracy in a pistol its size.

ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look.

Hey all,
	I have up for trade/sale a used but good condition Ipad Air 1st gen 16GB with Verizon 4G LTE  Data service. It is in good shape with normal wear a dent or two on the back. Nothing that makes it “too ugly” just what you would normally see after using one for a while. This would be a perfect way to replace your old broken one or simply get into the market for less than retail. This also will come with a factory wall charger, factory cable, and a set of unused EarPods. Also included is the original box and a red Smart Cover as well. 
	As far as trades are concerned, I would entertain certain offers on firearms, “maybe” partial trades of car audio set ups, and thats probably about it. Mainly looking for cash on this one. Need to be able to meet up around norman due to my schedule. Please shoot any questions or offers to REDACTED and we can go from there. 

Thanks for your time and have a good one!

1926 Savage in the rare Takedown configuration. This rifle has a removable barrel to allow for storage in a pack. The rifle features a rotary internal magazine with built in round counter visible on the side of the receiver.

Rifle is in perfect working order and could be used for hunting immediately if desired. Rifle has some surface rust on one side of the receiver and barrel. Stock has minor damage at the buttstock.

For hunting North American game the Savage 99 is still one of the finest hunting rifles of all time. In fact, it was a solid performer well into the later part of the last century, nearly one hundred years after its creation. It was manufactured for nearly a century with over a million rifles produced before the Savage 99 was discontinued due to decrepit machinery and increased cost.

The design of the 99 is superior to lever actions such as the Winchester 94 and the Marlin 336, because it can handle high intensity cartridges. It has several superior design features that make it more comparable to the Browning BLR and even modern bolt actions like the Winchester Model 70. The rotary spool magazine allows for the use of pointed bullets, which retain greater velocity downrange than the flat point bullets required by lever guns with tubular magazines. Its strong action allowed it to be chambered in many modern, short-action, high intensity cartridges. 

For a rifle designed in the last decade of the 1800's, it had many modern day features that are still prevalent on currently produced rifles. It has a cocking indicator on top of the tang and it ejected spent cartridges at an angle, which made it easily adaptable to the use of telescopic sights."

I took this rifle to the range this weekend and shot 5 shot groups all touching at 100yds and sub MOA at 200yds. I have only shot this rifle at 500+ one time and shot a 2.0"" group with a slight tail wind. This rifle has had a lot of work done on it to fine tune it to near perfection. It is extremely accurate. I guarantee that this rifle will outshoot any other .308 bolt rifle listed here on Armslist within 1K of my price. I am asking $675 cash for the rifle the way it sits less the scope.  If this posting is still up, the rifle is still available....

It has had some rounds through it (around 250) but the barrel has been well taken care of, never overheated and always kept dry, clean, and oiled.

I am not interested in any trades at this time so please do not ask. I simply want to sell the rifle for cash only. Must be an AL resident 18+ years old, non felon and sign a bill of sale.

In the world of AK type rifles THIS GUN IS VERY RARE. you almost never see them come up for sale. Not sure what the components are, but it has a standard AK receiver, NOT A WASR type. Regardless, it's the way they come from CAI, so look it up online. It has a threaded barrel and a Yugo type slant muzzle break installed (not set [is removable]).

This rifle is Chambered in 7.62 x 39 mm, it takes all standard AK mags. The very best thing about this bullpup is that the overall length is only 27"". That is just over the Federal long gun cut off of “more than 26” and allows you to carry the rifle with much greater mobility. This configuration allows close quarters tactical use. Perfect for Law Enforcement, Military or Home Defense. The gun can be fired “from the hip” or from the shoulder without having to fold or unfold it to fire. It’s always 27” and always ready to fire. All high capacity magazines will clear the pistol grip.

Preferably a Glock 23...it is my favroite model. I am possibly open to some 9mm/.380 or even a .357. Glock is my prefered system but XD's are also real nice. Im not looking for a full size weapon system...im looking for compact pieces. I may even entertain a Glock 27 (Sub-Compact) but Ive owned one in the past and did enjoy using it but unless you have the mag extenders it just doesnt feel ok in your hand. So with the extenders...I suppose I would be game!!! I have cash but I also have a few really rare PCGS certified Morgan Silver Dollar varieties that are valued over 1 grand. I am more than willing to ad a coin plus cash if you were interested or any other kind of trade + Cash like 2 coins and cash etc. The main firearm that I am looking for acquire is my favorite...a Glock 23. I have nothing bad to say about this system and have owned one in the past and kick myself in the ass for selling it. If you have any other pieces that you think I may be interested in...please feel free to let me know!!! Who know...I might be all over what you have and we could possibly come to a deal. But like I said...the G23 is my main want. Any questions please dont hesitate to ask. Remember...I have a few high value Morgan Silver Dollars that are encapsulated by PCGS (The number 1 and STANDARD of the rare coin business) that I am will to add as partial or full trade if you are into it like that. If you would like to see the coins I can send you pics. They are all mint state except one that is just below that is basically impossible to find in mint state and is a VERY RARE EARLY DIE STATE Variety. Either way...please lemme know what you have. Im very easy going and hope to hear from you soon!! Good luck on any sale you may have and lets educate this country on our second amendment rights!!!!
