Mags are also interchangeable with the Russian models with this pistol too.

This one is exceptionally clean and has 95%+ of it's original finish. The grips are in excellent shape, and numbers match except for the magazines. 

The best feature of this pistol and what sets it apart from so many other of all the TT33 variations that are being sold today is it's pristine, bright, shiny bore. Most all of the TT pistols being sold by the big distributors now are advertised as having ""dark but shootable"" bores. So not really best for accuracy or longevity.

It comes with two original mags that are in great shape, cleaning rod, and correct original leather lanyard. 

Additionally there is an original communist block country skeleton style or ""minimalist"" leather holster that I think looks neat as heck. 

Finally there is 100 rounds of 7.62x25 surplus ammo included. Ammo is clean & surefire surplus, but it is corrosive so cleaning your pistol is a must.

If you own a Beretta 96 .40 caliber pistol, you can use this beretta 92 FS 9mm complete upper to make the Beretta 96 .40 cal lower, into a SECOND PISTOL. All you need to do is remove the Beretta 96 40 cal. complete upper, and put on the Beretta 92FS 9mm complete upper on the Beretta 96 complete lower. Then use a regular 92FS 9mm magazine. This way you can interchange the full uppers, and magazines, and make a 9mm, and .40 S&W pistol. I have done this the opposite way with my 92FS 9mm, and using a 96 .40 cal complete upper.

    I am looking to purchase some Mosin Nagants. First things first, all of my rifles are taken out and shot regularly. I am not interested in either end of the Mosin quality spectrum. In other words, I'm not looking for a so-rusted-I-can't-use-the-bolt rifle, nor am I looking for a so-perfect-Stalin-himself-would-cry rifle. 

    What I'm looking for is quality metal. Absolutely no deep rust/severe pitting. Surface rust is totally fine, as is a completely beat up stock(so long as it's still in one piece) and lack of accessories; bayonet, sling and the like. In fact, I would prefer these 'lower-quality'(herein meaning the no one's bothered to clean it or fix the stock) Mosins. I quite enjoy my monthly deep cleaning of a new rifle.

    I use the standard quality scale when dealing with any firearm:

Very Poor
Poor
Fair - 100
Average
Good
Very Good - 150
Excellent - 170
Mint
New

    The numbers beside the quality marks are prices I have paid in the last week for Mosins me and the seller considered that level. I should note here, please do not hesitate to send in a counter-offer. If my exact terms don't meet with yours I'm sure we could find some middle ground and both leave happy. So, if you think your Mosin falls into that price range, or maybe you're just sitting on a few hundred Mosins and your wife's getting a bit upset, and if you are able to meet in or around NE Portland, please email me anytime at: 

REDACTED


    As with all my deals and trades, nothing is final until we have met face-to-face and inspected the firearms for ourselves. I don't want anyone to leave the table thinking they've been cheated, and I will work with you as much as possible on this to see us both leave happy. Please note, I have very odd weekends, Wed-Thur, so if I have to drive to you, it will have to be one of those days. Conversely, if you are able to drive to me, I am available everyday from 11am-2pm. If you are driving a distance and offering a fair price or fair trade, I would be happy to help pay for your gas to get here.


Please note! Face-to-face sale of firearms across state lines is illegal! This is an Oregon-only deal until my FFL comes in.

These deals are first-come, first-served. I will hold the deal if we are still negotiating, so don't worry if you need a few days to decide whether or not to do it. I am a collector myself, and I know how frustrating it is to decide to buy a rifle only to see it was sold mere hours ago!


Please contact me via: REDACTED

Pictures are preferred, but we can also meet up first and then decide on price.

The picture below are rifles I have purchased recently. They are meant to show you roughly what condition I will accept.

134,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3098134,For Sale:  RARE Pat Pending Hahn Crosman 45 BB gun Revolver,"Appleton, Green Bay, Wisconsin",$ 75,"Listed On: Thursday, December 18, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY EARLY ONE’S. 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A “PATENT PENDING” ONE BEFORE. SEE PICTURES.
Hahn 45 BB Single Action Revolver. P.Y. Hahn Mfg. Co. Fairport, New York. 
I believe Hahn was bought out by Crosman and believe this is the first model revolver Crosman made. I would guess late 50’s. It is the similar weight and feel of an original Colt 45. It shoots .177 bb’s.  It is in very good condition for it’s age with some paint wear as seen in the pictures. I haven't fired it, but it cocks and when I pull the trigger it clicks. The bb slide spring, tightening nut and the cylinder cycle all work. 
No cracks on the grips. 
Over 50 years old so I would assume it needs new seals or whatever, so it’s sold as is. 
Will ship to the lower 48 US States only. Shipping will be $12.00. 
No sales to New York City, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Staten Island, New Jersey, Chicago, San Francisco CA, Washington DC and Philadelphia PA. Or other areas where prohibited. Know your laws regarding bb guns. By bidding you are telling me that it is legal for me to ship to your address and that you are 18 years of age or older.
Any questions please feel free to ask. Cash if picked up.
USPS money order or paypal plus 3% of the grand total otherwise.
Thanks."

My goal was to get up over the $500 mark, so I've listed a few quality knives, and this pistol, for sale to reach that mark. If I can sell this pistol this evening, 50% of it will be donated to the charities that Carry the Load supports, with thanks to the buyer, of course.

That being said: FNX-40, low round count, not a lot of wear at all, except for the rear sight. Comes with box, manual, lock, paperwork from FNH, and three 14 round magazines. $500 or best serious offer, today only. Like I said, my flight leaves at 6am tomorrow, so this sale has an expiration date.

I hope everyone here enjoys their time off this weekend, and takes a moment to reflect on what cost it represents. Take care.

Open to trades.

Up for sale is my Winchester model 77 semi-auto .22lr rifle. It grades in 95%+ condition, all parts matching and original. One factory magazine included. Bluing is perfect besides the normal wear line under the charging handle. A couple light scratches and one small ding in the walnut stock, but it's all storage wear. Very nice for a 50 year old rifle. Bore is mirror bright. the rifle functions flawlessly and it has never jammed on me. Zero rust, corrosion, or pitting.

Extremey accurate. Shoots sub-MOA at 100 yards with bulk ammo. This may also be because there are very rare Redfield micrometer adjustable target sights installed on the rifle. The very same used by the U.S. shooting team in the 1960's. These sights alone sell for $300 on Gunbroker. The receiver also has a rail so you could take the sights off and attach a scope if you wanted.

Also included are vintage Lyman sight inserts. Just unscrew a cap on the front sight and you can switch out the sight picture to a few different options including a red-orange filter. 

And I'm throwing in a sealed new production brick of Remington 22lr ammo to sweeten the deal. 

These quality Winchesters couldn't compete against the cheap Marlins and they were only produced for a few years even though they are one of the finest .22 rifles ever made. The milling and finish work is second to none, and the barrel is super-heavy compared to any of my other 22's.

Selling the package w/ ammo for $375 cash, firm. 

$350 cash, OBO without the ammo.

Will take old military handguns as trade: makarov, TT-33, Star model B, smith and wesson chiefs special, etc. Also looking for retro m16/ AR-15 parts and a CETME. Will add cash for the right deal. Will take cases of ammo in almost any caliber as well.

I am a Washington CPL holder so you can be assured the rifle is in good standing. You must be 18 or older to purchase and I will have you sign a bill of sale for my records. No FFL transfer necessary. Would prefer to meet in Arlington, Snohomish or Cabelas, Marysville. Will ship to an FFL holder at your expense."

For sale is a LNIB Springfield Armory Micro Compact 1911 GI Military Spec .45 with originals and 5 magazines. I got it as a companion gun to my a Springfield Model 1911-A1 GI. The Micro was hard to find and there were not many made. I kept an eye out for it for years, only seeing it in adds and bought the 1st one I ever saw NIB. It has sat in the safe mostly ever since I bought it and only been shot a handful of times. It is a great lil Micro .45.

They have been a wonderful service to our youth shooting program. We have worked hard to raise funds using their promotional material (100% donated). It is simple. Buy the pocket knife set below from our organization for $30. Every purchase enters you for a chance to win a pair of Browning A-Bolts (One Adult and One Youth). The sale of each knife set yields our program approximately $120 in our trust. This includes matching funds and bonuses. Each year the team is able to use 5% of the trust to fund their program.
Our program is a precision rifle program that has been in existence only 3 years. We have had a Junior Olympian every year. Last year we had two team and one individual state champions. This year, we grew from our initial 12 shooters to 30. We traveled to Fort Benning, Georgia to compete in the Junior Air Nationals and placed 5th in the country. At state this year with only four disciplines we had two teams as state champions (International Air was a new state record) and two won state runner up titles. We had one individual state title and one new individual state record.
Our facilities have been our battle from the beginning. We have been in a barn, a gym, a business that closed, and a vacant building with limited heat. This year we have had a local businessman step forward and offer a building for little to no cost. We will need a new roof and a new parking lot along with some cosmetic improvements. Our goal will be to have this facility certified by USA Shooting as a Certified Training Center.
This summer we will begin a pre Para Olympic Program for youth with disabilities."

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

They have been a wonderful service to our youth shooting program. We have worked hard to raise funds using their promotional material (100% donated). It is simple. Buy the pocket knife set from our organization for $30. Every purchase enters you for a chance to win a pair of Browning A-Bolts (One Adult and One Youth). The sale of each knife set yields our program approximately $120 in our trust. This includes matching funds and bonuses. Each year the team is able to use 5% of the trust to fund their program.
Our program is a precision rifle program that has been in existence only 3 years. We have had a Junior Olympian every year. Last year we had two team and one individual state champions. This year, we grew from our initial 12 shooters to 30. We traveled to Fort Benning, Georgia to compete in the Junior Air Nationals and placed 5th in the country. At state this year with only four disciplines we had two teams as state champions (International Air was a new state record) and two won state runner up titles. We had one individual state title and one new individual state record.
Our facilities have been our battle from the beginning. We have been in a barn, a gym, a business that closed, and a vacant building with limited heat. This year we have had a local businessman step forward and offer a building for little to no cost. We will need a new roof and a new parking lot along with some cosmetic improvements. Our goal will be to have this facility certified by USA Shooting as a Certified Training Center.
This summer we will begin a pre Para Olympic Program for youth with disabilities.  Please consider purchasing this pocket knife set to help our program."

IN STOCK OR YOU CANNOT ORDER IT FROM US!  When ordered from G Code or other dealers you will wait months to receive your items.  WE KEEP THESE IN STOCK!The G Code / Haley Strategic INCOG inside the waistband (IWB) concealment holster is a joint development project between Travis Haley of Haley Strategic Partners and G-Code Holsters. The G Code INCOG is a minimum bulk, multi-positional, deep concealment, high quality Kydex holster with features and a quality unlike any other holster. Its distinctive features enable the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while facilitating the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw from the concealed carry. Inherent to the G Code INCOG are adjustments in the depth of concealed carry, angle of carry, the position of carry and security of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting points on the INCOG holster and the use of variable mounting components. Combined they maximize function respective to the users body type, concealed carry deployment tactics and personal preferences. The G Code INCOG holster is adaptive to varying operational environments and mission requirements. The mounting clip incorporates a negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the concealability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the positional security of the holster during use. This higher position facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. The INCOG mounting clips also have multiple mounting points further increasing the range of carry options and adjustments. The mounting clips open and slide down over the belt and lock in place. The clip is actuated via a finger tab, and is flexed to open allowing quick installation or removal from the belt. All INCOG holsters come with Black FUZZ coating which is a laminated fabric covering. At this time, PatriotTAC is ONLY selling the INCOG's with black FUZZ coating on our website. If you'd like to special order another coating/color, or ANY G-Code product, please contact us by phone, text, or e-mail.

The Model 512 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design uses a laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. The holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment. The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings.

Through this comprehensive Concealed Carry training program, PatriotTAC's students benefit from decades of real-world knowledge. Topics Include: - Practical Applications of Concealed Carry - Weapons Retention - Handgun Manipulation and Firing Techniques - Legal Aspects of Firearms Storage and Transport - Concealed Carry Gear Selection and Consideration - Firearms Safety Concerns While Carrying Concealed - Low Light Shooting Considerations - Drawing / Weapons Presentation from Concealed Carry - Modern Defensive Ammunition Selection - Defensive and Tactical Reloading - Firearms Safety at Home, In Vehicles, and at Work Participants are better prepared to deal with the real-life implications faced by legally armed citizens.

PatriotTAC's lead instructor first entered the law enforcement community in 1988, has a degree in Criminal Justice, and can provide personal and professional insight into the inner workings of the legal system, court processes, and what you should expect to happen if you had to use deadly force. Class sizes are kept at optimal sizes to prevent unnecessary waiting around and the instructor to student ratios are closely considered to ensure the safety and training value of each student.

Thanks

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitride finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."
