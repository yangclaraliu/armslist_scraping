Previously Sig Sauer made some P226 Equinoxes in 9mm because 9mm Equinox slides were built by accident and they finished the guns instead of destroying the slides. Those guns were never available again after that run. We are not sure if the same mistake happened with P229 slides and the factory finished the guns or if this is a limited short-term run of this configuration

Here's info on the RM01:

Trijicon RMR Red Dot Sight (LED) with 3.25 developed to improve precision and accuracy with any style or caliber of weapon, the Trijicon RMR Sight (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) is designed to be as durable as the legendary Trijicon ACOG. These Trijicon Red Dot Sights are an LED sight powered by a standard CR2032 battery. Housed in rugged forged aluminum, the Trijicon RMR Red Dot is extremely tough yet lightweight. New easy-to-use adjusters with audible clicks allow for quick windage and elevation adjustments.
The Trijicon RMR Red Dot is tougher than any alternative and suitable for military, law enforcement and hunting applications. When precision is the only option, your best option is the Trijicon RMR Sight. Built to provide optimum red-dot visibility against the target, you can acquire and hit your target quickly and more accurately. The new Trijicon RMR Red Dot Sight can be teamed up with the Trijicon ACOG or Trijicon AccuPoint for the ultimate in fast target acquisition or precise aiming at extended distances.
The Trijicon RMR Sight offers two illumination configurations. One choice is an innovative LED (light emitting diode) insert that automatically adjusts for brightness in any lighting situation and ensures optimum visibility of dot against the target. A second option is a dual-illuminated, battery-free model featuring Trijicon fiber optics and tritium. Accuracy is further enhanced with adjustments for windage and elevation and clarity is assured with the sight's ultra-clear, hard-coated lens.

On the surface, the AR-30A1 bears a family resemblance to its predecessor, the AR-30. But, every individual component of the AR-30 was scrutinized in the AR-30A1. As a result, only the pistol grip, buttpad, trigger, and a few small components from the AR-30 passed muster for the AR-30A1. All other components are new and/or improved. The result is a firearm that maintains its predecessor’s outstanding accuracy, light weight, and soft recoil while dramatically improving its ergonomics, adaptability, versatility, reliability and ease of use. Features of all versions of the new AR-30A1: Muzzle brake threads on the end of the barrels employ threads that are standard for the sound suppressor industry (5/8 x 24 for the 300 Win Mag and 3/4 x 24 for the 338 Lapua). So, many sound suppressors can be screwed directly onto the barrel without the need for an adaptor. The long, 26” barrel in the .338 Lapua enhances muzzle velocity, flatness of trajectory, and terminal ballistics."

45 Super is externally/dimensionally identical to 45 acp or 45 acp+P and is designed to be used in 45 acp semi auto pistols that have been fitted with stronger than normal recoil springs and a shock buffer, plus a couple other modifications. While you can shoot 45 SUPER out of some stock 45 acp+P pistols such as the Glock 21, HK USP or the full sized all steel 1911, you will batter your pistol if you do not have them modified to handle the extra pressure and slide velocity of the 45 Super.

All our 45 Super ammunition is loaded with flash suppressed powders so that if you have to fire in low light (when the criminal element is out) you will not be blinded by your own gun fire at the worst possible moment. 


To learn about the modifications your 45 acp pistol needs to reliably and safely fire 45 SUPER, contact Garey Hindman at REDACTED. Garey is the foremost authority on 45 Super modifications/conversions for your 45 acp and Garey performs such conversions for a living.


The below velocities were fired from my Colt Gold Cup Govt. Model (5 inch) that was converted by Garey.

1. Item # 45S185-----------1330 fps (185gr. Jhp)
2. Item # 45S200-----------1235 fps (200gr. Jhp)
3. Item # 45S230-----------1131 fps (230gr. Jhp)
4. Item # 45S230FMJ----1133 fps (230gr. FMJ-FLAT NOSE) 
5. Item # 45S255-----------1090 fps  (HARD CAST-FLAT NOSE)


As always with Buffalo Bore Ammunition, we use real world firearms to give you real world data and results.


All three of the JHP loads were designed for anti-personel use and for hunting small big game like deer. The two solid bullet loads were designed for breaking large bones like a bears shoulders or skull, but will work for anti-personel use as well if you need to shoot through cover like car doors or stick frame walls."

Previously Sig Sauer made some P226 Equinoxes in 9mm because 9mm Equinox slides were built by accident and they finished the guns instead of destroying the slides. Those guns were never available again after that run. We are not sure if the same mistake happened with P229 slides and the factory finished the guns or if this is a limited short-term run of this configuration

I promise you wont find one this clean anywhere, especially with such a nice scope on it!.
I have a ""Hunter""Super Blackhawk in .44 Rem Mag , grey laminate grips (RARE) with a Leupold 2x m8 long eye relief scope, this gun has provided me with several deer these past two years, but Im moving to a new state where I can use big bore rifles so Ill have no use for this pistol there. It has been fired approx. 20 times and is in perfect condition with no cosmetic or mechanical issues at all. I do have the original box with manual, it is a 1990 year pistol, there isnt one of these of gunbroker & there probably wont be, most guys that get these keep them. I also have a nice uncle mikes shoulder holster Ill throw in with it. It has a 7.5"" barrell and is accurate out to 85 yards that I have proven, but Im sure it would drop a deer at 100 yards no problem. I paid over $900 for the gun and over $300 for the scope so Im asking $900 for the package. Now is the time to get you a good deer gun for Indiana and this is it & I promise you wont find this gun in a store anywhere especially in this area of the country! I prefer text bc my work schedule is crazy (260) 239-eighteen twelve

600 rounds through this pistol. Has normal wear on it, no rust and well maintained. Second owner but first owner put zero rounds through it. Only have had 2 misfires with it and that was using Winchester ammo. I have seen it failure fall to feed 3 times but that's because my friend shooting it ""limp wrist"" the pistol.

300 rounds through it. Had about 10 misfires with Winchester ammo. Also the 10 round magazines may have loading issues with HP ammo but never with FMJ or ballistic tip type of ammo. I'm the second owner but first owner didn't shoot it because he got into air rifles instead.

Reasons I'm selling:
I have over 40 firearms so selling the ones I don't use and have time for. Both great guns and make a great hunting / backpacking / survival package. Both guns are used but in good overall shape, no rust or pitting. Also getting back into horseback riding for selling to fund a horse.

This listing is for (1) 50 caliber/M2A1 air/water tight Ammunition Can.  These are original US Military Issue.  They have been used 1 time.  Grade 1 cans.  They are in excellent condition.  The air/water tight seal is intact and the inside is rust free/clean (minus a little sand potentially).  They may possibly have some small dings, marks in the paint, or very small surface rust spots.  No used ammo can is perfect, but I have been in the surplus business for many years and have never had nicer ones than these.  These are great for many uses.  Tool boxes, storage & organization of small items, storing your ammo of course, or anything you need a water tight container for.  The stenciling on the outside of the can varies, but most of these are marked 5.56mm.   

We knock the dust off these, grade them,  and sell them as is.  We do not use oil/protectant on the outside to make them look shiney. Contact us with any questions you may have. We have lots of these available.  Contact us for shipping quotes.  Buyer pays actual shipping.

It's a beautiful, handy little rifle that shoots really nice & has a good smooth action. I didn't go crazy on the internals - just lightened up some springs & smoothed some of the rough spots. It does not have a short stroke kit. This would be perfect for someone interested in getting into SASS cowboy action shooting. It holds 10+1 of 45 Long Colt.

It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture. The new IC and its variants feature LWRC’s new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers. The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets.

The IC, as designed for the military, features non-IR reflective Cerakote Stealth that makes the rifle ‘disappear’ to image intensifying night vision. (This coating is for US Military applications only and is controlled by ITAR.)

The new Individual Carbine from LWRC International is proof that at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.

To the best of my knowledge all of this ammo is corrosive Berdan primed. I was told buy another person who seams much more knowledgeable than I, the following:

""M2 ball on the far right is definitely not corrosive (Lake City, 1966....Lake City went to non-corrosive in June of 1951 for M2 ball).  The one next to it should be two years after the introduction of non-corrosive at that armory (Twin Cities 1952...they went non-corrosive on M2 ball in Dec of 1950).  The rest is most likely all corrosive as you suspected....Belgian manufacturer.""

Colt 1917 Military DA Revolver.
Colt's large-frame revolver at that time was named the New Service. First introduced in 1899, the New Service had actually already served as an official US Army sidearm. That was the Model 1909 for which a special version of .45 Colt ammunition was also issued. It differed in having a wider diameter rim than commercial .45 Colt loads so as to insure case extraction. For the commercial market Colt sold New Service revolvers with 4-1/2"", 5-1/2"" and 7-1/2"" barrel lengths. Grips were checkered hard rubber and finish was the highly polished blue so typical of that era. Also typical were very crude sights consisting of no more than a blade-front silver soldered on the barrel and a thin groove down the revolver's topstrap for rear sight. Also standard on New Service commercial revolvers was a lanyard ring on the gun butt. 

In essence the New Service was already a military revolver just waiting for more service. The changes needed by the US Government to turn Colt's big commercial sixgun into the US Model 1917 were few. Checkered hard-rubber grips were replaced with smooth walnut ones. The shiny commercial blue was dispensed with in favor of a dull blue finish. For barrels, only the 5-1/2"" length was used on US Model 1917s. They were stamped ""U.S. Army Model 1917"" on the butt and ""United States Property"" under the barrel along with an inspector's mark at the top left rear of the frame. 

Sources vary to exact numbers, but Colt furnished more than 150,000 to the US Government in 14 months between October 1917 and December 1918. With about 355,000 Colt New Service revolvers made between 1899 and 1944, the government's purchase of US Model 1917s amounts to over 40 percent of the total.

The M1917's service didn't end with World War I. According to Bruce Canfield's US. Infantry Weapons Of World War II, over 96,000 surviving Colt '17s were kept in government hands between the world wars. Many thousands of those were pulled from storage and issued again in World War II. A sure way to discern if a Colt US Model 1917 was used again in WWII is if it now has the phosphate finish we commonly call Parkerizing instead of the original blue finish. Whenever possible, frontline unit members who were issued handguns received 1911s. The .45 ACP military revolvers mostly saw secondary service in the hands of MPs, POW Camp guards, etc. Still plenty of photos exist of combat troops in both the Pacific and European Theaters of Operations with Colt US Model 1917s in their holsters and/or hands. American troops are nothing if not good scroungers.

“The U.S. Army is moving forward to replace the Cold War-era M9 9mm pistol with a more powerful handgun that also meets the needs of the other services,” foxnews.com reports. “As the lead agent for small arms, the Army will hold an industry day July 29 to talk to gun makers about the joint, Modular Handgun System or MHS.” Fn! I mean, fun! This, after…what’s it been now? Five years? “The MHS will be an open-caliber competition that will evaluate larger rounds such as .357 Sig, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.” The rest of the article talks about shot placement, shot placement, and shot placement. And .40 wear and tear. So . . . my money’s on .45 making a comeback. Or a non-Beretta 9mm. By 2020. Depending entirely on the politics behind the scenes, of course. [ht/ JG]"

Double/Single action provides a very safe and time proven design. Steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.
