I was more accurate with this one when compared to the Springfield XDm, so I bought this one a year ago. I never shoot it since I stay busy building 300 BLK pistols and ARs, so it's time to sell.

Just purchased this a few days ago at a local shop but I have decided to try something else.  It's seen a field strip with packing grease removal and re-lubrication, then a 200 round trip to the range, and finally another field strip/clean/lube.  It functioned flawlessly at the range with good extraction/ejection and no failures at all.  I'm including a nice right handed Bladetech nano IWB kydex holster which can be used as a straight drop for appendix carry, or changed to a standard cant for strong side carry. 

Comes with all factory materials in the case plus holster.

Ohio purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person at our location. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.  If you’re not a local resident, and can’t make the drive to our location, we can ship the firearm to a local FFL dealer in your area.  The receiving FFL dealer will complete the background check, and transfer the firearm to you.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.  We do not accept returns on firearms, because once the firearm is sold, it is considered a used item, and we can no longer sell it as new.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade, because we cannot examine the firearm before buying it.

It is a dedicated 22 cal ar rifle.  It has a new frontier armory polymer ar 15 lower with a magpul ctr stock in tan and a magpul badlever.  Then i took a stripped upper and added a 17 inch 11 oz carbon fiber wrapped taccom 22 barrel and mate it to the reciever.  I then surrounded that with a 13 inch 5 ounce and thin taccom  carbon fiber handguard.  And to make sure it could cycle faster thN i could pull the trigger i used a cmmg stainless evo 22 bolt to run it.  altogeher it comes in at maybe less than 5 lbs.  I used it as my 3 gun trainer but only ran about 250 rounds through it.  Asking $ 475. Does come with one 25 round. Black dog mag

I have used the load data from the third one down in my Mossberg 500 with good results.

 These slugs were designed specifically for re-loaders. The diameter is sized .680"" to allow the slug to be loaded into a standard plastic trap wad in place of the shot. While most commercial slug loads have a rolled crimp, the loads for this slug were developed for a conventional folded crimp on top of the shot shell. These really are as simple as replacing the shot with a slug and using the load data which is included with your order. Additional load data is also readily available on the internet. I suggest you try loading a few first to make sure they work to your satisfaction before loading a bunch of these. Occasionally, a combination of shot shell and wad will result in the wad being reluctant to separate from the slug, but an inexpensive piece of felt, paper or cardboard wad between the shot cup and the slug will prevent this problem. Or simply choose a different wad. Most of the time, this is not an issue at all.

The slug is loaded in a standard trap hull with standard wad and conventional folded crimp. Slug loads are produced with any shot shell reloading press. These slugs feature the exclusive drive key. The drive key is the horizontal tab shown inside the hollow base. It positively rotates the slug in rifled shotgun barrels. The key doubles as a support rib allowing use of a standard trap wad - no need for a support wad or base filler. The sabot wad design outperforms rifled slugs in rifled slug barrels. Velocity and accuracy meet or exceed expensive factory loaded rifled slugs. Even in smooth bore shotgun barrels, the accuracy is surprisingly good, and the smooth bore allows you to easily switch between shot and slug load

I will provide load data to whom ever buys these."

Including the S&W blue gun rug that came with the first 500 pistols sold. The last few sold on Gunbroker went for over $700. And none were as perfect as mine. 
*******Just a heads up. If the ad for the 2213 on here for $470(a low price to intice buyers) in Minnesota is still up disregard it. It is a scam. The pictures were taken off a GB post.

Our firearms are competitively priced, please do not contact us with low ball offers.  Prices are firm. 

Ohio purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person at our location. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.  If you’re not a local resident, and can’t make the drive to our location, we can ship the firearm to a local FFL dealer in your area.  The receiving FFL dealer will complete the background check, and transfer the firearm to you.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.  We do not accept returns on firearms, because once the firearm is sold, it is considered a used item, and we can no longer sell it as new.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade, because we cannot examine the firearm before buying it.

I've had  a few nice ones and I keep letting them get away from me, so I'd like to get another.  I prefer one with a 3 inch barrel, but will look at 4 inch as well.  Also prefer a heavy barrel over a pencil barrel, but again, will look at both.  However, I am only interested in a round butt model, I am not interested in a square butt unless its a 3 inch barrel.

I'm a serious buyer with cash in hand, will spend  $300-$350 on one depending on condition.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested, texts preferred.

I would like to trade for a Romanian GP WASR-10/63.

A little about the lower: It is an older Gen2, so Gen3 PMAGs don't fit unless you alter the mag or the lower's mag well. The issue is the over-insertion tab on the back of the Gen3 PMAGs just barely don't fit because of the lower's flared mag well. You can force them in, but I wouldn't recommend it. All other mags are compatible as far as I know.

This lower used to be registered on a Form 4 as an SBR. However, since it is no longer in SBR configuration, it is treated like a normal lower. If you have questions reference the ATF website: https://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/national-firearms-act-short-barreled-rifles-shotguns.html#receiver-sale

I had a professional gunsmith mill out the inside a little. It doesn't really change anything, just makes it the same dimensions inside as a select fire lower minus the hole needed for the full-auto sear. It doesn't change the legality.

The castle nut is not staked. The LPK is CMMG.

This is a side-by-side, double barrel CAP GUN.  It’s a high-quality, Limited Edition piece and clearly one of the most realistic looking toy guns ever made. You won't find this at Target or WalMart. Make Santa's gift special this year for your young sportsman, and one they won't put on the shelf anytime soon.

Die cast metal receiver, steel barrels and double triggers, this cap gun also has a true break-open action. It includes two “shot gun” shells for youngsters to practice both loading and un-loading. The receiver has “engraved” scrollwork, which was then ""antiqued"" to look very authentic. This piece also has a functioning safety, put right where it should be. The stock set is a thick, high quality wood-grained synthetic.  Just check out the photos!

It can also shoot proprietary caps. 

If your young hunter isn't quite ready for his own shotgun, he can now own the next best thing. This authentic looking side-by-side toy shotgun, scaled down to 33"" and very lightweight - is a great way to learn gun handling and safety.

Very, very good condition.
I bought this revolver from a veteran who kept it meticulously.  I bought it for my wife and she doesn't like the recoil from the ultra-lite frame.  So it became a backup gun for me, but now I'd rather sell it and spend the money on something else.

Its appearance is excellent.  If you look really close, you'll see a bit of holster wear along the top of the frame.  

I am a private owner/seller.  I require your ID; I will photocopy it and keep the copy in my records.  Must be 21 years old or older.  

The price is firm at $375.  I paid $425 for it two years ago, and I see that  you can buy a used Model 85 in titanium on gunbroker.com for roughly $330 to $375.  If you buy my revolver, you don't have to pay shipping or a dealer transfer fee, and you don't have to wait.
