I think what I'm asking is reasonable. Also come with original factory rear sight, ghost ring sight, original trigger assembly, and a second set of grips.
Have maybe 300 rounds through it, people knock these guns... but anything happen to it from you lose a spring (did that several times) to breaking the frame in half they will fix it for your cost to ship it to them or they send the part out free right to you.
I'd keep it but I guess 5 guns is the house maximum.
I can also strip the paint off the barrel if it isn't your thing, it's just stone accent spray paint with a matte clear coat."

Desert Eagle XIX 44mag is an amazing firearm, as long as you shoot 240gr brass loaded rounds. also NO cast loaded rounds, due to the polygonal rifling and the gas system can get lead fouling. FMJ or jacketed softpoints are fine. has around 50 rounds through. if i was to take a cash price in the condition its in with low round count would be $1450.

Trades just offer, worst i can say is no. with that in mind be realistic on your trade. im very easy to deal with and will respond politely.

Only issue in the interior is a hanging head liner due to sitting. Willing to meet within reason. Clean title in hand. Let's work out a deal. Would make someone a great little truck.

I have a Polish Tantal AK type rifle chambered in 5.45x 39 Russian. 
It is the true commie barrel. 

This is one of the more unique variants of the AK series. 

It comes with:

Rifle
    - polish kit from when you could get the kit with uncut polish barrels
    - barrel is chrome lined Polish barrel original with the kit
    - NDS-2T receiver from nodak spud
    - side folder, rifle completely functional with stock folded.  
    - reinforced pistol grip plate
    - 922R compliance parts are:
            - tapco pistol grip
            - gas piston
            - receiver
            - 3 parts of tapco trigger group
    - some would consider it a ""rough"" finish, but the finish is untouched from how it came as a kit. I did this to retain some authenticity. 
Sling
Bayonet
3 ""Tantal"" magazines -- additional magazines available at $15 each. All but 4 are tantal, total of 11 available.  -- brown magazine pictured has been sold. 
5 magazine pouch
Oiler 
500+ rounds of ammo (all magazines are loaded, plus 4 paper 30 rd packages, one stripper clip, speed loader, and at least 60 rounds of loose 7n6 ammo.)
All but 60 rounds of ammo are the 7n6 ammo from a spam can
The other 60 is 70 grain golden tiger ammo. 
*if I can find it also:
2 more stripper clips
Ak74 cleaning kit

This is my bottom dollar on this rifle and I will not drop the price because you have to travel.
I have much more in the build, and this is a quality kit. I have priced it fairly for what it is. The magazines offered with it are cheaper than you can find online anywhere. 

No trades. Cash only. 

If you have your MO CCW, I'll throw in 3 more mags for no extra cost. 
Strong preference given to MO CCW permit holders."

THIS IS AMAZING AMMUNITION - These are nothing like those normal ""green tip"" light armor piercing 5.56NATO rounds... these are PENETRATOR rounds and have unbelievable accuracy and destruction.  This same ammo has been manufactured and sold to the U.S. and foreign Governments for use in combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other foreign theaters of war.

This ammunition is powerful enough to penetrate up to 3mm (0.12 in) of steel at 600 meters & up to 12mm (0.47 in) of RHA steel at 100 meters. 

These rounds are not cheap range fodder.  These are battle rounds that are moisture sealed to military specifications for long term storage.  The ammunition is manufactured in Romania, by Uzina Mecanică Sadu, which is an ISO 9001:2008 (Certificate 154-C) and AQAP 2110 certified manufacturing facility.  They have been manufacturing high quality ammunition for 75 years and have been supplying our armed forces and our allies overseas to this day.

These are NOT reloaded ammunition!  These are 62 grain full metal jacket SS109 5.56NATO rounds that are brand new from the factory, boxer primed, and in a beautifully sealed brass case.  If you reload your ammunition, after you fire off these rounds you will find the brass some of the best you can use for reloading.

Now the good news...the mechanics are fine, lockup and timing are perfect and it is accurate, as you would expect. Trigger is great as well.. The finish on the cylinder was luckily not touched. Very nice gun to hunt with and could be reblued to very nice, but not to collectible grade. Fair price of $410 in Frankfort...that is the bottom dollar.

944,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3254944,For Sale:  Professional Knife Sharpening,"Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama",$ 1,"Listed On: Friday, March 13, 2015",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm located in Birmingham and would like to offer my professional sharpening service to you for a reasonable cost. Actually for no less than what Bass Pro Shops is going to charge you while they more than likely have a guy with no experience running your knife through an electric or pull-through sharpener removing unnecessary amounts of metal and drastically reducing the life span of your blade. I can provide you a better looking edge, sharper than you can imagine (hair whittling to be exact--I can provide pictures of some split hairs if you'd like), that is longer lasting while saving blade life and not affecting the steel's heat treat. I do not and will never use a grinder on your knives as I treat your knives as I do my own. I use a combination of diamonds and Japanese water stones to achieve my laser sharp edges. 

If you value your good knives and want to take care of them, don't give them to a guy with a belt sander at the gun show or local shop. I've seen too many $300+ knives ruined by people who use power equipment and don't know what they're doing. I'm an engineer in my day job so naturally I'm OCD about things...and knife edges are one of them, so perfection is what I strive for.

**Rates as of January 2015**
Rates have been simplified to make it much easier on everyone and fairly reflect time and effort involved for each type knife as all are carefully hand sharpened to precise angles.

All folding knives and hunting or tactical fixed blades will be sharpened to a scalpel sharp, mirror polished 30,000 grit edge. (Can vary on case by case basis) 

All kitchen knives will be sharpened to a razor sharp 1,000 grit edge better suited for general food preparation. (I will do 30k grit by request only as some chefs prefer a finer edge) 

Single blade folding knives and fixed blades up to 5"" - $20
Single blade folding knives and fixed blades over 5"" - $30

Kitchen knives - $2 per inch 
(30k edge for chef's knives by request only - $4 per inch)

Blade shapes such as tanto or double bevel - $10 adder

Items I do not sharpen include hair shears, chisels, and woodworking tools. I will sharpen regular scissors, and I can sharpen serrated edges no problem.  

Rates can vary on a case by case basis if it's a knife that's just really odd or unusual or one that's really messed up.

If you're interested, or would like more details, feel free to contact me for email/cell info. On most days I'm in the downtown and Vestavia areas so we can make arrangements on the pickup and drop-offs of your knives. Don't settle with dull knives...a dull knife is an unsafe knife! 

All sharpenings are guaranteed to be the sharpest edge you've ever experienced or your money back.

Feel free to request videos of the level of sharpness I can achieve including whittling hairs and other sharpness tests. For many more pictures of my work, search for Professional Knife Sharpening on Birmingham Craigslist.
