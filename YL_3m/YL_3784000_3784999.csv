The grips included on the pistol are the black, VZ Operator II G10 grips. The G10s have an aggressive golfball pattern and also have an added thumb recess for the magazine release.
The VZ Grip .45ACP includes a two-dot adjustable rear LPA sight and tru-glo high visibility front sights. The pistol has an unloaded weight of 2.82 pounds and loaded weight of 3.25 pounds.

As far as all the guns they've made one would consider this the Mark I. Back then they weren't called that. Just Ruger 22 pistol. Made in 1975. This is the very first version that lacks the bolt release and any erroneous ugly markings. The guy who traded it to me said the former owner tried to rattle can paint it back to black and it turned out bad. So he removed that and it looks like patinaed raw metal. No rust at all. Just what's left of the original finish that he probably steel wooled off. This is why it looks how it does. Mechanically it's perfect and the bore looks like it was not shot too much at all. Still extremely accurate. Includes one chrome base plated mag and one aftermarket Alpine mag that purposely has a nub to grip a little better at the base plate. Does not have the original box, but does have a green plastic case. $200 cash firm. No trades on this one. Thanks for looking.  Sorry for the crappy pictures.

Extended firing pin. Reduced power firing pin block lifter spring, CGW lifter, reduced power mainspring, reduced power firing pin spring, short reset disconnector, CGW thin aluminum grips, CZ Custom comp rear sight (ramped, non painted plain black), CZ comp hammer, CZ Custom front fiber optic sight. 

This pistol was bought 1.5 months ago. All CGW parts were installed and function tested with 150 rnds of Federal 124gr ball. Functioned flawlessly. All original parts will be included. Original case, paperwork, and a genuine CZ belt/paddle holster is included(simple retention holster). Pistol is in fantastic shape. Even racking the slide, you can tell the pistol hasn't seen many rounds and isn't even broken in. 2-18rnd mags included. Pistol brush etc. 

Similarly upgraded CZ pistols such as the SDP's/Target lines go for well over $1400-1800. If you've ever shot a CZ, you know their triggers could be improved.  This pistol has a fantastic trigger and is by far the most accurate pistol I own. 
DA/SA pull weights have not been measured as I don't have a gauge. CGW's site says DA drops from 17lbs to 9. It feels like 6-7lb to me. CGW parts didn't adjust SA pull weight but the shortened reach and over/pre travel stops in combination with the race hammer makes for a fantastic SA. 
Recent personal issues have come up and this has got to go. As you can see this pistol is in new shape. Not interested in any trades at the moment. Cash and preferred FTF but will ship where possible. Must be 21, bring your drivers license and fill out a bill of sale. Meet in SE PDX off 82nd. 

First person to meet the above requirements and hand me $900 gets a deal.  I initially agreed to send this pistol out but will no longer do so considering the amount of local interest. All work was done by myself. This ain't the first time I've installed complete trigger parts kits on CZ's.  A SP-01, Tactical, PCR and a P-01. I have full cofidence that this pistol will serve you well. But this is still considered a used pistol and is sold as-is. You are welcome to test fire the weapon at Johnson Creek Gun Club if you bring your own 9mm FACTORY (no reloads or remans)ammo.  I only ask there be no tire kickers.  If you have $900 in hand, let me know and lets make this happen."

BORE IS NICE . GREAT OVERALL CONDITION . PLEASE SEE LISTED DETAILS. The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing full power loads. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.The USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

The gun has had under 200 rounds through it and is in pristine condition.  I did swap out the return spring for an 8lb return spring, replacing the stock 10lb spring.  I can change that back if you want.  Otherwise it will be include in the sell.  Also i did try to swap out the main spring for a 13lb wolf spring but I was having some reliability issues, so I switched it back to stock.  The gun shoots 100% now.  I can include the 13lb, 14lb and 15lb wolff spring if you want to try your luck.

Included with this gun would be:

Ruger stock case
Ruger trigger lock/keys
Original Manual and Shell casings
and of course the Sp101 22lr
(stock 10lb return spring)
(13lb, 14lb, and 15lb wolff main spring)

I live in Lakewood, CA.  So we can do the trade at an FFL around here, or we can do the trade at Turner's Fountain Valley.

Currently turners has this gun at 599.98 on sale (http://www.turners.com/ruger/ruger-sp101-stainless-22lr-4-barrel-15900), so thats 653.98 including tax. I think $500 is a fair price for a barely used gun.

A little history of this gun
Following World War II, the Browning Hi-Power became the leading military pistol in France, England and thoughout Western Europe and was copied behind the Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe. 
FEG of Hungary, the Hungarian national military arms manufacturer, copied the Browning Hi-Power 9mm design during the Cold War and supplied the Hungarian army with small arms. FEG also improved the BHP 9mm design by replacing the Browning Single-Action trigger (with its awful heavy pull) with a Double-Action/Single-Action trigger design copied from Smith & Wesson. 
KBI Inc. of Harrisburg, Pa., imported FEG Browning Hi-Power pistols into the U.S. starting in the 1980s, first the 9mm and later the FEG .45 ACP. The FEG .45 ACP GKK-45 has a DA/SA trigger and is a slightly larger version of the classic Browning Hi-Power in 9mm, scaled up for .45 ACP.
KBI Inc. is owner of Charles Daly and though it is no longer importing FEG pistols from Hungary, the company still provides parts and service for all FEG pistols KBI previously imported.

It has been a great duck gun and I have also shot a lot of skeet with it. Would also be a great goose gun or a starter 3 gun shotgun. The gun does have some scratching down the barrel (as any gun that has spent some time in the blind has) but it is in really good shape and shoots like a dream. (I uploaded pics of the scratches on the barrel) I am the 2nd owner of this gun, I bought it from a close friend who took very good care of it. (The only reason I am selling it is I received a Benelli Super Vinci as a gift and can't justify having 2 almost identical shotguns...at least not to my wife!)

In addition you will get a new Carlson's short, medium and long range choke set, a turkey choke and a new TruGlo bead.

Questions I get asked most often: 

Can you kill a deer with it. If you are at point blank range, and shoot it in the eye, probably not. 

What is the bolt speed? Between 150 and 175 feet per second. 

How far is it accurate? Ive had people tell me up to 50 feet for small critters. 

Do you offer a warranty? No. There are a variety of factors that affect longevity including how you string it, and whether or not you pust the cocking handle all the way forward every time. 

What is the body made out of? Metal. Not cheap fiberglass like many and will last longer. The pieces that hold the cocking handle on are metal, as is the body, and they will withstand you forgetting to push the lever all the way forward more than the plastic body. 

Where can I get replacement strings - I carry them, usually. 

Where can I get extra bolts? I carry the metal ones, most of the time. 

Is this safe for kids - Yes. Under adult supervision. 

Can I drink and use this - Most great fails all start with a beer and ""Y'all watch this.""

Does it come with a target? Yes there is one printed on the back of the box. Email me if you want a pic. 

How can you not lose the bolts? I use a large box with the target on the front. This way the bolts mostly end up in the box. 

Are they accurate? Yes. We steal boxes from IT all the time and shoot them in a storage closet. at 20 feet, once you adjust them, you can be in the center big circle generally. 

Are there instructions? Yes and dont be a dumbass and not follow them


Tips and tricks 
Wax the track for the bolt. Any candle way will do, it will make the bolt go faster and the string will last longer. 
Use rubber cement to attach the plastic pieces that go on the prow (Bow) That will stop some of the vibration and they wil last longer. 
Push the cocking lever forward every time, it will last longer. 
Use only under adult supervision.

OK. So what's an antique?

Quote:   (...) a firearm or replica of a firearm not designed or redesigned for using rim fire or conventional center fire ignition with fixed ammunition and manufactured in or before 1898, including any matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system AND ALSO any firearm using fixed ammunition manufactured in or before 1898, for which ammunition is no longer manufactured in the United States and is not readily available in the ordinary channels of commercial trade.

A little history of this gun
Following World War II, the Browning Hi-Power became the leading military pistol in France, England and though out Western Europe and was copied behind the Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe. 
FEG of Hungary, the Hungarian national military arms manufacturer, copied the Browning Hi-Power 9mm design during the Cold War and supplied the Hungarian army with small arms. FEG also improved the BHP 9mm design by replacing the Browning Single-Action trigger (with its awful heavy pull) with a Double-Action/Single-Action trigger design copied from Smith & Wesson. 
KBI Inc. of Harrisburg, Pa., imported FEG Browning Hi-Power pistols into the U.S. starting in the 1980s, first the 9mm and later the FEG .45 ACP. The FEG .45 ACP GKK-45 has a DA/SA trigger and is a slightly larger version of the classic Browning Hi-Power in 9mm, scaled up for .45 ACP.
KBI Inc. is owner of Charles Daly and though it is no longer importing FEG pistols from Hungary, the company still provides parts and service for all FEG pistols KBI previously imported."

From Wikipedia:
Wingo was an experimental indoor shooting sport invented by Winchester in the early 1970s. The only Wingo facility built was in San Diego, California.
The equipment consisted of a bank of machines that created four-inch diameter hollow spheres of ice. The player had a custom-made .20 calibre shotgun that was about the same size and weight as a .22 calibre rifle. The choice of calibre was to prevent players from bringing their own .22 calibre shells from outside. The gun was tethered to the shooting bench to prevent it from being pointed toward spectators and to facilitate the wiring for the internal microphone that detected when the gun was fired. Only about 20 of these guns were made and they are now very rare collector's items.
In the game, four-inch diameter hollow spheres of ice were fired toward the shooter from one of five ports from a distance of 75 feet. When the player fired the gun a number from 1 to 10 was presented by the scoring machine. The number depended on how quickly the player fired, higher numbers for quicker reactions. If the player hit the sphere he/she scored the number presented by the scoring machine.
Winchester conducted the trial in San Diego, rather than a midwest city where shooting sports were more popular, because they wanted to see if it would catch on in a city where there was an abundance of pastimes. The sport was not financially successful and the Wingo facility was closed in less than a year. The facility is now a branch of the San Diego Superior Court.

There is also a factory letter from Winchester authenticating this rifle.

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer.

The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9""; twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullets.

848,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3784848,For Sale/Trade:  SIG 556 Patrol SWAT with STS-081 Red dot & Swiss Handguards,"(Downtown, but I'll travel to meet in WY), Cheyenne, Wyoming","$ 1,250","Listed On: Saturday, December 6, 2014",Rifles,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Specs are available on Google for the technical folks... But let me say this. This is not your granpappy's 5.56! SIG took everything good about AK and AR combined together in a Swiss-accurate package with every single part being of premium materials and craftsmanship. Shoots WAY sub-MOA out of the box. It is not... at all.. comparable to an AR, besides caliber and magazine. It would be like trying to compare a 1999 Dodge Intrepid with a Ferrari Formula 1 car... yeah they both run on gas and have rubber tires... but that's about it.

Guys and gals: please, please ask me for photos of anything or any details you'd like to know prior to coming to see it. I want you to be a million percent happy with this. I'm so confident that you'll love it, go shoot it and if you're not sold, I'll buy it back on the spot. NOBODY ELSE SAYS THAT ABOUT A BATTLE RIFLE.

I'm available almost 24-7, so text me at 4O99398903 or email me through here! Hey, since it is the holidays, I'll consider trades and maybe a layaway. Let me know what you have.

Bought and maintained by a professional. It has ONE training/demo session of firing on it... 180 rds (just 6 mags), then my agency bought a boat-load of them and we were issued the select-fire and suppressed NFA variant, so this has been locked in the safe, fairly unused, besides showing it off to an unfriendly airport customer who thought you can drive a car on the runway... But hey, that's Wyoming, right?

History: (I first saw the 556 at a trade show and advocated my unit to use these) Purchased in 2013 from SIG to show my unit the capabilities of the SIG556, how fast it can be converted from carry-on baggage to operational platform and then changed from carbine to long-range DMR with scope. After that class/demo, it sat in a patrol aircraft (unfired) for a month, then I put it in the safe when our commercial order came in, now it is listed here.

-IMPORTANT: The trigger is tuned low, light and medium-length, so you can take up the first stage with nice even finger pressure and as you commit to the shot, only a further light pressure on the second stage will accurately send your shot. It's got to be about 2.5 to 3 lbs. (I don't have a gauge, but that's probably close) The second stage goes like glass: like a well tuned bolt action rifle. Out of the box, the trigger is more like a M9 pistol - Long and mysterious. Not any more.
-The desert wrap is NOT tape or sticky. It is cloth. If you don't like it, 10 seconds and gone.
-I'll throw in YOUR CHOICE of 2 Milspec, MagPul Pmag or SIG (linkable) 30-rd mags with fresh springs, caps and followers.
-I'll include a cool MagPul rounded trigger guard that I never installed.
-Swiss style handguards were installed because - let's face it - quad rails suck and chop your hands and gloves up, snagging all your gear and bags. Swiss handguards are the #1 requested mod for this weapon. ***The more ya know, right?!***
-The top swiss handguard was hastily Dremeled down (did not cut the metal heat shield) to accommodate that 56mm scope at the last second before the Unit Demo. It's invisible and under the desert wrap anyway.
-I will buy that $85.00 brand new swiss handguard if that dremel spot bothers you. It takes a while to come in, so it won't be available right away at time of sale, probably a few days later. Not a big deal! :)
-The white line on the safety lever was just for a range event yesterday and I've removed it. (I didn't shoot this rifle, but it was on the range with me, so I needed the marker for the range safety inspectors to see it at distance.)
-SIG-STS red dot is included, 56mm scope with rings are not, sorry.
-Blue OEM SIG case included ($149.00 value, yep, you can drop it on eBay for that much!)
-Papers, SIG decal & such included in the bluebox
-This model has the swiss/Glock round bayonet lug
-This model has a fixed front sight, flip-up backup iron sight and the red dot.
-Iron Zeroed at 300 (true BZO, not 33yd paper indoor target) with 75gr TAP/FPD
-Dot Zeroed for 1.25"" high at 50 yds
-Extra CR2032 battery is stored in the handgrip for the red dot.
-This model has the real nice 1:7 twist barrel so you can shoot 55gr spam ammo or 100grain subsonics without tumbling or other accuracy problems that 1:9 (stock AR style barrels) are well known for.
-From field experience, you should use 75, 77 or 64 grain projectiles for maximum punch and accuracy if you are in a Zombie Removal Service situation. If you're just cleaning up prairie dogs from 1/4 mile away, 55grain ammo is OK to 650yds on a ""man size"" target. 55gr is so fast, it will vaporize Prairie dogs at short ranges, but not injure your average zombie size customer... use 55gr with due respect and careful shot placement. 
-Personally, We use Hornady TAP FPD, which is a round that is VERY easy to duplicate via reloading press: Lake City brass, Hornady .224 OTM HP projectile over a match primer and Varget powder.

BRASS TACKS GENTS: This is like the Rolex of battle rifles, and I'd bet my life on this thing. That's something I can't say about the M4A3 I was issued in Iraq and Durka-Durka-stan, or even the SCAR!

Guys, it's the holidays and EVERYONE deserves a Rolex once in their life... Why not make that Rolex your next battle rifle? Unlike an AR platform, the SIG 556 WILL complete the 2500 round torture test without carbon fouling failure. At about 2300 rounds, the gas selector will need to be switched to position 2, but that's it. I've personally seen the test, the SIG instructor was ""chump confident"" and almost mathematically, his numbers were always right on. to be honest, I wanted him to be wrong just because he was such a snob, but nope, it was smoking, sometimes even glowing and still running like a dang clock. THIS RIFLE WAS NOT TORTURED IN ANY WAY. it only has 180 rounds through it. (The class used factory owned rifles for testing)


I'm not a dealer, this is a private sale, so of course, Wyoming FTF rules apply (be a WY resident, not a chump... etc.)"

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length M4 cool tunnel handguards, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9""; twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullets.

From SIG's website:

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips."
