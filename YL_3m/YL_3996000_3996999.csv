ONLY ISSUES: after polishing the slide, and carrying for a few days i noticed a pin sized spot of rust. at first i thought it was a spec of dirt. upon seeing this, i removed the rust spot and painted the left side of the slide with primer, as to prevent further rust. ive carried it like this for about 2 months and have had no issues. but for it to look ""perfect"" the slide would need to be refinished. the average cost seems to be about 100$ from my research. the gun retails around 500-600 depending where you buy, and the laser is about 250-300 depending where you buy. i dont really want to sell it, id rather trade. my first choice would be a glock 42, followed by a glock 19 or glock 26. those are the only guns im interested in. thanks for looking, and any questions feel free to contact me. my number is REDACTED my name is will. kept my florida number, but im local in durham."

Bought this for Boomershoot a few years back, and honestly haven't shot it since. The 6x20 is great for spotting your shots in the target, and the glass is sharp and holds a zero perfectly. Poppping 10"" targets at 630 yards was fun and this rifle was more than capable of sub MOA groups.

May be able to throw in some professionally reloaded 308 with once fired brass from this rifle if you're interested.

445,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3996445,For Sale:  $25 muzzle crowning,"Hampton Roads, VA Beach, Hampton Roads, Virginia",$ 25,"Listed On: Monday, June 22, 2015",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am offering a $25 re-crowning service for any 22 caliber or 30 caliber firearm (May not work for some 22lr pistols). Crown is an 11 degree target crown and I can also polish the finished crown for free for added protection from moisture and carbon (optional)

Why Re-crown?
The crown is the absolute last thing the bullet touches when leaving the rifle, and it directs the gas as it leaves.  Any imperfection on a barrel crown causes the gasses exiting behind the bullet to push the bullet in a non-straight line, causing tumbling, POI shift, and reduced accuracy.  Re-crowning creates a uniform and smooth surface.  As the bullet leaves the barrel, the gasses exit around the bullet evenly causing minimal impact to the bullet's travel, which causes an increase in precision (small groups) and accuracy (hitting your target).   

Ideal applications:
Military surplus firearms (Mosin Nagant, Mauser, SKS, M1 Garand, AK, M98, etc)
Mass-production firearms (AR15, AR10, AK, etc)
Varmint and hunting rifles
Competition rifles
Target model pistols
Anyone who wants to increase precision
Any firearm with old/worn/damaged muzzle or crown

Doesn't the pilot damage the inside of the barrel?
No, the tool I use has an aluminum pilot that does not move inside the barrel during the process, eliminating any possible damage to the barrel.  Aluminum is too soft to damage the barrel.

Are you an FFL?
No, so you will have to be present when I perform the work which takes LESS THAN 10 MINUTES per barrel.  

Warranty:   
I will stand behind my work 100%.  If I botch your barrel in any way, I will pay for either a replacement barrel or another crowning job at the location of your choosing (in Hampton Roads). 

Payment:
PayPal or cash only.  For PayPal, send payment to REDACTED.  Please call first to schedule date/time.  

Contact info: 
Send an email to REDACTED (yes I am in the USMC) with the gun make, model, and caliber (and qty if applicable).  

About Me:
I am a skilled and technical person who has been building guns and reloading ammunition for over 6 years.  I hold myself to a very high standard and consider my work to reflect that.  I also understand the importance of customer satisfaction. 

Below is a picture of a good crown and a bad crown. Note the pattern showing even gas dispersion around the bullet as it exists the barrel.  That indicates a very good crown.  Even the smallest ding in the crown can significantly reduce accuracy and precision (circled in red).

Note:  I will also cut a barrel to a shorter length for an additional $15.  I cannot guarantee a perfect 90 degree angle because I do not have a lathe.  I will not create an NFA weapon (16"" minimum barrel length for rifles)."

We don't care if you accidentally dry fired the weapon. If you pulled that trigger just once ITS USED.
stop trying to sell guns literally for the price you bought it for.
like I just seen a shotgun, they want 600 for it.

Wow buddy your saving me a dollar by selling here.
basically if it's not wrapped in plastic and doesn't have shipping oil on it Mark it down at least 50 bucks.
There's no reason I should come on here and see the same damn guns a month later because people would rather buy a new one at the freaking same price."

It is the shortest rimfire silencer on the market, has the quietest 10-round average of any silencer in its class, and can go 2,000 rounds between cleanings. Patented Multi-Part Containment (MPC™) technology facilitates ease of disassembly and reassembly – an essential function of .22LR suppressors. The internal MPC™ construction uses two half tubes that pull away from a monolithic core, which ensures that the Sparrow 22 will remain easy to clean after extended periods of use with notoriously dirty rimfire ammunition. The Sparrow 22 is compatible with multiple calibers up to 5.7mm and is rated for full auto fire.

USAK47 Machined Buffer Tube Adapter, attached to the Phase 5 Pistol Buffer Tube

I am selling all parts together. This assembly is range tested on my own M92 - the pull is very short and gives the M92 the feel of a sub mg. 
The buffer tube is VERY tight in the arm brace, so no slipping or rotating from normal use. 
The buffer tube adapter mounts underneath the pistol grip with the same screw the grip uses to secure to the gun frame and is about as solid as a bolt on stock. 
The folding adapter has some wear on the point of contact that locks it when folded, so it won't lock completely when folded (Shown in picture) The side of the lock used to lock the adapter open is perfectly secure, so the lock works flawless to keep the adapter unfolded.  It isn't shown as connected, but can be mounted between the buffer tube adapter and the buffer tube.

644,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3996644,For Sale:  looking to see if anyone is interested in $25 muzzle crowning,"Hampton Roads, VA Beach, Hampton Roads, Virginia",$ 25,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 4, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am about to purchase a high quality barrel reamer from Manson Reaming that can do 11 degree target crowns for any 22 caliber or 30 caliber guns (including 22lr, .223/5.56, .308/7.62, 30-06, and many more).  I can also include popular pistol calibers such as 9mm, 40 caliber, and 45 caliber, but the benefits are much higher on rifles.  I want to know if anyone is interested in this service for $25 (or less).  Many professionals will charge more than 3 times this much and they have inferior or dull cutters which can do more damage than good.  

Why Re-crown?
The crown is the absolute last thing the bullet touches when leaving the rifle, and it directs the gas as it leaves.  Any imperfection on a barrel crown causes the gasses exiting behind the bullet to push the bullet in a non-straight line, causing tumbling, POI shift, and reduced accuracy.  Re-crowning creates a uniform and smooth surface.  As the bullet leaves the barrel, the gasses exit around the bullet evenly causing minimal impact to the bullet's travel, which causes an increase in precision (small groups) and accuracy (hitting your target).  Polishing the final crown surface is optional (and free).  

Ideal applications:
Military surplus firearms (think Mosin Nagant)
Any mass-production firearm
Suppressor use (assuming your threading is concentric to the bore) 
Anyone who wants to increase precision and accuracy

Doesn't the pilot damage the inside of the barrel?
No, the tool I am buying has a pilot that does not move inside the barrel during the process, eliminating any possible damage to the barrel.  

Are you an FFL?
No, so you will have to be present when I perform the work which takes LESS THAN 10 MINUTES per barrel.  

Cost: 
Depends on demand.  More barrels = lower price.  
10 barrels @ $25 ea
15 barrels @ $20 ea
20 barrels @ $15 ea
25+ barrels @ $10 ea

Warranty:   
I will stand behind my work 100%.  If I botch your barrel in any way, I will pay for either a replacement barrel or another crowning job at the location of your choosing (in Hampton Roads). 

Payment:
paypal or cash only.  For paypal, contact me first to see how much (based on the number of requests)

I hold myself to a very high standard and consider my work to reflect that.  I also understand the importance of customer satisfaction. 

Below is a picture of a good crown and a bad crown. Note the pattern showing even gas dispersion around the bullet as it exists the barrel.  That indicates a very good crown.  Even the smallest ding in the crown can reduce accuracy and precision (circled in red)"

Somebody has a problem with my listing. I'm not trying to rob anybody, do your own research please. The MSRP on this rifle is $899, online retail is between $650 and $850 depending where you look. Slickguns had a deal for that rifle last year at $359 but it's no longer valid. I try to be as fair and honest as I can in my dealings, I've done my research on a fair price. $600 is less than I have in the rifle.

1st is 21 full boxes of same date code and 3 partial boxes. This is Silver Bear and is just about as good as you can buy for the Mosin Nagant. Being the same date code these should all shoot similar. 1 box is a different date code so it may shoot a bit different. So over 420 bullets. 

2nd lot is 2 full boxes and 1 partial box so around 50 bullets of Brown Bear. This is good average ammo for your Mosin Nagant. 

Will sell it all for $140 which is $6 per box and I want to sell it all at 1 time but considering people are always buying the spam can for just a few $$ less this is a great buy and it wont rust your rifle. 

Please don't ask to go lower on price. This price is good enough already. If you want to spend less try to find it. It will be very hard for this type of ammo."

Purchase can be either face to face (Of course requiring proof of Texas residence) or through a FFL transfrer, buyer will pay for shipping.

I am selling an Enfield NO4 MKI chambered for 303 British. 85% bluing, sharp bore and with excellent accuracy. I was able to score 30 shots on paper at 300 yards open sights.

150 rounds of Prvi Partizan FMJ were fired, so I will  include the casings will be included; they are non-corrosive and re-loadable along with 5 stripper clips. Included is also the long screw driver used to disassemble the buttstock from the rifle.

A lil' about the rifle:

The rifle was build in 1943 and refinished in 1946. The odd thing about this rifle is that it comes with the Jungle adjustable flip sights (Adjustable to of 800 meters), both the peep sight and the front blade sight were painted
white by its serviceman for easier target acquisition, the leather sling that comes with the rifle displays the message ""Mah Hell"" scratched onto it.

The wood is in excellent shape, with a dry part between the trigger guard and the buttstock, other than that it is in excellent condition. I bought a grooved handguard with the original included as well.

It has some interesting markings and I am willing to take some pics from them per request.
