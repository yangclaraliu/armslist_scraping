New user-inspired enhancements found on the HK45 and HK45 Compact are also found on recent Heckler & Koch semi-automatic pistols, including the P2000, P2000SK (Subcompact), and P30. 

The HK45 and HK45 Compact were also developed as possible candidates for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9mm M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected. 

Key features and system characteristics:

• Integral MIL STD 1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories 

• Ergonomic (HK45 full-size) and slim-line (HK45 Compact) grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference

• HK45/HK45C grip-to-slide angle matches Model 1911’s profile

• 8/10 Round Magazines 

• Ambidextrous controls with dual slide releases and enlarged magazine release

• Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system

• O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup

• Polygonal rifling for longer barrel life and better accuracy 

• Improved ergonomic control levers (safety and/or decocking)

• Low profile drift adjustable 3-dot sights

• Contoured and radiused slide with forward slide (grasping) grooves and anti-glare longitudinal ribs

Manufactured in 2013 (BD).  Firearm is in very good condition and well maintained.  Comes with everything from factory:  rounds fired at factory, both grip backstraps, security key, manual, HK factory case and 2 8-round magazines.  I also am including 2 additional 8 round mags for a total of 4 magazines."

Notes:
- Feed ramp has been widened and polished by a professional gunsmith. This is a standard recommendation for 5.56 Arsenal AKs to ensure high reliability
- Lower handguard has an EXTREMELY small flake (look at bottom right of second photo--tried best to capture it). Isn't noticeable in normal light, shouldn't be an issue. Hand guards fit very tight."

Combining the technology of Beretta’s best sporting shotguns with the requirements of the most demanding tactical shooters, it cycles faster than the competition, handles like a dream and has oversized controls for super-easy operation. It is available in two barrel lengths (21” and 24”) and its receiver is drilled and tapped for rail mounts, so that it can be equipped with optics or tactical aiming devices without any gunsmithing. And thanks to its Optimabore HP interchangeable choke system, it can also be adapted for other uses and will always perform like a Beretta. Lightning-Fast Shooting, Easy Operation The 1301 Comp features Beretta’s proprietary Blink gas-operating system, which enables it to shoot 4 shots in less than 1 second--that is, 36% faster than any other brand. But even with this tremendous advantage, Beretta’s engineers did not stop there. The controls are supersized so that the 1301 can be operated quickly and easily when seconds count: the cocking handle, bolt-release lever as well as the loading and ejection ports are oversized for simple and intuitive use under the heat of competition. Ultra-Durable Steelium BarrelSteelium-Barrel The barrel of the 1301 Comp is made of Steelium, Beretta’s own steel blend designed to give premium performance even after tens of thousands of rounds. It features a stepped, wide sporting rib that minimizes mirage, and it has both a mid-bead and front fiberoptic sight for instinctive pointing under most lighting conditions. And thanks to the Optimabore HP choke system, the 1301 offers unmatched ballistic performance, with constant patterns regardless of load used. Best-in-Class Tactical Stock Having worked with military and police forces all around the world, Beretta offers you decades of experience building firearms that meet the strictest demands of professional shooters. The 1301 embodies this experience, with its short stock with aggressive non-slip checkering for positive handling under the stress of competition. Also, the length of pull is user-adjustable so that this shotgun will give you the best fit and the most natural pointing regardless of your shooting style, thickness of clothing or body size."

The 1301 is Beretta's new gas operated semi-automatic shotgun designed for law-enforcement and home-defense. Engineered to be ultra-reliable and easy to use, it has all the features that a modern tactical shotgun should offer—and more. And thanks to its compact size (barrel length: 18.5”), it is ideal for negotiating tight spaces as well as for being safely stored away when not needed.


Easy Operation, Plenty of Features

Right out of the box, the 1301 Tactical features an oversized charging handle, large textured bolt release and an oversized reversible safety button. This makes it easy to use under most weather or lighting conditions—your hands will always be able to positively and safely grip it and operate the controls. Also, the aggressive checkering on the fore-end and stock makes it easy to gain a secure grip even while wearing gloves. As far as sighting, the 1301 Tactical features a robust, protected ghost-ring system with an interchangeable front sight, giving the user the opportunity to adapt it to its intended use, whatever the conditions.


Easy Customization to Most Shooters’ NeedsEasy-Operation

Although perfect out of the box, this tactical shotgun is easily adaptable to most users’ needs, body type and shooting posture. The stock is adjustable for length of pull with provided spacers, so that you can ensure it will always come up naturally to your shoulder and point easily to where you are looking. Drop and cast are adjustable as well. And for extra flexibility in customization and accessorization, the receiver offers a MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail, making it a snap to add tactical accessories without any gunsmithing or modification to the shotgun


Super-Fast Shooting

The integrated BLINK gas operating system, featuring a cross tube gas piston, allows the 1301 Tactical to cycle 36% faster than any other shotgun on the market. This also makes it ideal for three-gun tactical competitions: when shooting the 1301 Tactical, you will simply and objectively have an edge over your competitors. And regardless of the use, with a 1301 Tactical you will always know that you have the best of Beretta to rely upon—with its unmatched 500 years of experience, passion and know-how."

Some pitting to receiver but bore is fantastic. This is a working, shooting original Colt..........No navel scene on the cylinder but they didn't always come with one. Overall condition is quite good. At one point a factory shoulder stock was used on this pistol, you can see the impressions on the brass back strap. Looks as though nipples have been replaced and Im sure a new internal parts kit, it just functions to well. The guns straw/brown coloration  is balanced and even, making the gun enjoyable to carry and shoot. Some pitting to receiver making serial #'s tuff to read, but the order of the #'s you can read seem to match. Price is firm and fair. THIS IS NOT A REPRODUCTION COLT."

I took this in on a recent trade deal. I'm not an avid Smith & Wesson collector but
I could not pass this one up. 5-Screw model, ""Coke bottle"" grips, red ramp, 6 1/2""
barrel and a fit and finish that must be experienced.

This is an ""S"" serial number Smith (S 157XXX) from the mid-1950's.

Early Smith .44 Mags like this with far more visible wear (and less finish) start
out around $2500 on places like Guns International and GunBroker, so be fair
with your offers. 

Two further photos available.

Will follow all Illinois laws and waiting period. Must have valid Illinois
firearm owner's card.

If you want a rifle that'll run AR-15 mags, is lighter and handier than most AR-15s (and certainly lighter than gas-piston AR-15s), and just as accurate, look no further. It's what happens when Korea says, ""Re don't rike your M16 Amelica, so re made something better!"". Enter the K2, or as Kimber imports it, the DR200. This one has a Sturmwerkz stock adapter/folding mechanism and relatively short (7"") ACE stock. I got it short because I'm usually wearing heavy clothing when I shoot. 

Round count: Just over 300 total rounds--we can call it 350 if you want. The previous owner fired a single magazine through it. 
The receiver says "".223"" but the barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO with a 1:12 twist (meaning stick to the 55gr bullets). I've shot .223 stuff through it and haven't noticed a difference in groups between the two standards. The rifle shoots straight at 200 yards, haven't tried anything further. It's actually wonderfully accurate and of all the rifles I've ever owned it was by far the easiest to zero. 

Rifle is in excellent condition. I can also offer the Magpul MOE collapsible stock and stock adapter that it came with. Both are set up for optimal cheek weld. Ask about magazines, scopes, etc! I have a Millet DMS-1 on a PEPR mount that's still zeroed to it if you're interested.

It has an 18” barrel and 3” chamber. As this is a home defense model, it has a longer mag tube which gives you a capacity of 6+1 rounds of 2 ¾” 20 gauge shells; 1 round less with 3” magnum shells. Gun is in very good condition; round count is around 100 as the original owner indicated about 50 shells through it. I've put in about 50 shells through it myself. As would be expected with an 870, it shoots and cycles very well. Also note, this is the full-size adult stock, not the youth stock. There is a little wear on the receiver finish where the forward grip rubs against the receiver due to the tight tolerances (as you can see in the photo), but it is purely cosmetic. The finish on the rest of the gun is in very good condition. 

It’s a nice shotgun I got for my wife, due to the lesser recoil of the 20 gauge, and the recoil was fine, but it was a bit heavy for her, so we’re sticking with a pistol and this needs to go since I've already got my 12 gauge.

I’m including some boxes of shells to get you started, including a box of buckshot you can use for home defense. These can be a bit harder to find in 20 gauge, so I don’t expect this will last long.

Includes:
•	Remington 870 Express 20 Gauge Home Defense
•	(1) Full box of 25 2 ¾”shells, #3 buckshot
•	(1) Partial box, 20 3” shells, #2 shot
•	(1) Partial box, ½ dozen 2 ¾” shells, #8 shot

Shadow Gray finish. Rubber grip. 24.3 oz weight. This model is no longer available, and according to my brother this 7 shot titanium is semi-rare. It was left to me by my dad for backcountry protection, but I've decided to sell it since I never carry it. It was a one-owner gun and was rarely used, as my dad owned it for protection and not recreational shooting.

It comes with holster and 2 speed-loaders in original box with ""Safety System"" key and papers.  if you pick up locally, a few rounds of ammo will also be included but it does not make sense to pay another $20 to ship a couple dozen bullets separately from the gun (as is the law). Local buyer preferred, but can do FFl to FFL at cost of buyer. Purchase price 12 years ago was $800, and that was when it was still available and titanium was much cheaper. I do not intend to sell at the price of the stainless version still in production."

The original H3 tritium night sights have been known to reliably stay lit for 10 years or longer (more than aftermarket pieces) & the single stack 9mm design represents the current blending of concealability and power. These are difficult to find in retail stores...

I made a new stock for it. Not the best stock, but it works just fine for a 22lr. This allows you to pack it in a smaller area and leave the scope on it all the time. Let's face it, the selling feature of the original stock is that it floats, but if your pack falls in the water and sinks, so does the gun. 

I'm asking $325 for it. The buyer pays the shipping and transfer fees, unless we do a trade.

U.S. Survival AR-7 Rifle
Don’t Leave Civilization Without One

Since 1959 the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on should they have to punch out over a remote area. Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.

When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

The receiver is also coated with Teflon™ for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in two finishes; Black and Mossy Oak Break-Up Camo Pattern.  All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.

Rarest of the rare colored frames, the URBAN GRAY polymer frame ONLY came in .40 compact and .45 full size -and only 500 of each. This one is unfired, NIB with 3 high capacity magazines. Ever seen one for sale before... let alone NIB?

The BONUS of buying the pair is they are ONLY 100 numbers apart! Their serial numbers are identical... except for the 3rd digit! Being the original owner since new -when I ordered the pair, due to the different production runs... this was the closest to being sequentially numbered -and in different colors- that they could provide.

Both pistols come complete in their original factory cases... with manuals, locks (cable & lock out key), testfired case and original warranty card.

The set also comes with 1 serpa paddle holster (BLACKHAWK! brand) and 1 dual magazine paddle holster (iTAC brand) that look like matching pieces.

**Private Sale** -I am not a dealer, but I will ship insured FFL to FFL at the buyer's expense... once the destination is known and the shipping fee is determined (to your FFL), then an invoice will be sent to the buyer.

I will accept USPS (Postal) money orders by mail and will contact the buyer with the details to complete the transaction.

The free-floating barrel is made of match-grade Cr-Mo steel, and manufactured by a precision cold-hammer forging process by Sako craftsmen. The action and the barrel surfaces are Manganese-phosphatized for lasting protection against the elements and wear. The barrel features protected muzzle threading, providing attachment for optional Sako muzzle brake or suppressor assembly.

The modern bolt has two front locking lugs and a spring-loaded reliable operation. The Teflon coating on the bolt ensures a non-reflecting surface and a smooth bolt throw. The 2-way safety behind the bolt handle locks both the bolt and the trigger. The trigger unit is adjustable with a hand-honed sear/trigger - without creep. A single set trigger is optional.

The Picatinny rail on top of the action takes any Weaver or U.S. Mil.Std 1913 compatible mounts. New phospatized Tikka Optilock bases and rings are recommended for maximum accuracy and ease of use.

The detachable straight-feeding single column magazine is silent, durable and non-rusting. The standard 5-round magazines are tailored to each caliber for ultimate reliability and performance.

The stock is made of fiberglass reinforced copolymer polypropylene and features an ambidextrous palm swell. The wide fore-end has a swivel stud to take a bipod. The three sides of the stock are fitted with inserts which allow the use of heavy duty hook-type sling swivels. The recoil pad is of black rubber and the length of pull may be adjusted with spacers. The cheek piece is adjustable at 5 mm intervals, up to 25 mm (1”).

Scope, scope mounts, bipod, muzzle brake and extra large bolt handles are optional, as well as are adjustable open sights and fore- and rear-stock fastened military type heavy duty sling studs for hook-type swivels.

These were standard issue to many police agencies around the country... including the North Carolina Highway Patrol. Made after the acquisition of Benelli by Beretta, this represents the best of two high-quality Italian companies! This semi-auto uses the ultra-fast Benelli inertia-feed recoil system that has made thier own tactical line of shotguns the ones to have by police and military alike. This would be the equivalent to the Benelli M1 tactical.

I have added a SpeedFeed pistol-grip stock to the shotgun, but the original stock is included in the deal. A 20"" chrome-lined barrel and chambered for 3"" shells... but 2 3/4"" shells can be used (just keep the forward chamber clean to go back to 3"") for a 6+1 capacity. Sling loops on the stock and the end of the magazine tube. Original box is a bit tattered & worn from storage over the last 18 years.

I will ship insured FFL to FFL at the buyer's expense... once the destination is known and the shipping fee is determined (to your FFL), then an invoice will be sent to the buyer.

I will accept USPS (Postal) money orders by mail and will contact the buyer with the details to complete the transaction.

As a precondition of purchase, Buyer agrees to release Seller from all liability, whether criminal or civil, arising from the purchase, ownership, possession, use or misuse of this item. Always wear eye and ear protection when shooting firearms. Treat every firearm as if it is loaded. Safety is no accident and is a responsibility of gun ownership.

Please know your local laws concerning ownership of this shotgun and buy appropriately. I will sell & ship to the lower 48 only (all except CA or NY).

This hammer-fired, breach loader has a model number (940A) not found in gun books and a hunting dog scene engraved on the right of the receiver. The shotgun is pre-1968 manufacture due to no external serial number present. There may be one on the receiver tang, under the stock -not sure. Break-open lever is on right side of receiver and the barrel is 28"" long, with a 2 3/4"" chamber.

Stevens Arms became a division of Savage Arms Corporation (Westfield, MA) around 1920... with the break-open lever on the side -versus the tang- of the receiver dates it probably from the 1940's-50's. While in functional condition, the nice, even patina would make it a cool fireplace mantle gun!

The shotgun also comes with 1 soft case (Allen brand).

I will ship insured FFL to FFL at the buyer's expense... once the destination is known and the shipping fee is determined (to your FFL), then an invoice will be sent to the buyer.

I will accept USPS (Postal) money orders by mail and will contact the buyer with the details to complete the transaction.

As a precondition of purchase, Buyer agrees to release Seller from all liability, whether criminal or civil, arising from the purchase, ownership, possession, use or misuse of this item. Always wear eye and ear protection when shooting firearms. Treat every firearm as if it is loaded. Safety is no accident and is a responsibility of gun ownership.

I have a brand new WASR 10, still has the factory cosmoline on it. I have a couple ARs and wanted to get into an AK platform because there was always something drawing me towards one, but I honestly cant get into it when I have shot AR15s for so long. I just want to continue training on an AR platform and concentrating on buying one caliber of ammo. 

This rifle is brand new, so the new owner will have to spend a little time cleaning off the factory cosmoline. It comes with the original box, AKM bayonet, manual, oil bottle, 1 Tapco poly mag, 1 steel mag, leather sling, and cleaning kit.

If you are an new to AKs and wanting to get into one, this is arguably the best rifle to start with, and they accept common aftermarket AK parts and has a chrome lined barrel. The muzzle brake is changeable on this rifle as well and accepts common AK left handed thread devices. It comes with the common slant brake."

HSGI Bungee straps can be adjusted when installed, and provide a single bungee pull tab release for 2 x M4 magazines or 1 x M14 or AK type magazine. 

The WASATCH plate carrier was designed specifically for 19th SFG, whose operators needed a modular system to wear over their issue Interceptor body armor. The WASATCH can be worn over overt or covert soft armor, or as a stand-alone plate system. The front and back carriers will hold any 10""x12"" flat or multi-curve plate on the market today. The rear carrier also has a separate internal compartment for additional storage or a hydration pouch, although for hydration we recommend considering an external hydration carrier, because an internal hydration pouch will fluctuate in size with use, and affect the fit of the waist belt

Magazine pockets that allow you to carry up to 12 USGI 30rd M16 magazines without adding a single external pouch (This feature alone makes the WASATCH one of the best deals on the market today!). These pockets are universal for other magazines (6 AK, 6 M14/FN, etc.), and since they are integral, you still maintain the ability to add more mission specific pouches.

The magazine pockets expose enough of the 30 rd magazines to be grasped quickly, and both front and rear magazine flaps are fully adjustable. The outer pockets can be used for a radio, handgun, smoke or flashbang grenade, etc.

The front plate-carrier bib offers further real-estate for mounting modular pouches to suit your needs. There are 4 side release buckles to offer you in-and-out access in a hurry

Key Features Include:
6 Full size internal loop lined pouches to carry up to 2 M4 mags per pouch with bungee retention
2 Smaller internal loop lined pouches in the outermost ""wings"" to fit either 1 mag or smaller items
Small mesh pockets on “wings”
Loop Velcro is sewn on the top front and rear of the carrier for attaching patches, ID's, and insignia.
Located on the front bib near the top is an admin panel for maps, paperwork, and other flat items.

It was never used in that fashion except about one or two range trips.  Maybe 50 rds through it.  Low round count.  I've since moved on to another option for home defense and in the process I converted this gun over to the 870 compact express with the intention of scoping it and using it as a lightweight slug gun - I now have a baby and no time for that. 

You will also get: 120 rds rio royal 9P 00 buck 2 3/4"", 70 rds 2 3/4"" 7 shot winchester, 10 rds #3 buck winchester, 10 rds rifled slugs Winchester, 20 rds Federal Premium #4 shot game loads 3"". Thats about 220 rounds.  

It is equipped with a 21"" vent rib barrel, hi-viz fiber optic sight and realtree hardwoods stocks - all courtesy of Remington Country online - genuine parts.  

Perfect youth/wife shotgun - adjustable LOP to let the gun grow with your kids.  

It is also Duracoated 870 flat black for added weather resistance since I did intend to hunt with it.  

The barrel has never been shot through, it is BRAND NEW with IC and MOD chokes/wrench included.  The bolt and action have been polished and this thing is Slick enough to fall open on it's own weight.  

OVERVIEW FROM REMINGTON:
Young shooters are more likely to become stewards of the shooting sports if they start with a gun that fits properly. Exactly why we crafted our standard, premium-grade stocks with a shorter length of pull, then fit them to some of our finest firearms. for 2009, all compact firearms are equipped with our new Adjustable Length of Pull System. So, fit can be customized to youngsters as they grow, and adults requiring a shorter length of pull can tailor compact firearms to their specific needs. Rifles feature 20"" barrels and youth shotguns have 21"" barrels (20"" for deer gun).

Our Model 870™ Express® Compact Synthetic rifle is everything you like about the traditional 12-gauge Model 870 Express, but in a synthetic-stock version that is virtually indestructible. Rain, sleet, snow—whatever Mother Nature throws at it doesn't matter. The butt stock and fore-end stay dimensionally stable, and won't swell or crack due to weather extremes. Stock and all metalwork have black matte non-glare finish. Comes with a 26-inch or 28-inch vent rib barrel and Modified Rem™ Choke.
