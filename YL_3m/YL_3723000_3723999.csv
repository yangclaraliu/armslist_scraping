The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

Model number 24401.

This shotgun has a 20"" smooth bore barrel with rifle sights (adjustable), fixed improved cylinder choke, with a 4+1 capacity.  It also is outfitted with a SpeedFeed standard length stock, and a side saddle shell carrier which holds an additional 6 shells.  

The Remington 870 Police model shotguns are in a completely different category than the standard 870 Express models.  Police models contain no metal injection molded parts, stronger springs, a much more durable and corrosion resistant Parkerized finish (as opposed to rust-prone matte finish on the express models), a metal trigger guard assembly (as opposed to plastic on the Express models), and many other upgrades that make this shotgun well suited for heavy use.  The magazine tube has no ""dimples"" that restrict adding a magazine extension (like the Express models do), so you can add any magazine extension you wish without having to modify the weapon. 

This particular shotgun was purchased new (by me), fired 10 shells to verify proper function, then properly cleaned, lubricated and stored.  It is in new condition, with no blemishes.

Description:
Up for sale is a Springfield XDS 3.3"" .45 ACP Bi-Tone. I clean it every other month whether I shoot it or not. It is my daily carry so I keep it in excellent condition. I have function tested it and it works flawlessly every single time with zero problems of any kind. I have run 161 trouble free rounds through it, and have documentation showing when it was shot and what was shot through it. 
Trigger is crisp and excellent and is what makes this gun so amazing to me. I have upgraded the standard sights with Trijicon HD Night Sights with the orange fluorescent front (orange is preferred over yellow by many). Additionally the orange part can be charged by light and will also glow bright orange in the dark. It is amazing and allows you to acquire targets very quickly and increases accuracy day or night. Glows very bright and I love them. 

They do not make HD sights for the XDS so I had them custom fitted specifically for this gun. There is a voluntary recall on the XDS because somebody with too much time on their hands figured a way to cause a possible unintended discharge of the firearm. The chance of this happening is pretty much impossible unless you purposefully rack the slide in a very unnatural and difficult position. I have read of many complaints of guns coming back from the factory with ruined and spongy triggers. (Thats why you see so many XDS's being listed on here emphasizing that its post recall as if thats a good thing). 

I chose not to send it in because its perfect and I dont want to ruin it. Plus I dont rack slides like a dainty little idiot. Im not in a rush to sell it and if I can find a way to keep it I will. Its CCW ready so you can start carrying it today if you wanted to. I will update with pictures as soon as I can. 

Additional Note (Short version): Act fast before I change my mind because I really love this gun. 

Additional Note (Long version): The only reason that I am putting this up for sale is because an opportunity presented itself where I am able to purchase something Ive been wanting for quite some time. Unfortunately I am not able to afford both guns at this time. Should I find a way to keep this setup I will revoke this offer immediately. So if you are truly interested jump on this great offer now.

This revolver has its original magna wood grips and its hammer has been shortened to speed drawing from concealment. Timing on the revolver is decent; there is a small amount of cylinder play. Finish is fairly good as well, there is minor holster and carry wear, but the bluing is all intact and no pitting is visible. There is a very small chip missing from the corner of one of the wood grip panels, which isn't visible in the pictures. The trigger is nice and crisp in single action, and smooth in double action. This revolver conceals very easily, both in the pocket or in a belt holster.

The Model 36 was the first J-frame produced by Smith and Wesson, introduced in 1950. This Smith doesn't have an internal lock, due to its age. Based on the serial number, I believe this revolver was made sometime in the 1980's.

This model is an ""SPS LT Tactical"", a rare variant which (by my best guess) is a distributor exclusive. It is fitted with a 20"" fluted barrel with a 1-in-10"" twist. The barrel is threaded at the end, for mounting a muzzle break, flash suppressor, or silencer. The rifle features a black synthetic Hogue Overmold (soft touch) stock, dual point pillar bedding, an all black oxide blasted finish, and an adjustable X-Mark Pro trigger. 

With this rifle, I am also including a high quality one-piece picatinny scope rail, a two-piece scope rail, and a set of 1-inch scope rings.

The rifle is VERY accurate with heavy .308 bullets (168 grain and up). Because of the short, fluted barrel it is also very light weight and ergonomic. It could make a good hunting rifle, for anything from short to long range. It has not been taken into the field, or used for anything more than paper-punching, and it is in like-new condition.

Henry H010 45-70 Steel Round Barrel Lever 45-70 Gov 18.43"" 4+1 Walnut Stk Blue
Virtually all rifle making companies of the late 19th century chambered
their single shots and lever actions for the .45-70. As those companies and
their rifles faded away, the .45-70's popularity did not. Factory .45-70
ammunition ranges from 405 grain lead bullet, low-velocity loads for deer
hunting and target shooting, to high-velocity 300 to 400 grain jacketed
bullet ones meant for large game. The Model H010 .45-70 can handle them
all. Its blued steel receiver is fitted with an 18.43"" round barrel
underneath and a tubular magazine of four-round capacity. Its pistol-grip
buttstock and steel-capped forend are crafted of beautiful American walnut
and cut with checkering to provide a sure grip. The buttstock wears a soft
rubber pad to help shooters handle .45-70 recoil from a 7.08 lb. rifle. The
model H010 is factory issued with XS Ghost Ring rear peep sight with blade
front. Because the receiver is drilled and tapped, scope mounting is an
easy option.

This rifle is in good condition and shoots well with approximately 300 rounds fired.  The rifle has been used in the field and does show a few marks from normal wear but nothing that affects performance.  The rifle has also been customized – see pictures - by modifying the forend with a Magpul Angled Forend Grip and the stock buttpad has been removed and lowered to accommodate a Recoil Pad

Features:
•	Smooth slide-action design allows for fast follow-up shots in demanding conditions
•	Action, slide release and safety based on the design of the Remington 870 pump shotgun
•	22"" barrel with iron sights and receiver drilled and tapped for scope mounts allow for multiple sighting options
Includes:
•	Approximately 240 rounds of assorted 308 Win/7.62 NATO ammunition
•	One 4-round magazine & two 10-round magazines as shown
•	Extended magazine release (original stock release included)
•	Customized Forend with Magpul Angled Forend Grip 
•	Monte Carlo stock
•	Buttstock cartridge holder/pad black endura
•	Recoil pad reduces felt recoil up to 70%
•	Trigger Lock (or cable lock if preferred)

Note: Scope & bi-pod NOT included

Rare here in the West while popular in the mid-West and East Coast, this rifle typically sells new for $600+:  See Link ▶

I have various Calibers and amounts of Bullets for sale, they're all Jacketed and look to come from the major manufacturers. Some are in boxes and other loose but are all a good consistent quality even though they may be manufactured a few years ago. If needed I can take some photos if you want them.

I will list them all by caliber and would prefer to sell each caliber as a consignment lot as it makes more sense for shipping/pricing for you. The prices do not include shipping but I will ship with USPS flat rate to make it as cheap as possible.

Quite honestly i believe this is an excellent deal, Iv'e searched for the retail pricing and slashed at least a 3rd off those prices.

Just wanted to add that due to the age of these bullets some have some dark spots, this is the reason for the cheap price....if this concerns you then I will be willing to take photos to show you, this is not all of them and the majority are in great condition. 

Will accept Paypal gift or USPS Money Order.

Never fired Arsenal (Saiga) SGL-31 AK-74 Izhmash Legion with folding stock, 15 new 30-round magazines plus 2,080 rounds of Russian ammo as a package.

A beautiful Saiga Russian AK-74 assembled by Arsenal, never fired, kept in it's case. This AK-74 is no longer imported due to the ban by the Obama administration. This SGL-31 is about as close as you can get to owning the current Russian AK-74 battle rifle.

It's rare to find one that has never been used or very slightly used and when you can the price for the SGL-31 alone that I've seen here is as high as $2,200.

The ammo is in a sealed crate holding two spam cans of 1,080 rounds each.. This ammo is for sale for $219 per spam can plus $20 shipping on the Arsenal web site.  The 14 30-round magazines (the 15th came with the rifle) cost cost $45 each so my new magazines are worth $630. 

I'm asking about $600 less than I have invested ... remember, I've never fired this 
AK, the magazines are all new unused, the ammo is sealed in a crate and there's an a strap I bought for the rifle.

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

Even if you don't ""need"" these parts for your rifle, they could also be used to easily make a very cheap home-made bumpfire stock that works just like the $350 Slidefire stock. Probably might even look better than that ugly over-priced thing too depending on how crafty you are. Fun cheap project for your AR15 but also for anything that has a buffer tube like a M&P 15-22, the tactical Ruger 10/22s, or probably even an AK that has a buffer tube adapter on it. Basically anything at all that takes an AR15 stock could be made even more fun with a nearly free bumpfire stock, just search ""bumpinator"" on youtube for directions on how to make your own with just an extra pistol grip and stock. If you already have the spare parts then you are all set. If you want to buy them I will take $20 cash for both pieces or might trade for other parts or something else cool or some ammo or whatever."

Car is a 289/3 on the tree with pull-out style overdrive. Was my daily driver until the rear main seal went out at 110,xxx miles (sat for 10 years or so before I got it) and toasted the motor, how bad I'm not sure, haven't started it since. Again, was my daily driver 3 months ago so just needs a small block dropped in, which for the right deal I do have a rebuilt '87 5.0 I could let go. Also has collector plate, and some older originals

Just before the rear main went, I did some work to the car-

New:

brake light pressure switch
battery cables
solenoid
starter
plugs/wires/cap/rotor
Pertronix electronic ignition
Pertronix Flamethrower coil

bigger 2bbl carb(still have stock carb)
electric fan
re-wired the engine harness( wasn't damaged, just crispy wires and I wanted fresh ones with the alternator swap, ran amazing afterward)

Put some nearly impossible to find original N.O.S. style Sears P-78R14 wide-style white walls on ( thin white walls are gone, as are the stripes on the hood and the red gas flap. painted those black so just red on the sides and rims)

Body is super super solid for a western Wa car, one quarter size rust spot by the gas pedal is all I've found, pass side has a couple dings

Interior isn't bad, but isn't perfect and needs some work
pristine red dash, all door panels are there, drivers one needs work
back driverside door doesn't currently open 

one small crack in lower windshield( does not affect driving at all) the rest is perfect 


All in all I love this car but I've moved back to Eastern WA and need to let it go, so if seriously interested I will make a trip over. I have a clean title in hand (somewhere, lost it during move but I guarantee that it's clean)

I have recently acquired a Series 80 Colt MK IV GCNM that I am making my project gun.  One of the mods I want is to have it converted to a Series 70 by removing all the extra lawyer components and installing the required spacer.  There is a video on YouTube of a guy doing it, and although I have found some great DIY assistance there, this guy just goes too fast and uses words like ""gizmo"" and ""thingamajig"" instead of the proper terminology.  

Can anyone recommend a reputable gunsmith that does this commonly, one you KNOW has done it, and will do it right without charging me an arm and a leg--and will also install the correct spacer to keep the wobble out?  Preferably one that would allow me to watch.

I have already begun the restoration phase by removing the idiot scratch (as well as other dings and nicks.)  I eventually want to make this one of my carry guns and just do not like the trigger pull and extra slop of the unnecessary parts.  

Thanks from a crusty old retired Navy Chief."

Here is a Bow review from Compound Bow Choice that can be found on the web:
Editors' review
At only 3.9 lbs and measuring 36 inches from axle to axle, the PSE Bow Madness XL is a very good bow that can be used for both hunting and 3-D shooting. This rig is one of the three bows from the Bow Madness series introduced by PSE Archery and Drury Outdoors in 2009. In terms of specs this is the longest and fastest bow from the series. 

Grip
Many shooters say the new PSE ""Biomechanically Ergonomic Slim Throat"" (B.E.S.T) grip is thin and comfortable. The grip rubber side panels are positioned in such a way that the grip sits in the hands nicely. However, if you are not a big fan of thin grips it will probably take some time for you to get used to this grip.

Eccentric system
PSE powers the Bow Madness XL with a smooth-drawing Madness Cam system (MC Cam), advertised to hit IBO speeds reaching 332 FPS. The MC cam system is smooth and easily adjustable. No bow press is required for adjusting the draw length in 1 inch increments over a range of 25 - 30 inches. The short draw length adjustments (25"" to 28"") are made on the inner cam module, whereas the long draw lengths are adjusted on the standard cam module (27"" to 30""). The let-off is adjustable from 65 to 80%.

Draw cycle and shootability
The Bow Madness XL has received a lot of positive feedback from many archers in regard to its smooth draw cycle for the speed and solid back wall. In addition, a lot of shooters strongly agree that this rig holds extremely well due to its longer AtA length.

Quietness and vibration
No bow is completely quiet and the Madness XL is not an exception. Although hand shock and vibration is there, the bow can be made quieter by installing a stabilizer.

Overall quality
While archers agree the Bow Madness XL is a good quality bow, factory strings could be of better quality. A lot of reviews and tests indicate that the standard factory strings stretch and twist. While this is not a major issue for some shooters, others are keen to replace factory strings with an aftermarket set of better quality. Those who dislike factory strings strongly agree, however, that once the strings are replaced this bow is almost flawless.

Value for money
Many archers agree this rig is a great value for money. With a modest price tag, the Bow Madness XL is as good as some of its more expensive competitors with similar specs.

Summary
To conclude, The PSE Bow Madness XL is a quality long bow at an affordable price. With a modest price tag, this rig is as good as some of higher priced competitor bows. At only 3.9 lbs this bow is lightweight, stable, and holds very well. Although it is not completely quiet, the vibration and hand shock can be reduced to the very low levels by installing a stabilizer. Admittedly, the Madness XL is one of the best single cam bows due to its fast, efficient, and easily adjustable eccentric system. As noted by many archers and experts, the draw cycle is smooth for the speed this rig can produce. Overall, this is a quality bow that can be used for both hunting and 3-D shooting."

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 26 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me.

The quality of pictures are severely reduced when uploaded to armslist so it can make some textures look strange (like on the extended mags.) If you'd like the full size pictures, I can email them to you."

The MR556A1

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.

This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.

The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system.

The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled.

The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems.

Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.

But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore.

Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy.

The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy.

A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance.

Chinese Dragunov in 7.62x51, the only exact copy of the original Russian design. Rifle is wearing the current issue military polymer stockset. This makes the rifle more accurate as wood can expand or contract depending on the weather, changing the accuracy of the rifle. The polymer set does not do this, and is what's currently in use with the military. These rifles have been banned from import into the United States since the early 1990's and will likely remain so. The website SniperCentral lists the officially adopted sniper rifles of 61 countries, and the Dragunov represents 23 of them. The next most popular rifle (SSG-69) has only been adopted by 5 nations. Coming into service in 1963 the Russian rifle has become famous. This rugged and absolutely reliable system boasts a heavy-duty milled receiver that won't stop. The reliability of the system, combined with the semi-automatic rate of fire which allows quick follow-up shots if you miss your target the first time, and the hard-hitting 7.62 caliber round all make the Dragunov the ideal sniper rifle. A communist sniper issued a Dragunov rifle in the Afghan war stated that he felt confident hitting people out to 800 yds with one shot, and vehicles up to 1000 yds. The Chinese are the only ones who made a direct clone of the Russian Dragunovs and were helped by the Russians during production. Some Chinese rifles have even been found to be re-stamped Russian rifles. The 7.62x51 version is the most accurate of them all and was only made by the Chinese. It combines the durability of the Russian Dragunov with the accuracy of the American 7.62x51(.308) bullet. These rifles can outshoot the stock M14/M1A and AR10 rifles, and the only reason they are not in any U.S. arsenals currently is because it wasn't designed by an American. With the .308 chambering and the military furniture, this is the absolute most accurate Dragunov rifle you can buy. With no more coming into the country, these are undoubtedly good investments that you can take out and enjoy. This one is i"

This gun is in excellent shape.  It has only 30 rounds through it and is still in its break in period.

I bought it a little over a week ago and I really wanted this gun to work for me but my hand doesn’t fit the gun the way I want it to.  That’s a shame because it’s an outstanding design, very similar to a Glock (even down to its takedown method) with a smooth trigger.  Its ultra-slim profile makes it the smallest 9mm there is for concealed carry (you won’t have to settle for a .380).  It just disappears in a pocket or purse and even though it’s a small gun the Talon grips on it give you a very secure grip.  For size comparison, the spiral notebook in two of the photos is 5x7 inches.

The full package comes with Diamondback’s really nice hard case (like a Pelican case), lock, and all paperwork that came from the factory (as shown in photo) and includes the 6-round mag with pinkie extension supplied by Diamondback. 

The serial number begins with “YD7...” so you know this is a very recently manufactured gun.

Prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with valid TN driver’s license or permit.
