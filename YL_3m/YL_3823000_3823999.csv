Smith and Wesson Model 59.  Don't miss your chance to own a piece of American Military history.

Originally designed for Vietnam War Navy Seals, the Model 59 came to market in 1971 and went out of production in 1980, being replaced by the 459 (blued finish).  Over time several variants of the 59 were made including the 559 and 659.  S&W eventually went to a 4 digit naming convention and the 5904 and 5906, among other models, were produced.

There are thousands more just like it. Along with whats in the picture it also has had an awesome trigger job, the lower is color filled, I have a dozen or so poly mags and a couple mil-surp mags. She rests comfortably in a nice pelican brand case, and a ammo can full of brass case ammo, aprox 1000 rounds and only about 300 rounds fired. Now most guys would have this package listed at $1200-$1500. Hell I've seen a couple naked ones listed for $800. Here's the harsh reality. Everything I have here is probably worth about $800 and everyone wants a deal so I doubt I could sell it in a reasonable amount of time for more than $700. Yeah I have more than twice that into it but thats not what it's worth. It's used, everything attached to it is used, every mag is out of the package so they are used.  I can go get a brand new one from the gun store with a warranty, for $600 out the door and probably less if I really shop around. If you guys want to sell your gun, do  a google search, I guarantee your gun sells for less new now than it did a year ago. If you don't really want to sell your gun please stop listing it at twice it's actual worth. I rarely check this site anymore because of the 10 pages I'll look through there will be maybe a half of a page worth of ads that might have close to a reasonable price on it.

The 10mm, of course, performs as the rough equivalent to the .41 Magnum. Muzzle energy rating is some 550 foot pounds. The Model 20 Glock is the best combination of quality and price out of the entire 10mm market. . Manufacturer is Glock of Smyrna, Georgia. Type is double action only, striker fired semi automatic pistol. Construction is steel slide, barrel, and internal parts all assembled into a durable high impact polymer frame. Chambering is 10mm Auto caliber. Barrel is 4.60 inches with German style right hand hexagonal bore that ensures consistent accuracy with diminished fouling. Sight system is classic Glock stake on dot front and dovetailed U-white outline rear, with a 6.77 inch sight radius. Metal finish is black gas nitride. Frame is steel reinforced polymer, with combat finger grooved, ribbed front strap area, checkered surfaces in the recesses and on the back strap, with stippled laterals. Frame incorporates a slotted picatinny rail for light attachment. Trigger is .375 smooth face with integral safety lever, and pulls at a consistent 5.5 pounds with only 1/2 inch of travel. Weight empty on the Glock Model 20 is only 30.9 ounces, 39.7 ounces loaded with 180s. The innovative Glock Polymer damping system, however, significantly reduces felt recoil on this powerhouse. Glock’s safety system consists of automatically engaged trigger safety, firing pin safety, and drop safety. Overall length is 8.22 inches from the muzzle to the butt edge; height is 5.47 inches from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the magazine floorplate. Slide width is 1.13 inches at the ejection port, 1.18 frame thickness at the port. This pistol includes two 15 shot magazines, so 15+1 fully loaded capacity. This pistol’s loaded capability is almost 12 tonnes, as the Brits would say, of energy. Bear, boar, and deer hunters here in Tennessee and Mississippi use these to good effect, and they are unmatched for power delivery in defensive or tactical situations. Each pistol is brand new in its factory box with instruction manual and factory registration envelope, cable lock, fired brass envelope, magazine loading tool, and cleaning brush and rod. Current retail pricing on the Glock Model 20 in our area is $800 or more if a person can even find one. We're offering the pistol in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 489.00. Transferable to eligible civilians in all jurisdictions of these United States.

I recently got this in a trade, and I just don't have the time or motivation to get set up for a new caliber.  Need cash more, so here we go:

Surgeon Scalpel .260

- McMillan M40A1 stock in black/green marble

- Surgeon 591 SA 

- forend mounted picatinny rail

- black Cerakote on all metal

- Jewell Trigger

- 24"" Krieger 1:8 barrel, #9 contour

- 1x 5-round AICS mag and 2x 10-round MORTA mags included



This is an actual Surgeon-built Scalpel, not a rifle built by someone else on a surgeon action.  The action is as smooth as silk, and the Jewell trigger breaks like the proverbial glass rod.  It's a 2007 build and has some normal wear on it, which is purely cosmetic.  Only 2 spots that anyone might notice - first is a small nick in the Cerakote finish on the underside of the barrel near the muzzle end, 2nd is a little chip on the stock near where your thumb goes.  Previous owner reported less than 700 rounds through it, and after looking at it with my borescope I'd say that's about right.  This a very nice rifle and I'm tempted to spin a .308 barrel on it, but I already have enough guns that I don't shoot.  I am motivated to sell this, so I am asking $2800 CASH for a FTF sale in or near the TC metro area of MN.  This is about $2k less than a new one would cost you from Surgeon, and a heck of a deal on a top-of-the-line precision rifle.  You show me your MN DL and PTP or PTC at time of purchase.  Not looking for any trades on this one, but I might consider something small (up to $500 or so) with the rest in cash if it was something I could use.

The Deluxe Kit was designed by Lee to be everything you need to start reloading in an affordable package.  I find it to be just that - a simple to use and affordable progressive press, an excellent balance between a cumbersome single stage and an expensive Dillon.  The kit includes:

•	Turret press with auto index
•	Pro auto disk powder measure
•	Large and small safety prime system
•	Perfect powder sale (NEW - unopened)
•	Case trimmer currer & lock stud
•	Chamfer tool
•	Large and small primer pocket cleaner
From the website:
“The Lee 4 Hole Classic Turret Press features a proven design which utilizes turrets that lock into a solid steel ring allowing the reloader to quickly and effortlessly change calibers. Simply lift out the entire turret and replace with an extra turret (sold separately) set up in a different caliber. The powerful linkage allows even the largest magnum cases to be sized with minimal effort. Boasting generous hand clearance and a comfortable wood grip the Lee turret press will offer years of service to the even the most seasoned reloaders. “

In addition, I’m also including over $200 of dies and other accessories:
•	Lee Pacesetter 3 die set for .308 Winchester
•	Lee Deluxe Carbide 4-Die Set (.38special/.357 magnum) (NEW - unopened)
•	Lee Deluxe Carbide 4-Die Set (.44special/.44 magnum) (NEW - unopened)
•	Lee Deluxe Carbide 4-Die Set (.40S&W/10mm) (NEW - unopened)
•	Lee double disk powder measure kit (allows the press to reload large rifle calibers)
•	Lee rifle charging die (allows the press to reload large rifle calibers)
•	Four spare quick change turrets (five total)
•	Two die stands/storage boxes

This gear is in great condition – I used it to load about 200 rounds of .308, and was never touched again.  None of the pistol caliber gear was ever used – the dies haven’t even been taken out of the box.  I spent nearly $500 on everything here, but now I’m getting out of reloading.

For sale is a Ruger “ALL WEATHER” model 10/22 rifle.  These were made from 1997-2001.  These are not too common.  These are special because they have a true “stainless steel” receiver, instead of an aluminum receiver like most 10/22 stainless models, as is highlighted in the Reference Manual “Standard Catalog of Firearms”.  This one also has the rare skeleton stock, which are going for big $$$ on Ebay.  Gun is topped off with a satin/silver Simmons 3-9 X 32 scope, rings & mounts.  Gun also comes with the factory case, which is pretty cool. Also included is a Butler Creek “HOT LIPS” 25 round magazine, the good one with the metal internals.  Gun is in excellent shape.

For sale is a great shooting Remington 760 Gamemaster BDL pump 30-06 (AKA the Amish Automatic).  Gun was made in the late 70’s early 80’s.  It is topped off with a nice Bushnell 3-9 x 40 scope & see through mounts. Bluing is in good condition.  Stock is American Walnut. The stock has some nicks & scratches on it, & for a good reason. This is a shooter. Smooth action & everything is tight. Great trigger!  This was my brush gun. Somehow I wound up with four 30-06 Remingtons & have decided to downsize. I will miss this one.  I am keeping my 1951 model 721 & the others are sold. If I didn’t have the 721 I would be holding on to this one for sure. 

The new bare bones 760 model (or whatever they call it today) in Walmart sells for $659.00. It is pure junk (synthetic stock, no bluing, cheap black oxide metal finish, crappy trigger) compared to this one being offered. I would be embarrassed to whip that joker out at camp. Never had that scenario with my 760. It’s always like “When the tailgate drops, well, you get the rest.

I have several other long rifles & shotguns for sale on this board also.  You can cut & paste my phone # in the search bar to find my other listings. I am not a dealer, just downsizing.  I live in Carrollton GA, but work in Midtown Atlanta, so I can meet anywhere along the way via I-20.   Shipping? I dunno, maybe we can work something out, but has to be fully legit (shipped to FFL). All calls / texts / emails returned. Mike REDACTED  NO TRADES, NO TRADES, NO TRADES."

For sale is a really nice Savage Model 110 .243 mountain rifle.  You don’t see these too often.  This gun is near mint condition, a true 9.75 on a scale of 1 – 10.  I got it off of my dad’s neighbor. He bought, sighted it in & then died shortly afterwards. It has 14 rounds through it.  It has never been in the woods.  It is topped off with a Tasco 3-9 x 50 World class scope. Super nice bluing & wood stock, not like the junk being made today.  What else can I say?
I have several other long rifles & shotguns for sale on this board also.  You can cut & paste my phone # in the search bar to find my other listings. I am not a dealer, just downsizing.  I live in Carrollton GA, but work in Midtown Atlanta, so I can meet anywhere along the way via I-20.   Shipping? I dunno, maybe we can work something out, but has to be fully legit (shipped to FFL). All calls / texts / emails returned. Mike REDACTED  NO TRADES, NO TRADES, NO TRADES."

For Sale is a SUPER CLEAN, NEAR mint condition Savage Model 112 / .223 Caliber Varmint / Tactical Rifle.  This gun is in Mint Condition! It is a 9.75 on a scale of 1 – 10.  This gun is no joke, it is serious business.  I have never held another gun & had such devious thoughts come over me. The possibilities are limitless with this one.  It has the 24’’ bull barrel & the recessed / button crowned for improved accuracy & protection of the crown.  The action is silky smooth. It also has two sling mounts from the factory on the front of the stock, one for a sling, & one for a bi pod.  You get the picture. (I can see you…..), no, no, no, I meant “freeze Gopher”.  Caddyshack baby!
It has been in a safe for the last 6 – 7 years.  The owner passed away & it has just been sitting.  I bought it with very specific intensions, but circumstances have changed. I am still on the fence with this one.  I am reluctant to part with it.

Whether you choose one chambered for .22 LR, .22 Magnum, or .17HMR, the
Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting
enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the
excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. The Golden Boy

buttplate, with a gleaming Brasslite receiver and barrel band. The classic
styling will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America's
Old West, when company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original
Henry lever action rifle. Adding to the historic authenticity is the
adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. Small game hunters and plinkers will
appreciate its substantial 6.75 lb. heft. It balances well and makes for
highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry
rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness, and left-handed
shooters can safely use any of Henry's lever action rifles.

For sale is a nice Winchester model 121 / .22 caliber bolt action rifle. It is a single shot.  It is a one owner gun.  Condition is an 8.5 on a scale of 1-10. These were made from 1967 – 1973.  The bluing is like new & the stock has very minimal scratches.  These guns are great for young or newer shooters.  It has an automatic safety that is engaged each time the bolt is cycled, so any time a round is loaded the safety is on and has to be manually turned off before the rifle is ready to fire.

I have several other long rifles & shotguns for sale on this board also.  You can cut & paste my phone # in the search bar to find my other listings. I am not a dealer, just downsizing.  I live in Carrollton GA, but work in Midtown Atlanta, so I can meet anywhere along the way via I-20.   Shipping? I dunno, maybe we can work something out, but has to be fully legit (shipped to FFL).

If you don't want the laser, the nicest holster on the market, and a few other extras, buy a new one and save yourself some cash. If you want a used one for $100 less than mine, buy one without the $200 laser and that has been mistreated and reassembled improperly.

Kahr CW40. Great condition. Crimson Trace laser. Sighted in and installed. Pocket holster, 6 hollow points, 7 ballistic tips, 10 flat nosed target rounds, hard case, brand new Alien Gear Cloak Tuck 2.0 holster made for this gun with this laser. It just came in after a 1.5 month back order and comes with a transferable 100% lifetime guarantee and free exchanges for life. It also comes with adjustment pieces for the holster to adjust to your preferred retention, position, and gun angle. It also comes with two extra mags for 3 total.  

Gun has had less than 150 rounds through it, when I got it it had only been fired one mag. This gun overall has positive reviews, but if you will notice the negative reviews there are are due to improper reassembly after takedown for cleaning. I clean it meticulously and have done it right. It has had no failures of any kind, and is dead nuts accurate. At 15 yards, where the dot is on the laser is where the hole will be. The trigger is very light and has a clean break. I call it a long single action feel. 

This is a nice ccw rig and I have used it as such for a few months. I have a few guns I have had for a while and have made a recent purchase on a nice 1911 that is now my ccw. I want something else to shoot at the range."

This rifle is very clean and has very little use. In the span of time I’ve owned it it’s spent 90% of its time in my gun safe the rest of the time was at the range ans not bouncing around behind the seat of a truck like so many SKS rifles do (They are good for that). This would be a great gift for someone or yourself for the holidays! This thing comes ready to rock with 400 rounds of ammo for almost nothing! All serial numbers match and the wood is very nice. SKS rifles make great hunting rifles and are good learning rifles for beginners because of their affordability and dependability. Hit me up for more info.

I will also be including a brand new 8 round extended magazine and a box (50rd) of brass 9mm to get you started. I have original receipt showing I am the original purchaser.
Looking to make a sale only at this time. Price is 250 FIRM. You will not find this pistol online or in town for less, if they have it at all, especially with an additional magazine ($35 value). As such, I will simply ignore any offers for less outright. I am not desperate for the money and am only looking to sell it to help fund a different pistol purchase.
Otherwise I would be interested in trading for a Smith and Wesson J-frame- It must have either a shrouded hammer (438, 638) or exposed hammer- no hammerless or DAO models. I will add cash on my end of course. This is the only trade I'm interested in at this time.
Best way to reach me is by text to 316-619-9eight5four. FTF Wichita area only. Have CCL and will sign bill of sale if desired."

I'd like one in 12 Ga, but will consider 16 or 20 Ga.  No store brands like Stevens, Glenfield, Maverick, Ted Williams, etc.  MAYBE a Mossberg pump or auto-load with a 7 round tube or one of the models that has an extendable tube.

Will consider the shotgun's good case, good optic and extra slugs or buckshot.  I am not a collector, but just want a working Remington shotgun I can REFINISH AND USE, while staying in a budget of $200 or less.  

Price is dependent on condition of the stock and metal.  I can't give the full $200 for Grandpa's 870 that was left in a leaky basement for 30 years, but I'd still like to look at it--if it's working.  Older does not increase the value for me.  I am not a museum.  So please don't ask for more than it's worth or $200, whichever is less.

Please email or text pictures to REDACTED. Must meet in Catoosa or Claremore for the deal.  No Hassles, No Lengthy Forms--just your handshake that guarantees you are legally able to own and sell it.  (No paperwork is required for face to face private sales in Oklahoma.)"

I don't know a lot about this Gun. I do know that the barrel is the Damascus Barrel and I was told that it is a grade D. Being that this has a Damascus barrel, it is highly recommended that this gun is not fired unless you have it thoroughly checked out by a professional and are familiar with what type of ammo should be used in this firearm (modern ammo is not acceptable).

Price would vary based on the brand. That being said the panic is over so let's both be realistic about pricing. Lowers are running in the $50-95 range except some higher end brands (LMT, BCM, etc). If you want to offer an item at 2 or 3 times the new price don't bother contacting me.

Would be looking to pick up in the greater DeRidder/ Fort Polk area but depending on the deal might be able to drive a little bit.

Can show mil ID and orders assigning me to Louisiana and will sign a bill of sale if you want."

Gun is very light weight. The extended hand-guard allows for a more aggressive, fully extended accurate hold. Great for 3 gun. Upper is new, test fired by gunsmith who assembled it. Put A total of 10 rounds through yesterday. Lands hits on a 200 yard plate with ease. Lower has no more than 100 rounds through it.

If you're not familiar with 223 Wylde, I suggest doing some research. It is NOT a different caliber, it's merely a better chamber which can handle both 5.56 and 223 Remington much more accurately. Those tighter tolerances equal greater accuracy.
