These 10rd .22lr guns offer supreme accuracy, far better than what the S&W 41 or Hi Standard Victor can provide.  They are useful for target shooting, as well as self defense or ""concealed carry"".  In Europe, they are favored for security and intelligence work, where precision and zero ""collateral damage"" or unintended victims are desired.  In addition to an ideal target gun, they are optimal for defensive use inside buildings where wall penetration and high people density will be problems.

The 212 is the ultimate S&W 41, that S&W never made.

The rear sight is adjustable for windage only.  The front weight is removable.

The trigger system on these guns is taken from the Hammerli 215, a later version with a number of ""user"" adjustments not present on the older 208 and original 212 models.

Price varies from $1000 to $1600 with one magazine (additional are available) depending on the configuration of grip, gun, and barrel weight chosen.  The different grips and barrel weights shown can be interchanged between guns.  

All are single action.  A scope rail (aftermarket) can be fitted to the weight area of the barrel for bullseye use.

Please note, the MIDDLE gun has NO safety, and NO trigger stop.  For most uses, neither feature adds or subtracts from the function of the gun.  The trigger stop primarily is of use when firing rate exceeds 2 per second, as the trigger has a very short stroke distance anyway.  The middle gun also has a concealed crack in the grip.  NIB grips can be provided to replace that, one is a slab grip that is unstained, and one is a Nill grip fully finished with thumb rest.  The grip on it is OEM Hammerli but the left side has been extensively fish-scaled for good LH grip usage.  The fish scaling is the reason it appears dark.

At 25 yards, these guns are slightly more accurate than the related Hammerli 208 and 208S (which also is available).  At 50-75 yards, accuracy is a little less due to the 5"" barrel length.

Maximum firing rate with practice, and with high precision, is approximately 5 rounds (or 5 separate targets) per second.

FFL transfer only.  Please note, FFL transfer only includes EVERYONE.

Hammerli 208 and 208S, 120, 150, 160, Walther GSP, GSP Silhouette, and GSP Expert, and a variety of other target and self defense handguns are available.  Please email for catalog-selection guide.  Also some Hi Standard Victors and S&W 41 (original models, heavy barrel).

Detailed catalogs available for the 208/208S/212, Hi Standard Victor, and S&W 41 selections.

The last image is of a 4th 212 that is available.  This one has a SN matched box (interior has died).  It is very similar to the first gun to the left, but there is no safety, and no trigger stop.  The box carries a significant premium in cost.  It also can be combined with the Hofmann grip or the heavy barrel weight.  End price depends on how it is configured."

The main benefit of the BAR rail is to those who wish to have a suppressor inside of the rail or for those shooters who have large bear paw hands and who feel that skinnier rails are just too small ( the BAR is about the same circumference as a DD rail with the popular Magpul XTM covers). 

Inside dimensions 1.80"" Outside dimensions Picatinny to picatinny 2.42"" 

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling. 

No Spider logo on this one. Handguard only, no barrel nut or screws, fits the Seekins upper. or you can buy the barrel nut & screws from there website.

I've never shot this and it comes with all the original paper work and gun lock.  I'm looking for cash but would consider a pistol that I could carry concealed or even in a holster on my hip.  I'm basically looking for something more practical.  I paid $450 for this gun so that's the value to me and my price I'm asking.

The HK 416 Pistol is configured on the 416 receiver, but with a handgun-length barrel and short quad forend. The 416 Pistol does not have a buttstock. The HK 416 Semi-automatic Pistol in .22 L.R. is manufactured exclusively by Walther under license from HK. It is the only genuine HK tactical rimfire replica available in the world.

You can't beat a good defensive handgun at a very reasonable price, and one of these is the SCCY CPX-2. The CPX-2 is a double-action-only, hammer-fired, semi-auto pistol. The milled stainless-steel slide, sand blasted for a blemish-free satin finish, is angle cut and rounded at the corners to provide a practical and attractive shape. Five curved serrations are located at the rear of the slide to provide a good grip surface for easy cocking. The slide is topped with a three-dot sight system. The front sight is polymer, but the rear sight is steel and windage adjustable via a set screw.

 When I bought it, it was being used as a lake cabin, parked. Guy had water hooked up direct, I never tried the holding tank and pumps. 

 Roof had leaks, those got patched. However, damage had been done, Hole/soft spot in floor under bunk near bathroom. The front end is a bit worse, has rotted wood and needs some framing and than walls need to be redone. I started tearing into the front couch/bed and window treatments. The window treatments are still here. The sofa/bed frame is still here, I just ditched the covering and foam.

The central portion of the grips is finished with a thin layer of soft touch anti slip material, to increase grip and resistance to wear and abrasions. Biliennium pistols feature a competition tuned trigger with screw to adjust the extra short let off and over travel. The short and light single action trigger pull allows for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The Biliennium feature an extended length and width, ambidextrous manual safety on the frame that locks the sear and the slide in the closed position. The slide was widened near the slide rails. The slight increase in the weight gives the pistol better stability while firing. The pistol is factory new, it comes with both the factory outer cardboard box, serial-numbered to the gun, and also the Beretta metal inner case, as well as all paperwork"

700 dollars cash today gets it. that is my bottom line. no I will not take 699, nor will I take all the accessories off of it. it comes as pictured, 700 dollars, 150 bellow retail and less than anyone is offering it on this site with a US search. Its an increadibly fair deal for what this comes with.

I decided it was a good way to use up the little portions of mixed cerakote left as was doing other projects. I'm willing to cerakote it whatever color you want with cash sale or heavily discounted  if we trade. For quicker response,call or text REDACTED"

Lets all self police some of the continued gouging.  You can buy 22LR ammo for 5 or 6 cents a round at Walmart.  Some of the Walmart resellers are marking this up 3 to 4 times. I've even talked to a couple guys who are reselling to gun shops.  Holy crap!!

Lets all start flagging as overpriced any 22LR ammo that is greater than 10 cents a round.  That way we can set our own ceiling and maybe discourage some of the more outrageous resellers.  The only way we are going to see ammo on a regular basis is to discuourage the heavy gougers.

I know this will be flagged and removed within an hour ot two by the gougers.  Please copy and repost so we can keep this theme going for a coupel weeks and lets see if we can better control the price.

I will consider selling the Beretta without the laser sight for $500. 

Will meet at FFL in Elkhart for state to state transfer. Beretta is registered in the state of Michigan."

It comes with a quiver with five correct aluminum arrows with chisel point broadheads, sights, and a T-handle release. I hunted with it a lot of times over the years before I quit bow hunting.

Worth well over 1000 dollars but I need the money/ would like an AR. 

I have a picture of the inside tag but if your interested I can get more photos.

 I spoke to glen a historian at browning firearms, gave him the serial # and he told me that all he had on that firearm was it was made in 1958 and was a grade 1. 
 It has the back wheel site, blueing is still in descent shape with a minor spot on the barrel with minor lighting. The stock is a good shape with monor scratches but nothing major, it is 55+ years old so its in over good condition.

I also have an extended 8 round magazine for it, which is also brand new and still in the packaging. I am wanting to trade for a slightly larger gun in 9mm now that I no longer need this one for pocket carry. Mainly looking to trade for a Taurus PT111 G2, but would also be interested in a Khar CW9, CT9, or Arcus 98. That being said, would consider pretty much any 9mm trade. Trade value is $300- the sticker price, along with extra mag, and transfer fee was $320.
Otherwise, would be willing to sell for $250 FIRM. I am usually willing to haggle a bit, but not in this instance. You simply won't find this gun in this condition for a lower price anywhere online or in town, and that's assuming they have one in stock. Offers for anything less will be ignored outright.

Some free, unsolicited advice: If you have a 4"" or 5"" barrel, the Hornady Custom 147gr XTP will perform very well in terms of both penetration and expansion for a self defense application. If you have a shorter barrel, such as 3"", you're better off going with the Hornady Critical Defense 115gr FTX to achieve optimum penetration and expansion for a self defense application. If you need/desire additional barrier penetration capabilities from any barrel length, such as passing through auto glass or walls, the Hornady Critical Duty 135gr FTX is an excellent choice.

921,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3403921,For Sale:  A. UBERTI 1873 Regulator Grip Assembly,"Bloomington, Bloomington, Indiana",$ 50,"Listed On: Tuesday, August 19, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I've got a grip frame assembly for an A. Uberti 1873 Regulator.

What you get:  Trigger guard, back strap, original screws, and wooden grips.

The metal frame pieces are _brass_, not steel.  Depending on which shooting circuit you compete in, this may or may not be a problem.  Brass frames are not legal for National Congress of Old West Shooters (NCOWS) shooting, but they are legal for Single Action Shooters Society (SASS).

NOTE:  The owner previous of myself tried to modify the back strap by drilling/tapping a _small_ 1/8"" hole immediately above where the hammer spring contacts the hammer.  This has not changed the functionality of the pistol in any way and is largely a cosmetic defect, and I am selling this grip hardware because the brass frame is not legal for the NCOWS circuit that I compete in.  The price does take into consideration the fact that his is used hardware with a ""bubba"" modification.

If you can find any of these pieces of the frame assembly cheaper than $50.00 dollars individually then I encourage you to go buy those ones, but if you want a complete grip frame assembly with a minor blemish then you can't beat this deal.

Will send pictures on request."
