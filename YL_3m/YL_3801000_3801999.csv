Bought this from my neighbor. He purchased it, and put it in the safe... Never fired and it looks like it. This gun is NOS condition but w/o the box. Serial number is 18,598. Springfield customer service tells me it left the factory as a Standard Grade gun and was made in August of 1981!!! Comes with its original 20 round mag. The only blem on the gun is a very small group of shallow dents on the RH side of the buttstock down near the butt plate. Insignificant but I needed to mention it. Probably done when the gun was in his safe over these past 30 years. Don't miss this opportunity to own this really early Preban M1A."

These projectiles were originally loaded in the M48 .50 Spotter (or sometimes called .50 BAT) caliber cartridge and was used in conjunction with the M40 106mm Recoilless rifle.  The spotter charge in the projectile produces a flash and puff of white smoke to provide a significant visual indicator of the location upon impact.

These are quality reloads from Talon Manufacturing of West Virginia made in 2002. This is reliable sure-fire ammunition and has been stored in a controlled envronment.

Talon Manufacturing went out of business in May of 2007 but they had contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense to recycle, or de-mill, old ammunition as well as ammunition that was no longer used by our armed forces.

 Description: 
 The Micro Might handgun is a five shot, fixed cylinder mini-revolver. It is designed around an historical and simple single action mechanism. By ""fixed cylinder"" means that the cylinder does not swing out of the frame for loading and unloading. Removal of the cylinder is accomplished by removing the cylinder base pin and taking the cylinder completely out of the frame. By ""single action"" means that the trigger performs only one function: it releases the hammer.
 Ammunition Warning
 Micro Might Inc. produces and sells Micro Might handguns designed and chambered for two different calibers. The intended caliber is noted both on the shipping and storage box and on the barrel of the Micro Might handgun itself. If your revolver is chambered for 22LR, any good quality factory made 22 caliber ammunition in long rifle, long or short may be safely used in the revolver. The revolver will also safely handle high velocity 22 ammunition.
 If your revolver is chambered for 22WMRF ammunition, ONLY USE 22WMRF cartridges. This designation stands for 22 caliber Winchester Magnum Rimfire ammunition. Use of standard 22 caliber ammunition in the 22WMRF revolvers can result in malfunctions and serious injuries.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

BUSHMASTER
Stripped Lower Receiver
Mfr Part: F1003299
Rugged, High-Quality Machined Forging For Building A Custom Rifle


Semi-auto, small pin lower receivers are premium-quality forgings machined to precise dimensions and ready to serve as the foundation of a fully customized tactical, competition, or hunting rifle. Exceptionally strong, rigid 7075 T6 aluminum forging has extra metal in the right places for added strength without unnecessary bulk. Features a beefy, M16A2-pattern reinforced area around the front pivot pin, a strengthening ridge over the receiver extension threads, and a ridge around the mag release button to guard against accidental magazine drop by preventing unintentional button activation. Bead blasted after machining to ensure a uniform, non-reflective surface before application of lusterless black military hardcoat A8625, Type III, Class 2 anodized finish that adds surface strength and resists abrasion. A final, nickel acetate seal coat provides extra protection against corrosion. Stripped Lower is the perfect companion for Bushmaster Lower Receiver Parts Kit, available separately, and the receiver extension/buttstock system of your choice.

I Haven't gotten around to solving the problem, just looking to part with it.

LLAMA ESPECIAL .380 : Good condition, has handling marks and usual wear for a pistol of it's age. Has the wood grips with medallions good condition/ right grip with small chip. 1 magazine. Like the 39-2 it has an issue of which I also haven't spent the time to solve. The pistol does fire but after one or a few rounds an extraction/ejection issue will arise causing the spent casing to lodge or stovepipe. It has been awhile since I have fired the pistol but I have always thought it to be an extraction issue. Possibly just needs a new exctractor ?

If anyone is looking for a project, parts or truck guns after a trip to the gunsmith. They are somewhat desirable pistols which need a new home. Would really like to sell/part with both together and will come with a plastic hard case. Bundle for $300 or Send me an offer and/or a 2 for 1 semi-auto pistol trade. Email through here.

Rugged, High-Quality Machined Forging For Building A Custom Rifle


Semi-auto, small pin lower receivers are premium-quality forgings machined to precise dimensions and ready to serve as the foundation of a fully customized tactical, competition, or hunting rifle. Exceptionally strong, rigid 7075 T6 aluminum forging has extra metal in the right places for added strength without unnecessary bulk. Features a beefy, M16A2-pattern reinforced area around the front pivot pin, a strengthening ridge over the receiver extension threads, and a ridge around the mag release button to guard against accidental magazine drop by preventing unintentional button activation. Bead blasted after machining to ensure a uniform, non-reflective surface before application of lusterless black military hardcoat A8625, Type III, Class 2 anodized finish that adds surface strength and resists abrasion. A final, nickel acetate seal coat provides extra protection against corrosion. Stripped Lower is the perfect companion for Bushmaster Lower Receiver Parts Kit, available separately, and the receiver extension/buttstock system of your choice.

Per Milan trkulia (ref. http://www.czub.cz/en/shooting-team-czub.aspx?t=Photogallery&fotogalerie=foto-milan_trkulja#!prettyPhoto[pp_gal]/0/)


""Milan trkulia:  'You asking the right person as I was right on middle of it, when the Colt Z 40 happened.'


'Beside myself, another two persons you know very well, were instrumental in Colt Z or CZ .40 B project. It was Ira Kay and Kerby Smith....there was just one significant specification put forward by the Colt people - this pistol must bear exterior similarity with the the Colt 1911. It was just a verbal request, nothing was written down or signed on this design matter. We just shook the hands. That was it!


All another work was left on the CZ engineers. Shape of the pistol was designed by the Industrial Architect Vojtech Anderle (also author of CZ 100 design), and all interior mechanism works on Colt Z .40 was done by Radek Hauerland, who also worked with me later on CZ 2075 RAMI project. Your statement is absolutely correct, the Colt Z 40/CZ.40B pistol mechanism was fully adopted from CZ 75 line of pistols.


After CZ/Colt deal collapse, pistol was made by CZ for another customers, but in limited numbers. When Radek Hauerland worked on trigger mechanism for COLT Z .40, he at the same time got ready SA/DA and Decocker versions of this pistols. Therefore it was easy to later produce all these trigger mechanism versions, and also the caliber conversion down from .40 to 9x19 was very easy to make. Beside the Colt Z.40 and CZ .40 B pistols, there was an another model based on COLT Z .40 design produced in 9 x 19 cal and called the CZ LE 9.'


Its a great pistol designed from the beginning for the S&W .40.

It feeds Hornady Critical Defense rounds with ease as well as Round Nose bullets. It has the original box, all paperwork and the Ruger carrying case. This has the Raspberry colored frame so this could make a nice Christmas present for the Lady in your life. This is the LCP which is smaller than the LC380 and is VERY concealable! Please, no low ball offers as they will be ignored. I am looking for a face2face meeting with an Ohio resident with a valid driver's license and preferably an CCL as well. I can provide 7 rounds of Honrnady Critiical Defense ammo at time of purchase.

Rifle has a Timney adjustable trigger (set at 3lbs) which breaks like a glass rod. The action, barrel and bolt handle have all been duracoated since new, so the factory metal finish is untouched. The rifle has been used for practice and competitions, so there are the normal handling marks, shell ejection marks, etc. It is not a safe queen.

The stock is a H-S Precision Pro-Series M24 Vertical Grip. The grip has a double palm swell and has been inletted for and has a PTG/M5 bottom metal that accepts detachable magazines. It will take AICS style mags, Accurate Mags, etc. The rifle will come with 2-10 round Accurate Mags as seen in Photo 1. The stock is not designed for, but can be bedded.

This rifle is sub moa all day long with FGMM 175 SMK. My best 5 shot group at any distance was with my hand loads at 600 yards- 4 2/3"" group (.8 MOA). Will give the buyer the best load data I have developed with Muzzle Velocities from chronograph testing.

All this rifle needs is Optics and it is ready to ring steel at 1000 yards. All of the upgrades have been done for you. The rifle alone in the crappy rubber Hogue stock would cost you $700 new. The stock on this rifle with the additional inletting, bottom metal and mags would cost another $600.00 easy. Timney trigger-$140, Surefire Brake-$140....Load Data--priceless.

I have one of those 1226 (is it?) round tins of European 7.62x25mm ammo for sale. I think just the primers are corrosive, that's all. All you need to do is clean your barrel with either hot, soapy water or ammonia after firing and you shouldn't have a problem with corrosion. It is a sealed tin and has never been opened or messed with. Bought it and put it in along with the rest of my ammo and never used it. I won't ship this ammo...it will be a FTF sale in the LaFayette, GA 30728 area. $400 cash. Needless to say, the buyer has to be over 21 years old and can legally own ammo, too.Thanks everyone for reading through my post here. Looking for an ""I'll take it"" and that confirmed ""I'll take it"" will override any ""let me think about it"".

It shoots Point of Aim and has digested 230gr Jacketed Round Nose, Lead Round Nose, and Hollow Point bullets with no issues. This is a clean American made 1911 that has not been buggered with nor has the idiot scratch below the slide release. I will entertain offers but low-balls will be ignored.

578,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3801578,For Sale:  Winchester Model 1876,"Florida, Florida, United States","$ 2,600","Listed On: Thursday, December 11, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"From my personal collection I have a beautiful Winchester Model 1876 Deluxe Sporting rifle chambered in the rarer 40-60 caliber. This Deluxe Model was manufactured in 1884 and shipped in 1886. It comes with a Factory letter of authenticity from the Cody Firearms Museum verifying all 4 special order features. Pistol Grip, Checkered Stocks, Case Hardened and a Set Trigger. With the 1876 Model see a total production of 63,871, there were only 9,275 rifles made with in a 40-60 caliber, 6,612 that came with a 28"" octagon barrel and a mere 268 Deluxe Models with a pistol grip and checkered stocks. With some of those guns having round, 1/2 round and different barrel lengths, that makes this rifle quite rare. As for condition the receiver retains very little case color in protected areas and has faded to a mottled silver. It has a very nice appearance. The 28"" octagon barrel and full magazine retain about 90% of their original bluing, starting to lighten in areas. The bluing looks much better in person, it appears lighter in photos. The highly figured XX grade, original walnut stocks are in very good condition, with normal handling marks and lightened checkering, more on the forearm. Most of the original high gloss piano finish remains. Some old timer lightly scratched (W.M. Little, ANIWA WIS) on the left side of the buttstock, it is barely seen (shown in photos #34 & #89). You don't really notice it in person. The wood to metal fit is tight and proud. I carefully removed the buttstock and the butt plate to show the matching assembly number 2633 stamped on them and the lower tang of the receiver. An ""XX"" is also stamped on the receiver tang. The action is tight and smooth, mechanically perfect. The Dustcover retains 90% of its original bluing and slides flawlessly. The bore is in excellent, mirror like condition with sharp rifling. I would rate it at 90% condition. Sights are original and perfect. The rear 38A Mid-Range Vernier peep sight is in excellent condition and is valued around $800 to $1000 alone. The barrel address and caliber markings are perfect. Screws are excellent and most appear unturned. Gun shows honest use, not abuse. This is a very rare Deluxe Model 1876 in better condition than most, with a lot of eye appeal. I have provided over 80 photos and offer a 3 day inspection period so you can bid with confidence. All photos were taken outdoors in natural light and provide a very accurate depiction of its condition. This old Winchester is considered an antique and can be shipped directly to you (No FFL Required). Insurance is provided with shipping."

BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE 500 S&W - 375 gr. Barnes XPB 1800 fps - 20 Round Box





This is an ultra high performance 500 S&W loading.  It is safe to use in any and all 500 S&W chambered firearms EXCEPT guns that are fed from magazine tubes.  ALWAYS use flat nose bullets in guns fed from magazine tubes.  Click HERE to see Buffalo Bore 500 S&W rounds that are flat nosed.

This spire pointed all copper Barnes XPB bullet will fly very flat and penetrate very deep for an expanding bullet. This load can be used on animals as large as Bison or Cape buffalo. If you need an expanding load that penetrates super deep, I do not know of a better or more capable one. Plus we were able to safely drive it at a super high velocity.

We were also able to use a flash suppressed powder for those who may need to shoot a camp raiding dangerous animal in the dark. If you need your revolver for defense against wild animals, chances are it will happen in low light, when animals are most active—same goes for human criminals. No sense in blinding yourself with your first shot and becoming a blind victim.

As always, we use real world firearms to generate our advertised velocities. We believe that the industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to produce extra high velocities is dishonest to the customer as he/she will never be able to produce such high velocities under real world conditions, where it matters. My single 500 S&W revolver has a nine inch barrel and produced the following velocity.

Has 5 Round Capacity & 22"" Barrel with 1:10 Twist

Extras: 
400 Rounds of Premium Brass Cased .308 Ammunition (some of the best available)
3-12x50 Scope for Long Range Shooting with optional Illumination Crosshair Recticle
New Weaver Rail Mount System (allows you to mount scope in any position you prefer)

NEW Tactical Profile Bi-Pod Setup with Mounts for Sling Swivel or Rail Mount
New Gun Cleaning Kit with 3 Quality .308 Brushes
NEW Individual Weaver Scope Mounts (in case you dont want to use the rail system)

This is everything you could possibly want/need for an awesome Rifle capable of doing everything from long range shooting, hunting, an awesome Sniper Rifle, or whatever you have in mind. These guns are known for their accuracy and shoot 1/2 MOA @ 100 Yards in Stock Form. 

Price: I just bought everything and it's all brand new still in factory packaging, here is what I paid: Rifle: $338, Bi-Pod: $40, All Mounts & Rings plus .308 cleaning kit: $58, 3-12x50 Scope was used to sight in one rifle then removed to use on another rifle but never did because I decided to stick with iron sights (it was a high level AR) so it's basically new with the exception of being mounted to another rifle and fired a few times, its an excellent scope with great glass and the Option to turn on the Illuminated Crosshairs is Great, Scope cost $169.99 and is an excellent scope. The 400 Rounds of .308 Ammo cost $342, this is top quality, brass cased ammunition with 147 Grain FMJ-BT Ammo excellent for close, medium, and long range, many competition shooters use this ammo exclusively because it is so accurate and always consistent to ensure tight groups, I have 20 Boxes of Ammo that each have 20 Rounds inside. All together, everything listed adds up to $948. 

I AM WILLING TO MAKE SOMEONE AN EXTREMELY GENEROUS CASH DEAL AND YOU'LL GET EVERYTHING LISTED THAT COST ME $948 FOR ONLY $650. I would be willing to trade this setup for a really nice gun, preferably with some accessories & ammo, I am open to trading for a couple of nice pistols or one really nice pistol, or a nice Glock 19, Springfield XD/XDM in 9mm and cash, im also interested in a defensive type shotgun with a high capacity & short barrel like a M590A1 or anything similar,  or an even trade for something like a Kriss Vector .45 ACP Carbine or other Pistol Caliber Carbines, MP5 or Other Pistol Caliber Carbines, etc. preferably in 9mm or .45 ACP, even a pistol caliber AR or something similar, I'd prefer a .308/7.62 AR Type Rifle or any High Quality Firearm that is Magazine Fed with a large caliber, I may trade for a really nice AR15, in 5.56 or different caliber AR's, or even a nice AK47 loaded with Ammo & Extra Magazines, or possibly a Mossberg MVP .308/7.62, im open to all quality firearm trades, or we can make a simple cash deal. Just let me know what you have.

I am only selling/trading because I was going to use this setup for long range shooting competitions but my schedule has changed and will no longer allow it so I might as well sell/trade everything since I am not going to use it. My loss is your gain. Thanks for your time and Happy Holidays!

I have a Lee Hand Press ready to go for 9mm and all that you will need is bullets of your choosing. My Lee Hand Press was used only one season for loading hunting rounds at the range. I have a progressive setup and no longer have use for my Hand Press. It will come with everything listed below and as stated above it is ready to get you going with only the bullets of your choosing. This is a great setup that requires no table/bench to mount the press. That’s right if you have a understanding wife or want to take the chance you can actually reload on that precious kitchen table. Great press to learn on or take to the range/hunting trip.

The only reason I'm doing this right now is to pay for repairs on a vehicle that was in an accident mid last week, so I'm not going to be able to entertain any trade requests or drop the price as I'm already losing almost $350 to sell it quickly. First things first, here are the specs on the 1911 from the factory:

Caliber: .45 Auto
Magazine: 7+1
Barrel: Stainless
Twist: 1-16 LH
Overall Length: 8.5""
Overall Height: 5.5""
Trigger Pull: 3.5 - 5 lbs.
Finish: Satin Black Oxide
Grips: Double Diamond Walnut
Avg. Wt. (oz.): 38.5
MSRP: $729.00

With that said and done I'll tell you that a lot of time and energy has gone in to this weapon since I received it a month ago in trade, including a trigger job. The feed ramp has been polished, the barrel has been polished and throated. The base of the firing pin stop has been polished. The trigger bow has been polished and the trigger channel deburred. The sear and disconnector have been deburred and polished on the surfaces that required it. The sear spring has been polished and adjusted slightly.

With all the smithing out of the way on to the Wilson Combat parts that were fitted and installed: hammer, wide competition thumb safety, competition match trigger, beavertail. It comes with Pearce Grip rubber side panel grips. This firearm also has a match grade barrel installed in it. All in all what I have in to this weapon is nearly $950 when all things are said and done, not including what you'd normally spend on a gunsmith to do a trigger job and polish all the internals. which can easily be $75-150 depending on who you use. The only flaw is a small scratch next to the magazine release from the previous owner, but I had eventually planned to cerakote the frame in FDE and toss desert digital grips on it, so it didn't bother me. It has just about 200rds through it and it can run everything I put in to it. It's run Federal aluminum, TulAmmo steel, Winchester white box, and Remington gold saber without a single hiccup. This weapon is a super reliable tack driver now and would be great for home defense or EDC. I'm former law enforcement and do some firearm instruction and I would trust the lives of my family to it, it's that reliable.

I'm asking $600 out the door for this weapon and it will come with all the original stock parts, hard plastic Remington case, and two 7rd magazines. I will also require a valid FL driver's license and a bill of sale to be signed to protect both parties. If you have any questions or would like to see more pictures, please contact me. If you're going to offer less than I'm asking or to trade, please don't waste either of our time, this is a heck of a deal and it makes me sick to sell my project gun, but need outweighs toys.  Also, due to the vast price drop I will require the buyer to make the drive to Spring Hill, I'm already out quite a lot of money on this weapon.

Have a good one!"

Made in Germany in June, 1930; this firearm represents magnificent German engineering and quality.

All proof marks are legible and sharp.  Case hardening colors are sharp through receiver and trigger guard.  Bluing is over 90% by my estimate.  Double 16ga bores are clean and bright, rifling on 8mm is clean, bright and sharp.  Slide lock action locks tight without a bit of movement.  Filigree detail is clean and clear.  Optic glass with German style reticle is bright and clear.
