This was built by a very well-known armorer and good friend who passed away a few years ago.  I have shot one high-power match with it, then cleaned it and stored it in my safe.  It has not been fired since the high-power match but has been oiled and maintained.

It has a NM Douglas barrel, NM sights, and a sweet NRA-legal trigger.  The stock and handguard is from an M14 and has been glassed in where the selector switch used to be.  It has a web sling, TRW bolt, and 2 mil-spec/original magazines included.

I could go on to describe it in more detail, but if you are seriously interested, you will want to know who built it and what he built it with.  This armorer was a very good friend of mine, and was very well known in the CMP/NRA High Power community.  It is legal for matches and/or would make a great hunting/sniper type rifle.  You can't get much better than this...

I will not advertise it with his name - I don't want to capitalize on his name (as others have done).  Again, if you are serious, you can email or text me and I will tell you.

Value between $3500-$5000.  I know that's a very wide range, but if you know and understand the rifle/armorer you will understand why."

This is serious fire power. From the factory: The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser."

.460 Rowland firearms are safe to fire .460 Rowland, .45 Super, and .45 ACP as they have the same OAL, however .460 Rowland has slightly longer brass to prevent them from being chambered in guns that are not set up to handle the .44 magnum pressures of the Rowland.
(.45 ACP rounds may not fully cycle the gun with the currently installed 24lb spring, have not tried the also-included 22 lb spring)

The conversion kit it all here, includes the original TOOLS, INSTRUCTIONS, and PAPERWORK!

Comes with (3) three magazines, two are surplus, one has a kimber bumper on it.
(any standard 1911 magazine will feed .460 Rowland)

Breakdown:
Norinco 1911- $425
Clark .460 Rowland Conversion- $250
Jigged Bone Grips- $50 (Can remove from firearm if unwanted)
83 Rounds of Underwood .460 Rowland Ammunition- $70 ($1 per round from Underwood)
$750 Total.
$700 w/o Bone Grips.

Also included: original rubber grips w/ finger groove insert, USGI-style plastic brown grips.
ALL PARTS THAT ORIGINALLY CAME WITH FIREARM WHEN I PURCHASED IT.
This includes the .45 ACP barrel, guide rod, springs, etc..

There were a limited run of only 30 of these made and there are none left. They are sold out. This is a classic AK47 with Milled receiver and wood furniture. This is the BEST of the BEST! Get this while you can.

                                                THIS IS NOT A SCAM!

                  THE FOLLOWING INFO WAS OBTAINED FROM THE K-VAR WEBSITE.

The SAM7UF-87. Limited run of only 30 units available.

The calls have been heard and Arsenal, Inc. has provided us with a select quantity of the SAM7UF-87 with original Bulgarian wood handguards for that classic look. Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the new addition to the SAM7 family – the SAM7UF-87 rifle. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features expected in the SAM7 Family. From its reinforced under-folding butt stock to its 14x1mm left hand muzzle threads with muzzle nut, every component of the SAM7UF-87 is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7UF-87 rifle is bound to become a sought-after and collectible firearm.


The New Reinforced Under-Folding Stock:

The SAM7UF-87 utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, which locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver

Each SAM7UF-87 receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.


SAM7UF-87 model 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14x1mm muzzle left-hand threads, muzzle nut, bayonet / accessory lug, reinforced under-folding buttstock, Bulgarian blonde wood handguards, cleaning rod, one 10-round magazine (accepts any mil. spec. magazine), sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

I had decided to keep it and mount it on my AR10 (which works awesome) but I have some higher priorities at the moment. It is a solid scope but too be honest I am not into the ""rang/hold over"" reticles. I guess I just prefer the simple type reticle.  These have the 1 Shot Zero. NEW ones are $799 but obviously this one is used. It has ring marks and some general handling marks from hunting. The Glass is in good shape with no issues. I'm just looking to raise some funds for another project.  The holdover points work exactly as listed per the caliber!

The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser."

This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun."

This is one of my babies. This is a Stoeger Stage Coach Nickel and Black Wood Side By Side shotgun. I had this professional Made By a GunSmith in Dallas and it took me 8 Months to have made. It was lowered to 26 1/2 inches which is 1/2 inch larger than the legal limit. It was Just always a dream of mine to have a short double. It has Dual Triggers. Which can be fired at once or one at a time.

It was professionally made by a licensed Smith. If you look at the Buttstock it was Made Custom to fit the reduced size of the Stock. As well the Barrels were cut down, and sanded so there are no chippings or excess steel deposits. Even the Ribbing on the top of the shotgun has been perfectly mounted. The Black-Finished Hardwood, Polished Nickel Looks beautiful. 

I fired this shotgun maybe 6 times in the life that I've had it. It has very little if not any scratches. ZERO dents or deep indentations. IT is ROCK SOLID. When you hold it you here no rattling or shaking. Its like a solid piece of steel. This is a SUPER powerful Shotgun. And I’ve never seen one like it before. Hence Why I had it Built. 

Pretty much the Ultimate in Firepower for a home protection gun, and if you're a CowBoy action shooter this is a must. Everyone that sees it flips out, and when I've taken it to the Local Gun Shop, There are too many Oohs and ahhs. 

Pictures don't do this justice. 

I'm asking $525 firm. 
Ill Throw in a Custom Nylon Scabbard/Case that fits it perfectly and two safe Shells so you dont damaged the firing pins!

You MUST be a legal Texas resident and Be willing to sign a Bill of Sale.
I'm in Plano Texas, so I can meet you in public. Please Be professional. Im a Professional Person I’d expect you to be also. Feel free to email me questions and i'll be happy to email you more pictures.

It's a custom build using only premium parts.  I originally built this gun for 3 gun competition, and its based more off of the M16 style rather than the M4.  
Specs on the rifle are as follows.

Lower Receiver-
Stag Arms lower receiver;
Palmetto State Armory lower parts kit; 
Magpul MOE grip;
Magpul MOE Rifle stock;
Magpul Enhanced Trigger guard;

Upper receiver-
Spikes Tactical upper receiver;
Custom 17"" stainless barrel chambered in .223/5.56 Wylde with rifle length FSGB;
Yankee Hill Machine Phantom muzzle break
Magpul MOE rifle length handguard
WMD NIbX bolt carrier group with NIbX coated hammer;
Daniel Defense fixed rear sight;
standard charging handle (keeping my ambi gunfighter for a pistol build)

The Barrel started its like as a 20"" HBAR and I sent it out to Randall over at AR15barrels.com and had him shorten to it 17"" crown, re-thread, open the gas port for proper function year round in Wisconsin weather and pin the front sight block.  Once it returned from him i threw it on the lathe at my work and re profiled the barrel from HBAR to a government profile.
All of the barrel parts (Barrel nut, Delta ring, FSGB ect.)  came from Bravo Company Machine.

I built this gun like a tank and stand behind my work.  This isn't my first build, and it's not just slapped together using generic part kits.  A lot of thought has been put into this gun and several people have told me it's the softest shooting AR they have ever shot.
Maybe 100 round have been through it, and the bore is mirror smooth.
Reason I'm selling is, 3gun won't be happening anytime soon and  I am in the process of a 7.62x39 pistol build and wont need 2 toys.  Plus i want a motorcycle...

This Gun will come with 5 Magpul Pmags.  Four 30 rounders (one has a window) and one 40 rounder.
Also 150 round box of 62gr greentip

Price is $950 obo for everything or trade for an older motorcycle.  

Any meet ups will take place at Shooters in Racine.   I will, however, travel to you if our deal involves a trade.

Any questions/comments/concerns please feel free to email.

Thanks for looking, and happy shooting."

If you haven't seen one of these, they are pretty impressive.  They can go from 0 to 3 power to allow you keep both eyes open while firing at close range, or crank it back up to 3 power for long range work.

616,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3272616,"For Sale:  Custom, Handmade Steel and Knapped Blade Knives with Sheaths","west, Omaha, Nebraska",$ 150,"Listed On: Saturday, July 12, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have more than 35 handmade stainless steel and obsidian blade knives with specially treated deer or elk antler handles. The photos picture some of the knives. The vast majority of my steel blade blanks are fabricated from 440c high carbon stainless steel. They are various styles and sizes ranging from 12-inch bowie knife blades to the smallest patch knife. The knapped blade art deco knives feature obsidian, agate and blades flint knapped by master knappers. Both my steel and knapped blades are hafted to elk or deer antler handles that have been specially treated, finely sanded and polished. Some feature hand carved images such as eagles and deer on the handles by nationally known artist by Rob Roberts. The elk antler handles are fitted with exotic wooden end caps. The ends of my deer antler handles feature finely carved, sanded and polished round skull bone on the end of the burr. Some handles have been dyed to enhance their appearance. The tangs of my steel blades have been deeply inserted into the antlers and permanently attached with industrial-strength epoxy. Although I offer a 14-day money-back guarantee, I have never had one returned. My rating as an eBay seller is 100 percent. My knives have been praised on Facebook and in the Other Weapons category of firearmstalk.com many times. Main Street Jewelers in Plattsmouth, Neb., has prominent display case of my knives for sale. Pilchers Indian Store in Omaha, Neb., has a great inventory of my obsidian blade knives which are hafted in the traditional method with sinew; however, the blades also are permanently attached with epoxy. Retail stores in other states also sell my knives. My custom handmade leather sheaths are the highest quality, sold at cost. Prices vary depending upon the knife. Whatever the cost, it will be much less when averaged over the decades than inferior, retail-priced knives. A knife in a store may cost less, but does not have the value of a custom, handmade knife to become an heirloom passed from generation to generation. Many personal referrals available. Various knife collectors have 15 or more Porter Knives and have ordered many more for gifts, including many groomsmen. You may also pick the blade want, and the handle you want (or let me suggest excellent choices) and I'll make a unique, one-of-a-kind knife that can never be duplicated and is valued for its beauty and craftsmanship."

Comes with 1 Steel 30 round Ribbed back Magazine. It was built on a Nodak Spud full heat treated receiver by Century. It is up to par with the Yugo M70AB2 Rifles they build. It has a 16.25in overall barrel length, with a 14in Barrel, and 2.25in Muzzle brake to bring it to above 16 in in length, and to mitigate recoil. It has a Sidefolding Paratrooper style stock (Which is awesome because it allows you to hook the buttstock behind your armpit for reloading), Uncovered gas tube and ventilated lower handguard with Vertical Pistol grip (This is for sustaining fire, as to keep the barrel and gas block air cooled), and it has one of the best triggers on an AK I have ever felt. It is a Tapco G2, but when you feel it and shoot it you will clearly feel how clean it is. The action is extremely smooth and all of the rivets are perfect. The Stock opens and closes with ease by Push button. The Muzzle brake is Tac-welded on by the factory to make it NFA compliant. The Brake really attracts attention at the range with it's huge fireballs. The sights are dead on, and there is no cant what-so-ever. This is not a Garage build, and it was put together extremely well. I have shot this rifle out to 300M with consistent and accurate hits, and it has not once had a malfunction of any type. I have Exactly 300 rounds through it (60 rounds of Winchester FMJ, the Rest were Wolf, Uly, and Tula FMJ and HP Non-corrosive). I have not bump fired it or any stupid shit like that. This is my personal defense rifle, but right now I have other priorities. Keep in mind my price listed is my cash price, not my trade price. The only trades I would be interested in would be a All stock (sights exempt) Glock 34 (Preferably Gen 4), A Walther PPQ M1 or M2 with some mags, Maybe a G42+boot, A Zastava M92PAP+brace (Boot without brace) but I would rather have cash or a Gen 34 Gen 4. I will not even look at any Glock that has any ""Polishing (Dremel Jobs) or Stippling (Soldering Iron jobs). If you have something that you think I may be interested in, let me know. Not interested in any Taurus or other low end firearms, no Shotguns, Deer rifles, M&P's, AR-15 Parts, other AK's (Outside of the pistol I have listed, or other AK pistols+boot). I am not selling this out of need, and I am more than happy to keep it as it is excellent. LOWBALLING WILL BE IGNORED, AND DO NOT REPLY WITH YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER SAYING ""TEXT/CALL"" AS IT IS EXTREMELY RUDE. THANKS! :) 
ALSO, I AM NOT DRIVING TO LOUISVILLE/LEX/MAYSVILLE or any other place that is far as hell away.

The Gen 2 solves any past issues the Gen 1 had, which were still good rifles overall, but the Gen 2 is a great rifle!  It eats all ammo reliably, takes all standard AK-47 steel and polymer mags and has a nice trigger, it's a great modern day AK platform.  It comes with a Troy Battle Rail and optional Troy Micro Battle Sights.  Also included are the stock polymer handguards with removable rails, top receiver rail, an aftermarket extended safety lever(a must) and a Hogue grip, which is very comfortable.  I have included links for everything listed.  Due to the demand, I cannot find any sites where the 556R is actually in stock, so my price is firm at this time.

$1,500 in cash with Troy Battle Rail or $1,650 with Troy Micro Battle Sights.  Add another $600 if you want the EoTech 552 and Vortex 3x magnifier.  I prefer cash, so any trades or trade + cash offers would need to be a good deal for me to consider at this time.

On a helpful side note, anyone looking for a quality 3x magnifier needs to pick up the Vortex.  I have the $600 Aimpoint 3x as well and cannot tell the difference in clarity, eye relief etc.  I now have a few of the Vortex if that tells you anything.

If wanting to trade, please state exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I do not need anything in trade right now, but will trade if it makes sense on my end, no hurry to move this set-up.  If you offer something of less value and do not mention adding cash or other to the deal, I will assume you want a straight trade and pass.  Same on your end, if you have something of higher value let me know what you are looking for on top.   

Below I listed a handful I do not have yet and would not mind trying, but also listed are ones I would not mind having more of and will consider if the deal makes sense, so feel free to make offer as I like a bit of everything, but please make sure the value is there.

Trades:

FN SCAR 16 and 17 or AR uppers in .450 Bushmaster, maybe .50 Beowulf, would like to try H&K USP or prefer larger frames like the Tactical or Expert models, that's about all I would not mind trying right now.

Others I would not mind having more of:

All makes & models of semi-auto rifles, AK-47, AK-74, Saiga rifles and shotguns, PSL, FAL, AR-10, AR-15 and variants like Sig 556 etc.

All makes & models of semi-auto pistols or revolvers in .357 mag & .44 mag.

Maybe bolt-guns in the common calibers, or quality low to higher power range scopes, quality red dots and magnifiers.

Maybe ammo in the popular calibers to help make a deal happen, but not going to give full retail value on ammo as I have plenty already.  Will consider .308/7.62x51, 7.62x39, 7.62x54, 5.45x39(7n6), .223/5.56, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 Mag, .44 Mag and .22lr.

Previous owner bought this gun in 1992 while working in Germany. The design of the slide is from Joe Peters of Peters Stahl, (Peters' Steel Manufacturing). KPS the German manufacturer, was the name of the Peters Stahl company for a short while. The Peters Stahl 1911 family of pistols are among the finest 1911s money can buy. They started manufacturing their range of custom guns in the mid-1980s and are still around today. the founder Joe Peters went on to Form KPS, who manufactured this pistol. Along with excellent build quality (this gun is build like a tank!), the main difference from ordinary 1911s is that the Peters Stahl guns use a Sig type lock up, where the breach locks directly into the ejection port. Basically this means that you are combining the two most reliable and accurate major caliber semi-automatic pistol formats – Colt/ Browning and Sig. The result is a pistol that is utterly reliable and accurate. The fact that it is a .45 ACP with a six inch barrel just makes it even better. The double extraction system is designed to be ""Multicaliber"" with an adjustment screw on the slide. This allows the breech face to be altered to fit the cartridge being fired. To convert to any caliber (.45, 10mm, .38 super, etc.) one only needed to change the barrel, recoil spring and magazine and you would use the same slide. The slide to frame fit is on par with among the best custom gun makers. Comes with a case and one magazine. This gun is perfectly adaptable with other Omega pistols and ordering other calibers whether from either Peters Stahl or Springfield is possible. I accept checks and money orders,"

The MK 116 is a very nice piston driven system chambered in .223 Wylde and using the PWS proprietary piston design. This rifle has a 16"" barrel, a 13.5"" PWS keymod rail system, and the rifle weighs less than 7 lbs. As noted in the title, one of the key upgrades is the Geissele Super Dynamic Enhanced two stage trigger with a smooth 2 lb. first stage and then a crisp 1 lb. second stage. In addition to the trigger upgrade, I've added 45 degree rapid transition backup sights, a competition muzzle brake/compensator that significantly reduces muzzle rise and allows the shooter to take full advantage of the trigger for accurate rapid fire and follow-on shooting, and a Weaver 1-5x tactical scope and offset mount (Note that this isn't the scope pictured but it is now mounted and is a much better scope).

I'm the original owner of this rifle, which was purchased in November of last year. I've shot the rifle a few times but it has had no abuse and I estimate the number of rounds fired would be no more than 500 rounds. In addition to the items discussed above, a Drago rifle case, and all original paperwork including the manufacturer's warranty are also included with your purchase.

For those not familiar with the MI SSK12 Minute Man rifle, it is an AR-15 that comes with a great and very nice looking billet receiver set made by MI. Though a great rifle out of the box, I made many upgrades to better accommodate my needs for competition shooting. With the upgrades that have been made, you're buying a rifle that you would be hard pressed to further improve upon at a price less than that of the stock rifle, not to mention the $1000+ (far more with sales tax included) I have invested in the rifle through improvements and upgrades after purchasing the rifle new in October 2013
UPGRADES ARE SUMMARIZED AT THE BOTTOM OF POST WITH ADDITIONAL DETAIL PROVIDED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

Among these upgrades are a brand new 16"" 1:7 twist DRD hammer forged chrome lined barrel that I had installed in place of the original barrel in early June (poor timing on my part but at the time I had no plans to move abroad).  The rifle has been taken to the range twice since installing this new barrel with roughly 100-200 rounds having been fired. The reason for switching barrels was to improve accuracy as the DRD uses polygonal rifling as well as being cold hammer forged.  The accuracy with this new barrel is easily sub-MOA, quite possibly closer to 1/2 MOA. Other upgrades include the Magpul UBR Stock, Magpul Pro Sights, a Fortis compensator/muzzle brake, and a Geissele Super Dynamic Enhanced Flat two-stage trigger with a smooth 2 lb. first stage and a crisp 1.5 lb. second stage (Note that the Geissele trigger is not pictured as it was just installed and the trigger shown in the pictures is a Timney). The rifle originally came with a shorter 13"" rail, but I had this replaced with a new MI Gen 2 quad rail when the new barrel was recently installed. A Weaver 1-5x tactical scope with offset mount and a Sight Docter mini red-dot sight is also included. Another nice feature is the upgraded BCG which is a Titanium Boron (TiN) Bolt Carrier Group. You can see the gold coloring of this BCG in the photos and in addition to improving the look, this bcg is very tough due to this coating, quite easy to clean and maintain, and functions flawlessly. 

As I'm preparing to move abroad where I will not have any use for my weapons, I'm selling two rifles, including this one, and one 1911 handgun. This rifle had originally sold for just over $1600 when I purchased it last fall and the value of the aforementioned upgrades has been well over $1,000. When you factor in the sales tax, this price is quite a bargain.  The listing price of $1,550 includes the optic but I am willing to sell the rifle without the scope for $1,450.  Any offers below full price will not come with scope or triggers mentioned, but instead a JP single stage, unless otherwise negotiated.  Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
