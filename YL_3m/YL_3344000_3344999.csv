I bought  some reloads from a guy in Fernely selling bulk ammo on Armslist.  I drove for Reno to Fernely gave him $250 dollars of hard earned honest money. He gave me 1000 rounds of the worst ammo a person could possible make. I doubt he as a FFA license to sell such bad batch of defective bullets.  Then he lied and said he had thrown in some extra rounds to ""sweeten"" the deal. Well I believed him. But after opening the box and counting the rounds there was no extra's. Then after firing the rounds and getting one misfire after the next and having bullets jam up in my gun I asked someone else what they thought. I was told there was not enough gunpowder in the rounds.  At no time since posting warnings about bad ammo in Fernely has the guy said he was sorry and offered to give back $250 he ripped me off for. I have received e-mails daily telling me what  a bad person I am for telling the truth and warning others.  But still this is a true account of what has happened to me for trying to make an honest deal with a dishonest person selling bad ammo out of Fernely. I don't believe he gave me his legal name or is a representative of a legal manufacturer. I think he is making  his own reloads and then trying to sell them without a license."

The extra turrets are set up for mk262 ammo, 77gr smk 5.56 about 2600-2650 from a 16"" 1/8 twist barrel. There are 2 turrets new in package as seen in picture, and the one on the elevation turret in the picture. I took the original numbered turret from the elevation and placed it on the windage turret where I could have exposed turrets on both. the original turret cap is the one in the foreground of the picture. All of the turrets slip on to the standard burris turret system and tighten with 3 screws. It was just handy to have the windage turret easily dialed when you don't want to use the reticle hash marks. Optics are nice and clear, adjustments never failed me, always repeatable, and the turret bdc system marked for yardage is fairly close (no problem for hunting, precision work I would always dial to my dope chart). 

I purchased a butler creek flip cap for the objective, but couldn't use one in the rear because of my backup ARMS sight. No ring marks, no sign of use, looks new with all papers, box, etc.

When armslist first started it was a fun place to hang out and kill a Saturday. You could find guns you haven't owned yet, you could get a fair trade or buy, try it out, and put it back on the next week if you wanted to.
Today we have what is called progress, today we can find guns at prices in excess of dealer list. Guns that are without accessories but listed as LNIB.  There is no need to concern yourself with missing anything, it's the same stuff listed again and again, because most of us are smart enough to do the research and not do business with the scams. Don't even want to get started on ammo!

The 30-06's all have a small nick on the edge of the rim, but I think 'cuz they were fired out of my friends' Garand. The 40's & the Lugers all look pretty good too, as do the 308's----but I can't say with certainty if they've been fired more than once. Anyway I don't want to sell this stuff separately so it's gonna be all or nothing. So I'll take the best offer over $40.00, plus cheap shipping anywhere in America.

People do not be fooled into thinking buying a Saiga is going to be any harder. While yes they are passing a Russian ban on things, I wish people would research before starting to state that oh these are going to be banned and how the value is going to go up. First in order to know these, the firearms come stock as a sporting style rifle with the 5rd mag for reason whether the rifle or shotgun. Long and behold if you look into the compliant list you will surely see that must are already in stock here by the thousands in that form and all the AK style pistol grip furniture is all US made which it has to be. So with that being said a true Saiga S12 series shotgun can not be bought legally anyways which is more what they are looking at. Those are the full automatic ones. Please do not start charging $2000+ dollars or trading for multiple firearms only because they have been converted from sport ( which by the way at most with plug,spring,grip,etc) cost at most $250. How do I know because I have a few done already ( No not about to sell). Be careful people. If you are that gullible I have a shiny rock that I was told came from mars and can stop a .50 cal round."

It's been my everyday carry for a couple years, taken it to the range a handful of times, kept clean, and never had an issue with it. Just decided to make a change. Fantastic little pocket gun that nobody would ever know you had on you and no discomfort from concealed carry.

Second Layer of History on this gun is that it was in the Same Johns gun collection that consisted of 450 some guns all of which were donated to the Montana Historical Society in Helena except for this one which was picked up in 1957. Sam Johns was born in Wales in 1866 and came to Montana and the Flathead in the 1880s and was one of Kalispells first Merchants in the early 1890's and previously had lived in Demersville ,he recorded the history of the Flathead and was a collector of historical Firearms. he has 10 volumes of his research and memoirs at the Mike Mansfield Library in Missoula. Google him,very interesting man. The third layer of history is that this gun was originally owned by Tom Mcgovern, whom Mcgoverns Bay was named after which was renamed Somers Bay on flatehead Lake. Tom Mcgovern was a Irish Immigrant who sold all the Land where the Town of Somers now sits to John O'brian who built the town of Somers and the Saw mill.Historical home in Kalispell the Mcgovern/Karcher home was built by Tom Mcgovern.
Gun has a Helluva lot of neat history to it and is a Fantastic conversation piece and would make a great wall hanger.

It comes with 2 mags (10 rounds) and one of the mags has the extension on it. I still have the original box and will add an unused ankle holster.

I am a Connecticut resident (private party and non-FFL) and if you want, you can travel to Hartford County to inspect this Glock prior to purchasing it. If you are satisfied with it, we'll sign a bill of sale together (driver license info required) and we will drop the Glock in a Connecticut UPS store to be shipped to a FFL of your choice. All according to ATF rules. 

Mass dealers are selling G26 for $675 plus tax and transfer fees and good luck finding a private party in Mass selling great shaped G26 preban for less than $600. I know I have an excellent handgun and you won't be disappointed. 

The price is firm and I'm not interested in trades. Cash only. Buyer pays shipping fees. If you don't like these terms, please don't waste your time or mine.  I am not in a hurry, so shop around and see the old junk G26 preban people are selling around for $400 and when you are tired, send me an email and come check my G26 out."

I am also selling the bayonet ( not the original but it came with it when I bought it), 37 rounds of ammo + one black powder blank ( about 40$ in ammo) and the reloading dies and some reloadable brass I have. I am looking for about 300-400 for all of it, but that is not a firm price. I am willing to haggle within reason.

The gun originally had a 4 plus 1 capacity. It has an integrated top rail and AR-15 style front and rear sights. It also utilizes a AR-15 stock and pistol grip. The gun is based on a Winchester 1300 action and is extremely smooth. This is the last of the pump shotguns made by FN, and the dealer stock ran out about six years ago. Several non-permanent additions have been added to the base gun. An EoTech clone was placed on the rail and is included. A Tac-Star six round side saddle has been mounted to the receiver, as well as the addition of a Tapco S.A.W. style pistol grip. This grip is a bit wider than a standard AR-15 style pistol grip, and helps tame the recoil of the 12 gauge. The trigger guard has also been replaced with a Magpul enhanced polymer trigger guard to reduce sharp edges. An ambidextrous sling plate has been added as well as a collapsible stock. To that collapsible stock a Mesa Tactical SOCOM six round side saddle has been added. Also a magazine tube extension has been fitted to increase the capacity to eight rounds plus one. The gun will carry a total of 21 rounds with a loaded chamber. All of the original parts are included with the purchase of the gun. The barrel is 18.5 inches long and compensated with a breaching muzzle. 

Also included is a Blackhawk Shotgunner vest. I used this in the early days of three gun before I had access to items specifically designed for the sport. It has 3 AR-15 magazine pouches holding a total of six thirty round magazines. On the opposite side it has two pouches with elastic loops that hold a total of 28 rounds of 12 gauge in an easily accessed position. There are also just under 300 rounds of 12 gauge ammo included. Types include law enforcement grade buckshot, slugs, and less lethal pepper ball rounds. Also birdshot and a couple of different types of Brenneke slugs. This package is a one stop solution for those looking for a great home defense gun, or wanting to get into three gun matches. The asking price is $1100 or best offer for everything. At this point I am not looking for trades, or wanting to separate the package. For a fast response you can text me at 6 two 3- 2 6 one – six 2 four seven.

Thanks for checking out the post. I am generally posting to find a good AR-15 or just outright sell two handguns I have. I have a BERSA Thunder in .380 and a Ruger SR9C in 9mm. I'm looking to get $750(sell) or $850 (trade) for everything or I could part out if necessary. I'm not looking for attachments with the trade however, I will not decline if you have them to sweeten the deal. Also, I have about 10 loose rounds of .380 Hollow Point ammo I will throw in, as well as 18 Loose Rounds of 9mm ammo and one 50 round box of Federal 115 Grain ammo. The Ruger has a Tagua Leather Holster with it.

There is no holster wear of any kind, however there's some finish wear on the magwell lip area and by the decocking lever which isn't that noticeable unless you look for it. Less than 400 rounds fired. Selling because I prefer the trigger on my HK USP9SD instead.
