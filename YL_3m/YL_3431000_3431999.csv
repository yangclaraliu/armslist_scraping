I started with the Maverick because of the cross-bolt safety over the tang safety of the Mossberg 500. 
I then removed the pinned composite/rail assembly and replaced it the the standard steel tube slide assembly adding the forward pistol grip and light w/3 way function on the thumb switch of the grip Low/High/Strobe, Barrel is a 20"" cylinder bore for 2.75 and 3.0 magnums and magazine is the the longer 8 shot version as well. 
The rear grip is a Knoxx/Blackhawk breaching grip and it really helps tame those loads ! 
A single point sling , Mossberg stock pistol grip, factory composite stock and a Blackhawk for-end are also all included. Easily converted to full stock cylinder bore for rifled slugs for deer season just add the magazine plug (not included) to keep it legal.
All told over $300.00 in parts added to the gun .
This firearm has been tested for over a hundred rounds with no malfunction or issues."

Up FS/FT is my LNIB HK VP9. I acquired this recently along with a Walther PPQ and have decided that I do not need to keep both firearms. I am posting both the Walther PPQ and this beautiful HK VP9 up FS/FT in hopes to acquire an optic for my AR platform or cash to purchase an optic for my AR platform.

This weapon has fired 1 box of 50 rds. Shoots amazing. I was impressed with the ability to make rapid follow up shots with maximum control; HK nailed the ergonomics of this firearm. Gun comes with original box and papers as well as all other accessories/magazines that were included new with the firearm.

I'm hoping to trade this for a high end optic. I can add cash for the right deal but I do prefer not to. Price for sale is $625. Again, preferring to trade. I am open to firearm trades as well but I am very picky! I also have LOTS of ammunition that can be added to trades.

Optics of interest:
- Anything Aimpoint
- EoTech
- Trijicon
- Lucid HD7 
- Leupold 1x4
- Some vortex optics
- Other high end scopes or dot sights
- Will consider other firearm trades

Other things to note: I travel frequently for work. Don't let location prevent you from offering. Odds are that I will be approximate to your location sometime soon and I don't at all mind meeting up at a convenient time for you. Perk of the job!"

This weapon has fired 1 box of 50 rds. Shoots amazing. Ergonomics are fantastic with this firearm, fits my hand unlike anything else.

Great sounding and playing guitar.   $800 cash or $900 trade value.  Comes with hardshell gator case.

The second is an ESP Alexi 600 with SCYTHE inlays!!  Awesome playing and sounding guitar.  I just had it set up last week and the action is ridiculously low and fast.  Has a couple small knicks on one of the wings.  Other than that I don't see any other flaws.  $500 cash or $600 trade value.  Comes with gig bag

The third is an epiphone es-339 pro. The action is great on this one as well and plays effortlessly.  It has the push/pull coil tap for a huge variety of sound.  I bought this from Mayberry music during one of the bad snow storms last winter (feb or March 2014)   No flaws on her that I can see.  This was my first epiphone and I must say that I am highly impressed with it.  The only reason I'm getting rid of it is that I have recently obtained a different semi hollow body and just don't play this one anymore.  $400 cash or $500 trade value.  Comes with gig bag."

 The first is an american stratocaster with a lot of upgrades, including:  dimarzio hot rail in the bridge, fender noiseless in the neck and middle, black graphite nut, and fender locking tuners.   Great sounding and playing guitar.   $800 cash or $900 trade value.  Comes with hardshell gator case.

The second is an ESP Alexi 600 with SCYTHE inlays!!  Awesome playing and sounding guitar.  I just had it set up last week and the action is ridiculously low and fast.  Has a couple small knicks on one of the wings.  Other than that I don't see any other flaws.  $500 cash or $600 trade value.  Comes with gig bag

The third is an epiphone es-339 pro. The action is great on this one as well and plays effortlessly.  It has the push/pull coil tap for a huge variety of sound.  I bought this from Mayberry music during one of the bad snow storms last winter (feb or March 2014)   No flaws on her that I can see.  This was my first epiphone and I must say that I am highly impressed with it.  The only reason I'm getting rid of it is that I have recently obtained a different semi hollow body and just don't play this one anymore.  $400 cash or $500 trade value.  Comes with gig bag."

chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of

has an ambidextrous safety/decocking lever and a reversible magazine
release, and it may be configured with a small, medium, or large backstrap
for individual fit (3 backstraps included). The modular structure,
ergonomics, and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal

This gun is no different and is just awesome.  This particular model has the threaded barrel and protector nut and is a suppressor ready handgun as it sits. The P226 features an ergonomic beavertail grip and is a DAO gun.  The trigger is tight and clean and performs very nicely.  The P226 offered is in 9mm and built like a tank, this is not a sissy gun, it is all metal and feels like it.  The pistol functions 100% perfectly and is in good shape all around with very little visible wear.  It has always been cleaned and stored properly and would make a fine addition to anyone's collection.  It includes a red Sig case and 2 mags. Enjoy and hopefully this gun meets your needs. Have a great day.

This is the same rifle (except for TX DPS Markings) that passed the Texas D.P.S. torture test and is now being issued to Texas D.P.S. troopers. 3,400 of these rifles have been ordered from GT Distributors by Texas D.P.S., the largest purchase of an AR15/M4 weapon outside of a Federal Agency Purchase.

This is the basic description of the rifle in stock form.  I have only made a few additions:
Hogue pistol grip
removed carry handle
Yankee Hill Machine Quad rail
remove front sight post
added back up sights, they are polymer
forend grip
single point sling
Tlr-3 light

Anything I took off, I still have and comes with.  Only had about 100 or so rounds through it. Just sits in the safe and is not needed.  Comes with 3 mags and 3 Magpul Ranger floorplates.  It comes with the original hard case."

Interior ok.....leather..drivers side seat lil torn but intact power seats, windows and mirrors some stains on rear cargo carpet area comes with 3rd row seat also it's removable for more cargo area of needed.......heat works great...but A/C needs recharged professionally

Several parts replaced recently........New master cylinder and front brakes and front ABS sensor hub assembly, New alternator....space to hook up a dual battery setup also.

Tinted windows all around and a black dash cover/carpet.

4x4 was awesome this past winter...couldn't get stuck....matter fact able to help others get get in stuck out snow drifts and ""blaze a path"" for others to follow thru deeper snow.

The Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights (ACOGs) are internally adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics, which collect ambient light. The ACOGs combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Every feature of the mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions, without failure-prone batteries. Covered under a limited lifetime warranty.

Similar to Ultimak,"downtown okc, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 120,"Listed On: Thursday, January 15, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is the new Troy top rail with integrated gas tube. It's similar to an Ultimak top rail/piston tube. However, unlike an Ultimak or other AK top rail systems, it does not need to be clamped or bolted down to the barrel or bottom rail. 

It uses a unique adjustable castle nut retention type method for retaining tension. This allows this to fit on just about every type of AK variant rifle or clone out there.

This one is brand new in box. I ordered this and the Troy long AK bottom rail, only to find that their long bottom rails don't fit certain AKs with the Bulgarian style FSB. Returned the bottom rail and kept this top rail, but deciding to sell it since I've decided to stick with the original Arsenal handguards for the time being due to not running any optics with the AK.

I installed the gas tube rail for fitting and then removed it. Has not had any rounds through it or even had the gas piston cycled through it. It's new in box.

This will fit with just about any lower handguard or rail. This is pretty much a railed gas tube like an Ultimak.

These go for $145 + shipping new online.  Asking $120 for this and will not go lower.  Prefer face to face exchange in OKC area.  Comes in original packaging new."
