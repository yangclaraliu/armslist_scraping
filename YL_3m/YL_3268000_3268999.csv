Upper I bought brand new. It is an AO Precision assembled upper, A3 with M4 style feed ramps. Bolt carrier group is brand new Spikes Tactical, while the charging handle is generic.

Fast twist 1/7 rifling, so 69 grain and up bullets are called for. Lighter bullets are not really designed for the fast twist. Bore and chamber are chrome lined and look gorgeous. Has a VLTOR A2 flash hider, used.

The hand guard is YHM 13"" Diamond Free Float Quad Rail, bought used but pretty spotless. It's got 4 pieces of ladder style rail guards, the endcap, and I've mounted a Tapco vertical front grip.

Here's some highlights:

- The aluminum alloy frame's frontstrap and trigger guard is factory checkered and has a sweeping beavertail at the rear to assure you don't experience slide bite when shooting with an aggressive grip.
- Checkered aluminum grip panels provide a positive grip (manufactured by Hogue for Sig Sauer)
- The 8rd single-stack magazines also reduce the pistol's size for shooters with smaller hands. The P220 feels very similar to a 1911 for both grip angle, circumference, and overall size.
- The barrel is 4.4"", and is not threaded.
- Equipped with adjustable night sights, still bright.
- Factory-equipped with the excellent Sig Short Reset Trigger (SRT) which reduces the amount of trigger reset between shots, providing for a super-fast reset for quicker follow-up shots.
- Sig short reach trigger installed which allows shooters with shorter fingers or smaller hands to easily reach the trigger for proper trigger finger placement, enhancing accuracy.
- Trigger was weighed with a Lyman digital trigger gauge, average of 10 pulls in single action was 5lbs, 5.50z and double action was a smooth 10lbs, 10.5oz 

This is a great pistol to shoot, one of the attached pics shows the first 10 rounds I shot from the P220. I loaded 5 rounds in each mag and decocked the hammer between mags. This was at a measured 7 yards. I'm far from a great pistolero, but this thing is accurate! On top of that, I had no malfunctions with the 100 rounds I fired from it.

The P220 comes with factory case, both 8rd magazines and rear sight wrenches - no user's manual will be provided because the first owner lost it. I estimate approximately 500 rounds have been fired, total. I have detail stripped and inspected/lubed the pistol. Frame rails show no wear, and only the expected wear on the barrel's finish is visible. Pistol is in fantastic condition, shoots great and is reliable. Only selling because I'm moving to a double stack .45ACP which will fit my hands better.

Price is $800 FIRM. Face to face transactions only, buyer must be 21 years of age and will be required to present valid Texas ID at time of sale (CHL preferred). I may travel a short distance to close sale, but no tire kickers, please! I typically do my face to face sales in the parking lot of Academy located at 410/Military or 1604/Potranco."

Only a slight turn line on the cylinder. Lock up and timing are great.
Does'nt look to have been shot much. Probably carried alot by a LEO

Has a NICE set of factory ""Target"" grips.

The grips are beautiful and feel much better than the original rubber grips, but I'm including both, in case you have smaller hands (rubber grips are smaller size).  Ive put less than 100 rounds down the barrel.
Here's some info from Chiappa's site:
The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.Defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort."

For your consideration is a LNIB Ruger SP-101. This has the 2.25'' barrel, stainless finish, and it's chambered in .357 magnum (accepts .38 special ammunition). I bought this gun new locally and have fired 30 rounds through it. It works flawlessly, and I have kept it in immaculate shape. It spent most of its time in my safe; since it's just taking space, I decided it's time to let it go.

You get everything that came with the gun from factory, plus 2 HKS speed loaders with a pouch. 

$525.00 takes it;I will also accept in trade a PAP M92 AK pistol in New/like new condition + cash on your end.

The first one, in the glass case. Gun is housed in special collections divisions in Tulsa and can be viewed by appointment only. Please email for an appointment.
One of the earliest cartridge Colts known to exist and now on the market...having MATCHING Serial number #2004. U.S. Marked. Comes from Lot 2 issued in 1873 This is an EXCEDDINGLY RARE piece of history, Issued to 6th cavalry to fight the Native Americans ""Possibly Little Big Horn"" Custer colt. This gun locks up and indexes perfect and has been tested with blanks. The fact that the barrell was cut to non-standard length is strong evidence it was taken by the Native Americans during a battle and modified as this was the common practice. As well as the holster having a strong Native influence hand made as well as the knife. The handle was checkered likely by a simple knife probably sitting around a camp fire back in the day. Having the badge from 6th cavalary also suggest it was taken by Natives after a kill as this was common to use for trade goods as well as a battle keep-sake to show bravery within the tribe. This gun was used!!! And if it could talk. 
The gun was taken to an expert smith and the screws were replaced during the cleaning and initial repair, but the original screws are now back in the gun. The gun was plum colored from age and after inspection and cleaning was put back to plum to preserve the original color..
The John Kopec letter states the history of this gun with much detail and John Kopec is the worlds leading colt expert having devoted his life to the study of this period colt revolver. 
Comes with period holster and knife and 1876 6th Cavalry badge and 6 period ammo rounds ""One round has an X carved on it"" Also comes with COA. Please feel free to ask any questions. This is a museum piece for the serious collector. Once again, this gun is housed in a special collections division and can be viewed by appointment only.

The rifle has a blue barrel, ramrod, barrel bands, receiver, lock plate, hammer, trigger guard and buttplate. The ""low arch"" breechblock and barrel tang are color casehardened. The black walnut stock is oil finished. The rifle has the late Buffington folding leaf rear sight adjustable for elevation and windage, lock with three-click tumbler and a grooved trigger. The serial number, ""383059"" is stamped of the rear edge of the receiver. ""U.S./MODEL/1884"" is stamped in three lines on the top of the breechblock. ""A"" is stamped on the top of the barrel between the rear sight and the receiver and the Ordnance ""V/P/Eagle Head/P"" proof and inspection marks are stamped on the left side of the barrel. ""R"" (Rifle) is stamped on the top right side of the rear sight leaf. ""US"" is stamped on the top of the buttplate heel. The left side of the stock wrist is stamped with the ""SWP/1887"" Ordnance final inspection mark enclosed in a rectangle. An encircled script ""P"" proof mark is stamped on the underside of the stock behind the trigger guard finial. The rifle retains 98% of the original blue and casehardened finish and shows only very limited storage wear. Nearly all of the blue finish is present on the barrel, barrel bands, receiver, lock plate, hammer and trigger guard. The only significant wear is on the buttplate and a few areas on the barrel bands. The breechblock and tang have vivid case colors. All of the markings on the barrel, breechblock and lock plate are extremely crisp. The stock is near-perfect with un-handled ""feathered"" grain. The Ordnance final inspection mark and proof mark are extremely crisp. This is an outstanding example that is 98% condition and would be very hard to improve upon condition. Included is the sling but not sure how old it is to the rifle. I am open to negotiate and would be except reasonable offers."
