I have not fired this gun, I inherited it and I am selling it in the condition in which I received it. It comes apart fine, the hammer cocks back and releases when you pull the trigger, you can see the firing pin move forward when the hammer hits it, but the trigger seems to be lacking a return spring. I looked it up and the spring can be purchased for $2.90 at Numrich Gun parts (I will include the parts diagram and part number for the spring). It also has an ejector for the shell. Bead front sight. 28"" barrel. Everything appears to be original. Bore is bright and shiny, no pitting or rust inside the barrel.

Now half the size of the previous model, the Subcompact V3 needs less than ¾-inch of Picatinny rail space to easily mount onto even the smallest firearms.

Constructed of T6 aluminum for extra strength and durability, this updated unit offers a smart, cost-effective auto-off feature. If left on for five minutes, the unit begins to display a unique flash for one minute, indicating to the user that the unit will automatically shut off soon. After one minute in flash mode the unit shuts itself off to extend battery life, prevent accidental activation and battery depletion. Press the unit's button at any time to reset this feature for five more minutes.

The Subcompact V3 easily mounts with a hex drive crossbar screw and features windage adjustment, elevation adjustment and programmable constant on and pulse modes. Additionally, the unit is ideal for left- and -right handed shooters with two separate activation buttons located on the backside of the laser. Not only will the laser fit nicely on the smallest of sub-compact railed pistols, it works great on modern rifles as well.

The Subcompact V3 laser is powered by four 377 batteries that provide five hours in constant on mode and ten hours in pulse mode of normal usage. Normal usage is defined as one minute on and one minute off. This test mimics actual usage where the unit is turned on and off and the battery is given time to automatically regenerate.

This gun also has a new GG&G tactical quad rail forearm installed on it. It has a Magpul BUS (back up sight) folding rear sight, and a tactical front grip. Factory furnitures that were originally on the gun (i.e., collapsible stock, pistol grip, handguards, trigger guard) also included. All the parts/accessories are brand new. I like this gun a lot. But I want something else. You must be at least 18 years old, or older and a Kentucky resident with proper ID to buy or trade this gun. Local sale or trade only. Must meet around Lexington/Fayette County. No shipping out of state. Thanks for looking.

$850 for all. Price is firm. No low ball, or BS please. I got way more than $900 invested on the gun and extras. I'm just trying to recoup some of my money back. Will not separate gun, ammo, and the extras."

Daewoo Precision Industries K2 assault rifle was developed by the, South Korean, Agency for Defense Development and manufactured by S&T Motiv (formerly Daewoo Precision Industries). It is currently the standard service rifle of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces. Shoulder-fired and gas-operated, the K2 is capable of firing both 5.56x45mm NATO and .223 Remington ammunition. The K2 supplanted the M16A1assault rifle for the Republic of Korea Armed Forces since its adoption in 1984. 

Comes with a Chinese Norinco 120rd AR-15 or Daewoo drum magazine chambered in .223 or 5.56mm. These were most likely made for the Daewoo series of rifles but will fit any AR-15 rifle. Made just like the standard AK-47 drum magazines, these are durable, easy to load, and can be kept loaded and unwound for many years. The C-Products or cheaper polymer double-snail drums require lubrication and constant maintenance for reliable operation – not these. They will run, and run, and run . . . round after round . . . and almost never fail to fire. These of course were imported well before the Clinton ban (1989 era) and so are “pre-ban” – never to be imported again due to the arms restrictions with China."

303,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3717303,For Sale:  Scilencerco Sparrow .22,"Cold Springs, Reno, Nevada",$ 398,"Listed On: Monday, November 17, 2014",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The 22Sparrow is the first silencer in the world to offer the patented multi part containment (mpc) technology, which allows the 22sparrow to be easily disassembled for cleaning and maintenance after heavy use.
Because the .22 LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time, it
is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue, .22 silencers must be disassembled for cleaning and regular maintenance.
Until SilencerCo introduced the 22Sparrow, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner.

Daewoo Precision Industries K2 assault rifle was developed by the, South Korean, Agency for Defense Development and manufactured by S&T Motiv (formerly Daewoo Precision Industries). It is currently the standard service rifle of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces. Shoulder-fired and gas-operated, the K2 is capable of firing both 5.56x45mm NATO and .223 Remington ammunition. The K2 supplanted the M16A1assault rifle for the Republic of Korea Armed Forces since its adoption in 1984. 

Comes with a Chinese Norinco 120rd AR-15 or Daewoo drum magazine chambered in .223 or 5.56mm. These were most likely made for the Daewoo series of rifles but will fit any AR-15 rifle. Made just like the standard AK-47 drum magazines, these are durable, easy to load, and can be kept loaded and unwound for many years. The C-Products or cheaper polymer double-snail drums require lubrication and constant maintenance for reliable operation – not these. They will run, and run, and run . . . round after round . . . and almost never fail to fire. These of course were imported well before the Clinton ban (1989 era) and so are “pre-ban” – never to be imported again due to the arms restrictions with China."

The SIG SAUER P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy."

This is a Dan Wesson Model 15 built in their Monson facility. It is a 357 mag and can obviously shoot 38 special as well. The serial number on this gun places the build date in the late 70's to early 80's.

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 26 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me.

The quality of pictures are severely reduced when uploaded to armslist so it can make some textures look strange (like on the extended mags.) If you'd like the full size pictures, I can email them to you."

Recently named Shooting Illustrated's ""Rifle of the Year,"" the TAC2 offers a longer sight radius for improved iron sight accuracy. With ""Dissipator"" styling, the TAC2 highlights the flexibility of the AR-15 platform by using a rifle-length gas system on a carbine length barrel. Rifle-length gas systems reduce felt recoil and heat-related wear to critical internal componentry. Most Dissipator configurations use a carbine length gas system with a low profile gas block under the handguard and a non-functional gas block front sight post at the rifle length position. DPMS's engineers increased the size of the gas port 60%, allowing more gas in to the system to compensate for the shorter dwell time, preventing short stroking and ensuring reliability. The location of the front sight post further down the barrel increases sight length to nearly 20"" with the included Magpul BUIS. For iron sight shooting, a dissipator configuration can't be beat.

This rifle features a 16"" Chrome Lined 4150 CMV steel barrel with a 1:9"" twist rate suitable for most commercial ammunition. The rifle length free floating DPMS M111 handguard is comfortable in the hand and boasts a full length top Picatinny rail and modular rail segments for mounting accessories like tactical lights and bipods. The upper and lower receiver are forged 7075-T6 aluminum for exceptional strength and light weight. The upper has M4 feed ramps for flawless chambering and a Picatinny rail flat top for mounting optics, and the lower has a bevelled magazine well for quicker, easier reloads. A Magpul MOE pistol grip and ACS adjustable stock are equipped for comfortable operation"

I build custom gun boxes and cases. I've been building high-end furniture and most lately, multi-media art furniture. Now I've turned my attention to building completely customized handgun, rifle, shotgun, and fishing gear boxes, cases, and display cases.

I have the capabilities to do complete custom CNC and/or hand carving from small images to complete box and case covering scenes. The interior of the box or case will be to your unique specs, as each box and case is its own unique project. 

There are no 'standard' products here. Your project is a stand-alone custom creation of a one-of-a-kind firearm box, case, or display, that you will be proud to pull out, or put on display. 

I also make field boxes and cases for those of you who are shooters and want an upscale, custom box to accompany you in the field.

Email me to chat about your project. Ladies, this is the ultimate guy gift for the active collector or shooter, but remember, these cases take time. I'm a one-man shop and everything is done by hand, to the highest of the artisan qualities of fine art building.

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing your ideas. If you can imagine it, I can make it a reality. (Materials Available: woods and exotic woods, reclaimed woods from the world over, concrete, Italian leathers, felt flocking, steel, brass, and bronze trims and metal works, and lots more.)

The .22 rim fire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our center fire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rim fire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

This was Grandpa's shotgun. Im not sure of the manufacture date or the round count. Pawpaw rarely left his farm so im sure it was mainly used for varmints and home protection. He had it stored in a gun cabinet for decades! This is a good old fashioned 12ga pump with a ridiculously long barrel and a rubber ""Red Head"" buttstock. I really don't know much about it except its similar to a Savage 525(?) from the same era. This gun is ALL metal and wood, the metal needs some rebluing and the wood needs some re-shellacking but its 100% functional and not bad looking either, No major damage to anything. Still has the front bead sight. No chokes. This gun is unique in that it has a tang safety and the bolt locks into the receiver on top. I can throw in about 200rds of birdshot in a ammo can for the asking price. Will send serious buyers pics upon request.

The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

This is a hard to find handgun and a favorite of many!

LE Model with Night Sights! 9mm, comes in factory packaging with all accessories including 3 15 round magazines!

Call Scott at REDACTED to come see it.

MORE INFO:  In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014."

It will allow you to get serious marksmanship practice, or just plinking around, without having to spent tons of money on more expensive ammunition.

The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13"" length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4"" - 14.5"" LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a ten round magazine."""
