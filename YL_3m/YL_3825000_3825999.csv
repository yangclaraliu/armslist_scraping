I removed the rail system and the gun looks better.  It will come with the gun. The rail system is UTG and is one-piece that comes off easily and is made for a mini, as itslides rigth over the front of the barrel/stock.

The serial numbers start with 186-630xxx indicating that this is the model run from 1991-1999 I believe and this gun was made in 97/98.

Take off the stock and the true ""mini"" is in incredible shape.  The first two pics show the internal front and back of the chamber and I couldn't get my camera to take a decent pic of the inside of the barrel but it is bright, shiny and the rifling is great.  The gun shoots perfectly.  The action is smooth and crisp.  The magazine go in tight and crisp and snaps right into place, where I've had other minis that you fought with the darn thing to get it in there.

The barrel and top of the gun are very very clean and the only blemishes on the thing are a couple nicks on the suppressor and the stock has use marks.

This would be a perfect gun to throw an optic on and use as it is or to take off the stock and rails, sell them, and build whatever you want.  I'd put a tactical folding stock on it from tapco or some other brand and just use a regular scope mount with a 3-9x30 myself.  Or one could just put a nice red dot on the upper rail of this setup and go.

$480 and thanks for looking.

Factory Part # S4WSDSCE0003 The SPHINX SDP Subcompact is a lightweight concealed carry, or back up, pistol with design roots from the competition circuit. Carry with ease, draw with confidence, fire with precision. The SPHINX SDP Subcompact Alpha is the smallest and lightest of the SDP line up of pistols. The Subcompact Alpha is the perfect choice for concealed carry, or professional duty use, with an overall weight just under 25oz and an overall height and width at 4.9” and 1.2” respectively. Though the SDP Subcompact Alpha is small in stature it does not sacrifice in quality or performance.Through precision machining and hand fitting by a master gunsmith, the SDP Subcompact Alpha can achieve similar groupings to that of its larger counterpart, the Compact Alpha.The Subcompact Alpha shares more than just high performance figures with the larger pistols in the Alpha line.It also features a steel slide machined from billet.The upper frame, machined from billet aluminum, features full length internal guide rails which provide very smooth slide operation as well as solid barrel lock up.The pistol grip is polymer and textured for maximum ergonomics and grip.The pistol grip is also contoured to offer high hand placement to compliment the low bore axis, which assist the shooter with managing recoil. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side.The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Subcompact Alpha.The white dot front sight is easy to see in contrast to the black rear sight.The competition inspired trigger is very smooth, in both double and single action mode, with a clean break and short, crisp, reset.Every component of the SDP Subcompact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight.Defined by precision, the Subcompact Alpha is the only choice for discerning shooters that demand the utmost in build quality and performance. Magazine Release is reversible.

The Citori is more than a shotgun, it is the quintessential representative of the quality of the Browning brand.

We challenge you to take any Citori from the rack and you’ll see the same high level of fit and finish on every gun. Open and close the action and throw it to your shoulder. Sight down the barrels. Only then will you fully understand why the Citori has gained its reputation as the finest over and under shotgun available in the world. The convenient barrel selector allows the shooter to choose which barrel fires on the first pull of the single trigger, and the second pull fires the remaining barrel.Locking Bolt and Hinge Pin
 The Citori utilizes a transverse-mounted, full-width tapered locking bolt. The tapered locking bolt engages a full-width tapered recess in the rear barrel lugs.Chrome Chambers
 All Citori shotguns feature chrome-plated chambers that resist the toll thousands of shells can take on lesser quality guns. Corrosion resistance is also greatly improved.

Triple Trigger System
 All Sporting Clays, XT and XS Series Citori shotguns come equipped with the Triple Trigger™ system, which allows the shooter to fine tune the length of pull and switch between a wide checkered, a narrow smooth and a wide smooth canted trigger shoe.

Back-Bored Barrels
 12 and 20 gauge Citori shotguns feature Back-Bored Technology.

I'll also throw in a 30 round mag of Remington 55 grain FMJs for zeroing and test fire. As you can see in the photo, many of the mags are still in their original packaging.

I'm asking $1250 for the package, which I believe is quite fair for what a base rifle is selling for on Gunbroker. With the magazines added in this is a pretty good deal. I can do FTF in the E. Tampa/Brandon/Riverview area or ship to your gun shop (add shipping costs for that). FTF will require that you show me proof of Florida residency, or orders for active military personnel."

The 1866 Yellowboy lever-action rifle was a marked improvement over the Henry rifle. It was the first true cowboy lever-action rifle, and the first rifle widely carried in a cowboy-style saddle scabbard. The Yellowboy had a convenient new type of loading gate, devised by Winchester plant superintendent Nelson King. The gate passed cartridges through the side of the receiver. This improvement made the lever action more functional and allowed for the installation of a wooden fore-end. The handy carbine version of the 1866 Yellow boy was a hit worldwide."

The pistol was purchased directly from CGW earlier this fall and has less than 100 rounds through it.  Because it is seeing very little action since I subsequently upgraded my P-01, I've decided this pistol needs a new home.  It comes in the original box with 2 16rd magazines, grip size inserts, original paperwork and CGW upgrade documents.  

Pro Package upgrades include:
* CGW Hammer Kit delivers a crisp SA, short reset, and reduces SA pre-travel
* Short Reset Kit that cuts the SA reset 50% and reduces up to 80% of SA pre-travel
* CGW Ultra-Lite Kit replaces the factory springs and includes our superb 61050 ""Perfection"" firing pin
* CGW oversized DA roller for optimal timing
* Trigger drilled and tapped for single-action over-travel

These combined make the trigger very smooth with a clean break. DA is roughly 7 lbs, SA is only 3.5 lbs. This is a great trigger weight for both self defense and competition.  

You can purchase the same pistol new from CGW for the same price if you’re willing to wait in line 4-6 weeks for CGW to work their magic or you can skip the wait and buy this one.

The bow is made by Jennings when it was owned by Bear Archery. The bow is one of the later generations when they started to improve the quality of the Black Lightning Series. Also, this is one of the rarer ones with a realtree camo dip pattern. According to online forums, this has compression molded glass limbs and are more durable than the older models. The bow is in very good condition. I got this about 10 years ago as a young teenager. I practiced a few times with it, took it hunting (never got a deer with it), and put it in storage until a year ago. Originally, it was at a 24"" pull with 45lb draw weight. Last year, I went back to the place where I bought in Bay City, Michigan (Bay Archery). I am 6'-4"" so I had the draw made to about 36-40"" and 60lbs. There is a lot of versatility if you want a young person being able to use this as they get older. I would say that I have shot it about 100 times. I took it to the bow shop in Grand Rapids and paid to make sure the arrows were coming off the bow straight in the current setup. Has a lot of character and still looks modern.

The Browning Auto-5 was the first mass-produced semi-automatic shotgun. Designed by John Browning in 1898 and patented in 1900,[2] it was produced continually for almost 100 years by several makers with production ending in 1998. It features a distinctive high rear end, earning it the nickname ""Humpback"". The top of the action goes straight back on a level with the barrel before cutting down sharply towards the buttstock

The Browning Auto-5 is a long-recoil operated semi-automatic shotgun. Shells are stored in a tubular magazine under the barrel. When a chambered shell is fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together (for a distance greater than the shell length) and re-cock the hammer. As the barrel returns forward to its initial position the bolt remains behind and thus the spent shell is ejected through a port on the top of the receiver. Then the bolt returns forward and feeds another shell from the magazine into the action. This type of long recoil action was the first of its kind and patented in 1900 by John Browning."

This individual claimed to have an HK P7 pistol for sale. He provided me the address, which no public records were able to verify that this individual resided at the address given. The individual then provided me a utility bill (which was clearly forged, he used a different font, and size to put his name on the bill). The utility company does not provide service anywhere in the state (of the address listed above). the utility bill also had conflicting dates (individual listed the date of 5 NOV 2014, but the bill had meter readings of 2007).
