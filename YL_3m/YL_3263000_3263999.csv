This is chambered in 5.45x39mm.

This was built using a brand new 1985 dated Russian Molot front end (everything from the receiver forward including barrel.) This was built on a 5.45x39mm VEPR receiver in order to get a real Russian receiver. This worked out great and has factory features and spot welds, you just cant get more authentic than that. A military bullet guide was riveted in place and the insanely rare RPKS-74 folding stock was installed. The mix of a laminated buttstock and plum grip and handguards is correct for a 1986 vintage RPKS-74. This has the correct shiny Plum MOLOT grip, good luck finding one of those! This has a brand new cold hammer forged, chrome lined Russian barrel
 It was built by POHF to exacting specifications. The receiver has the correct selector marks and proper factory spot welds. The rifle uses the correct factory rivet pattern and has a paint over park finish, just like the Soviets. This is as accurate clone to a factory rifle as available. Only the receiver was refinished in an effort to keep as much as the factory finish as possible. Comes with one Molot 45 round mag were legal. The 6- US parts are trigger, hammer, sear, floorplate, follower, and Arsenal gas piston."

It's just been sitting on the wall since I got it and is a waste of space. I was going to use it to teach my boy to shoot but he hasn't shown interest.

NOTE: If anyone is interested in a wholesale purchase, I can also include a New Frontier Armory (It's a Tapco T6 just with a New Frontier Armory logo) commercial spec stock for $20 more. I don't want to trade it individually because it's attached to my rifle, but if I can sell all the parts at once, I can buy a new stock."

To buy all this new would be over 700$ on brownells, not including shipping, transfer fees, the lower parts kit or the mag.  Which could easily be well over another 100.  

I bought all this to build a large frame AR in a gunsmithing course at Montgomery community college.  When I got there I was given a good deal on all the same from black rain ordnance. So I have all this for sale.  The upper and charging handle are unused.  The lower was used temporarily while I waited for my black rain lower to transfer.  It and the lpk have maybe 100 rounds shot through them.  The lower parts kit was robbed of some parts after when I assembled my other lower and is not complete, I know it is missing detents and springs and a couple other parts, what you see in the picture is what you get with it.  This would be perfect for someone wanting to build a large frame AR.  I would like 600 trade value or 550$ cash.  

Would prefer cash, but am interested in trades (no black powder, or bows). I will take partial trades

ADDED!!: I will trade for the right browning hi power as well

I will answer any questions and take better pictures to the best of my abilities, let me know

the dark finish has been worn off largely due to the salty conditions of the South Pacific where this pistol saw service during WW2. Bore  is sharp and shiny.the S8 is clear on the left side of the frame.

An interesting thing about this Colt are the cut-outs under the clear plastic-Plexiglas taken from the canopy of a Japanese
Zero aircraft.Each side with pin up girl pictures of the famous artist of the time period  Alberto Vargas. He became famous in the 1940s as the creator of iconic World War II era pin-ups for Esquire magazine known as ""Vargas Girls."" The nose art of many World War II aircraft was adapted from these Esquire pin-ups.  .
Some of these 1918 era 1911's were reissued during the Second World War, some came home after the first war.

Now they list what firearms they have along with the dealer cost and say before ordering negotiate a price with your dealer.
 They are a reputable company that I used when I had a home based FFL a few years ago.
A lot of the AK's and used glocks listed on armslist probably come from there.
Those $500 glocks listed on here go for $350-$400 there.

OK, I am sure you mean well but I went to this website, they are selling USED, TURNED IN firearms not like new or new with box that are on here.  I picked the most popular Glock, the 19 and here is there information on it

""Glock Model 19 9MM Night Sights 
Product Description:
.Glock model 19 in 9mm caliber. Night sights. Comes with 1-15rd magazine. Good to Very Good condition"" for 369.95 sounds like a deal right???  well it comes with NO BOX, 1 MAG so if a person on here has a LNIB or NEW UNFIRED FOR 500 that is coming with everything as new this 369.95 IS NOT such a GOOD DEAL.  You have to pay at least 10 for shipping, another 15-25 for a transfer fee, sales tax and it does say contact your dealer for pricing too.  This could mean that in order to get it for 369.95 your dealer may have to buy 5-10-15 of them.  SO by the time you add it up and pay for an extra mag and box the 500 LNIB or NEW UNFIRED on here from an average JOE doesn't seem like such a bad deal.  

I'm growing sick and tired of others trying to regulate pricing on this site.  If a person pays 600 for a new glock and post it on here for 500-550 so he doesn't take an ass beating so what.  IF someone wants to pay that for it SO WHAT.  WHY?? is it anyone else's concern other than who is selling and who is willing to buy.  I mean really??  IF the price is too high the person selling will eventually realize it and lower it or just keep it.  WHY is it anyone else's business what the hell they do?  THIS is the exact problem with society as a whole, always worried about shit that is not their direct business.  Same deal with over priced ammo.  IF Johnny wants to hit walmarts in the am and get 22 lr and then post it on here, WHO GIVES A SHIT?  Johnny has taken his time, gas and effort to roll his ass out of bed, go to the stores and buy it.  IF he wants to TRY to sell it for a profit and someone wants to BUY it for what he is selling it for, why would I give two shits.  YOU people who want to ""police"" this website are just making an ass out of yourself and hurting everyone.  I think we are all smart enough to figure out what something is or is not worth to them.  IF we are not then guess we will over pay and learn from it.  GEEZZ  I didn't think LIBERALS liked guns but some of you on here with wanting to police this as if we don't know any better are using plays from the LIBERAL LOGIC PLAYBOOK.

AND SPEAKING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
 ALL OF US do NOT have the ability to purchase with an LE discount so WE the average person pays retail plus tax.  IF we want to take such bull shit offers (from those who like to point out that they can buy with their LE discount) we would go to MONEY MAN and save ourselves the hassle of meeting and making a sale.   I mean why would you even buy my used on if you can use your LE discount to buy a new one?  WAIT>>>> to resell and you make the buck....

in closing if you think its too much just keep looking and stop trying to police this website"

(This can be done without a bow press). By turning the limb bolts in or out to align the limb with the marks on the bow.
This is older bow and does have some scratches but overall it seems to be a good, solid bow, and comes with nocking points and a new roller rest installed.  

REEL: I was in the process of making a fishing rig out of this bow so there is also a Browning ""tape on ""fishing reel’(all metal no plastic) and two fishing points. The line on the reel has never been in water, and there is about half a spool of line left (kind of forgot the poundage on the line, but its ether 100 or 120 lb. test). 

The stabilizer in the photos is for target shooting, I have removed the ball from the end and I’m in the process of making a bracket for the fishing reel to be a bolt on. If not completed when sold I will relay instructions to finish.

ARROW: A fishing arrow will start at around 4 dollars and go up, depending on what you want. If you ad reflective tape to the end add another 3 or 4 dollars to each arrow.
I’m on a budget so I use the $2.00 solid fiberglass rods “Lowes” sales as drive way stakes. These stakes are 5/16 in diameter, 48 inches long with a 5 inch long reflective sticker.
I use the end with the reflective sticker for my noc and after cutting the rod to length, epoxy the fishing point to the other end. I’m old school, I still drill a hole through the point (after it’s glued on) and run my line through the point and arrow. But a safety slide made for a 5/16 arrow will fit.

CASE: Then there is a camo soft case made by Kolpin, to carry & store the bow and equipment in........ For the time being I have put the loose parts in a zip-lock bag

Here's how it works:

You provide the land or property (must have a solid backstop, and be big enough to safely have 6 people on the shooting line at once - I will need to see the land before officially booking the date of course). You also provide the group - this can be anything from 20 people, to just a husband/wife that want to get some training without having a lot of strangers shooting right next to them. $75/person for the class. If you get a group of 6 OR MORE - YOUR class is free ($75 for everyone else). Class times will vary but plan for a 4-hour time-frame (if we run longer, there are no extra fees).

What you need:
1) Land with a solid backstop (could be a ridge, hill, large hay bails, dirt mounds, etc.)
2) Handgun of your choice and 500 rounds of ammo (may not shoot it all)
3) A date in mind with a 4 or 6 hours window (Saturday's work best)
4) A group of people (men or women) that want to invest in good, defensive training
5) An open mind

That's it. You don't need lots of experience. This can be very laid back and simple, or could be more advanced if that's what you decide - I tailor the course to you. I bring the targets and all training materials not listed above. I can schedule on your time (as long as the date is open).

 USP Tactical
 Enhanced versions of the USP, the USP Tactical models are designed for users who need the features found on the HK Mark 23, but in a more compact pistol. Both pistols approach the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel with a rubber O-ring, adjustable trigger, and adjustable target-type sights.
 The .45 ACP model of the USP Tactical is constructed on the USP45 frame. The 9 mm and .40 S&W Tactical models are built on the USP 9mm/40 caliber frame. The 9 mm variant, known as the USP9 SD, has a slightly different set of features.
 Features & System Characteristics:
•Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profile (no O-ring barrel on 9 mm variants)
•High profile target sights 
•Match grade trigger (not present on 9 mm variant)
•Adjustable trigger stop (not present on 9 mm variant)

This is a good working collectible!

The Multipax was offered by Reloading Specialties for about 5 years or so, right after steel shot became mandatory. It has two four inch tubs mounted on a stand. Each tub holds about 3lbs of shot. The two tub design was to make loading duplex loads easier. These tubs are fittled with adjustable disks in the bottom with holes in them. They are adjustable in the amount of holes that each hold one pellet. They have a crank handle on top and a spout on the bottom for dropping a charge of shot. Each 360 degree turn of the crank drops a given number of pellets. You can get a consistant number of pellets dropped with each crank. The disks that come with it each have different size holes to allow fitment of #4 thru T size steel shot.
When loading a 1 1/2oz load of #1 steel, it takes three cranks of the handle dropping 51 pellets each crank. It is very accurate and smooth operation using good quality polished steel shot. Dark colored, unpolished shot will cause hangups with the Multipax.

Description: This bullpup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition. The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG.

The gun was used as a carry gun and has very few rounds through it. The finish is an 85 out of 100. Other than that, she runs great and works as intended. If you are worried about the finish, just get it cerakoted for like $100.00 to have a professional to do it or just do it your self for like $60.00. I haven't bothered to do so because I like the look of it and don't care for a flashy gun. Would make a great home defense gun or carry gun if you wanted to.

Kimber Custom Covert 2 (Full size model)
Original night sights (Still glow very bright)

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components. The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” type rail system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled. Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. The MR762A1 uses the same 10- and 20-round translucent polymer box magazines made for the HK417; a 5-round magazine is also under development. MR762A1 rifles are well-suited for a variety of applications including law enforcement tactical, police patrol, general sporting, and hunting (a 5-round magazine is under development).

( The “C” stands for “Constant Action.” Having seen the overwhelming popularity of the light-stroke double action only (DAO) trigger systems of Sig Sauer (DAK) and Heckler & Koch (LEM), Beretta wisely chose to come up with their own. The Constant Action gives 
the Px4C only one trigger pull. Shot to shot, it is relatively light and not terribly long, the pull length measuring a very manageable 0.472″.)

 Beretta JXF9C21 PX4 Storm 9mm 4"" 17+1. 
 The Px4 is built around a modular concept so these pistols can be adapted to different needs. 
 The Px4 features an exclusive, Beretta-designed locked breech with rotating barrel system, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. 
 Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning and feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. 
 The light frame employs a durable fiberglass-reinforced polymer with a milstd-1913 picatinny rail and a modular grip system for a custom fit. 
 The magazine release button is reversible. 
 The Bruniton non-reflective black coating offers superior resistance against corrosion and wear.
