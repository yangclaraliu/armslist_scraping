******************BUSHMASTER Patrolman AR15 Rifle Specifics:*********************

Patrolman AR15 M4 Carbine, .223/5.56 16"" W/Detachable Carry Handle, Telescoping Stock, Black Finish 30 Round Mag
Chrome lined barrel and chamber. Features A2 bird cage style suppressor. A3 type removable carry handle features 1 MOA elevation and 1/2 MOA windage adjustments. Picatinny type rail base. Flat-top upper receiver. Non-reflective mil spec hard anodized aluminum receiver. Six-position telestock. Shipped with 30 round magazine, carrying sling, chamber flag and operator's manual.

One of our ALL TIME BEST Carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive Military Barrel Profile and Six Position Telestock – great for 3 Gun Match Shooting, Home Defense and Law Enforcement use.

The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel).

The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. 

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling. 

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. 

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs. 

You must be of legal age and a Washington resident. I will only meet locally here in the Lacey area for transaction and you must have $1,100 cash only.

Thank you and have a great day !!!"

Excellent + barrel. Not counterbored barrel. This rifle has NO bayonet lug and, as such, does NOT counts as an assault weapon in many liberal occupied and infested cities and states as it can neither accept a detachable mag, nor does it have a bayonet lug. I NEVER fired this rifle. Selling it to get funds for another rifle. I ship it to your FFL or we can do Face to Face (I am in Deerfield, IL). If we do F2F - you don't pay shipping. Do not be fooled. Reloading SKS with stripper clips is MUCH faster then changing a mag. Great rifle needs a new loving home. Two of similar rifles are on gunbroker for $499+ shipping.

All original components are here, along with 25 stripper clips, a 30 round SKS magazine, 40 rounds of steel case ammo, a nice woven sling, front sight adjustment tool, a nice butt pad, and a Plano hard case. 

The gun operates flawlessly.  Very solid. Recoil is almost as light as an AR chambered in .223. Exceptional shooter.

I decided also to open up to trades plus cash, but be aware that the trade value should be higher than a straight cash value.  You must include at least $200 cash with your trade offer of another gun, and it needs to be something I can resell easily.  Do not offer me a gun as a straight trade, and do not offer me a trade with less than $200 cash as part of it.

The action has been trued by one of the best in the business, Bob Brackney. Bob was a fan of the 40X since it's inception and dedicated his efforts to perfecting an already superior design.

The action was trued, as well as the bolt face and the lugs lapped to produce a silky smooth motion that locks up precisely every time and a Sake extractor installed. The action is single shot, solid bottom, no magazine cutout for the best rigidity.

The barrel was chambered and fitted by 300 yard World record holder benchrest shooter Gary O'cock. He started with a Shilen match grade barrel and used his personal 6 PPC reamer to chamber it and then fitted the barrel to my 40X action.

Soon after the gun was built I left Phoenix and the awesome shooting scene there. As a result the new barrel has never been fired.

Also included is a Jewell 2oz trigger and McMillan benchrest stock ready to paint in the color of your choice.

If you are looking to get into the benchrest game or want  a precision varmint rifle that will place one bullet on top of the next, this is your chance.

Cash is preferred but I may consider a trade or partial trade for a Colt AR6721 or other good quality AR15. Prefer 1 in 9 twist, 16-18"" barrel.

The Crew Cab can be collapsed into a compact daypack or expanded for three to four day backpack hunts. The Crew Cab's integrated expandable platform area is perfect for hauling Mystery Ranch Load Cells, Pelican cases, shed antlers, weed control sprayers, entire antelope, or even multiple elk quarters. When fully compressed, the Crew Cab is a low profile 1900 cu. inches that will not interfere with active motion. Fully expanded, the Crew Cab can reach the equivalent of a 5000 cu. pack. For Backcountry Hunters and anyone looking for a system that can do it all, this is your pack."

The SD variant of the Beretta PX4 Storm is the result of the U.S. military’s Joint Combat Pistol program of 2005. The premise behind this program was to replace the aging stock of M9 pistols currently in use with U.S. armed forces with a superior weapon. It stipulated that thye weapon be chambered in .45 ACP, more resistant to salt spray be capable of mounting a sound suppressor and be capable of firing 5,000 rounds without failure. Furthermore, the replacement pistol should have a grip no larger than the standard M9, feature a low-glare finish and ideally be in FDE.

 The semi-auto hunting rifles VEPR SUPER are designed for medium-sized and big games. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). VEPR SUPER's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and either a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver or fixing bases for a top scope mount. VEPR SUPER comes with a fluted barrel for reducing the rifle weight and improving cooling ability. All VEPR SUPER rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual. MOLOT Factory produces VEPR SUPER (SUPER VEPR) rifles in the following configurations: VEPR SUPER 223 Rem, VEPR SUPER 308 Win"

These are getting harder to come by. Not nearly as common as your civillian marketed zastava n-paps or o-pap underfolders.

This one has the original wood, as well as the reputable US made D.C. Industries thick 1.5mm rpk style receiver with bulged trunnions particular to the B1 and B2 O-PAP. Also the high quality american made 4140 steel green mountain barrel. Built like a tank. Runs like a top. I have put about 500 rounds through it and the original owner didnt shoot it much at all. 

Very accurate. High quality AK. Definitely a big step up from your standard WASR, and if you do the research you will find these earlier Century imports have a great reputation for being solid and accurate. SN# is in the high 4000s.

I kept it pretty basic but have added a couple nice upgrades. You get a tapco slotted muzzle brake, as well Hogue grips/yugo specific handguards(about a month old) so your rifle is ready for a foregrip/whatever else. of course you get the original wood handgaurds as well.  Also have 3 nice steel mags with it. That's about $100 in accessories if you assume most AK's come with 1 mag. Also the wood is left untreated can easily be cleaned up/refinished without having to strip it. 

I travel between Cleveland - Akron - Youngstown for work. Price is pretty firm, no lowballers please, but I will consider all reasonable offers. i'm not pressed to sell it at all. Hate to see it go. Just want to put some money towards my AR or an SVD.

She had a blast, literally and figuratively.  I had borrowed a Sig 239 from a buddy and she shot it well.  She wanted her own gun.  I couldn't afford a $700+ Sig.  I bought her this Taurus.  I shoot a .40 so I thought the two of us having one common ammunition would be economical.  I've taken her to shoot it twice, about 100 rds each time.  She hates the recoil.  After the first time I thought I could talk her out of the recoil fear but she's still pushing shits down and says she wants something with less ""kick.""  

I admit I wasn't very thoughtful in my buying decision.  It's a great little gun.  It shoots well.  It's well made, nice looking and has had no failures.  It has 2- 10rd mags. I'm looking to trade it for something softer shooting.  I'm thinking 9mm but I'm open to here what sorts of trades anyone is interested in.  For the right trade I'll be willing to add cash.  I have about $350 in the gun so please don't try and trade a raven or high point or any other junk guns."

Bought it new earlier this week, and its only had 50 rounds through it, will come with its case, mag loader, and two 11 round magazines. These are solid steel CZ75 clones if you aren't familiar with them, uses CZ pattern mags and can be carried cocked and locked or hammer down. The .40 caliber C-100 is hard to find here in the states and was only released here recently. Functions well but I didn't like it like I thought I would.

I'd be interested in trading it for a different mid sized .40 or one of the police trade in Glock 22's that have flooded the market lately. I just bought an engagement ring for my girlfriend so I have no cash to add to a trade, so looking for an even trade only. Really only interested in .40's but would still consider 9mm's.

It took me 30 years to find one that was not union made, but I finally got mine.  I am not necessarily new to the 1911 as I used one often while on active duty, however, I am not as knowledgeable as others on this model.  It seems there is much discussion on the Series '70 versus Series '80, plastic in the 1911 models, collet bushing versus solid, and so on.  I also own two Ruger SR1911 CMD pistols (to which I can attest are ALL METAL except for the grips.)  The ""oddest"" thing I noticed about my Gold Cup is the guide rod.  It is a spring loaded two piece (metal) unit that is 2 1/8 inches long and depresses to just under 2 inches.  It also has a plastic MSH which surprised me.

I have fired about 100 rounds through the GCNM, 230GR FMJ Ball and JHP.  All fed, fired, and cycled flawlessly.  Some may say ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"" but here are my questions anyway:

1.  What is the intended purpose of this style guide rod and is it factory stock?
2.  Would I be better served installing a regular GI style guide rod?
3.  Would I be better served installing a solid bushing?  
(I know the intended purpose of the colleted bushing and supposedly they are prone to breakage.)

The only thing I have done to date is remove the idiot scratch and other nicks, install custom grips, and install a new recoil spring (which I do to all used guns upon acquisition and annually thereafter.)  This is my first project gun and although I do not want to ""trick it out"" or make it a pimp gun by adding curb feelers, I do want to make it as sweet a shooter as possible.  Presently it just does not feel as good as my Ruger models when I squeeze off rounds (and it's more than just the three quarter inch difference in length.)

Thanks from an old Crusty Retired Navy Chief."
