They are the standard ones you find at any gun shop.  All 10 for $110 or $15 individually. Clean, simple, to the point. They are in perfect condition. Great gift idea for any occasion. Ladies, did you by chance bug your man just a little too much and want to put a smile on his face. Nothing says I'm sorry quite like a military style manly ass metal ammo can filled with any number of other awesome items. Maybe you put some sort of bedroom play kit in it, maybe ammo, fill it with M&M's. All I know is that once you put something inside these cans and give it to whom ever, you are going to be a winner. FELLAS!!! Same goes for you. Perhaps you and your brohammer had a small..... tiff. Even if you gave him one of these bad boys (btw, it holds beer too) i can promise that all will be forgotten.  Heck,  Christmas is upon us. Want to have the manliest tree on the block. Stack these bad boys up as shown in the picture. Maybe dangle some beer cans off it and top it with a bottle of nice Irish Whiskey. Dang I am feeling super patriotic just thinking about this Second Ammendment Tree. Guess what my friend. If you have made it this far into this reading material and have not already called to get your Merica Tree, i can only assume it is because you are purchasing for that special lady in your life. Check this out. These cans...... are freaking paintable. Simply go to your local Tagger Store to pick up the finest can of her favorite color, then find a nice area outside that is well ventilated and spray (be ready for over spray to get on things in the area. Hate to see that brand new Truck speckled in Stripper Pink) . Is someone into crafting of any kind. Bet ya all that crafting stuff fits inside one of these fine cans. Having a big family get together and need a bunch of serving bowls. Yup, you guessed it. With the proper application of some sealant to the inside, not only will you be able to put ammo in these, but you can put food in it. Nothing screams American more than Weapons and Food. Now you have that perfect balance to serve up food, justice..... and freedom.  Feel free to call or text me. REDACTED

""The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."""

The rest is Springfield's description...
The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® redefines what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition.

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place."

In searching for information on this shotgun, everyone who owns one says it is their go to gun for general hunting.  quotes such as "":D You have a good field shotgun there. I have shotguns that I paid several months wages for, but enjoy shooting a JC Higgins 101.7 in 16 gauge as much as I do the pedigree guns. It is nothing more than a Stevens 311, and a rock solid gun that has never given me trouble. I paid $160.00 for the gun and consider it one of my great bargains.""

In researching this shotgun we believe the gun was made in the late 60's time frame as they started putting screw in chokes in, in 1970 and this gun does not have screw in chokes.  The lockup is still very tight, and both barrels are in immaculate condition.

Upon activating the lever, the breech block pivots, or swings down to expose the chamber.
These firearms evolved basically with many internal running changes happening over the time span that the guns were in production.  This article is not meant to be the BIBLE, in that many times if something is printed, there may later be some gun show up to prove us wrong.  So, you will see words like appears, may, could, possibly, assumed, etc. used frequently in this article.
There appear to be basically 4 main different versions of the Favorite, the 1889, 1894, 1915, & the 418 with other sub variations made at the productions start & then again at the end.  These older Favorite series had a total of 4 different versions of extractors.  Most guns were made in either 22RF, while 25RF or 32RF calibers were offered.

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 26 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me.

The quality of pictures are severely reduced when uploaded to armslist so it can make some textures look strange (like on the extended mags.) If you'd like the full size pictures, I can email them to you."

The Model 700 was introduced by Remington in 1962 and has since been expanded to include more than 30 sub-models. What makes the VTR unique to the 700 family is that it has a vented fore-end and a triangular barrel.

Ideally the a triangular barrel is supposed to balance tension and compression in turn allow the projectile to travel smoothly through the bore. It is said that a triangular barrel is, in fact, more accurate than a round barrel, however, the industry standard is round, so everything else like the stock and bedding are designed for a round barrel.

Remington says the Model 700’s action forms “three rings of steel,” meaning it uses a push-feed action where the bolt pushes the round towards the chamber and the extractor does not grab the rim of the cartridge until the bolt is completely forward and locked. It doesn’t affect the smoothness of the action, but does cater to one’s preference. Some prefer the push-feed action over a control-round feed action (which does the opposite). Also, according to Remington, the Model 700’s receiver was milled from a single piece of steel, so it’ll be more resistant to wear overtime than those not milled from a single piece of steel. A durable receiver is necessary especially when absorbing the force of the initial explosion that sets off heavier loads.

The Model 700 VTR features a 22″ blued carbon steel barrel with an integral muzzle break that helps decrease recoil and muzzle jump. The synthetic stock is finished in Desert Recon Digital Desert camouflage, and includes black overmold grips similar to those found in XCR models. The overmold grips are made of soft rubber and are intended to provide comfort and help the shooter maintain positive control when absorbing harsh recoil.

Remington recommends the VTR Desert Recon for general varmint/tactical applications."

Overview:

The Remington Model 700,™ a rifle with no equal, and a superior performer in every way. Its accuracy and dependability have become the standard by which all other centerfire rifles are measured and continually fall short. Still the most accurate out-of-the-box rifle made, the Model 700 brings its famous action and renowned consistency to this diverse family of guns. All are newly equipped with our externally adjustable X-Mark Pro trigger system.

Visit the NEW Remington 700 Network website  

The Model 700 BDL has been the hunter's favorite for 40 years because its strong, smooth action, consistent accuracy, and classic beauty make it an unequaled value. Its high-gloss American walnut stock is enhanced by a distinctive black fore-end cap, Monte Carlo comb with raised cheekpiece, and generous skipline cut checkering. Metalwork has our rich, deep bluing for beauty and protection. The Model 700 BDL features a hinged magazine floorplate, sling swivel studs, hooded ramp front sight, and adjustable rear sight.

Key Features:
Receiver machined from solid-steel bar stock resulting in uniformity and strength 
Cylindrical receiver design provides a solid bedding area in the stock for consistent shot placement 
Recessed bolt face locks up inside the counter-bored breech of the barrel which is surrounded by the receiver, forming “threerings-of-steel” enclosing the cartridge case head for unparalleled strength 
Integral extractor is set in a groove inside the rim of the bolt face, uniformly supporting the cartridge head 
X-Mark Pro™ Trigger – featuring super-tight tolerances and mirror-like surface finishes, it breaks like glass and is adjustable for trigger pull weight"

I put the """" because that's subjective to who you ask or what you read on the internet! 

But seriously, this is the AKT-98 that was, supposedly, imported in limited quantities. It is the predecessor to the WASR-22. Full blown AK in size, furniture, controls, etc, except the barrel, bolt/carrier, recoil spring, and mag. Actually, I have one metal mag that seems to have once been a 7.62x39 mag that was converted! Even the gas tube is ""regular"" AK, but obviously the barrel isn't ported. 

I've had this gun for sometime and gotten it to function 98%. The extractor is there and works flawlessly, in contrast to a lot of the reviews and experience you'll find googling this little brat. The few little issues exist when feeding hollow points. I have 5 30 round, smoke colored, Black Dog mags to go with it as well.


I'm only looking to trade at this time. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm open to hunting rifles. Big caliber is preferred. Please know in advance that I will be picky. Any other guns will be of interest too, so feel free to let me know what you have. Trade value including the mags is the same as my listed ""price"", $450. 

It's the rifle on the left, obviously!

While not actually in the films, the Walther LP-53 was used for all but the first James Bond movies staring Sean Connery in posters and other promo art starting with “From Russia with Love” and stands out with its odd style and long, thin barrel.

The LP-53 would later be re-used for making the posters for “Goldfinger,” “Thunderball” and “You Only Live Twice” before George Lazenby stepped into the role of 007 in “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.” (Connery reprized the role of Bond for “Diamonds Are Forever” but left the LP-53 behind.)

In reality, the Walther LP-53 is an air pistol, a single shot .177-caliber (4.5mm) pellet gun. How it became one of the most treasured James Bond icons is just odd luck.

LWRC description:
The IC Enhanced rifle uses our Cold Hammer Forged barrels. They include a two position gas block, with a bayonet lug, that can be switched between suppressed and non-suppressed modes. This feature enables the user to restrict the gas flow to the piston system, allowing the rifle to run smoothly and compensate for the added back pressure resulting from running a suppressor. We complete the upper with our modular rail in a nine inch length. This handguard utilizes individual rail sections that allow the owner to place accessory rails where they are needed while retaining the slick, low profile nature of the rest of the handguard."
