The frame has been blued nicely and the swamp scenes are visible. The stocks have a nice finish and the butt plate is correct for the model. 
The barrels retain a lot of bluing, have a few very small nicks and freckling (no dents). The bores are shiny and clean. The gun shoots.
There is a small chip out of the left front of the butt stock. This will not affect the shootability.

2 Magazines, one older and one new.
It has some ware over the past years. I knew that when I purchased it and it did not make any difference in the accuracy as it has one small scratch on one side of the stock.
The rifle was purchased in January of 2014. The rifle with a scope is too heavy for me to carry and that’s the only reason it’s up for sale. It’s fine hunting gun, very accurate. My 60lb Wild Boar, shot in the brain pocket, as he was running at about 35 yards, worked just fine for me!

My nephews outgrew it and are ready for something bigger. This is just the right size for a youngster, with a shortened stock and comb reduced for smaller hands. It's heavy enough to earn their respect and tame the recoil, but not so much that they'll have trouble handling it.

Includes synthetic sling with Uncle Mike's quick release on one end. Nice wood stock and fore end with some light handling marks. White outline buttplate. Thumbsaver installed on the hammer makes it easier and more comfortable to handle. Transfer bar and hammer block manual safeties. Changing barrels is simply a matter of unscrewing the front sling swivel to remove the forearm.

Both barrels are in excellent condition, near-100% finish on the outside and bright and clean on the inside. The shotgun barrel is a 22"" 20 gauge 3"" modified choke with a front bead. The rifle barrel is a 18½"" .22 LR, so of course it could also be used for .22 L or .22 S – very handy for a new shooter. It has removable standard front blade and rear notch sights installed, but is also drilled and tapped for a scope mount.

Here's the info from the Rossi web site:

The youth size Rossi Matched Pair makes the perfect first gun for teaching that young hunter in your life how to safely shoot and hunt. All offer a smaller stock and barrel to ensure that the first time out is a pleasant experience. Single shot has long been recognized as the best teaching firearm for young shooters and Rossi adds in transfer bar technology to help prevent accidental discharges as well as a manual safety. Blued 18-1/2"" .22 LR rifle barrel and 22"" 20 gauge shotgun barrel. Wood stock."

Made in Italy. Italian police department trade-ins. Overall good to very good condition. Some holster wear but otherwise great condition. All are excellent shooters. ICN #1880, 1881 & 1883 History: In order to meet requirements of some law enforcement agencies, Beretta modified the Beretta Model 92 by adding a slide-mounted combined safety and decocking lever, replacing the frame mounted manual thumb safety. This resulted in the 92S which was adopted by several Italian law enforcement and military units. The later relocation of the magazine release button means these models (92 & 92S) cannot necessarily use later magazines, unless they have notches in both areas. Beretta 92FS magazines will work in this gun, however make sure the lower notch is present. USED - Beretta 92S Semi-Auto 9mm Pistol"

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 26 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me.

The quality of pictures are severely reduced when uploaded to armslist so it can make some textures look strange (like on the extended mags.) If you'd like the full size pictures, I can email them to you."

My nephews outgrew it and are ready for something bigger. This is just the right size for a youngster, with a shortened stock and comb reduced for smaller hands. It's heavy enough to earn their respect and tame the recoil, but not so much that they'll have trouble handling it.

Includes synthetic sling with Uncle Mike's quick release on one end. Nice wood stock and fore end with some light handling marks. White outline buttplate. Thumbsaver installed on the hammer makes it easier and more comfortable to handle. Transfer bar and hammer block manual safeties. Changing barrels is simply a matter of unscrewing the front sling swivel to remove the forearm.

Both barrels are in excellent condition, near-100% finish on the outside and bright and clean on the inside. The shotgun barrel is a 22"" 20 gauge 3"" modified choke with a front bead. The rifle barrel is a 18½"" .22 LR, so of course it could also be used for .22 L or .22 S – very handy for a new shooter. It has removable standard front post and rear notch sights installed, but is also drilled and tapped for a scope mount.

All offer a smaller stock and barrel to ensure that the first time out is a pleasant experience. Single shot has long been recognized as the best teaching firearm for young shooters and Rossi adds in transfer bar technology to help prevent accidental discharges as well as a manual safety.

If you offer a trade, then follow through, and if you have to ask your wife then don't waste my time. Serious offers only. I'm not here for games,go to craigslist for that.
Thanks and God Bless!"

The Bushmaster A3 Patrolman's Carbine is modeled after their U.S. Military and law-enforcement utilized M4 Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individuals. The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. calibered 16-inch barrel is chrome-lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a ""birdcage"" type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The stock, pistol grip, and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters.

889,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3734889,For Sale/Trade:  12 Gauge 1 oz Slugs. Really. They're Free.,"London or Delaware, Columbus, Ohio",$ 0,"Listed On: Sunday, November 30, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I don't have a slug gun. I never have time to hunt deer during gun week. I only ever shot one animal with a slug.  I loaded a slug into the chamber by mistake and took a shot at a rabbit.  

I don't know what happened to the boxes or the 10th round.  I am giving these items away in the hope that somebody will harvest some deer with them this (or next) season.  It isn't need based.  They're something that takes up room and gets in the way.  I keep having to move them.  I would rather move them into someone's possession who is going to put them to good use.

Update: I found the 10th round.  This is now an offer of 2 boxes worth of FREE 12 gauge slugs.  Just drop me a note.  

I ask that anybody who responds is legal to own firearms and can legally be in possession of ammunition.  If you look under age, I'll want to see your picture ID (just the photo and birth date).

I have 
5 Winchester Super-X 2 3/4"" 1 oz hollow point slugs
and 
5 Federal Maximum HI-Shok 2 3/4"" hollow point slugs (they don't state 1 oz, but I weighed 
them on a digital scale and they register the same as the Winchesters)

I don't remember if they're rifled slugs (for a smooth barrel) or smooth slugs (for a rifled barrel).

They're free if you want them.  I will accept 1 appointment per day to meet and give you the ammo.  (I am doing this so nobody is on their way to get these when I am meeting someone else for the same purpose. In other words, I don't want anybody to waste a trip).

If you feel like trading me something, feel free.  I shoot 9mm (and will begin reloading soon), so a little brass would be nice. a box of .22 lr is always welcome (I have kids who like to go plinkin'. Then again, aren't we all just big kids who like to go plinkin'?).  As these are not worth a lot, I wouldn't ask for more.  You don't have to have something to trade in order to receive these.  It's strictly First Come, First Served.  

As these things are free, I'm not inclined to drive to a meeting with you, but if you live between London & Delaware, I drive that route twice a day, so I can make a stop or a brief detour pretty easily.  I am at home, in London, today and I will be at work in Delaware tomorrow.  If you're going to be one of those two places, it's free ammo.  If I don't get a response by the end of gun week, I'll cut them open and put the projectiles in the smelting pot.  It just seems a bit of a waste, if somebody could use them.

I am always in the market for pistol and shotgun powder and shot. I will begin reloading metallic rifle cartridges soon, too.  If you have any supplies for those endeavors, I'd like to discuss prices for those items with you."

Here's the deal: I have a Glock 35 stuck in a Pawn Shop here in Hillsboro. Gun details are: Glock 35, the coloring is O.D. Green and Black, it's in Like New and Excellent condition, this Glock 35 has an expensive Crimson Trace Laser Grip that fits like a glove and makes your grip feel so much stronger plus the laser is an excellent way to improve your accuracy, it has a flashlight and laser combination attached to the accessory rail which gives you the ability to put two laser beads on your target at the same time and gives you a much better impression of were your shot will hit, it has professionally installed Tridium Night Sights also and those of course are also after-market, I have 6 Hi-Cap magazines for it also. Here's the catch, it's in a Pawn Shop and will cost $490 dollars just to get out of hawk. Of course I'm doing this to make a little cash today and I am available to get this done as soon as possible. The value of this gun has been appraised by an insurance company at $1,100 bucks, so please make me an offer that is reasonable, since it costs $490 just to get out of the Shop please make an offer for this handgun and the price to get it out of hawk will be deducted from the sale price, which will not leave me with very much money but I need whatever I can get. I almost forgot, it also comes with another barrel that you can swap out and turn the .40cal into a 9mm. So tell me what you're willing to give me after the $490 to get it out. It's a unique and accurate tricked out handgun that I gurantee you won't find one like this (with all it's after-market parts) anywhere else. This gun is close to $600 brand new without any of the badass accessories on it that cost me hundreds of dollars to equip it with."

I have added a UTG pro rail with tactical style rings and a 3x9x40 Nicon scope with the BDC reticle. Included in the sale is everything in the pic. I have two 20rd Tapco mags and on 30rd steel mag. I have all of the original parts as well that will come with it. I used a Dremel tool to cleanly remove the bayonet. I did this because I don't see and need for a bayonet and it reduced the weight. I will include a box of 20rds to get you started.

I have mainly used this rifle for coyotes and hogs.. It is very accurate and reliable. I do not need to sell it but I just bought a new bolt rifle and don't use it near as much as I used to. Before I buy a new pistol I wanted to see what was out there. My price is $500 firm. I have over $650 invested. I can send more detailed pics on request.

Thanks for looking!"
