*****KYDEX IWB HOLSTER IS EXTRA $$$$$*****

I was offered a  job in FL and I will be moving there. I am only licensed in MA for weapons so I cannot bring them with me. I can't transfer them to myself through a dealer because I do not have an LTC for FL. So my only option is to sell them before I leave the state. 

Asking $500 for the gun, it isn't too much as the gun performs excellent in every way, no jams or anything that would prevent it from being used as a conceal carry. This was and still is my Conceal carry weapon for now. The gun without the Kydex Holster is $500. ***With the kydex it is $545. The Kydex In Waste Band Holster was purchased at The Gun Parlor in Worcester. 

Will not meet in a public place, will only meet at a shop that can transfer the weapon from person to person. Please contact me if you are interested and we can arrange a meet at a gun shop to have the transfer done.

Guns a beautiful thing, it's turns out with loving care, shiny and bright. Guns like a beautiful woman, using a gun is like, putting rouge on a woman's face, never be used, never should be marred never.

Hello all, 

I just ordered these for an H&R M1 Garand I was going to purchase; however, the deal turned out to be a scam ""based"" in Ohio (careful on Armslist, folks) and so I never sent money for the rifle I would likely never see. 

12 of them (so you can fill your M-1923 cartridge belt and have two to put on your sling!). They are from AEC-3,or Aggressive Engineering. Aggressive was supposedly the last supplier of M1 Garand clips to the U.S. Army, so needless to say these are made to milspec standards.

This pistol was of simpler design, when compared to its predecessor, and susequently it was less expensive to make. Hungarian army adopted this pistol in 1937 in 9mm Browning Short caliber (which is also known in USA as .380 ACP). After the start of WW2, Germany placed a contract for the 37M pistols, chambered for the 7.65x17 Browning (.32 ACP) cartridge, which was standard for German armed forces along with more powerful 9x19 Luger / Parabellum ammo. German authorities also requested some design changes, namely the addition of the manual safety. German contract pistols were marked with ""P Mod 37"" rollmark and appropriate calibermarking ""Kal 7,65"" on the left side of the slide. The official designation of the these pistols within German military was P.37(u). Production of these pistols lasted between 1937 and 1944, with total production estimated at about 175 thousands.

 The FEMARU Model 1937 / Frommer 37M / P.37(u) pistol is a simple blowback operated weapon.The return spring is located below the barrel and the barrel is attached to the frame with four lugs below the chamber area, and can be easily dismounted when gun is disassembled. When gun is fired, barrel remain stationary. 
 The trigger is of single action type, with exposed hammer. No manual safety is available on the 37M, but the pistol is fitted with automatic grip safety at the rear of the grip. German contract P.37(u) pistols were fitted with additional manual safety on the left side of the frame, above the grip panel.
 Feed is from detachable box magazines, with magazine release catch located at the base of the grip, behind the magazine well. Each magazine is fitted with characteristic forward-facing finger rest at the bottom. External slide stop lever is provided at the left side of the frame."

Its superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and astonishing capacity combine to put more into a concealable pistol than you will find anywhere else.

This XD® 3″ Sub-Compact has all the same features found in the standard XD® line, but in a smaller package. The barrel is 3” and the frame is a short, compact size that will let the pistol nearly disappear when you carry it. Like other XD® pistols, This XD® 3” Sub-Compact gives you great versatility when it’s used with X-Tension™ magazines. Enjoy 13+1 rounds of 9mm, with standard flush-fitting magazines. Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 16+1 rounds of 9mm. You’ll find everything on This XD® 3” Sub-Compact that makes Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to this XD® 3” Sub-Compact.
If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD® 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range."

I am having to pay up to $100 more each gun to buy them. I have adjusted my price only half of that. This auction is for a new Baikal double trigger SXS shotgun in 12 ga. It has 20"" barrels with a large gold bead. The action work was done by Johnny Meadows. The action has been modified to stay open further than a stock shotgun. All Cowboy action work has been completed. This is not a hammered double that falls open when you push the lever. It takes a little force to break open, because it has to cock the main springs the same as any non hammered double. It comes with a recoil pad. $25 shipping to lower 48. Extra to ALaska and Hawii. No problem with California sales. Credit cards with a 3 % charge are accepted. It has a Kickezz recoil pad installed and the length of pull is 13 1/2"" to front trigger. This shotgun is set up for Cowboy action. If you want to shoot loads higher than 2 3/4 drams with 1 1/8 oz of shot, this isn't the gun for you. Test fired only. THANKS,"

Want to trade for similar value gun.    

This mower in fully restored condition, is worth $1500
This mower, fixed to run/mow, is worth $1000
This mower, as it sits, is worth $550

This mower has a 23hp Kohler with pressurized oil, cranks over with good compression.   48"" mowing deck.   New front rims and tires.  1080 hours.

Why is it a fixer-upper?   The hood hinge broke, so in the photo it's just laying on the mower.   The previous owner was mowing without the hood and had a small grass fire under the front of the mower.   Heat damaged the fuel line and the plastic shroud on top of the mower.  The next owner will have to replace some of the plastics to make things right.   However the mower was running good right before the fire, so it should run good once a few things are replaced.    Other bad things, one rear tire has a sidewall crack and barely holds air, so it needs a tube or tire.   Battery is bad but I can install one to demonstrate it cranks with compression.

If fixer uppers aren't your thing, this is not the mower for you.  

Got a gun worth $750?   I'll fix the engine so it runs and mows, the hood hinge is your problem."

I purchase this gun a while back from a reputable dealer here in Vass. It was a trade in from elderly man and shot very very little. I have not fired the gun, id plan on using this year on a trip. However I came upon another marlin 4570 and cant have two of them.The gun has great wood and near flawless. These JM marlins are going up and up in price and in a few years will be worth more. This is your chance to own an american classic at a great price. asking 800.00 will consider trades for a ar15 (must be in excellent shape). I would love to trade for other marlins, 39a, any marauders or trappers or rare ones. Especially interested in any Y OR Z serial numbers on a marlin lever. I have a leupold scope 2.5x8x36 vxIII (silver) that is on it in the picture that is new as well with box. The scope is not included at this price. however i will sell package for 1100.00 or do muti gun trades, ar15/marlin lever or possible a henry 17hmr only, no 22 please.  not interested in handguns unless its a like a S&W bodyguard 2nd generation or anything else with built in laser sight. and can do mutigun trades as well.  would consider a good name brand metal detector plus a gun. So value is 800 or 1100 and i can include cash for right deal. if more pics needed serious inquiries only I can send.  Scope is a 400 plus tax scope I am selling for 300. thank you for your interest. If you send a low ball offer and i dont respond there is a reason for this. This is as fair as I can go. I can throw in a leather butt cuff with loops for ammo for right deal."

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

This bike had been sitting for a few years up until this summer. We have cleaned the carb and it now starts and runs but is still bogging out a little bit at low idle. I think just riding a few tanks of gas thru the bike will get it back to 100%. The bike is fully functional and ride-able as it sit. The bike is great for riding thru the metro parks and is great on gas.

The picture is from this summer and up to date

From their website

Features you won't find in ordinary pontoon boats

New for 2014, the Sea Eagle FoldCat has a dark green color to blend in with the water where you most want to fish.

Unique Folding Frame Exclusive!
Most pontoon boats have a huge, metal frame with tons of parts. The FoldCat features a unique, patented Folding Frame design that assembles in 5 minutes.

The FoldCat has a full floor so you have far more useable space than ordinary pontoon fishing boats - and it's a ""safety net"" that catches gear you may drop. This allows you to carry more fishing tackle and supplies than ordinary pontoon boats. 

Two Large Inflatable Pontoons:
The FoldCat Features super-buoyant 16"" pontoons spaced widely apart. The 4'6"" beam gives the boat incredible stability as compared to a hard hull boat. 

Motor mount takes up to 3hp:
Motoring The FoldCat is a very light boat, with very little drag, and motors very well with an electric outboard. With a 3hp gas engine, the FoldCat rips along at 8 knots, fast enough to make headway against tides or headwinds.

Two 360Â° swivel seats
Plenty of back support and generous cushions put you in the lap of luxury on every fishing excursion. Instant snapon/ snap-off without tools.

2 Scotty Rod Holders
These top-quality rod holders mount into pre-drilled holes on two benches. Each rod holder accepts all rods, lock-in ring holds rod safe and secure, rotates 360Â°.

Carry Bag
Your FoldCat packs tightly and carries neatly in our durable nylon hull bag included. Fits easily in a full-size car trunk."
