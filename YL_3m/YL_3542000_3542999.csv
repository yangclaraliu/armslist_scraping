The stock 11 Lb. recoil spring has been upgraded to a Wolff 15 Lb to tame the formerly stout recoil the 9x18 has when mixed with the lightweight aluminum/titanium alloy frame of the PA-63.
It also has an upgraded Wolff 13 Lb. hammer spring that makes the DA trigger pull much nicer. A new firing pin spring was also installed.
The gun has functioned 100% with the upgrades, even with reduced power reloads and surplus ammo with hard primers that give other guns problems.

This firearm has a fixed barrel and is capable of some impressive accuracy if you do your part. I've also seen threaded barrels and .380 conversions available if that's interesting to you...but the 9x18 is more powerful than the .380 and in my opinion is also more accurate.
If you reload, this cartridge is a dream...you can trim 9x19 brass and load up some nice reduced power FMJ practice rounds or full power defensive loads using Hornady XTP bullets.

This will also come with a little over 200 rounds of ammo, a holster, a padded case, and a lock."

These have been banned from import via sanctions against Russia and are becoming hard to find.  I am somewhat recoil sensative after a neck injury and would like to get cash for an AR build...

The pistol grip conversion was professionally done: extra reciever holes welded over and blended, original trigger guard reloacted and welded, back plate welded onto the receiver, carrier group polished and reshaped to ease inserting magazine on a closed bolt action work/polish, Tapco G2 trigger group and SAW grip, customized selector lever for use w/ left thumb, and duracoated Foliage green.  

The barrel was shortened (and re-threaded) later on a Form 1 per the National Firearms Act.  I rented a guided thread die for the new muzzle threads, it indexed in the bore to ensure the threads are straight & concentric. 

Side folding AR M4 type stock w/ butt modification to allow it to fully fold w/ 20 drum inserted.

SGM tri rail hanguard, VFG, VT Flashlight mount and Surefire G2L light, SAW grip, 4 position gas regulator, Tromix Shark breacher brake, Tromix Bolt on knurled charging handle knob, couple reduced power action spring for shooting light loads. 

Gun and magazines are lightly used, just a few range trips to function test really.

One 5rd factory magazine comes w/ the gun, I have a couple 12 rd drums and 10 rd stick mags that I'll sell too w/ the gun.

All NFA rules apply.   (per the NFA [National Firearms Act] if you want to buy this gun as a SBS, you will have to send a ""Form 4"" along w/ $200 to the Federal Government & pass a background check.  When they send the form back approved several months later, you could then take possession of the gun.)   

Or, you can put $150, I can have the barrel pulled, then I can sell you the rest of the parts as a normal title 1 shotgun/receiver and you can submit your own form 1.  When you get the form one back approved you can then take possession of the barrel and we can have that smith press it back in.  eForm1s are only taking about a month recently.  You would then have to have your own engraving added to the receiver as the new ""maker.""

Prefer to transfer direct to another FL resident who is a CCW &/or NFA Tax stamp holder, or directly to a Title II/Class 3 dealer."

161,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3542161,For Sale:  Two Tactical Backpacks--SO Tech Paladin Mission Pack and 5.11 Rush 72--$85 each!,"Sterling, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 85,"Listed On: Saturday, September 27, 2014",Hunting,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for grabs are two packs--either one for $85 face-to-face:

-- A brand-new-with-tags black SO Tech Paladin Mission Pack Expedition

-- A lightly used 5.11 Rush 72 in Sandstone (I think). 

I bought several bags trying to figure out what I'd use for my hunting pack--lots of knee and shoulder problems/surgeries making me redefine how to manage getting to and from the field. Figured out what to use and now time to clear out the rest.

These packs are both right around $150-160 new (SO Tech IS new). 

SO Tech Paladin is no longer made (the SO Tech version runs around $400). The SO Tech bag has a plastic back support insert and expands from a 3-Day to a 5-Day pack. It's covered in MOLLE / PALS webbing to add whatever you need to add and it's designed to hold your Mission Go Bag in the front pocket if you have one (see pics; Mission Go Bag not included). Paladin is the affordable version of SO Tech's gear. It's made in Taiwan (like Maxpedition gear) to keep prices down, but does not skimp on quality in terms of materials, zippers, etc. The pack is guaranteed for life, just like any other SO Tech pack. I have both SO Tech and Paladin gear and notice no difference in terms of quality. Here's the link to the pack on the SO Tech website:

http://sotechtactical.com/products/paladin-mission-pack-expedition

The 5.11 Rush is a fantastically organized bag with pockets everywhere. It's set up for a water bladder (not provided), has a stuff sack in the front, and I THINK the waist pack tucks into the back. It is an amazing pack in every way. It was the runner up for me, but it was a close second (I ended up going with a Camelbak BFM). This one was lightly used by the previous owner and there are a couple of light dirt marks on it and one small light red mark--couldn't get pics of it in the light tonight at home. Other than that, it's in great shape--no real wear or tear on the bag. One day I'll probably buy this pack again, spend more on it than I'm selling it for, and resent the fact, but right now just looking for the cash!

247,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3542247,For Sale/Trade:  Ruger Mark III 22/45 with threaded barrel,"north metro, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 425,"Listed On: Monday, November 24, 2014",Handguns,Ruger                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,no type,Pistol,"This is an extremely accurate and fun firearm. 
The gun and everything included are in excellent to brand new condition.
Comes with a nice optical sight with 4 different patterns, 2 different colors (red or green) each with 3 different brightness levels. Extra batteries for the optical.
It has a threaded barrel and the end cap protector.
Comes with 2 Ruger factory magazines.
Ruger factory carrying/protective bag.
Brand new lockable carrying case with protective foam inside. I know a lot of people like to lock up their firearms when not using them and it's a great way to bring it home.

Other than the optical (which you can remove with just an allen wrench) it is exactly how it came from the factory with no ""kitchen table gunsmithing"" to the sear, trigger, springs, etc, etc - but there are MANY different things you can do to the internals of this handgun to fine tune it if you so choose; which is why I bought it in the first place but I never got around to it because it was already a tack driver so I didn't want to mess with it.
There are SO MANY different grips and other accessories you can get from Amazon, Ebay, Midway, etc if you want to dress it up and personalize this fun gun - literally 1000's of different options.
Although the Ruger looks and seems brand new, it isn't. I've shot exactly 200 rounds through it and they all performed flawlessly. Very fun gun to shoot. Most of the regular velocity rounds act like subsonic rounds (less than 1,100+ feet per second) due to the 4.5 inch barrel versus the long barrels on rifles, which is nice if you're trying to keep your shooting a bit quieter. 

I have several thousand rounds of various .22LR (FMJ and HP various brands, weights and speeds) that I'd be willing to sell or include with a trade for fair prices, not super inflated prices like you sometimes find lately.

I'm selling this gun because I just don't get out and shoot anymore.

I might be interested in trades and I can add money on my end if needed.
I'd for sure be interested in firewood (hardwood) that is seasoned & preferably split.

I live in Blaine but drive all over the Twin Cities for work and can most likely meet you pretty close to wherever is convenient for you."
250,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3542250,For Sale/Trade:  Glock 19 Gen 4 + Extras,"Gap, PA, Southeastern, PA, Pennsylvania",$ 0,"Listed On: Monday, October 13, 2014",Handguns,Glock                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"First off, I'd like to apologize to anyone I haven't gotten back to, or responded to lately. As we all know, life can get crazy at the drop of a dime, and I've tried to keep up with all the offers, which I greatly appreciate. So, again, sorry if I didn't respond.
So I'm still considering trading my Gen 4 Glock 19 for something new and/or different. It is currently my EDC, but I recently acquired another Glock 19 (gen 3) and considering parting with this one if the offer is right. At this time I'd rather trade for something of similar size and capacity, but offer away. Worst I can say is ""No thanks, not interested."" I'm very easy going so don't hesitate to let me know what you have. **I understand this is no $1000 dollar pistol, but I will ignore the $400 offers simply because of its condition and overall value. While it is not brand new, between the pistol, sights, and laser, it's value is around $900. THAT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECT TO GET, but it is why I won't sell it for the price of some SR9 or Sigma, or things of that nature. And don't even tell me I can keep my laser or sights because they don't fit the Gen 3, therefore I will have no use or want for them at that point. Also, the barrel in the pictures is not the stock barrel, but the original will be going back in. The nickel one in the pictures is from my NiB-X Gen 3 and is serialized for that pistol.**
So now, onto the firearm itself. It was purchased brand new by me about 4 years or so ago if I remember correctly. I've put around 800 or so rounds through her, and cleaned her after every range visit and periodically to keep lint buildup out of it. Slide and frame finish are basically immaculate. It currently has Trijicon Night Sights installed and a Crimson Trace laser grip. I have the OEM sights still and the 2 additional back straps that came with it. I have the original case and paper work with spent casing, and the 3 mags. Because I have my other 19, I am going to be keeping my hoster. It's nothing special anyway. 
I also have the paperwork and box for the CT grip with cleaning tips and allens for adjusting windage and elevation, as well as the OEM pin that the CT replaces in the grip. In short, I have everything needed in case you wanted to return it completely to stock. I have never done any trigger work or springs or anything, and never had a failure in any way. The only thing I did was the paint in the engravings to add a bit of contrast. Any questions, feel free to email me! 
**If you are over an hour away, I would like to try and meet somewhere relative to the halfway point between us. No shipping, and face to face only."

Armscor's description:

If you're looking for high quality brass-cased .223 training ammo, then look no further than Armscor's ammo to meet your shooting needs. 1 box of 20 rnds. Armscor's .223 Remington ammunition is unique in that it utilizes a higher quality crimped and sealed brass casing. Most .223 Remington ammunition does not utilize the more expensive crimped brass that the mil-spec 5.56x45mm ammunition utilizes. This higher quality component allows this cartridge to feed better in fully automatic rifles even in the high heat of deserts such as those in Nevada which is one of the proving grounds for this round. Armscor's ammunition is loaded in Montana for reliability you can count on."

Beretta Mod. 950BS in .25 ACP. - Private sale of an older classic Beretta in very good condition. Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...). You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. Taurus also makes a small caliber tip barrel design, but has a much heavier trigger (due to being double action). The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $210. Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $140.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven."

But what about the legal attack that so often follows? In today's world, you can be arrested, jailed, sued, fired, discharged under ‘Other than Honorable’ (OTH Good of Service) conditions, and bankrupted, even when you have justifiably used a firearm in self-defense.   If you had to use deadly force at home, at work, or on the road when travelling, two fights are sure to ensue; the gun fight and the legal fight sure to follow. That's why you must carefully choose a concealed carry training course. Attend a PatriotTAC Training course to learn all you can about the U.S. Criminal Justice system, the courts, and what you should expect to happen if you use deadly force.   You can benefit from the decades of real-world experience, training, and education of our instructors. PatriotTACs instructors deliver both the training and the education you will need in order to stand a chance of winning the legal fight.   Learn how to prepare to defend yourself twice – first against the physical attack and second against the legal attack.

I have only had this firearm for around 5 months and it has only been to the range 2 times. This gun has functioned flawlessly and still looks brand new. These are not easy to find locally, I had to have a local gun shop order this for me and I paid full retail for it. So my loss is your gain. This is the M&P model that was designed to have a red dot mounted on the top of the slide and it is a very smooth shooting good looking firearm, unfortunately I have fallen in love with another gun, and I have to find a way to fund it. All original instructions, mounting plates, etc. will be included. Considering how new and well maintained this firearm is the price is firm. The only trade I would consider is a Sig p226 elite variant plus cash from my end. Any potential buyers must be legally able to purchase a firearm and provide a drivers license to prove so. I prefer to be contacted by text message and I do work 7pm-7am on weekends as well as college full time so if I don't answer right away I will text you back as soon as possible.

The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is much more hard wearing and corrosion resistant than the original blueing.

Text or call REDACTED with questions or offers.  Must be over 21 and requires an Oregon driver's license or ID card to purchase.  Washington residents can purchase also but federal law requires that an FFL is used to facilitate a state to state firearm purchase.  Any fees associated with that FFL transfer, background check or any other fees, are the responsibility of the buyer exclusively.  I am not interested in selling to parties in any other state.  I know these can be hard to find, especially in this condition for this little money, but I am interested in local transactions only.
