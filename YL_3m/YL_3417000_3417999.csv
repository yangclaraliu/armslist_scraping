Asking $320 or trade for .380 or .38 spc of similar value

This new 9mm pistol is a double-action, striker-fire designed platform that incorporates an ergonomically driven polymer double stack frame with a stainless steel slide.  With extensive research on the form and function of the tactile-enhanced grip, the operator will find the design enhances control, while providing consistent hand placement. The flared magwell aids in fast and reliable reloads while the extended magazine base pad provides a secure grip during loading, handling and shooting the DB FS Nine. 

Diamondback has incorporated a trigger safety and firing pin block safety with a short, positive reset, minimizing trigger travel for faster cycle times. A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide.  Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user’s hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation. The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75” Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25” sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition.

Kahr says these are blemished, but it's extremely hard to see what is possibly flawed. They function perfectly and look great! Blemishes are usually minor imperfections in the name stampings and have absolutely no effect on the function of the weapon. These guns still carry the Kahr manufacturer warranty!

I have a little ammo to throw in, maybe 50 rounds or so.
Lettering has all been white colorfilled, the only thing not done is the ""fire"" lettering which I was going to do in red, however I did not have the paint to finish. It is easy to do and if you would like it done before the sale I would be happy to do it for you.

Gun also comes with all original trigger spring hardware, original A2 style grip, and grip screw. I have the box and paperwork for the scope as well as all the original packaging from the parts, including the Diamondhead rail.

Has only ever had Lake city 5.56 fired in it. Either XM855 or XM193. No other ammunition, and steel cased junk never touches my firearms. Any ammo that comes with it will similarly be Lake city 5.56. I have a few XM855s left but it's mostly XM193.
Rifle has less than 500 down the tube, has always been cleaned after every range trip and I only use Slip 2000 on it for lubrication. This build was done right and has functioned flawlessly. I may be forgetting one or two things, if I remember them I will edit the ad, if you are still reading this it is still available.

Price is set at $1000 as is, $800 without scope and mount

The rings are the perfect height for this rifle and I don't need them otherwise, so I'm throwin 'em in. I bought everything brand new in Nebraska; I'm the original owner. It has about 600 rounds through it.

I've tested many brands of ammo with this:

Federal 115gr (brass)
Wolf 115gr (Russian steel case)
WPA 115gr (Russian steel case)
Magtech 115gr (brass)
CCI Blazer 124gr (brass)  
Herter's nylon jacket 115gr (cheapo CCI aluminum)
Fiocchi 115gr (Italian brass)
PPU 115gr (Serbian brass)
Herter's black box 115gr (Czech brass)
Herter's beige/yellow box 115gr (Russian steel case from Tula)
Tula (Russian steel case)
Brown Bear 115gr (Russian steel case, lacquered)
Ultramax 115gr (remanufactured brass, lead bullet)

ON ALL BRANDS THERE HAVE BEEN ZERO FAILURES WITH ONLY ONE EXCEPTION: Brown Bear. It just doesn't like the lacquer. But, the unlacquered Russian steel case does just as well as the more expensive brass. Every magazine has been tested and each performs flawlessly.

Don't let anyone tell you these are garbage. They are anything but. If you want accurate and affordable home defense, this is it. Yeah, it's only 10 rounds per mag, but your shot placement with this won't be a problem. If i had to make a choice in a crunch I'd pick this rifle every time over any handgun.

So, all you have to do is keep the action oiled, don't use lacquered ammo, and you're good to go.

Why am I selling it? Too many calibers = bloated ammo expenses, so I'm stepping away from 9mm. All of this hardware normally costs over $500. After the ammo, you're basically getting $125 worth of stuff for free. Or, you can break it down like this:

995TS: $225   (I paid $300)
6 extra mags: $120   (I paid about $150 on ebay)
Mag attachment: $25  (my cost, it's brand new)
Folding foregrip: $20  (my cost, it's brand new)
Weaver rings: $10   (I paid $20)
200 rounds ammo: Free

Nebraska purchase permit and driver's license required (so i can match your name to the permit), and you have to sign and date two sales agreements with both our names and purchase permit numbers on them. Mine for yours, so both our butts are covered. No exceptions.

You can buy 22 ammo for 5 or 6 cents a round at Walmart. Some of the Walmart resellers are marking this up 3 to 4 times. I've even talked to a couple guys who are reselling to gun shops. Holy crap!!

Lets all start flagging as overpriced any 22LR ammo that is greater than 10 cents a round. That way we can set our own ceiling and maybe discourage some of the more outrageous resellers. The only way we are going to see ammo on a regular basis is to discuourage the heavy gougers.

My posts keep getting flagged by the Walmart resellers so if you have the urge, post your own reminder to have others to flag these gougers.

 The Good:
 The car runs and drives great but needs some work. It has tinted windows (NH Legal) , and an aftermarket flowmaster exhaust done by Majestic Motorsports in NC so you can definitely tell it's a V8! It also comes with 2 Viper alarms both with lcd screens and remote start/trunk functions. I also had the alternator replaced in January of this year and have receipts for both as well. The A/C blows out ice cold air, heated seats work great, and aside from the work needed, it's a very solid luxury car on a budget. It has a NH inspection sticker that's good until November of this year but needs work to pass after that. 

 The Bad: 
 The car's title is ""Reconstructed"" due to a previous flood. I've had the car since 2005 as a daily driver and it has passed inspection ever since until recently. It needs a new O2 sensor,Vent control Valve,Valve Cover Gasket/s, and Knock Sensor replaced to pass next inspection. The dash may have a loose wire because it has gone out once or twice, but it doesn't seem consistent. Honestly with a little wrench time,a trip to Autozone, and some knowledge of a motor, the repairs can be done on a weekend. The air bag light has been blinking for years along with the seatbelt light, neither of which has ever caused it to fail inspection though. Non-Inspection related are the replacement of hood support shocks (or install a hood rod), and the sunroof very, very, rarely has trouble opening (could just be dirt in the track).

 I've included everything I possibly can so that there are no surprises. I'm a former US Marine and I believe in integrity and being honest unlike some people nowadays. I recently purchased a new vehicle and I hate to see this car sitting in storage. The reality is that after some work your looking at a very clean 98 Infiniti with low miles."

This Mossberg 500 Mariner is made for self defense and home defense, gifving you 12 gauge stopping power, 6-shot capacity, the shorter 18 1/2 inch barrel, Mossberg's fabulous Mariner Marinecote� finish and Mossberg's great dependability and warranty. Mariner� Shotguns provide Corrosion-resistant Marinecote Finish for All-Weather, Year-Round Protection. This finish is ideal for humid environments. It was developed to prevent deterioration due to humidity and coastal environments, for boat patrol too, so it makes this shotgun last much better than other finishes. The Mariner is the ideal choice because your shotgun can be subjected to all-season climates, which can induce condensation. Rigorous testing proves the Marinecote resists corrosion better than stainless steel. This finish is harder than ordinary gunmetal and provides the added bonus of greater resistance to wear and distinctly smoother action. One reason so many military and police organizations purchase Mossberg shotguns is that the guns will withstand heavy wear and tear. But you don't have to be in the service or a police officer to buy this shotgun. In the event service is required, owners of Mossbergs always receive Mossberg's highest priority for inspection, repair and fast return of their firearms. Their expertly trained technicians complete every detail of service and repair at the Mossberg production site. Mossberg uses only factory original parts and install them to exacting specifications. Every firearm is returned in ready condition. Those who trust their lives to Mossberg products continue to rely on Mossberg's dependable, reliable and proven performance.  Manufacturer Mossberg

In 1883 Colt decided to produce a lever action rifle to compete with the Winchester 73.  Colt got their guns out quickly and made 6400 Burgess rifles before Winchester called a meeting with the Colt executives to show them the concept design for a double action revolver they were intending to produce.  As a result of this information, Colt stopped production of the Burgess and Winchester did not go through with their revolver plans.  This Burgess rifle is a real gem.  It is about 50% and is a 44-40 with a 26 inch barrel.  The serial number, XXX, indicates that it was probably made during either the first or second month of production.  The Colt Burgess is one of the rarest of the American lever action rifles and is not seen on the ""for sale"" list very often."

These guns are german made , and the trigger pull on it is amazing, like a feather. 6 shot cylinder, single action only. Incredibly accurate too!. Needs a little work , the cylinder has some burrs that need dremel work on to smooth it out, as the cylinder locks up a good bit , 10 mins worth of work and its good as new. If i have the time ill take care of it , but treat this ad as though i have not yet. Looking to trade for something of same quality, i dont mind if its beat up , as long as it functions faily decent. Looking for a semi auto 22 or 380 or 9mm handgun, a cheap 380 would be nice for my wife. Price for outright sale is 200 . Yes its high , but its only bc i dont want to sell outright , prefer to trade.  You can also text me , # REDACTED"

Frame has a fairly done reblue, the rest is all original bluing. Excellent for a shooter it is a very pretty yet rugged appearing pistol. Has that worn character, yet looks almost as if it just came back from the battle field. Grips are repro rough grips that I wore down and stained with original method. These guys have older 9mm barrels so they can be picky with ammo. Crimped brass at the head are a necessity to properly function. Winchester whitebox is so far the only one I found to fit these. They can be rimmed ever so slightly with any 9mm rimming to take all the ammo, just didn't care to take the time to do it. This piece is NOT a collector. Functions as it should. I am well educated on the guns I own. This is entry level for anyone who has wanted a Luger but can't afford that 1k stamp. That's what it was for me and now I'm ready to move up and pass to the next man.

I do not need to get rid of this handgun by any means. I'm just looking to see what is out there. I'm hoping to make an arrangement for a high quality AK. This Sig cost over $1000 when it was purchased so I know what it is worth and I also know the worth of most AK's as I've done my homework. Sig makes quality products and this 1911 is no exception. It is a reliable, accurate, amazing bullet guzzling beast. So please no centuries or converted saiga's. I'm looking for something more along the lines of an Arsenal, a quality Chinese AK, Quality Chinese AK, or Polish AK. Maybe a Waffen Werks.

Building off the success of our highly-accurate and reliable OBR 7.62, we set out to apply the same proven design features into a 5.56 rifle. The result is a lightweight, and reliable, tack driver that remains cool…even after high-rates of fire. The barrel and barrel nut does not touch the handguard at any point, so there is very little heat-transfer to your support hand. Like its 7.62mm sibling, both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum, for the optimum fit and consistency...translating into maximum accuracy. Even though this is a complete rifle, the upper will fit to any Mil-Spec AR15/M16 type lower.

 The continuous upper-rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations and provides correct ballistic orientation for all inline night-vision combinations. The 10 MOA cant gives users an added advantage when using magnified optics at longer distances. A step-down at the rear of the receiver creates zero MOA for use of BUIS’s at shorter distances.

 Each rifle ships with three, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail sections that they can be configured anywhere along the entire length of the handguard (via threaded steel inserts), for the interface of MIL-STD-1913 equipped lights, lasers, bipods, grips, tripod mounts, etc.

Barrels:
 The barrels are available in 12”, 16.1"", 18"" & 20"" lengths. They feature a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). The 12” model have carbine-length gas systems, the 16” and 18” models have a mid-length, and the 20” has a rifle-length. All gas blocks will feature our unique Port Selector Technology (PST), a two-point adjustable gas selector that allows optimum function between suppressed, and unsuppressed operation at the flip of a switch.

Internals:
 The Bolts and Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys. The carrier key contact areas fitted to allow zero gas leakage. 


About LaRue Firearm Accuracy: 
 LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results. 
Price does not include $10 fee mandated by the Democratic state congress and signed by GOV. Hickenlooper (Democrat).

Shipping out of state will cost $25; out of state purchases do not need to pay the $10 fee.

LaRue swag also included."

This weapon is intended for civilian and security use, and mimics the famous M16 rifle in its layout and placement of most controls. It is remarkably light for its caliber and size, because of extensive use of modern, high strength plastics.

Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight.

He emailed me pretending to be interested in buying my pistol. After he got me to respond he announced that he was turning me in to ATF for ""gun running"". He also cursed at me, bragged about how he had ""bagged"" 20 people for ATF, was a lawyer, etc.

He has done none of these things. You can tell you're talking to someone uneducated about anything technical about firearms.

Here's the deal: he tries to intimidate you by putting your name in all caps. ""I KNOW YOUR NAME JOE BLOW. I'M REPORTING YOU, YOU PIECE OF FILTH"" etc, etc... Since no one here is doing anything illegal don't be intimidated by him. He has my name- so what? 

I had quite the email conversation with him. All he can do after you challenge him to go ahead and call ATF is to write long-winded, cursing insults about how you're inbred and a Baptist (OOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!) He is nothing but 1) a troll who is doing nothing but trying to rile people up and get a response from them, or 2) some dumb liberal who doesn't know the law and is trying to intimidate you. 

So just ignore him if you recognize the email addresses above. But even if he uses a different email, don't let him bother you."
