FYI - If you use this lower on a rifle upper, do not use a vertical foregrip! You would change the classification of this to rifle (that would be bad) You can use an angled foregrip and it would be fine.

When you could purchase these rifles they went for about grand and some change after taxes and FFL fees.

Please Text 479 four four 5 zero 361
This gun has less than 50 rds run thru it and is in excellent condition.
The MSRP with only 2 mags is $509.
This Cougar has several beneficial features, such as its barrel and recoil system. A departure from the prevalent tilt-style system that dominates most semi-autos today, the 8045 F sports something different under its sleek, Bruniton-coated hide. A quick field strip reveals a locked-breech system utilizing a rotating barrel. The rotating design keeps the bore axis better aligned with the target, providing greater accuracy. What’s more, the mechanism reduces felt recoil and muzzle flip.
In addition to its compact size, all the edges on the Cougar’s non-glare steel slide are beveled to get rid of any sharp edges, which promote a snag-free draw while also preventing the pistol from shredding a shooter’s clothing, carry gear or hands with feline-like fury.
The Cougar feels good in hand due to the grip indent and being well balanced and points extremely well.  The frame also contains a heavy-duty dust cover with an integral rail for mounting lights or lasers.
The Cougar 8045F has ambidextrous decocking/safety levers, making weak hand shooting easier."

I would maybe do a trade if you offered something of equal value that I just couldn't pass up. But that's a slim chance because I need the money.

In a deluge of plastic, here is a real pistol, the best of its kind ever made. This is Smith & Wessons model 5906. Photo is representative, but buyers will receive a pistol from the same lot this one was issued with. It served for 15 some odd years with private civilian security guarding two of our nation’s nuclear plants. Dealers, collectors, and law enforcement may take any number of extra 5906s we have on hand at the same per-gun price, and with no additional shipping charges. Manufacturer was Smith & Wesson from the late 1980s until a few years ago. Construction is stainless steel, with classic satin stainless .260 serrated spur hammer and matching .304 smooth combat trigger. Sights are Novak low profile 3 dot, dovetailed into the slide front and rear. This pistol has been professionally reworked, bead blast refinished, and test fired by our friends at Black Ice Coatings in Utah. Magazine is both later production, orange follower 15 round stainless body factory. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent, note that bushing contact evidence on the muzzle area of the barrel is only moderate. We estimate that each 5906 has been fired fewer than 1500 rounds, annual qualification, no rounds at all for a 5906. The distinctive configuration of the barrel and the full-length stainless steel guide rod made these among the most accurate 9mms ever produced. Weight empty is 37 1/2 ounces. Own a very attractive matte stainless specimen of the tried and true Smith & Wesson 5906	for only	$ 489.00.	Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where the 15 round magazines are restricted to law enforcement, we will include a factory or Mec-Gar 10 round magazine; or $15 off with no magazine, buyer’s call. Affected jurisdictions include Chicago / Cook County IL, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, and New York.

In all seriousness though this pistol with the Sig brace affixed to it and shouldered, which is legal according to the BATF as of May 26, 2014, makes an excellent firearm. I have fired one hundred rounds through it flawlessly and it has been oiled and cleaned since. The only reason I am selling the firearm is because I have other firearms, all though you can never have too many, and would rather have the money to go towards paying off bills. The firearm includes everything pictured which is the Sig Sauer Arm Brace, 11 slot rail mounted to the bottom, as this is a key mod rail, with a Magpul XTM hand stop which I have o say I far prefer over and vertical grip or any  for grip but to each there own. A set of Magpul MBUS sights is also included which are flawless and a enhanced trigger guard to make which makes the gun much easier to use with bulky winter gloves. A Magpul grip is also on the gun with a hollow cavity to store batteries or whatever you may want to keep with the gun. A two position sling mount is also included attached to the buffer tube. All of this comes with the gun including two brand new Magpul 30 round p-mags, 100 rounds of 147 grain brass FMJ factory ammo and a great Draco case.

The SIG-Sauer P228 pistol was developed from the larger SIG-Sauer P226 pistol in 1989 in the same way as the earlier P225 pistol had been developed from P220 – which means that the designers basically chopped some length from the barrel and slide, as well as from the grip. The overall shape of the P228 also was made slightly less angular and more suited for concealed carry. In around 1991 the P228 was adopted by US Armed forces as the M11 pistol, and is issued to Military Police and some other units. The P228 is also a highly popular police and civilian sidearm and is widely issued to law enforcement forces in Europe and the USA. The P229, which was developed especially for the US market and is assembled in the USA using both German and US-made parts, is technically similar to the P228 except for the heavier slide, made by machining a bar of steel as opposed to the P228 slide, which is made by stamping and forming from sheet steel. The heavier slide on the P229 is necessary because of the more powerful ammunition used in this pistol. P229 pistols also can be adapted to any of three calibers (9mm, .357 and .40) by switching the barrel and return spring; P228 pistols are 9mm only and cannot be converted to other calibers."

375,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3307375,For Sale:  2 Sealed Cans (880 Rounds) Russian 7N1 Sniper Ammo 7.62x54R - Price Reduced 8/14!,"Fairfax County, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 500,"Listed On: Thursday, August 14, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have two sealed spam cans of Russian 7N1 7.62x54R sniper ammunition up for sale. 440 rounds per can. This is NOT the typical 147gr silver tip surplus ammo made in the '70s or '80s. This is newer 152gr ammo made in 1997 for better accuracy with sniper and designated marksman rifles such as the SVD and PSL. A unique characteristic of the 7N1 design is that the projectile has a lead knocker which causes it to tumble after hitting a target, inflicting a nasty wound rather than just passing through. It can also be fired from Mosin Nagant, VEPR or any other 7.62x54R chambered rifles with better accuracy than the standard stuff.

Asking price is FIRM: $260 for one can (440 rounds) OR $500 for both cans (880 rounds). These prices are WAY cheaper than current retail. I'll include a Russian surplus can opener. FTF only, preferably in Northern VA area. Cash is king, please be able to provide ID for proof of age and VA residency. PM me if you need more info or are interested in buying!"

The 5.56 PDW Tactical Evo 7.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system. Because the piston chamber is the same size as the chamber on the rest of the Adams Arms gas lengths this 7.5"" upper now has the proper dwell time to get cyclic rate and bullet velocity needed to make this a viable short barreled option for any CQB scenarios. We've also added a 7"" Samson free floating Evolution forearm giving the shooter the ultimate tactical option in a personal defense weapon. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper."

I've been trimming a bunch of 'stock' to standardize my reloading. It would be nice to have a multi-fluted chamfer bit attached to the left side of the trimmer, eh.

Lyman doesn't offer it. I got a quote to have custom ""Left Handed"", 90 deg. chamfering bits made, but the minimum order is many more than one person needs & that then makes'em expen$ive. If I get the shaft made to spec & thread it for the power trimmer, well, what say you? Any serious interest in such an endeavor? 

Without asking for your commitment to purchase, what would it be worth to you, including say, $2 USPS shipping? I'd like to make this worth my while, cause I want one myself! Pls. PM me as well as posting here. Thanks for watching.

P.S. A loop of 2""+ masking tape, about 3"" in diameter, surrounding the trimmers cutter, helps contain the ""dross""."

Bought new last year and shot roughly 500 rounds through it. Cleaned after each trip. Functionally a 10/10.

I added a few extras to it:
- pistol grip
- bipod
- picatinny optic mount
- NcStar Red/Green dot optic
- Desert tan paint job (Krylon paint for plastic)
- 25 round Promag magazine
- woodlands camo padded sling

I am selling the rifle with the above listed extras for $280. I would be willing to negotiate a slightly lower price if you didn't want all the extras. The only ones that are specific to this rifle and are included regardless are the pistol grip and magazine (and the paint job, obviously).

It will also include the original 10-round magazine that came with the rifle.

Please note the paint is currently fully intact but it is not cerakote or anything like that and it will scratch. I'm not pretending it's a professional job or anything although it is a smooth finish; no runs or unevenness.

For the buyer of this rifle I can also sell off some of my .22LR ammo stock (pictured). I don't remember the exact prices but most people are selling ammo for $0.10/rd so I will sell at $0.06/rd for the buyer of the rifle only. I have up to 775 rounds available which comes out to $46.50 at $0.06/rd.

If you want all of it, with all the extras and all the ammo, I can knock of another $6.50 to make it an even $320.

Must be over 21 and present Texas ID, and legally able to own a firearm.

I purchased it new and used it for a couple hunting trips and two trips to the range and its only had about 200 to 250 rds fired and never a single jam or misfire of any kind.
It comes with about 1200 to 1300 rounds of ammo.
It has been converted to accept removable magazines and comes with one 5 rd mag and 2 High Cap mags that are the best feeding non jamming mags Ive ever found. I think they are made by USA magazine but Im not 100% sure
 It has a custom ""Choate"" Brand Conventional Black Synthetic Rifle Stock. Conventional Stocks replicate the factory stock, but with highly durable and weatherproof polymer construction. The glass filled fiberglass will not warp or crack and is impervious to moisture. The Stock has has molded etching or checkering to help with grip and accuracy and has a rubber recoil pad on the stock as well. All Choate stocks carry a lifetime warranty.
It also has a custom Matte Black Steel See Through Receiver Cover with a High Profile Tactical Scope mount with Weaver style Rail Mount Complete With 1"" Rings and a 4x32 Redfield scope that is great out too about 500 yards. The Scope mount is tig welded to the reciever cover so that it will never work its way loose but the scope rings are still fully adjustable. Its a nice sturdy scope mount that stays put and still gives the option to use the iron sights and be able to mount a redot or lazer or flashlight.
It has a olive drab Green adjustable shoulder sling.
Vented forearm guard.
Adjustable rear sight and a TRUGLOW Light Reactive Front adjustable sight for quick target aquisition in low light conditions.
It has a removable flash suppressor that is milled and machined to allow the factory bayonet lug.
It comes with a Contico brand Black Zytel Hard sided Two gun transport lockable gun carry case.
With the Ammo and all the other options its a steal at 350.00 because there is that much in ammo and the stock and carry case alone not even counting the value of the gun and other options. I just need some cash and need it gone.
Please call or text for a faster reply and if you want pictures I can send them from my phone.

It's an awesome kit for anyone who wants to save money shooting 22 instead of larger caliber bullets. 


This Advantage Arms L.E. .22 Conversion Kit is to be used on the following GLOCK models: 17, 22, 31, 34, 35, and 37. It will work on RTF frames. DO NOT USE ON GEN 4 MODELS!

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF THE CONVERSION KIT: 

1. ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4. FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.

I will meet you at Target Masters West (Milpitas) or Metal Dog Tactical (San Jose) to do the transaction"
