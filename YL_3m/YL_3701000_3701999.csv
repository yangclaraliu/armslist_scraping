Mine is an excellent reproduction out of Canada and features the three post retical as was used in that era.  The scope conversion came with a scope mount, bent bolt, hardware, leather lens cap covers and canvas scope cover. The gun has a steel butt plate and a rubber one I added.   This sale includes a bayonet, leather ammo pouch, scope cover, winter hat, Russian flag, magazine and gun case.  I also have ammunition for this rifle sold separately.  This is the gun from Enemy at the Gate.  Very cool piece of history.

The P-64 pistol (official designation 9 mm pistolet wz. 1964) has been developed in Poland during late 1950s and early 1960s, as a compact and lightweight replacement for Tokarev TT pistols, manufactured in Poland under soviet license. Following the Soviet road, Poland replaced the powerful 7.62x25mm ammunition with less powerful, but still effective 9x18 Makarov ammunition. P-64 has been used by both Polish military and police, and still could be found in holsters of some Polish police officers. In military service it has been superceded in mid-1980s by the P-83 pistol. The P-64 was small and light enough for a pocket or a concealed carry sidearm, but it has too small magazine, and too heavy trigger pull to be considered as a valuable service pistol. The severe felt recoil also did not helped to establish popularity for this gun.
P-64 is a blowback operated, semi-automatic weapon, made almost entirely of steel. P-64 is hammer fired, with double-action trigger and decocking safety, mounted at the left side of the slide. Safety features also include loaded chamber indicator in the form of a small pin, which protrudes from the back of the slide, above the hammer, when chamber is loaded with cartridge. Trigger guard is a separate unit, which is hinged to the frame and served as a disassembly lever when pulled down. Single stack magazine contains only 6 rounds, and magazine release catch is located at the bottom of the grip.

Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.

The 75 B features a steel frame, a black polycoat finish, 3 dot sights, 16+1 9mm capacity (10+1 in .40 S&W) and, of course, the ergonomics and DA/SA action that have made it the most copied handgun design second only to the 1911. The ‘B’ designation is an indicator that the model is equipped with a firing pin block safety.

CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

THIS PISTOL IS IN GOOD CONDITION AND PERFECT FOR THE CAR, FOR CARRY, HOME DEFENSE OR A SHOOTER. WORK GREAT IN SINGLE OR DOUBLE ACTION.

The Tanfoglio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. 

The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you''ll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol''s bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot.

Up for sale today is a used Stainless Taurus Raging Bull 6 Inch. It fires quite nicely, however I have moved on from this to a more concealed version, the Raging Judge. Lots and lots of rage here.

This item is discontinued in many stores and is no longer produced and easy to obtain.

The revolver is in pristine condition, and the lock up is perfect. The cushioned grips is all intact and really makes this revolver easy to shoot. This revolver is chambered in the .45 Long Colt and the monster 454 Casull rounds.

Please take a look at what a 454 Casull round can do on the link below!

My personal guns for trade are as follows:

1. Mossy Oak Camo Ruger 10/22 Takedown with aftermarket ""Kidd"" bolt assembly & a threaded barrel with a screw on flash hider. Only interested in trading for another threaded barrel rifle. Value = $450

2. Ruger 22/45 pistol (22 LR) with a threaded barrel. (I will only trade this for another threaded barrel pistol). Value = $425

3. AR-15: (BCM upper with 18.5"" barrel, and Noveski lower). Has full length Centurian Arms Quad Rail. Value = $1400 (stripped of all accessories)

4. Gen 4, Glock 23 (Compact .40 caliber). Value = $550

5. Springfield XDS .45 Auto. Value = $550 (POST RECALL, Springfield already upgraded it and gave it back with a few 7 round extended mags).

All 5 guns are in phenomenal shape both mechanically and asthetically. The only marks you may find on the Glock and the XDS would be a slight amount of ""holster wear"". That just means that they've been well loved :-) I meticulously clean them after every use.

The new legislation that Washington voters passed this month DISGUSTS ME! I love the guns that I currently own and I never intended on getting rid of them. HOWEVER, I don't feel that it's ANY of the governments business to know what I own. I believe we are only 1 vote away (maybe even as little as 1 term) from having to actually register what we already own. As it stands, after December we will have to go through an FFL to buy sell or trade our firearms.

The purpose of this ad is to possibly trade what I have with what you have before we are REQUIRED to leave a paper trail. It is my sincerest hope that we never have to register what we own but if we hope for the best it's not too late for our personal firearms to be ""grandfathered in"" to whatever legislation is to come.

I am MOST INTERESTED in swapping them for the EXACT same guns. If you have something else for trade I suppose I could entertain that thought as well. I do miss my 12 gage shotgun and I have always wanted a Ruger GP-100 mag or a .44 mag :-)"

It is a very accurate and reliable, with about 200 flawless rounds through it. It features contrast sights, a very durable poly coat finish and comes with two fourteen round mags. 

Read up on this gun, it went through some of the most rigorous testing to become the first NATO Spec pistol to be available to the public. It's the compact version of the SP01. Again, just a very underrated gun for the price.

The ""MY VEPR 7.62X54R WITH IRONWOOD STOCK SET IS FOR SALE"" listing is an image from a forum user in Washington.. Not Arizona. Reverse image search if you don't believe me. The user even stated that he ended up selling his AR instead of the vepr because he liked it so much.

This guy has posted about 6 different ads, in different locations across the states. Once in Ohio, Arizona (most recently), another somewhere further east, etc. Search all states > 54r > semi auto, you will find multiple ads, worded similarly.

He is selling under the current market price of what an actual 54r vepr would go for. He doesn't respond to any messages about possibly purchasing locally.

Also he has also posted on gunauction, the auctions untouched because the only payment option is money order, so good luck getting it after sending money.

example: http://www.gunauction.com/search/displayitem.cfm?itemnum=12777885

Please be careful, if something seems too good to be true it probably is.

Below are some of the wordings he used in some of his listings, as well as images.


""Here is my own collection selling due to financial difficulties only, Vepr 7.62x54r made in Russia in excellent cosmetic and working condition. This is Russian BULL heavy duty semi auto AK style rifle, 16.5 inch barrel.""

This is a solid, mechanically sound and smooth revolver. Unfortunately, the collectable quality has been removed by a previous owner who did an excellent job of fitting a full rib to the top of the barrel with the rear 2.75"" or so rounded and tapered with a fine pebble finish to cut the glare. Then, almost as an afterthought, he slapped on a shotgun bead front and rough metal leaf fixed rear sight. On the plus side, the whole gun has been refinished and the action is very tight and smooth, grips are decent too. Overall it is a very good shooter.

Revolver shoots great, very smooth and with 148 gr wadcutters hits POA at about 15 yards. Being a pre-numbered model, +P ammo is a no-no.

I have about $2,000 invested in the rifle and realize I will be taking a financial hit. I have the price set for the rifle at $1,400 which is firm and not negotiable. I am located in strongsville Ohio and will only sell face to face. I will not ship to a ftp dealer. The three pictures displayed do not do any justice for both the appearance and performance of this rifle and I do have more pictures upon request. There are approximately 120 rounds through the rifle all of which are Hornady American Whitetail. If you have any further questions or inquiries feel free to contact me. Thanks for looking.

GLOCK PISTOL MODEL 27 CALIBER .40

The GLOCK 27 in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

 I am not sure on the exact weight, but I would guess that it is around 500 or 600 pounds. It is VERY heavy. I can load it for you with a fork lift.

 It functions just fine. It is older though, so the cosmetic aspect of the safe could use a spray paint job if that is a concern to you. 

 There is a drop slot at the top/back of the top compartment where you can use it as a drop box safe. It falls down into the bottom compartment. Perfect for a retail store.

 I am not sure on the exact weight, but I would guess that it is around 500 or 600 pounds. It is VERY heavy. I can load it for you with a fork lift.

 It functions just fine. It is older though, so the cosmetic aspect of the safe could use a spray paint job if that is a concern to you. 

 There is a drop slot at the top/back of the top compartment where you can use it as a drop box safe. It falls down into the bottom compartment. Perfect for a retail store.

 I actually have several of these and can make a deal if you want more than one.

They would work great for a smaller arms safe or for an ammo safe. Also, they would work great for a retail store.

Leave your name and number if interested. I can also give a better deal if you get several.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

KSG has less than 100 rounds through it and has had no problems. Zero FTF, FTE or anything. This is a Gen 2 after they fixed those issues. All accesories Magpul, FVG, rear and front flip up sights.

To many in the self defense world, the 380 Auto (or ACP, or 9mm European) is a joke cartridge. A non-contender. It’s too small, it’s underpowered, it doesn’t have enough knockdown and in general it doesn’t belong with the big boys of the self defense realm. Maybe you’re right. Maybe not, or maybe these guys are just partially right? Or, perhaps, our friends in the firearms industry are actually on to something. Regardless of the “like it or not principle,” SOME gun is better than NO gun any day of the week. Especially if subscribing to the principle that the first rule of being in a gun fight is to bring a gun."

Here is a description of the monocular:
ENVIS (Evader’s Night Vision Imaging System) is a rugged handheld night vision system for operators who must be prepared for covert night movement. Night movement is the best choice for evasive movement, but it is generally discouraged because of difficulty navigating in the dark. The ENVIS is the survival tool of choice, designed specifically to overcome obstacles and hazards when moving at night and successfully evade hostile territory. The ENVIS is USAF approved for flight survival vests. It is a lightweight night vision pocketscope that fits in one hand for direct viewing. It can easily convert a standard still or video camera into a high quality night vision recording device. It attaches to the objective lens threads of most cameras for temporary nighttime applications. The removable objective lens can be replaced with any C-Mount Type lens for increased range and magnification.

It’s brilliant that Walther stayed so faithful to the original PPK design. - See more at: http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2013/12/04/gun-review-walther-ppks-22lr/#sthash.A39Cj3x7.dpuf"

If you're viewing this listing, I'm guessing you know all about it - a limited run of Noveske made lower receivers, with SilencerCo on one side, and Noveske on the other side. These were made by Noveske for SilencerCo and offered during a very small window restricted to people that purchased a SilencerCo Saker suppressor during that window. 

You know about Noveske, and whenever they do limited runs on things (especially lower receivers) people go crazy for them. I've hung onto this for awhile, debating whether to use it for a nice build or not - but I've decided to go ahead and sell it instead. In no hurry to sell it, as it's a pretty niche item - and not just your regular ol' everyday lower receiver. I've seen them go for $600, but I wouldn't feel good selling it that expensive - having said that, I know the right buyer is willing to shell out for this limited run item.

A lower receiver is considered a 'firearm' and therefore will need to ship FFL -> FFL. Free shipping.

I have for sale military surplus .30 ammocans for sale. They are Condition: Grade 2/Very Good (Grade 1 is new).

These GENUINE military cans have many uses including storage, geocaching, tool boxes, and of course, they can be used to store your ammo. They have a rubber seal on the lid that makes them virtually air tight and highly water resistant. This can also makes a great camera box on float trips. 30 cal. cans measure 10""L x 3 1/2""W x 6 3/4""D on the inside.

Don't be fooled by those new ammocans sold at Gander Mountain, Fleet Farm, Cabelas, Walmart, etc. Those ammocans are NOT considered MILSPEC and do not have the same gasket and sealing mechanism as the military models do.

Priced as follows:

$10 each if paid in cash.
$10.45 each if paid via Paypal.

Buy just one or one hundred. I'll likely have as many as you'll need.

If you live outside the Twin Cities metropolitan area, I can ship two ammocans in a USPS fixed rate box for a shipping fee of $13. If you need more than two, we'll use custom packaging and you'd pay actual shipping costs.
