A double trigger setup fires the gun—the front trigger fires the shotgun barrel and the rear trigger fires the rifle barrel. The MP 94 comes with an adjustable open sight and the receiver features an integral dovetail scope mount.

The gun’s overall length is a compact 40 inches and it takes down quickly in a manner similar to an over/under shotgun for cleaning and transport. Fit and finish of the gun’s walnut stock and blued steel parts are decent for a gun of its price and it balances and points naturally. It’s clearly a gun made for offhand shooting.

290,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3615290,For Sale:  Thunder Beast Arms Corp MODEL 338BA SUPPRESSOR,"Howell, Michigan, United States","$ 1,749","Listed On: Friday, October 24, 2014",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"YOU CAN BUY THIS HERE>Thunder Beast Arms Corp MODEL 338BA SUPPRESSOR

The 338BA is our high-performance .338 caliber suppressor design for applications where the rifle will be shot with and without the suppressor and recoil reduction is required in both cases. The 338BA effectively suppresses the extreme muzzle blast of the .338 magnums down to levels similar to suppressed .308. The 338BA brake is left attached to the rifle at all times, and reduces recoil when the suppressor is not used. When the 338BA suppressor is mounted to the brake, the rifle's ""suppressed zero"" returns and the mount design ensures accuracy.

We developed the 30BA and 338BA to meet the requirement that some customers have for a suppressor that mounts over a muzzle device. We haven't found a ""quick mount"" on the market that meets our accuracy and repeatability requirements, so we developed the BA series to mount over our brake and provide the same repeatability as our direct thread attach suppressors, like the 30P-1. The 30BA features a conical shoulder for rock solid POI repeatability and to make sure it never comes loose.

The 338BA, like the 338P-1, has additional volume to handle the gas pressure of the .338 Lapua Magnum, but only weighs fractionally more than a .308 suppressor.

The 338BA is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded baffle core. This material and method of construction provides a great strength to weight ratio. Our suppressors are designed from the ground up for superior accuracy. The 338BA can take whatever your big-bore precision rifle can dish out while keeping all your rounds on target.

The 30BA brake will accept the 338BA suppressor, so with a .30 caliber brake on your .308 and a .338 brake on your .338 Lapua Magnum, you can use a single 338BA suppressor on both. The 30BA suppressor will not fit on a 338BA brake.

413,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3615413,For Sale:   Surefire SOCOM556-MINI SOCOM Series Sound Suppressor (Silencer),"Howell, Michigan, United States","$ 1,137","Listed On: Thursday, February 19, 2015",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"YOU CAN BUY THIS HERE> Surefire SOCOM556-MINI SOCOM Series Sound Suppressor (Silencer)

SOCOM556-MINI
The SOCOM556-MINI Fast-Attach® suppressor is shorter, lighter version of SureFire’s SOCOM556-RC, which was selected by US Special Operations Command as first among all competitors in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor evaluation in history, covering all aspects of suppressor performance, and which also received the USSOCOM official safety verification in support of fielding.

With an overall length of just 5 inches, the SOCOM556-MINI is 1.2 inches shorter and 2.5 ounces lighter than the SOCOM556-RC. It features advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability.

SureFire’s patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvements in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a true technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree.

A new indexing system means it mounts to a SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous models and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area.

Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM556-MINI produces minimal, consistent shift in point of impact compared with the unsuppressed weapon regardless of the number of attach-detach cycles.

The SOCOM556-MINI is constructed from advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and heat-treated stainless steel, and features a tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond coating on the Fast-Attach® lock ring and Cerakote™ ceramic finish on the suppressor body, in either Black or Dark Earth color.

All SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors require a compatible, latest-model SureFire muzzle brake/adapter or flash hider/adapter for attachment to a firearm—see Parts and Accessories on this page.

SureFire sound suppressors for rifles and machine guns combine every important suppressor feature: excellent sound, flash, and dust signature reduction—key components of SureFire's Total Signature Reduction™ (TSR); minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of attach/detach cycles; rock-solid attachment in seconds; compact size; minimal weight; fail-safe baffles to prevent bullet side-exit; and extreme durability permitting full-time use. In fact, your SureFire suppressor should outlast your firearm barrel, depending on use.

All SureFire Fast-Attach® sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing operator's position and preserving night vision and unobstructed view; reduce dust signature, concealing operator’s position and maintaining unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots.

NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brake/suppressor adapters, and flash hider/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous generation SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders.

Selected for the M4 and Mk18 carbines by US Special Operations Command after placing first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted, it also received the USSOCOM official safety verification in support of fielding. Compact and lightweight, the SOCOM556-RC suppressor adds only 4 inches (approximately) to the overall length of your rifle. Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM556-RC produces minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with the unsuppressed weapon regardless of the number of attach-detach cycles. The SOCOM556-RC features advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability. SureFire's patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvements in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree. A new indexing system means this suppressor mounts to a current-model SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous versions, and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area. The SOCOM556-RC is constructed from advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and heat-treated stainless steel, and features a tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond coating on the Fast-Attach® lock ring and Cerakote™ ceramic finish on the suppressor body, in either Black or Dark Earth color. All SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors require a compatible, latest-model SureFire muzzle brake/adapter or flash hider/adapter for attachment to a firearm—see Parts and Accessories on this page. SureFire sound suppressors for rifles and machine guns combine every important suppressor feature: excellent sound, flash, and dust signature reduction—key components of SureFire's Total Signature Reduction™ (TSR); minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of attach/detach cycles; rock-solid attachment in seconds; compact size; minimal weight; fail-safe baffles to prevent bullet side-exit; and extreme durability permitting full-time use. In fact, your SureFire suppressor should outlast your firearm barrel, depending on use. All SureFire Fast-Attach® sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing operator's position and preserving night vision and unobstructed view; reduce dust signature, concealing operator’s position and maintaining unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots. NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brake/suppressor adapters, and flash hider/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous generation SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders. Features Patented Fast-Attach® design provides rock-solid attachment and easy removal in seconds New design provides superior sound attenuation, virtual elimination of first-round muzzle flash, and decreased dust signature Minimal and consistent point-of-impact shift compared with unsuppressed weapon regardless of number of attach/detach cycles Compact and lightweight for minimal impact on weapon handling characteristics Internal blast shield increases durability Advanced core design reduces back pressure, suppressed cyclic rate, and gas blowback Constructed from advanced high-temperature US mill-certified alloys and stainless steel Redundant-welded subcomponents eliminate parts loosening Tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond and Cerakote™ finish in Black or Dark Earth color"

This carbine is made by Just Right Carbine and setup to take the Glock Magazines.  This particular rifle is setup for the caliber .45 ACP but you can purchase kits from Just Right Carbine that would convert the rifle to Glock 9mm magazines or Glock .40 S&W magazines.  Gun is several years old but in like new condition.  It has spent most of it's time a hard case in the trunk of my car. :)  Goes super with my Glocks that are in my car on or me.

Photo with White Background is most recent photos.  Sorry the Glock 30s is not included.  One Glock model 21 Magazine is included.  Photo with Red Background is an older photo that was taken and has some accessories shown on the gun that are not included in this sale.  Reflex Sight has been sold.  Flashlight has been moved to my Shotgun.

Just Right Carbine has a few glitches with the .45 caliber when they first started up until Just Right Carbine engineers tinkered (engineered) a few components to get the right balance with bolt speed, spring pressure, length of buffer tube, ect.  This carbine went back to the factory mid 2014 because Just Right Carbine announced they had some updates available to help solve issues with Failure To Eject, etc.  I sent the carbine back and the manufacturer installed the updated (slightly longer) buffer tube and buttstock.  While there, Manufacturer replaced Bolt & Extension, Firing Pin/Spring/Retainer, Feed Ramp, Extractor, Buffer/Buffer Spring, and Barrel.  The Third Photos shows the information that returned with the Carbine in July 2014.  So this carbine is like new and ready to rock.  

Stock Carbine comes with threaded barrel end that is capped off.  I still have the original cap but have installed a tactical tip flash hider.  I've also swapped out the stock hard plastic pistol grip with a Hogue Rubber pistol grip.  

Carbine is free floating barrel and has full length picatinney rail along the top of the rifle. Forward Guard has picatinney rail on all four sides so there is plenty of room for the goodies of your choosing.  

I have a set of Magpul Flip Up sights that will go with this gun.  I have a nothing fancy Plastic Hard Case that I will send with the gun.  I made it from a Benelli Shotgun Case, installed foam and lined the case with black material.  Nothing Fancy... but will protect gun from scratches and wondering eyes.  

Asking price is $750.  Trade interests would be Scandium Frame S&W Revolvers in .357 Magnum, 44 Magnum, and possibly .38 Special.    Possibly Glocks (no .45GAP's).  Partial Trade possibly for a Mossberg 590 12 Gauge that came from factory as a pistol grip only gun (with factory box showing that gun camefrom factory with pistol grip only - no buttstock ever on he gun).

This gun has had a total of approximately 300 rounds shot with it. 200 for the initial recommended ""break in period"" as Kahr states with all their guns then 2 trips to the range for some brief shooting. This gun is FLAWLESS condition with no scratches and has been cleaned religiously, before the first time shooting it and after the total of 3 times to the range. I have always been into Glock's then but switched my main carry pieces to Kahr's because of how slim they being a single stack but having Glock like reliability. I have owned a Kahr PM9 for years which I love and I bought this gun as a pure impulse buy. I have had a Ruger LCP before but got rid of it because it felt just to cheap and always wanted a Kahr P380 to match my PM9 HOWEVER I just couldn't find the reasoning behind spending AT LEAST $550-600 for a P380. I saw this at my local gun shop as they were unloading it from a new gun shipment. The gun looks IDENTICAL to a P380 with just a few minor insignificant differences (listed below) which lower the price of this gun to a VERY reasonable no brainer buy in my opinion. The fact it is probably the most solid built 380 WITH TRUE SIGHTS yet still is light as a feather. Overall considering its quality of build, reliability, ability to shoot +P ammo straight from Kahr's website vs. other cheaply built 380' which cannot fire +p or certain types of ammo for that matter also, super tiny, and overall a beautiful gun.

This is the only 380 I own so I am looking to part with everything 380 related along or that is specific for this gun which includes:

- Orignal Kahr box with ALL paper working including registration card, manual, Kahr info, and trigger lock.

- Orignial receipt showing the date I purchased the gun which was March 16 this year.

- A ""Crossbreed"" Super Tuck holster only holster custom made for a CW380 with upgraded leather horsehide for better durability. I did cut a small piece of the leather near the grip of the gun so it could be drawn easier. With tax and shipping the holster was near $100 itself. Google ""Cross Breed"" holsters to see prices and amazing reviews if you have never heard of them.

- ""Talon rubberized heat shrink grip"" which I put on all my guns to help draw and hold especially these smaller guns. It applies like a very very adhesive template that wraps around the entire grip on both sides also the front and back in which you use a heat gun or hairdryer to shrink and securely firmly wrap around the guns grip. It is as thin as paper and if you do not like you can simply peel it off with no permanet markings or indication it was ever installed new was around $20.

- De Santis ""inside the pocket holster"" in MINT condition. Great for summer shorts or just throwing in your front pocket as this is truly a ""Pocket Sized Pistol"" new was $24.

- Pack of 380 ""snap caps"" so you can dry fire your gun without any worries or use for training randomly loading one snap cap into your mag at the range to train how to quickly eject a jammed bullet the pack new $19.

- I have roughly half a box of some 380 FMJ target ammo along with a full box if not missing a few rounds of ""Federal 90 grain Hydra-Shock Self Defense"" bullets with cost $25 brand new.

- Depending on your interest I also have a fairly newly condition rarely worn (5-11 Tactical) true black leather gun belt with stainless steel buckle with no ""wrinkles"" or wear spots. I believe it is 36-38 inches which I will try to find the receipt or just measure but it was over $65 new and only worn slightly when I had to dress up and honestly I just prefer nylon type gun belts.

Here is how Kahr was able to offer a nearly identical gun as the P380 yet for a nearly $200-250 less which as you'll notice not many truly CRITICAL features:

""The CW380 savings come from switching out the P380’s match-grade polygonal rifled barrel for one with standard rifling, a fixed polymer front sight (driftable steel on the P380), less machining on the slide, simpler roll markings, a metal-injection-molded slide stop lever, and the inclusion of only a single 6-round magazine (the P380 comes with three).""

I am looking to get rid of EVERYTHING ask mentioned. The gun brand new cost me $359 plus taxes. All the extras I am throwing in total to minimum $250. With the flawless condition and super low use of this gun I think $250 would be a steal. The gun and everything mentioned for total of $325 would be very fair. If you have any questions or would like to see more pictures don't hesitate to call or email. REDACTED."

589,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3615589,For Sale:  Surefire SOCOM556-MINI MONSTER SOCOM Series Sound Suppressor (Silencer),"Howell, Michigan, United States","$ 1,180","Listed On: Friday, November 6, 2015",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"GREAT DEALS SELL QUICKLY, CHECK HERE FOR AVAILABILITY OR TO PURCHASE>Surefire SOCOM556-MINI MONSTER SOCOM Series Sound Suppressor (Silencer) SOCOM556-MINI MONSTER The SOCOM556-MINI MONSTER Fast-Attach® suppressor is identical to our SOCOM556-MINI suppressor, but has serrated teeth on the front plate for added bite if the situation demands it. The MINI and MINI MONSTER are both shorter, lighter versions of SureFire’s SOCOM556-RC, which was selected for the M4 and Mk18 carbines by US Special Operations Command after placing first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted, and which also received the USSOCOM official safety verification in support of fielding. With an overall length of just 5.3 inches, the SOCOM556-MINI MONSTER is extremely compact and lightweight. It features advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability. SureFire’s patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvements in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a true technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree. A new indexing system means it mounts to a SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous models and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area. Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM556-MINI MONSTER produces minimal, consistent shift in point of impact compared with the unsuppressed weapon regardless of the number of attach-detach cycles. The SOCOM556-MINI MONSTER is constructed from advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and heat-treated stainless steel, and features a tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond coating on the Fast-Attach® lock ring and Cerakote™ ceramic finish on the suppressor body, in either Black or Dark Earth color. All SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors require a compatible, latest-model SureFire muzzle brake/adapter or flash hider/adapter for attachment to a firearm—see Parts and Accessories on this page. SureFire sound suppressors for rifles and machine guns combine every important suppressor feature: excellent sound, flash, and dust signature reduction—key components of SureFire's Total Signature Reduction™ (TSR); minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of attach/detach cycles; rock-solid attachment in seconds; compact size; minimal weight; fail-safe baffles to prevent bullet side-exit; and extreme durability permitting full-time use. In fact, your SureFire suppressor should outlast your firearm barrel, depending on use. All SureFire Fast-Attach® sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing operator's position and preserving night vision and unobstructed view; reduce dust signature, concealing operator’s position and maintaining unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots. Features Patented Fast-Attach® design provides rock-solid attachment and easy removal in seconds Identical to the SureFire SOCOM556-MINI, but with serrated teeth on the front plate Same revolutionary suppressor technology as SureFire’s SOCOM556-RC, winner of US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) extensive and rigorous suppressor trials Provides effective attenuation of sound and dust signatures Minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with unsuppressed weapon regardless of number of attach-detach cycles Compact and lightweight for minimum overall weapon length and minimum impact on handling characteristics Advanced core design to reduce back pressure, cyclic rate, and gas blowback Patent-pending front-plate design and proprietary gas-flow improvements virtually eliminate first-round flash Integrated blast shield increases durability Constructed of advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and stainless steel Redundant-welded subcomponents eliminate parts loosening Tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond and Cerakote™ finish in Black or Dark Earth color"

Desantis Dual Angle Hunter Holster for S&W Governor Revolvers features separate belt slots for conventional hip draw or cross draw. The Desantis 016 Holster is specifically moldedimage for the Smith&Wesson Governor 2.75"" Pistol. The DeSantis Dual-Angle Hunter SW Holster is constructed of tan lined premium saddle leather. The line leather interior of the gun holster is made with suede to prevent rubbing or scratching on a firearm's finish. This belt holster accommodates belts up to 1 3/4"" wide.
DeSantis Holsters are built for a snug fit. Leather holsters will stretch slightly with use, resulting in a better fit. Therefore your new holster from Desantis Gunhide may feel tight at first, until it is broken in. Frequent daily wear and use will naturally break in a holster. Other simple physical techniques can also be used to break in a new Desantis Gun Holster. Leather dressings and oils are not necessary!

I'm standardizing on AKs and this is my lone oddball AR-15, so it needs to go.  It has a PSA midlength H-bar upper with a Magpul MOE foreend and RFG, Daniel Defense rear sight, RRA BCG.  Charging lever is a PRI gasbuster with a Badger latch IIRC.  Lower is an AR-57 with a PSA parts kit, everything's mil-spec on the inside.  It has a Magpul BAD lever on it, grip is USPalm.  Stock is a B5 Sopmod with battery dry storage.  The gun runs great, no hiccups since day one, it's got about 200 rounds thru it just for the test fire and I put it up.  It has some scuffing on the recievers, but nothing horrible, you can see for yourself in the photo.  Basically a no-BS combat gun, and that's what I'd like to trade it for.

For trades I can add a little cash, I would prefer something new or like new, I don't want beater guns.  Again, looking for Arsenal or other premium AKs, but I'm not really all that interested in inflated Saigas or Veprs, I've already got a ton of them.  I basically want mil-spec ready-to-run AKs, not sporterized guns I'll have to mod.

I'd also consider a trade for a .50AE Desert Eagle, high end S&W revolvers in .357 or .44 magnum, HK 45s and 45Cs or a Sig 226 E2 in 9mm.  No .40S&W guns."

647,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3615647,For Sale:  Surefire SOCOM762-MINI SOCOM Series Sound Suppressor (Silencer),"Howell, Michigan, United States","$ 1,249","Listed On: Thursday, February 19, 2015",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"YOU CAN BUY THIS HERE>Surefire SOCOM762-MINI SOCOM Series Sound Suppressor (Silencer)

SOCOM762-MINI
The SureFire SOCOM762-MINI Fast-Attach® suppressor is optimized for use with 7.62x39 and 7.62x35 caliber rifles and will also adequately suppress 7.62x51 NATO caliber rifles with a barrel length of 16 inches or longer. It features the same revolutionary suppressor technology as the SureFire SOCOM762-RC, the most advanced suppressor ever made, which was recently selected by US Special Operations Command as first among all competitors in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor evaluation in history.

Just over 6 inches in overall length, the SOCOM762-MINI is 2.2 inches shorter and 2.5 ounces lighter than the SOCOM762-RC. It includes advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability. The patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvement in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a true technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree.

A new indexing system means this suppressor mounts to a SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous models and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area.

Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM762-MINI produces minimal, consistent shift in point of impact compared with the unsuppressed weapon regardless of the number of attach-detach cycles.

The SOCOM762-MINI is constructed from advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and heat-treated stainless steel, and features a tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond coating on the Fast-Attach® lock ring and Cerakote™ ceramic finish on the suppressor body, in either Black or Dark Earth color.

All SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors require a compatible, latest-model SureFire muzzle brake/adapter or flash hider/adapter for attachment to a firearm—see Parts and Accessories on this page.

SureFire sound suppressors for rifles and machine guns combine every important suppressor feature: excellent sound, flash, and dust signature reduction—key components of SureFire's Total Signature Reduction™ (TSR); minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of attach/detach cycles; rock-solid attachment in seconds; compact size; minimal weight; fail-safe baffles to prevent bullet side-exit; and extreme durability permitting full-time use. In fact, your SureFire suppressor should outlast your firearm barrel, depending on use.

All SureFire Fast-Attach® sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing operator's position and preserving night vision and unobstructed view; reduce dust signature, concealing operator’s position and maintaining unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots.

This is a used product that was off of a rifle that I purchased. I do not want this scope, or the other items shown in the second picture. The scope does come with low rings (don't know the brand). Very few small scratches are on the tube and rings, but otherwise appear to be in good-very good condition. Reticle is intact. The bipod is a Champion 8-12""/9-13""(?). Works great and shows minimal signs of wear. The sling is a Blackhawk KUDU stretch sling. Once again, very few signs of wear.

Anyway, about the gun: It's an Ishevsk round receiver stamped 1943, all matching numbers, but the buttplate was arsenal force matched. The wood has no chips or cracks, but plenty of dents (It was a war rifle after all). Bluing is 95% or better on most parts.

Includes the bayonet, the oil can, the dual ammo pouch, the full tool kit with it's pouch, the cleaning rod, and the sling. There are NO stripper clips, despite what the picture shows.

The bore is a little dark, but has excellent rifling, the rifle is headspaced properly and has the proper firing pin protrusion. It has not been counterbored and shoots very well."

I am the only owner of this gun.  It has been shot very little..about 100 rounds of defensive ammo just for function testing.  It has a GREAT trigger and is very slim.  It is a great carry piece.  It has two interchangeable back-straps so you can get the grip size you want.  

It comes with all the original accessories, plus two magazines (total of 3).  Two have pinky extensions.  It also comes with a leather IWB holster, and a Fobus holster.  These retail for about $530 with one mag.  Mags run around $40 each.  With the holsters and extra mags thrown in, this is a really good buy.

Amidst all of the nuttiness of the last year I bought some stuff that I don't need. 

(1.)Unopened Federal 525 round value pack...copper jacketed hollow points

(2.) Unopened Remington ""New and improved"" 225 round .22 LR value pack

(3.) And one fractional box of the Remington item described above....with maybe 100 rounds remaining.

This is 850-875 rounds of .22 LR all purchased in 2014. The stuff that I used had zero malfunctions.

I don't need this stuff and I just want my money back out of it. I've had no problems with any of it.

My best guess is that I paid about $45 for this at Wally World. Will sell for two $20 bills...that is $40 for all will not separate.

No...I will not negotiate on price and I will not burn $3 a gallon gas to sell $40 worth of stuff---will sell at my house or within a couple of miles.

As-new condition.

Will also come with the original case, literature, and...holster thing (apparently Sig no longer ships these with a paddle holster, see pic).
Looking to make a trade for a Sig P239. .40 version preferred but would consider a 9 as well. Must be a DA/SA model. Would really like to make a deal for a Gen 2 SAS model. Doesn't have to be brand new but no beaters please. I can add some cash for the right deal. 
Otherwise would be willing to sell for $600 FIRM. I have just over $700 into this pistol with the grips and extra mag, and I will throw in some hollow points to fill both mags. I just lost my job and could use the money, so please no haggling- this is still a better price than you will find online or retail, especially after applicable tax and/or transfer/shipping fees.

I bought this for my Mossberg 500 12 ga so that the recoil would be more manageable for my wife and so that we could adjust the LOP between the two of us.  It does reduce the felt recoil noticeably.  Firing slugs and buckshot is reduced from ""Black & Blue Shoulder"" to ""Mildly Uncomfortable"" (Phoenix's website says 40-50% reduction, though I have no way of scientifically testing that).  I am selling this because I prefer the grip of a standard stock instead of the pistol grip.  I used it during two shooting sessions, firing about 75 shells with a mix of birdshot, buckshot, and slugs."

One gun in the photo has OK wood for a gun of this age.  It has a 27"" barrel including choke.  There are no model numbers on the barrel just patient numbers.  Choke is marked Lyman Choke.  This is the older gun  from numbers believe that it is from the 1940s. Most of the bluing is gone but no rusty spots.  Think serial # is in 1913

Second gun has a broken fore stock so barrel will not stay in place.  Main recoil spring is still there. Tube spring is missing. Not a major fix just replace fore stock and tube spring.

The pistol has never been fired except for the factory test rounds.  It has been carried, and has some minor holster wear on the lower front of the pistol.  The R9s is the smallest 9mm made, and makes a perfect pocket carry pistol.

Also included are 2 factory magazines - one came with the pistol and the other is a new magazine purchased directly from Rohrbaugh for around $40. 

This was a limited production model.  Best I could determine, there were approximately 60 of these models made.

Rohrbaugh pistols are precision CNC machined from solid billets of stainless steel for the slide, barrel and smaller internal parts. Frames are from 7075-T651 aluminum billets. Parts are then hand fit for a superior self-defense weapon where size, weight and deep concealment are of consideration. 

The R9 Stealth slides are coated with Diamond Black (DLC), which reduces friction, increases wear resistance and has anti-galling properties. The Elite slides are then hand-sanded to reveal silver-color highlights of the stainless steel.

- One new rifle case that fit perfectly

I have personally test fired this rifle and it is 100% reliable and accurate. It feeds and ejects perfectly with no sticking. When I was doing my job, I was hitting steel plates with iron sights at 75 yards. The bolt has been taken apart and cleaned and the head space has checked out to be perfectly safe. In fact, I would not have given it a good test run the other day had I not checked this out.

If you are looking for a Mosin Nagant, this is a really nice representation. You can buy with confidence that it is in excellent condition, is safe to shoot, is all-matching, has a great bore, and is very accurate.
