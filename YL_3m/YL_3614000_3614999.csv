I ordered one up and it is a great shooter.  I have fired about 300 rounds, and no issues.  VERY accurate and practically no recoil.  At 25 yards it shoots tight groups.  Only selling to help fund a trip to the 2015 SHOT show.  Was asking $425, in spirit of black Friday, will take $375. On Monday price goes back to $425.

If interested, please contact me by phone/text at REDACTED. You should have an Indiana ID and valid handgun permit and we will do a bill of sale. If not, we can do transfer at FFL. Thanks for looking and have a good night."

Car had all maintenance done and I have receipts,  but recently there's a knock coming from the engine so I parked the car to not further mess anything up.

These cars are known to go 300,000 miles plus.  All components inside the car work, just needs new battery and engine. Car starts and drives. Interior isn't ripped or torn. Has flip out touch screen radio and is very spacious. Rides like a dream. I'd say for about 1,100 and TLC you could have a 4 - 5 grand car running just fine.

Purchased the car about two years ago and have the title. Car had all maintenance done and I have receipts, but recently there's a knock coming from the engine so I parked the car to not further mess anything up. Got a estimate for a new engine for $750 but I don't have the time or know how to remove the old one and install a new one. Car had about 17X, XXX thousand miles on it. These cars are known to go 300,000 miles plus. All components inside the car work, just needs new battery and engine. Car starts and drives. Interior isn't ripped or torn. Has flip out touch screen radio and is very spacious. Rides like a dream. I'd say for about 1,100 and TLC you could have a 4 - 5 grand car running just fine. I'm not a professional or car guru by any means. I'll be moving soon so im trying to limit my list of things to take. Few minor rust spots but definitely not serious. Makes a great family car or car for a loved one. Spacious and easy riding. I've took it on several trips out of state."

In a 53-46 vote, the Senate narrowly passed


a measure that will stop the

into the United

Treaty, which has been 


championed by the Obama Administration, would have


effectively placed a global 


ban on the import and export of small firearms.  The ban


would have 


affected all private gun owners in the U.S. and had language


that would have 


implemented an international gun registry, now get this,

You can spend another $130 on EBay for a Sig 357 factory barrel and technically have two guns without switching out anything else. Love the feel of it I just can't afford to own it currently. That's where someone gets lucky. All I can say is look up by model number and after realizing what it is make me an offer. I need it to have a new home so am willing to make you a deal that won't be made anywhere else.  Seriously it's easily a $1k gun with higher ones on gunbroker. Make an offer respectable somewhat and you will have the best pistol in your circle. It's never been fired despite a manufacture date in 2012.

Otherwise to a collector, it's value is greatly reduced, the factory box will have the matching serial number on it.... i would still be interested in one without these prized extras, Gunbroker.com has become like ebay, in other words, people list guns on there and then create a seperate account under another email and then bid on thier own gun to drive the price up. That's why you will see guns sell listed much higher then they are worth and then you see it re-listed after it met the reserve price and sold and then it's relisted.

Its in good shape with a little bit of carry wear but nothing major worth mentioning. Comes with two 8 round magazines. Has an excellent trigger, light and breaks very cleanly with a short reset. If you aren't familiar with these they are very similar to a Kahr CW9, basically the single stack 9mm Glock has yet to make.

It carries nicely but I prefer to pocket carry so I'd like something with a shorter grip. I'd be interested in a Ruger SR9c or LC9s or an M&P Shield in trade. Might also consider J frame sized .38 special revolvers or possibly a used S&W Model 10 or the same guns mentioned in .40.

.45. Because shooting twice is just silly: Cherry Glock 21 Gen 4 for sale.

Beloved Glock 21 Gen 4, Trijicon HD sights (installed / $130), original case, 4 back straps (with elongated pin), 3 magazines, original Glock sights, owner’s manual and large caliber Glock magazine loader. 

“.45. Because Glock hasn’t made a .46. Yet.”


“As far as I know the only people that can survive a .45 are Wolverine and Superman”


“Let’s be honest, everyone to some degree has a level of respect for people that carry a .45. Even if they don’t want too.”

Pistol has around 1050 rounds and 3 IDPA matches through it; which means the trigger is smooth as silk (for a Glock) and it’s proven it’s reliability (never misfired, hung up, miss-fed or complained in any way). Trijicon HD yellow sites (which can be charged with a flashlight) are insanely visible and WILL NOT BE DENIED in daylight, dim range light, autumn dusk, black of night, movie theater lighting or any other situation you may find yourself in. This .45 is more accurate than any black gun should be and kicks less than its sizeable caliber would suggest. Slide shows some signs of holster wear (see pics). Internals are clean, smooth, well taken care of and completely stock.

“God himself handcrafted the .45. bullet and that shinny little rock that David used to kill goliath was actually a .45 round that fell out of Moses’s pocket”

My Sob story: I can't shoot Glock 45s worth a d*** and I have a tax bill coming up.

“9mm kills your body. .45 kills your SOUL.”
