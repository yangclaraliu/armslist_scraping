Nordic Components AR22 Chassis Kit for Ruger 10/22

This was assembled only once for a YouTube Video for the channel.
Ultimate 10/22 Build | Nordic Components Chassis - http://youtu.be/Lguai3Rqd-c 

All you will need to finish this kit is a barreled receiver with a trigger. Works with standard barrels as well as .920 barrels.All these parts were bought new, assembled once, and stored properly until deciding to sell. The AR22 Chassis, MFT Stock, and Handguard are in New Condition showing no signs of wear. 

This would be perfect for a long-range setup. Due to the 12"" Hand Guard, a barrel length of 18"" or more would look great. The 16"" .920 Barrel barely cleared the front of the hand guard. If you are using an aftermarket drop-in trigger, a little material may need to be removed from the back of the trigger housing.

The barrel nut & rubber trigger gap insert have a small scuff. Does not impair the functionality or aesthetics of the chassis kit. Installed once and shelved for a month in a non-smoking home.

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

Now you have the basics, below is what I have for sale. It is all a package, I have no interest in piecing it out. It's all or nothing - save for the NightForce Optic, that I will sell separately. The NightForce is brand new, BTW, I bought it and put the Unimount on but never even fired the thing or dialed it in. My intention was to make the M1A a bullpup but I never got around to it and the scope is for it. I hope that someone else will take this and treat it right. 

This is one heck of a smoking deal, if you went to a local store and bought all these today, the ammo would be $860 + Rifle&Mags $2150 + Drum $380 + Optic 1734 for a grand total of at least $5140. This is over $700 off retail.

1 - 50 Round X-Products Drum Mag ($350 from Cheaper Than Dirt)
675 rounds of 308 ammo (all the ammo has been priced out today, Dec 15)

That's 1900 for rifle & mags + 1500 for optic + 300 for Drum + 700 for ammo

Total for all above: $4400

If you don't want the NightForce subtract $1500

I have decided to go a different route now and do not need this barrel any more. I have only put 10 rounds through it.

here is the description and specifications of the barrel from the company I bought it from

DESCRIPTION:
These Barrels have been professionally developed for Accuracy and competition target shooting, a 16"" M4 which is lighter in design and  improves barrel accuracy due to quicker target acquisition on the move. Our M4 Competition barrels offer the accuracy of a heavy barrel but the lighter weight approaching that of an M-4 ""pencil"" Profile. M4 Profile for increased Strength, and Cooling, while Reducing weight compared to Standard 18-20"" heavy barrels. Custom Machined from solid Bar Stock of Chrome-Moly Steel Hardened to 26-32 RC Spec and then Cryogenically Stress relieved and nitride/melonite finish for prolonged accuracy under heavy use/competition.

Nitride Treated:Read about this process being better than Chrome lined bores
These barrels have been treated with a Black Nitride treatment. The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with Black Nitride have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more expensive processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, Black Nitride gives better corrosion protection. Additionally, Black Nitride is commonly used as an alternative to high temperature conventional heat treatments such as carburizing and carbonitriding. 

PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT:
Our Socomm Barrels are capable of 1/2""-3/""  MOA 5 shot group at 100 Yards. This means all 5 shots will be touching.

Drop-in trigger/hammer system requires no gunsmithing to give your small-pin AR-15 a rugged, reliable trigger with a smooth, consistent two-stage pull. Fixtures custom designed by CMMG engineers are used for final grinding of 10 separate contact surfaces on the trigger, disconnector, and hammer for a crisp, precise, consistent hammer release. Brass bushings reduce friction to help ensure an ultra-smooth pull and exceptionally fast locktime. Rounded, low-mass hammer further speeds locktime and reduces wear on contact surfaces. Each trigger is function tested before it leaves the factory to ensure correct operation. Works equally well in .22 LR conversions and AR-style .308 rifles. Standard-weight trigger and hammer springs included; will work with aftermarket reduced-power springs."

There are some blemishes but nothing some light sanding and wood stainer can't fix. The door does lock but the bottom drawer doesn't lock with a key.

This is a great condition Beretta 92G Elite II Brigadier. I am the original owner of this Beretta. Pistol has EXACTLY 450 rounds through her. Internals are like new. I have all the paperwork it originally came with. This pistol was purchased by me in 2003. Trigger is amazing, slide is like butter. It has 9 magazines, 3 factory Beretta (two with bumpers) and the rest are mil-surp. External finish is perfect except two areas, there is a very small pin size chip in finish under dust cover, and small amount of wear at the beaver tail from when I used to carry this pistol on Search and Rescue and it would rub on my carabiner. It is missing a grip screw that went MIA when i was swapping out some hogue grips a few weeks ago, but that is a $4 fix and grips are solid still. Otherwise it is in new condition. I have kept this pistol in the safe for most of it's life. I really hate putting this up like this as I will probably never get another chance to get one of these, but alas, other responsibilities are calling. I know these are very sought after now so I will start my auction off at the lowest cash offer i have had locally and go from there. At the time of this writing this is the only one on gunbroker at the moment. I tried to add as much of the pistol as i could in the pictures. If you would like more please email me thank you and good luck."

BNIB!! NEVER FIRED!! It's BRAND NEW, exactly as it arrived from the factory. No scratches, nicks, dents, holster wear, etc. Has always been kept in a humid free safe. Was purchased with the intent of having a .45 caliber in my collection, but ended up with something else in it's place. Just looking to free up some room and use the funds for other toys. 


Comes with all the goodies, case, extra magazine, magazine loader, competition magazine holster, extra grips, manuals, and bullet from test firing from factory. 


Asking $550 Cash only. No trades. This is a brand new handgun. Look up the price online.


I also have roughly 1000 rounds of .45 ACP ammo that we can make a deal on if you're interested as well. Both FMJ and JHP's.

Bulgarian black and chocolate circle 10 and 21 mags.  This is an extremely solid well built rifle ready for any scenario.  This top of the line build was pricey before the import ban and would cost even more now to duplicate, so no lowballers please.  I am in no hurry to move this rifle or ammo and only selling because I want to slim down the calibers and finish some other projects.  For those not familiar, the .223/5.56 and 5.45x39mm calibers are ballistically very similar when fired from the same length barrel.  Many say the 5.45 round is flatter shooting and offers better terminal performance over the .223/5.56 because of the longer projectile.

$2,400 obo. in cash or $2,600+ in trade or trade plus cash offers.  Not wanting to split up the package at this time, but might consider it, depending on what the offer is, just let me know the deal.

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, but will consider trading as long as the value is there, otherwise, I'll pass on trades and wait for cash.  

If wanting to do some type of trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.

The only thing I can think of at this time I would do a straight trade on would be maybe a SCAR 17.  I like semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants, pistols, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag.  Pistol caliber carbines like Beretta CX4 9mm, maybe the .45ACP model.  Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44) and shotguns(Mossberg 590 models & 930 SPX), but I will consider these as well, depending on the deal and values.  

Might also consider quality optics as well, would like to try the Nikon M-223 4-16x42mm or maybe a nice Vortex on one of my AR's.  I have plenty already, but will consider more ammo to help make a deal happen, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

Ftf in or around the Garland area.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed, but would need to check shipping rates on the ammo."

Product Information
The LaRue Tactical LT150 will allow you to mount your Aimpoint Comp M2 or Comp M3 at the proper height for ideal eye alignment. The LT150 achieves this by raising the sight centerline to 1.7"". Like all LaRue mounts, the LT150 is precision-machined out of aluminum bar-stock and hard-coat anodized. The LaRue Speed Lever allows you to remove and replace your optic without loss of zero."
