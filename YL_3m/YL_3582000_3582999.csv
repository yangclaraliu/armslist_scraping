Description from manufacturer:

The SP2022 is the latest version of Sig Sauer's popular polymer framed pistol, a firearm that has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. The SP2022 features a durable, lightweight, and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by Sig's black Nitron finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a double-action/single-action to a double-action only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the Sig Sauer four-point safety system, making the SP2022 one of the safest guns on the market. The Tacpac includes the STL-900 Tactical Light and laser and a Level 2 Roto light/laser holster.

Comes with a 10-round mag, cleaning kit, rail covers, all packaging.  All of this is brand new and has never been fired.  I'll throw in a black 30-round PMAG to round out the package.

Features include 7.0"" barrel, Sig arm brace, high quality flip up iron backup sights, Sig free-float quad rail, Piston driven operating system, ambi mag release, front serrations on mag well, Sig ergonomic pistol grip, and more.

Per ATF ruling, this firearm is classified as a handgun.  If you have been looking for an AR pistol, this is about as good as it gets.

To put it in perspective, our wholesale price on these items (even if we could get the Sigs) is well over $2000.00.  The owner has put a retail package price of $1999 on this.

Sorry, no trades on this one.

introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced,
while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional
accuracy they expect. The 1911 Scorpion features a Flat Dark Earth (FDE)
Cerakote-coated stainless frame and slide, low-profile night sights, and an
8-round magazine. Hogue's innovative magwell grip set combines G10 grip
plates and mainspring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that
promotes rapid magazine changes. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture
for excellent retention in any environment, and they come in a multi-layer
green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's FDE Cerakote finish.

501,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3582501,"For Sale/Trade:  Lee Enfield .303 Rifle, Scope, Magazines, and Ammo","Near Faribault - South of Twin Cities -, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 225,"Listed On: Saturday, October 18, 2014",Rifles,no type,303 British                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Update:  Sale Pending for 10-18-2014.  

For sale is a sporterized, SMLE, Number 1, Mark 3, Lee Enfield rifle in .303.  

The rifle is bolt action with a strong return spring.  It comes with a 3 – 9x40, wideview, fully coated, Simmons scope with lens covers on a Weaver mount.  

I like rifles that have a sense of history to them and the Lee Enfield fits that bill.  I wanted to know what it felt like to fire an Enfield (even a sporterized version) and how accurate they were.  I wasn’t disappointed.  The .303 cartridge has enough punch to knock down anything in North America (apparently Africa, Antarctica, India, Korea, and many more places too) that you would need to.  

Being a fan of such British war films as Breaker Morant, Immortal Sergeant, The Lost Patrol, The Desert Rats, A Bridge Too Far, Kelley’s Heroes, Cast a Giant Shadow, The Lighthorsemen, Legends of the Fall (chick flick, still solid fight scenes though), and Zulu Dawn I had to buy an Enfield and spend some time at the range with it.  

So what about this particular rifle? I put ~100-rounds through it.  I fired it for both speed and accuracy.  It never had a failure to fire or failure to eject and the rounds all struck where they should – any lack of accuracy is my fault and not the rifles.  

The rifle comes with two magazines and both were test fired with no issues.  

The rifle is not new.  The rifle is not pretty.  The rifle will most likely still be functional long after I am not.  

If you’re looking for a dependable bolt action rifle to drop furry critters in North America this may be your thing.  

Rifle will come with 40-rounds of factory .303 ammo."

No scratches, chips, dents, rust or marks. The blueing is still dark and uniform and the stock is Walnut with a hand rubbed oil-finish. It is somewhere between a 1968 and 1970 version depending on what system you look at for the Serial # codes. It was purchased new by a family member and given to me in 1972 for my 21st birthday. Since then I have shot probably 20 rounds to sight in over the years and another 7 times to kill 7 Whitetails. I doubt it had been fired 20 times before me. It has the 24"" Microgroove barrel, straight stock, gold trigger and a Redfield Wide-Field 3 to 9 scope sitting on top. I've got about 100 or more rounds of ammo that goes along. It is a workhorse of a firearm and designed to take down almost any animal in North America, while looking good doing it. I'm not able to hunt any more myself, there is no one in my family to pass it down to and I have no place to display the rifle ... so I hate it but away it goes."
