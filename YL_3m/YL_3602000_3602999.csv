I am looking for $650 for the rifle with the bipod and the scope.

The rifle has a street price of around $700.00.
It has a Nice Laminated Thumbhole Stock, the Accu-trigger, Dual Pillar Bedded Stock.  The rifle is very accurate.

•AccuTrigger is adjustable from 2.5 to 3.25 lbs. 
•Beautifully laminated thumbhole stock 
•Detachable four-round box magazine

This firearm disproves the notions that a superb varmint rifle has to be heavy, and that lighter models aren’t as accurate. It’s medium-contour, free-floating sleeved barrel has a recessed target crown for enhanced accuracy. Weaver-style scope bases come installed atop the receiver. Dual-pillar bedding adds to the features that make this rifle a tack driver. The bolt has three locking lugs and a 60° bolt lift. The AccuTrigger™ is adjustable from 2.5 to 3.25 lbs. A beautifully laminated thumbhole stock makes this rifle as pleasing to look at as it is to shoot. Sling swivel studs and an extra stud for a bipod are standard. Detachable four-round box magazine. Made in the USA. 


The Scope is a very nice Sightmark 8.5x25x50mm Tactical Scope w/ Illuminated Mildot Retical, Side Focus, and 30mm tube.  The scope carries a street price of about $225 new.  Here are the specs on the scope:
This scope features multi-coated lenses for optimum light transmission and a clear, crisp view of the target. It is water and fogproof to stand up to use in all environments and weather conditions making it a great choice for use as a hunting scope. In addition, the oversized and easy to adjust windage and elevation turrets can be locked to ensure the scope will not lose its zero. Powered by a CR2032 3V battery.

You simply pull up, find target and fire.  Following is what all that it has and how much I invested:
-Gun, paid $419
-Weaver V-3 1-3x20mm Matte Black Dual-X Hunting Rifle Scope, paid $180
-Ram Line Custom Real Tree Stock, paid $98
-Camo sling, $19

KSG Kel Tec Shotgun 12 Gauge 18.5 Inch Barrel 2.75 Inch Chamber Picatinny Rails Dual Magazine Tubes Black Finish 14 Rounds
Internal dual tube magazines holds 6 rounds of 12 gauge 3 inch shells each for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4 inch shells). Pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. Feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. Lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. Cross bolt style safety. Pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. Includes an under Picatinny rail and top Picatinny sight rail. Sling loops are built in and a basic sling is included. Soft rubber butt pad. Weighs 6.9 pounds with a 26.1 inch overall length.

This bullpup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition. The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG.

Varmint Express .17 HMR Rifle --- The Rifle of The Range Riders
This is the rifle the range riders of the 1800’s would have loved to have had close at hand for picking off varmints or just plinking at whiskey bottles. But since the .17HMR didn’t hit the market until 2002, it will be up to you to make it a legend.

Our Henry Varmint Express® rifle packs eleven .17HMR rounds in its tubular magazine. It features a 20″ barrel, comes with a checkered American walnut Monte Carlo stock. Like all lever action Henrys, the action is incredibly smooth from the very first shot. It will enable small game and varmint hunters to take full advantage of the .17HMR with regard to velocity, trajectory, wind drift, richochet resistance, quietness and accuracy.

Already considered by many to be the most accurate rimfire cartridge ever produced, the .17HMR incorporates a .17 caliber bullet into a necked-down .22 magnum case. This high-powered combination produces a sizzlin’ muzzle velocity of up to 2,550 feet per second and the laser-flat trajectory makes it lethal for long-range shots on woodchucks, prairie dogs, foxes and other small varmints. Henry’s take on this revolutionary caliber, the Varmint Express, has a 20″ barrel that delivers dead-on accuracy.

Just like all Henry rifles, it’s handcrafted in the United States using only high-grade components such as a checkered American walnut stock, and Williams Fire sights and, of course, it’s outfitted with that legendary, smooth-operating lever action that sets a Henry rifle apart from all the imitators.

Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical Pump- 12 Gauge, 18.5"" Barrel, Black Finish, 3.5"" Chamber, Synthetic Black Stock

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth.

Our exclusive ArmorLokt™process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

BARRETT M107A1 !!

The Barrett M107A1 .50 BMG semi-automatic rifle is an exceptional firearm! Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail.

* It has a lightweight, quick detach bipod with modular feet.

* It has a monopod as standard equipment instead of having to pay additional and add as an accessory; this is a big help so you do not have to support the weight of the rear of the rifle with your own strength. It also allows you to dial the elevation of where your aiming up or down with the monopod with even more accuracy so even if you don't want to upgrade you may want to ask about adding a monopod.

*The case it comes with from the factory is an upgrade from a Pelican case to a nicer Storm case. The Storm case is much easier to open and close, and you don’t bust your knuckles on it, and the case features padding inside instead of bare plastic.

Features:

Blued/Walnut.  Immaculate!!!

Comes with a quality 4-12X40 Vortex Diamondback with the Dead-Hold BDC reticle (bullet drop compensator).  The scope was professionally mounted and bore-sighted on Ruger factory rings. 

Also, included in the sale are 2 boxes of ammo (20 rds of Hornady 117gr +P SST, and 20rds of Federal 120 gr +P Nosler partitions).

Rifle was originally won at a raffle, and never fired.  I put the scope on last year with the intent of using as a back-up deer rifle, but never took it to the range.  However, with the type of hunting I do in inclement weather, it would be more appropriate for me to opt for a synthetic/stainless instead of risking beating up this beauty.  Its been a “safe queen” and its time to let someone else enjoy it.

The 257 Roberts (“The Bob”) round is a proven and loved classic, based on a “necked down” version of the 7x57 Mauser.  It is perfectly suited for hand loaders to bring out its true potential.  For those who do not handload, it is still a wonderful deer round with light recoil, and perfect for beginners to learn on.

I've had this pistol for about 2 months, now I haven't even had a chance to shoot it. I been stocking up on .45 to see what it will shoot more accurately. Last weekend I was at a friend's house who recently got out of the Marine Corps. Short of the story is: he is an Iraq veteran and recently was considering taking up deer hunting, to help him deal with his PTSD. This man has always been a good friend to me and now I have a chance to give back a little. I want to pick up a nice bolt gun so we can go out hunting together. I sold my 30-06 a few years back so now I need to get a new rifle, but I'm getting married in Dec. so funds are a little tight. 

That brings us to the USP. It's a very clean gun, I'm the second owner and the guy before me said he put about 500 rounds through it. The gun will come with two mags, and a hard case. it has florescent green sights, and an extended magazine release installed. If I get a local buyer (NV ID/CCW is a +) I will throw in all the .45 I picked up for it.

Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail.

* It has a lightweight, quick detach bipod with modular feet.

* It has a monopod as standard equipment instead of having to pay additional and add as an accessory; this is a big help so you do not have to support the weight of the rear of the rifle with your own strength. It also allows you to dial the elevation of where your aiming up or down with the monopod with even more accuracy so even if you don't want to upgrade you may want to ask about adding a monopod.

*The case it comes with from the factory is an upgrade from a Pelican case to a nicer Storm case. The Storm case is much easier to open and close, and you don’t bust your knuckles on it, and the case features padding inside instead of bare plastic."

Brief description source from Burris:

The Burris AR-332 is perfect for quick shooting at point-blank to intermediate ranges. 3X magnification plus the Ballistic CQ reticle provide for instinctive target acquisition. The black reticle is etched directly onto the prism with red and green light illumination available with the turn of a dial. Reticle dots correspond to bullet drop from 5.56 or 7.62 rounds, however this tough optic is built to handle much heavier recoil if needed.

The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip. This allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a fresh round into the chamber as the bolt silently glides through a polymer guide.

The cylinder is strong 400 Series stainless steel, extensively fluted to reduce weight and is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s durable Target Grey® finish. Five-shot capacity.

With large, glove-friendly buttons and an intuitive menu, you can quickly set reticle settings, zoom, and polarity palettes in three clicks or less. An internal shock reduction system (SRS-M™) is qualified for a MSR semi-automatic platform, up to .30 Cal. Plus, the durable, water-resistant casing can be submerged in up to three feet of water. Day or night, hot or cold, clear or stormy, whatever the conditions, the R-Series will deliver.
The ThermoSight R-Series is the ideal night vision, non-game hunting scope because it detects heat energy, instead of visible light. Day or night, the body heat of animals will stand out against cooler backgrounds when seen through the R-Series scope.
Conventional image intensified (I2) night vision scopes can’t match the power of thermal because they require illumination from moonlight or other sources. They also can’t reveal what’s hiding in the shadows or in low-contrast environments in the same way thermal can.
The R-Series offers up to six different detection palettes, including FLIR’s exclusive InstAlertTM, which displays the hottest temperatures in red so you can detect animals, people and other warm objects more easily.
