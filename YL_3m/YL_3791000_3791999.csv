I'm sure your questions will be answered if you read through, if not, by all means drop me a line.


AK-74 built by Waffen Werks purchased last year and has 180 rounds through it. Very accurate and functions flawlessly.

From The Website:

These high quality AK-74 rifles are built from all matching Bulgarian AK-74 parts sets. Rifles are built to exacting standards on a new U.S. made Waffen Werks receiver. Each rifle features a brand new chrome lined U.S. made barrel properly chambered for the 5.45x39 round. They have been extremely accurate.

Rifle features a Tapco G-2 trigger set and a U.S. grip and is fully 922r compliant. Accepts all AK-74 mags regardless of country of origin. Rifles also incorporate a side rail for easy installation of scope rails or accessories.

New $619.

AK-74 Accessory package, 4 30rnd parts kits, mag pouch, bayonet and oil bottle. $169

2 Tapco 30rnd parts kits $24

900rnds 7n6 ""banned"" ammo. Full case $240 Since its a partial case I'll value it at $200

AK ergo grip, so you can actually hold the rifle. $20

Kvar O.D. green ""NATO"" length stock, A inch longer to fit us decadent capitalist pigs in the West. I have both the original stock and grip that will go with it. $47

""Venezuelan"" PK-A red dot. A excellent red dot that was built for the Venezuelan Army by the Russians. The great thing about this particular sight it that it uses a regular AA battery and it sits low enough to co-witness the stock AK sights. It also allows a proper cheek weld on the rifle a huge plus. $400

Total price if bought separate $1479

My price $1200. Non negotiable!

No Trades unless your looking to trade a M1A Loaded with a stainless barrel.

I will not break up the package it's all or nothing, sorry I just don't want to deal with all the hassle. I'm in no hurry to sell, I really have no need to sell just trying to diversify my collection so the price is the price.

Don't bother contacting me saying ""I found all this stuff at the gun store for $30."" If you did, great, buy it. Don't bother telling me.

You line up the Dealer and cover the fees.

Willing to travel a reasonable distance but I'm not going to Rifle or Pueblo so lets keep it real.

Sorry to come off like a dick, but I have a low tolerance for trolls, and think we all know how this site can be sometimes."

So we both agreed on a place and time to meet tomorrow so that I could buy the rifle and the ammo.

The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols.

I have an RMR'd m&p 45 I'd like to trade for a 1911.

The mill work was performed by Bowie Tactical. Im the second owner, thus far about about 3000 rounds through the gun. 

The RMR is an early RM08 made by Trijicon, with auto adjust and an 8 MOA dot. It's a 4 digit serial number, google DocGKR and his experience with early 4 digit serial RMR08, it's one of the more robust/longer lasting options.


I'm looking for a good condition Springfield TRP, Colt XSE, Colt Rail gun, or series 70. I can also add ammo/cash for an uptrade. No bubba'd guns. This isn't going to be a safe queen, so she don't need to be pretty. I'd also trade for: 

9mm and 45 reloading supplies (powder, primers, projectiles). 
S&W model 29 
45-70 lever gun



Located in NOVA. I can meet during the week in Woodbridge or the Wal Mart in Manassas on Liberia Ave. I work a 9-5 in DC and have a family, so I can really only meet after 9 pm or early, like 6 am early, in those locations. Im not driving more than 20-30 minutes.

Text for fastest response. Cash price is [s]$1000[/s] $850. Looks like my original price was a bit out of line. Sorry about that

Stock holds 15 rounds of 22 LR and 4 rounds of .410 2.5"" or 3"" shells. These rifles are getting very hard to come by and can cost upwards of $1200.00  They make the ultimate bug out / survival gun and when in take apart they only measure 18.5"" long. The later versions of this rifle were made by both the Czech Republic for Springfield  and by Springfield USA as the ""SCOUT"" which has a trigger guard. I will sell this rifle without the sling if you so desire for less $. 
Some History: Springfield originally made the M6 for the Air Force B52 crew members in a 22 hornet / .410 with a 14 inch barrel. This is the civilian version of that gun. This is a ""SURVIVAL"" version and not the later ""SCOUT"" version. Both barrels are clean and clear of any imperfections with the 22 rifling clean & crisp. Rifle and shotgun are very accurate.

For local pick-up only. This is a real Spas 12, one of 1,850 that were imported into the U.S during the 1980's. This shotgun functions in both Semi-auto and pump action, and has a very aggressive look to it. Featured in many popular video games and movies.

This particular Spas 12 was made in 1987, according to the stamp on the receiver. The gun is Brand New, Never Fired. It comes with the Original Box, Manual and Purchase Paperwork. This shotgun has the very desirable folding metal stock, with the shepherds hook! It also has the extended shell tube. Price is absolutely firm at $1500. This is a cash only sale, and the shotgun must be picked up locally. 
Franchi SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun manufactured from 1979 to 2000. Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the United States. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 was sold to military and police users worldwide, the civilian market, and has been featured in many movies, TV shows and video games.

US firearm laws have universally blocked the importation of the SPAS-12 shotgun, because the shotgun fits under the profile of a military shotgun, additionally, in 2000 Franchi stopped production of the SPAS-12 altogether, and Franchi has since shifted its entire marketing focus towards the new and improved SPAS-15. Together, these drastic events have made the SPAS-12 a true collector's item both in the United States and abroad."

I am selling my like new Arsenal AK in 5.45, comes with one polymer mag (surplus steel reinforced) full of surplus FMJ,  This gun is practically brand new, I puchased it as an impulse buy, ran about 150 rounds through it,  runs smooth as butter with almost no recoil, like shooting a .22. I've put in a recoil buffer as well as a rubber buttpad. I have also wrapped the stock in 8 strand 550lb paracord. The proper milspec stuff, not the commercial crap. Stock still folds up nicely. This model has a side rail and a chrome lined barrel and piston. Built on a bulgarian parts kit with 90 degree gas block, threaded front post tower with proper AK-74 Muzzle brake with the large expansion chamber that actually works. Not those crapco muzzle brakes that hardly do anything. Absolutely zero mag wobble or binding. Mag releases are fast and easy wih the extended mag release. Even with rapid fire its easy to get all 30 rounds on a silhouette at 100 yards.  

Looking for cash but I would trade for a century AK-47/74+cash,  or  a sub-2000 in .40 that takes glock mags plus cash. 

Open to partial gun trades+ cash or multi gun trades. Unique and interesting firearms are an interest."

SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable operation and function.

The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.

It's amazing this system wasn't discovered long ago.  The diamond reticle ""fits"" the eye so much more natural.  Target Aquisition speed and precision are day and night difference from any other ""Iron"" Sighting system; Indeed, I would chose these over my Eotech 552 Holographic in almost all situations! The only situations I would opt for true optics would be precision distance shooting and extreme CQB, but the quick fold system allows for both on the same rail and can be deployed with the flip of a thumb if powered holographic fails. That being said, these sights still perform exceptionally well at range and in CQB. In my opinion ,and 36 years experience, they are the benchmark for non-glass optics and what every company already is copying. What follows are DIAMONDHEAD's own description and specs. 

DIAMOND Combat Sights, the D-45, MICRO-D, and Gas Block Sights are an innovative design for M4/AR15 variants. When paired together, they create the Diamondhead Integrated Sighting System (I.S.S.). By incorporating the Rear Sight's original, patented Diamond-shaped Apertures & Diamondshaped Upper Housing with the Front Sight's proprietary, patented Diamond-shaped Upper Housing, the eye can place the front sight post perfectly in the center of the rear aperture. The result - ""Faster Target Acquisition and Centering"". Diamondhead's I.S.S. has received critical acclaim from industry writers as well as Military and Law Enforcement professionals, many of whom prefer to use the Diamondhead I.S.S. as their primary sighting system.

I purchased them at jobber prices from Ashland in 1995-1996, when I still had my FFL, and still have the receipts.  They were for rifles now long gone, and never mounted.  All three are pre-Chinese manufacture, and the optics are quite clear and sharp for inexpensive scopes.  They are much better optically than the current Simmons, Pentax and Mueller scopes I've recently tried at 1000 yards, and I'd keep them, except I've found mil-dot reticles much easier to use on the various target distances of my range.  All three are Simmons Whitetail Classics, Black Granite finish, Tru-Plex reticle, 1"" tube variables with adjustable objectives, and come with factory lens caps and cartons.  I'm asking what I paid for them wholesale in 1995-1996.  Please let me know if you know of anyone interested...I'll pay the shipping if someone wants all three of them.  Thanks!

Typical post-war refurbished rifle, I have not fired it since I bought it about 8 years ago (I had 12 Mosins at one time).  Includes rifle, sling, ammo pouch with cleaning kit/oil bottle, bayonet, stripper clips, and (139) rounds of non-corrosive ammunition. The ammo is mostly Brown Bear/Golden Bear, with one box of (2) Winchester brass cased. The rifle stand shown is NOT included in this sale. Brass ends on the upper handguard too, Btw. The stripper clips are the good brass ones from eBay.

Price is $175 cash for the rifle, accessories, and ammo/clips. Face to face transaction in the New Ulm or Mankato area.  I may be willing to drive a little bit to do a deal, though.
