This is the same rifle you may have saw listed here a few weeks ago. I deactivated the listing planning to relist it nearer to muzzle loading season, because of various people wanting it and saying they were coming to get it, but they never came. If you want a brand new rifle complete with everything but the deer, here it is.
This rifle shoots great and has a 3x9 Tasco scope mounted and zeroed. Comes with 20 sabot bullets, several maxi balls, 3 packs of plastic sabots for use with 44 and 45 caliber bullets, primers, Triple 7 powder and much more. Nothing else to buy, it's all here. Even still have the box this came in. Will photograph anything on the gun you want to see, just let me know. 
If this listing is active, I still have the rifle for sale. 
I'm looking for a serious buyer instead of a tire kicker this time.

It has a combination front sight and gas block, and if it was SBR'ed it would be a very good Bulgarian clone of the AK-102. The combo FS/GB also brings the weight towards the shooter, making the rifle balance better than most AK's. This rifle was having some trouble at first, so I sent it back to Arsenal to get it fixed and now it runs like a sewing machine. Arsenal also gave it a new coat of paint while they were working on it, so it looks and and feels like it's brand new. This rifle is fully 922r compliant, even with foreign magazines, and it features Arsenal's high quality US made furniture. The folding stock is especially impressive, very comfortable to use and locks up very tight.

AUTOCOMP is extremely fine in the 38 Super, 9mm, 45 ACP and 40 S&W race guns. It’s just the perfect burning speed to feed the compensators with a higher volume of gas. With AUTOCOMP competitors get off faster shots with minimal muzzle flash, it’s a winner."

This is all original with every correct part that was issued on the M40A1.  This is not a standard production weapon.  It was built by a 2112 armorer in Quantico back in 1997 as a personal rifle.  I have shot this rifle and worked up an M-118LR load tailored to the MST-100 for bullet drop and every round fired recorded in the log book with target descriptions and cleaning record.     If you know what this is then you understand the value and the rarity of a rifle like this.  I have the build sheet for reference.   Serious inquiries only for more info and better photos.   Extras included.   The MST-100 is one of the hardest scopes in the country to find.  This weapon is legit, which is why the price is so high.  I have way more in it than I'm selling it for.  This came from Dan of DD Ross Co.   I have other USMC original M40's as well but the price is much higher than this.   Email me if you are interested but please don't waist my time.

Made of 7CR17MOV steel with an attractive satin finish, the 3.63-inch partially serrated, folding blade has a clip point shape that allows a quicker and deeper puncture upon insertion, sharpens easily and makes quick work of any task. This knife features a Lockback, which uses a lockbar with spring tension to hold the blade safely in the open position. The ergonomically contoured and well-balanced handle has a black finish and is made of a high strength, abrasion and impact resistant glass-reinforced nylon that will fit comfortably in your hand. A black nylon sheath with a hook and loop closure and secure clip attachment is included to keep the Magnadot 2.0 safely protected and close to you at all times.

The Magnadot is a meaty folder. It has substance and you know it when it is in your hand. A traditional and reliable pattern that will give years of reliable use, the Magnadot is more turtle than hare. Easily opening the formidable 3.63-Inch half serrated blade with one hand gives you a sense of power. The Magnadot includes a lockback feature and is one of the oldest locks in use today. It's a great mechanism that locks up very securely. The lever on the back edge of the handle catches in the tang of the blade and locks it, while with one press on the back of the lever, unlocks the blade in this ambidextrous and safe to operate feature. The glass reinforced nylon handle is high strength, abrasion and impact resistant. The handle also offers a chemical resistance to common chemicals such as motor oil, transmission fluid, and methanol. Magnadot... it is happening big. This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in manufacturing and materials.

Romanian manufacture, imported and stamped by CAI.

Barrel length is 7.5"", action is the reliable AK-47 type, semi auto

Improvements include:
-hogue pistol grip
-midwest industries quad rail forearm
-single-point sling attached by rear-mounted sling mount
-TRUE Bulgarian 4-piece muzzle brake/flash hider
-three magazines, including metal 30 round, and two Tapco plastic 10 round

I will include the original forearm (as pictured, i gave it a slight re-finish to darken and seal), the original muzzle attachment, and all accessories described above.

The Bulgarian muzzle brake really reduces muzzle flash and recoil.  Quad rail worked great with the laser and red dot that I had mounted.  Single point sling works well for using Israeli Defense Force technique. 

No need to SBR this due to single point sling, but it is a good candidate if one wanted to attach a vertical foregrip and stock and get appropriate tax stamp.

Feel free to make offers.  I think this is a fair price with all the upgrades and lack of current importing of this firearm, but am willing to work with the market."

The upper is from Palmetto State Armory. I bought it new off of Armslist for this build. It has a 16"" barrel chambered in 5.56 with a carbine length gas system and a YHM Phantom flash hider. Installed on the upper is a Seekins Precision SAR 9"" free float rail. The ambidextrous charging handle is from Rainier Arms (the Raptor), and the bolt carrier group is by Rainier Arms as well.

There's well over $1300 invested in everything together. Asking $1000. The only trades I'm looking for are Smith and Wesson revolvers.

It's the ultimate goose gun, buy your own chokes, but I have all original furniture barrel and spring/ follower. The stock gives excellent radial control and it just feels right. It's heavy enough when fully loaded to absorb most of the recoil. Long barrel max ammo load, check your local laws. For hunting the limiter will have to be put in rendering the massive shell capacity useless while hunting. Abide by local laws. This is new, less then 50 rnds put through to test the hicap tube."

These older models are pretty uncommon and have more classic slide serrations and rollmarks (which I prefer). This gun has a matte nickel slide and barrel and a stainless frame. It can be fired in double action or single action and has a very nice, smooth, light trigger pull. Has a 5"" barrel and stainless steel full length guide rod. Slide action on this gun is extremely smooth and very nice. Comes with one stainless Mecgar 15 round mag (17 round mags are available). Has a frame mounted safety similar to the 1911s, this one is ambidextrous and very easy to work while maintaining a positive ""click"". This gun was built in 1990 and must have been a safe queen because it is in 99% new condition with only a couple extremely small handling marks

I paid $6.99 each for these (they were on sale, original price was $14.99 as seen on label), a total of $153.78 ($6.99 X 22 = $153.78).  I originally bought 40 of these because they were so cheap, I have used 18 of them and they work great in my DMPS, I'm selling the other 22 (new, never used) because I need some fast cash and really have no need for 40 magazines.

I'm asking $40 FIRM!  Cash only.  I'm located in Brooklyn Park right off 694 & CR81,  I'd be willing to drive nearby the Brooklyn Park area.  Call / text REDACTED if interested."

Up for sale is a Daniel Defense upper receiver. This upper does NOT include a rail system or a bolt and carrier group. They actually come this way from Daniel Defense. It's somewhat of a build it your own type of thing. When you receive these from DD you have to add your own rail or hand guards, a BCG and a charging handle. I'm going to include a BCM Gunfighter charging handle though as I have a spare.

This one has the newer style Daniel Defense front sight post / gas block on it which doesn't have a bayonet lug or sling point. This is not a ""ban"" type item, this is just Daniel Defenses newer front sight post offering. This sight post is the same height as the F-Marked units most of you already know. If you walked into a store and bought a brand new DDM4 that has a FSP this is what you would get.

Will also include the front hand guard retaining ring if you wish to run something like the drop in KAC RAS or MAGPUL MOE hand guards.

This upper also has a factory original COLT A1 tear drop style forward assist installed on it. This is an actual 1966 COLT factory part, not a cheap DPMS unit. Bought it brand new still in the wrapper. If your into SOCOM BLOCK builds, you will know why this is there! ;)

Barrel specs: 16 inch M4 Government profile, 1/7 twist rate, cold hammer forged.

Asking $350.00 dollars.

Up for sale is a Daniel Defense upper receiver. This upper does NOT include a rail system or a bolt and carrier group. They actually come this way from Daniel Defense. It's somewhat of a build it your own type of thing. When you receive these from DD you have to add your own rail or hand guards, a BCG and a charging handle. I'm going to include a BCM Gunfighter charging handle though as I have a spare.

This one has the newer style Daniel Defense front sight post / gas block on it which doesn't have a bayonet lug or sling point. This is not a ""ban"" type item, this is just Daniel Defenses newer front sight post offering. This sight post is the same height as the F-Marked units most of you already know. If you walked into a store and bought a brand new DDM4 that has a FSP this is what you would get.

Will also include the front hand guard retaining ring if you wish to run something like the drop in KAC RAS or MAGPUL MOE hand guards.

This upper also has a factory original COLT A1 tear drop style forward assist installed on it. This is an actual 1966 COLT factory part, not a cheap DPMS unit. Bought it brand new still in the wrapper. If your into SOCOM BLOCK builds, you will know why this is there! ;)

Barrel specs: 16 inch M4 Government profile, 1/7 twist rate, cold hammer forged.

Asking $350.00 dollars. 

Will also trade for some higher end fishing gear. Looking for a St. Croix Tournament Bass rod, some type of higher end Shimano bait caster, spinning reel/rod sets etc.

Could also use a bow mounted trolling motor."

The Shock Suppression System built into the new X-Series protects the xenon-filled incandescent lamp from the abuse of recoil and impact. The enhanced MIL-SPEC design allows the airtight X-Series to be exposed to the world's harshest environments.

SLIDE LOCK
Insight's Patented Slide-Lock mounting system allows the tactical illuminators to be mounted and removed instantly without tools. Most commonly used on handguns, the Slide-Lock mounting system is a great advantage to operators who transition between multiple handguns and shoulder-fired weapons.

I have a Ghillie Suit that I made a couple years ago thinking that I would use it to call coyotes back home in South Dakota. Well, I have not had the time and now need to sell it to make room in my garage. I am a retired Marine and had a bunch of friends that were snipers. A long time ago they showed me how to make a good quality ghillie suit. I made it just how they taught me. I have only put it on a couple times. It has never been out side, I keep it in a sea bag. It is a 2 piece ghillie, made of a flight suit (3x large) and the hood is a boonie hat with netting. Elbows, knees, and chest are reinforced with canvas and padding. All the netting that I used is from a tennis court net. Very durable. Most of the jute that I used is from old burlap sacks, I also used some jute from a spool, and a little bit of bailing twine just to break up the texture. The netting was attached with heavy duty fishing twine. If you have any other questions, shoot me a text or give me a call.
