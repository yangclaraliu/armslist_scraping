Overall this firearm is like new with only minimal buff marks as you get in polished stainless steel; no rust or pitting anywhere. Has fully adjustable rear sight with a red ramp front for good visual alignment. Bore is excellent, timing is perfect, and cylinder locks up tight with very little play. I’m the original owner and had purchased this revolver while stationed in Europe in 1995 to let my youngest son use at the range to learn to shoot. It probably has less than 1000 rounds through it and has been stored for most of its life.
These go online for between $250-$450 since they’re not traded very often, and I’m asking a very reasonable $300 (firm price) for what will likely be a lifelong shooter."

Product Description:

At 5″ tall with a barrel length of just under 4″, the Compact model shaves a little more than 3/4″ off the length and about 1/2″ off the height of the full-size CZ 75. Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line."

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

The is a police model meaning extra attention was made when putting the gun together. Everthing is nickle plated for easy maintenance and longevity. The stock was replaced with the mesa tactical LEO telescoping recoil stock kit. Basically the stock now has a hogue pistol grip with an adjustae M4 stock with a buffer tube that is a hydraulic piston that reduces recoil to next to nothing combined with the limbsaver pad on the back of the stock. The safety was replaced to a vang comp oversized dome safety that allows for disengagement without regrip. The barrel is 18"" with rifle sights and a smooth bore. Also the gun is set up for quick detach sling swivels. The gun holds 6+1 shells and has a 3"" chamber.

I think that is everything. The gun shoots amaziningly and with the stock you get the reliability of a pump gun but the low felt recoil of a semiauto. The model number is 25047. This gun will last a lifetime.

Elite Piston AR-15   16""","Southwest, Columbia, Missouri","$ 1,500","Listed On: Sunday, February 22, 2015",Rifles,no type,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Check around Gunbroker, etc. you will not find a Piston Elite for less than $1800 and many are over $2000, and don't forget shipping and transfer fees on top of that!  Also this rifle has a factory installed 2-stage trigger included.  This is an early serial number (somewhere under 30) and will no doubt become a collector's item increasing in value.  Below are the specs which will explain why this is a revolutionary piston AR.  Regrettably I must sell to fund another purchase.  Nikon M-223 4-16x42 BDC 600 scope and matching mount ($600 value) available for $500.  Face to face cash sale to CCW or other proof of legality of gun ownership required.

B.E.A.R. (Brown Enhanced Automatic Rifle) models from Adcor Defense feature a patent-bearing, gas piston system with a free-floating barrel for increased accuracy. This is due to the piston's incorporation into the
upper half of the forward rail system - so it never touches the barrel.
Extremely close machine tolerances eliminate the need for piston rings. 
With a tool-less field strip design, a B.E.A.R. requires nothing more than
a firing pin to disassemble, yet remains strong. The piston's cyclical rate for a controlled rate of fire adjusts with a turn of the gas plug located in the front piston assembly. Because diminished heat reaches the upper, hot gases and carbon particulates are prevented from entering the receiver, lubricant lasts longer and maintenance is simplified. Due to superior design, the B.E.A.R. has no carrier tilt and low fouling of the chamber and action. The ejection port wiper prevents the entry of dust, sand and other debris by moving into the ejection port opening flush with the inside geometry of the upper receiver. The spring-loaded shield allows the bolt carrier to return to ready position. Being made of a highly-durable, self-lubricating polymer helps the shield withstand temperature extremes.  The B.E.A.R. Elite series features a few upgrades, including a Magpul MOE rifle stock and Magpul MOE ergonomic rifle grip with aggressive texturing for a sure grip. The chrome-lined barrel from FN Manufacturing has 1:7 twist and is hammer-forged with a M249 rifling profile for long life and exceptional accuracy. It also has a forward-placed, ambidextrous charging handle. It has a two-piece key-locked, highly-rigid quad-rail system made of aircraft-grade 7075-T6 aluminum alloy that seamlessly mounts to the upper receiver made from the same aircraft-grade 7075-T6 aluminum alloy.  The upper and lower rails separate with the push of a button - no special tools required."

The condition of the rifle is very good, aside from a couple scratches on the rifle's finish. I have not had the opportunity to fire this weapon for several years given the lack of outdoor  ranges in my area that can accommodate the size and power of this weapon.

It eats any ammo you feed it flat nose or round nose. These are in the same bracket as RIA, and I've never had a problem in some 200+ rounds. Comes with one 8+1 mag (any 1911 mags fit this weapon) and 30 rounds or so of fmj. Nice crisp trigger pull with no slack at all. They sell for 400+tax, and this firearm is well worth every penny of that. Really wanting to trade because I can't afford to buy .45 ammo anymore for fun lol!

The Ballmers give another quarter million to support I-594
Posted by Joseph O'Sullivan

Steve Ballmer’s been in the news quite a bit lately: keeping busy with basketball teams (and more basketball teams)  and stepping down from the Microsoft board.

And the former Microsoft CEO and his wife are continuing to add to the big-dollar campaign in support of Initiative 594, which would expand background checks on firearms purchasers. Ballmer and wife Connie each donated $125,000 – for a total of $250,000 – to the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility’s independent expenditure group in support of the campaign. The records appeared today on the state’s campaign disclosure website, though the donations are dated Sept. 4.

I-594 would expand background checks past what is currently covered by federal law to include people buying guns online or at gun shows, as well as many personal transfers of guns. The Ballmers have now donated $830,000 to the campaign, which has also seen big donations by Nick Hanauer, Bill and Melinda Gates, Paul Allen and Michael Bloomberg’s gun safety advocacy group.

Opponents of I-594 have called the deep-pocket donors elitists who want to buy an election. Alan Gottlieb, chairman of the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, even challenged Gates to a debate.

Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility has now raised north of $7.3 million for the initiative, which voters across the state will approve or reject this fall."

First off, this is a really light rifle for a 20"" barreled weapon.  On my scale the complete rifle weighs ls 6lbs 5oz including the BCG and charging handle. And that's with a 20"" barrel and a 13"" hand guard.  Of course it's a BCM Keymod and a Fulton Armory light weight barrel.  It's been out to the range twice, and has had about 100 rounds fired through it. So it's basically not really even broken in.

Fulton Armory has a well established reputation for making very accurate barrels, and this one definitely backs that up.  It's fitted to a VLTOR MUR-1A upper, and equipped with a VLTOR/BCM Gunfighter charging handle.  The Shadow Ops Weaponry billet lower is a perfect match and the Rock River National Match 2 stage trigger will help your accuracy dramatically.  Everything is brand new (other than the trips to the range), so you can see where a scope has been attached but everything else is perfect.   

The fire group is a custom Pacem-Parabellum-Molon Labe, completing the custom nature of the weapon.


Specs are as follows:

Upper:

VLTOR MUR-1A upper receiver 
Full auto NiB BCG
VLTOR/BCM Gunfighter Charging handle
Fulton Armory light weight 20"" match quality barrel, Chrome lined, rifle length gas, 1X8 twist, .223/5.56 finished chamber

Lower

Shadow Ops Weaponry billet multi cal lower receiver
Spikes Tactical lower parts kit
Rock River Arms National Match 2 Stage Trigger
BCM buffer extension assembly
Magpul STR adjustable stock (milspec)

The price for everything is $1000. I can meet you at an East Bay FFL for transfer, preferably K Smith in Martinez or the Gun Works in Pleasant Hill. I will include one 10 round magazine with the rifle.
