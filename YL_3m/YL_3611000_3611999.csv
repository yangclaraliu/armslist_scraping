Planned on getting it cerekoted but decided to put it on her. The guy he bought it from did some paintjob on it himself and my friend stripped the paint he put on off and did the hand guard, grip, stock, and MBUS rear sight in a flat dark earth. Can easily be stripped again and cerekoted. It looks fine minus a little bit of the finish above selector. Maybe 1000 rounds through the rifle. I've run 3 mags through it flawlessly, just want to see what I can get for it. All the accessories are the ones I got on it. He said he had about 1150 in it. Has ejection port that says semper fidelis and charging handle that says ""veritas aequitas, truth and justice"". I have the original parts as well. I can work in some 62gr green tip and mags for the right price/trade. I can answer any questions and provide detailed information upon request. Send me an offer, worst I can say is no. Not much of am interest in AR's or 5.56, which is why I'm selling it. There is a mock suppresor that came with it when I bought it but I also have the A-2 birdcage and crush washer. I don't know the brand of flashlight or green laser, but laser is very bright (visible during daytime) and the flashlight is advertised as 1000 lumens."

It has a stainless bull barrel and a free floating hand guard from the factory, comes with the two factory mags and its plastic case just like I originally got it. Gun new out the door with taxes was over a $1000.00, buy it here with no taxes or yellow paper for $900.00, if you want a 600.00 AR please go buy somebody's frankenstein ar build.

This fine single-action handgun was made in 1954 and imported in the early 90's (no import marks). Included are three magazines with aftermarket extended floorplates for fast reloads, the original holster, and the option to include 520 rounds of ammo. The CZ-52 is widely accepted to be a more robust design than the TT-33, utilizing the roller delayed-blowback action like the MG-42, HK G3, and MP5. The original rollers have been replaced with new hardened steel ones. The original firing pin has also been replaced with a hardened steel model that won't break when dry fired. The original tiny fixed sights were milled off and 1911 style Novak adjustable target sights installed- the difference is amazing compared to the factory sights. The original Bakelite grips were sealed and then painted black. The parkerized finish on the frame is in 90%+ original condition and the slide has been coated in Dark Parkerizing Gray Alumahyde II rustproof gun coating (properly cured) so it can be carried IWB without worrying about rusting from sweat. Function wise, I have never had any malfunction in 500 rounds. The decocker/safety works properly and the hammer does not contact the firing pin when decocking.

It fires the potent 7.62x25mm tokarev round which will defeat both sides of a threat level IIa bullet proof vest or one side of a level II vest with normal target grade FMJ's. The now banned 320 (of 520) hardened steel core AP rounds I am including will defeat all soft body armor up to level III. These rounds are legal to own in all 50 states, they can just no longer be imported into the country or manufactured.

The gun has a very thin profile and can be concealed as easily and sometimes better than a 1911. If you're expecting bad guys with body armor and want better penetration than a .357 SIG, this is the gun for you. Would make a perfect glove box gun to shoot through glass and sheet metal if needed to. Hollow points are available online if you are concerned about over-penetration.

The ammo available is:
100 rounds of banned Norinco mild steel core non-corrosive FMJ
100 rounds of S&B indoor range safe new production non-corrosive reloadable FMJ
320 rounds of mixed Hintenberger and another European manufacture 1955 and 1962 production hardened steel core AP. The finest 7.62 ammo ever available to civilians, last available in 1990. This ammo is mildly corrosive like most surplus stuff. It is very clean brass cased and berdan primed. I have shot through 1/4"" steel plate like it wasn't there, and I have seen it shred Kevlar helmets.

Besides defense, this is one heck of a fun gun to shoot. It sounds like a .44 magnum going off, and it has the recoil of a .45 1911. Minute of bad guy accuracy out to 150 yards from a bench, and very flat shooting. 9mm luger drop-in conversion barrels are available online.

I'm looking for a new toy, so this one has to go. 

$400 cash or $500 trade for the pistol and three mags and holster.
$600 cash or $700 trade OBO for the above plus all the ammo.

Ammo is not for sale without the gun.

The sights, modern steel upgrades, and magazines are worth $400 alone.

I am open to trades and trades plus cash for firearms and military related equipment, silver, cool stuff etc. What do you have? Worst I can say is no thanks. I am NOT interested in your used SCUBA gear, marijuana grow lights, or fish tanks.

If you are reading this, it's still for sale. 

Will meet at the Tulalip Cabelas in Marysville, WA only. Will ship overnight to your FFL at your expense for $50. Ammo ships separately for $20. Qualifies for C&R FFL sale if you have one of those and can go through normal mail that way for $15, ammo still $20.

I am a CPL holder and will only sell to US citizens 18 and older with valid ID and bill of sale. If you have a CPL or WAC card, no bill of sale is necessary.

Quality gun trades only. Prefer Handguns, because I'm out of long gun space in my safes.

BTW, some idiot wrote a post about how these guns only cost  $750, etc just because he saw a Colt Sporting rifle in FDE for that cheap. These are NOT sporters! These are high end Colt M4s and to buy one outfitted like this will cost you in excess of $1,500! So, no, I won't trade one straight across for a Glock.  And you can complain all you want because I won't trade straight for your high point rifle and lorcin 380. I will trade, but you've gotta be real & fair."

Primary Weapon Systems FSC Compensator Product Info:

The FSC30 Tactical Compensator is designed for excellent recoil reduction and combined with enough flash suppression to keep the flash out of your optics and line of sight. Now you can have both effective recoil control and effective flash reduction in one unit. Designed for .308 caliber rifles as well as rifles chambered for 6.8 SPC as long as they have the 5/8x24 RH thread pattern. Very effective recoil control making your full power battle rifle easy to control in rapid fire. Is officially designated as a non-flash suppressing device by BATFE. Precision machined from high quality steels, made in USA, with a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. This is definitely one of the best and most versatile large caliber muzzle brakes available. Recommended for self defense, tactical and competition applications. 

This muzzle brake is threaded with 5/8x24 threads which is the U.S. industry standard for .308 or 7.62mm threaded barrels. For this reason, this brake will fit the majority of .308 or 7.62mm tactical rifles available. This thread pattern is also used on some 6.8 SPC barrels and most 300 BLK barrels.

This part is 2.94"" in length, .90"" in diameter and is threaded 5/8x24 RH

I am changing muzzle devices, so therefore selling this one. Low round count. In excellent condition. Compare at $100 new.

My H&K45CT. This is a factory one, not bought as a compact and throwing in my own threaded barrel. I got it in April/May of 2013 and am the original owner. This is the V1 with single action/decocker so you can carry it cocked and locked like a 1911. It is quite slim and works great as a conceal carry gun (which I did for some time with it). If you've read anything about these you'll know the biggest (only?) complaint about them is the slippery grip, hence I did some moderate stippling to it. 
 This set up comes with:

 - HK45CT with factory night sights
 - Heinie Straight 8 tall suppressor night sights 
 - 1x 8rd mag with finger rest
 - 5x 10rd elephant foot mags
 - Raven Concealment OWB holters
 - CompTac IWB holster

 $1200 for everything, I won't part it out. FTF in the DFW area.  If you know the price of even the mags ($80ea for the 10rdrs) you'll know this is a screaming deal. I won't lie, I hope my AK74 sells before this because I don't really want to give it up. Call or text Chris REDACTED."

Its in good shape with a little bit of carry wear but nothing major worth mentioning. Comes with two 8 round magazines. Has an excellent trigger, light and breaks very cleanly with a short reset. If you aren't familiar with these they are very similar to a Kahr CW9, basically the single stack 9mm Glock has yet to make.

It carries nicely but I prefer to pocket carry so I'd like something with a shorter grip. I'd be interested in a Ruger SR9c or LC9s or an M&P Shield in trade. Might also consider J frame sized .38 special revolvers or possibly a used S&W Model 10 or the same guns mentioned in .40.

Just listed on eBay as well,so if you're interested,let's try to get it done today so i can end that listing.Just under $200 new plus the cerakote.If you have any questions,feel free to ask!

New, never-fired, in original dealer box with cardstock header intact (original price: $6.95). Made by Colt in Hartford, CT. Pen gun is stamped “COLT” (see pic). Appears to be aluminum (based on weight), but is finished in bright brass. 

Pen gun comes with original box, foam lining, 2 original, unused CS tear gas rounds and mounting bracket with screw for attaching under desk, at bedside, etc.

Cartridges are screwed onto the muzzle of the pen and the cocking knob pulled back and locked into position. To fire, simply thumb the knob down and the internal spring drives the firing pin into the primer.

THIS DOES NOT FIRE PROJECTILES/BULLETS. It is manufactured for gas cartridges only. Conversion to fire live ammo is not recommended.

This is classified as a non-lethal weapon, but not as an AOW (Any Other Weapon), thus the buyer would not need any paperwork to own the pen gun (if the gun were converted by a Class 2 manufacturer to fire live ammo, it would need to be registered with the BATFE and a $5.00 tax stamp would be required).

Incredible collector’s item. It is becoming increasingly rare to find these. 

Buyer must be over 18 years of age and please check local laws before considering purchase.

Price is firm (unless you're local, in which case I'll knock a bit off, seeing as how I won't have to ship it, and I'll try to look out for neighbors). If shipping is required, buyer must agree to pay shipping cost. I ship only to the lower 48 states."

It holds 9 rounds of the powerful .40SW cartridges in an ultra compact package that weights in at only 14 oz, making it one of the lightest .40 caliber pistol ever made!  Its smooth edges is great for CCW or as a back up weapon, along with a smooth DAO trigger that is easy to stage and control for both slow and rapid fire.
It is in excellent condition, comes with KT OEM belt clip, 3 mags plus I will throw in an extra SW 4006 stainless mag as well (Smith and Wesson 4013 TSW/4006 mags works fine for the P40)  Make no mistake, this is one power house that is a handful to shoot in such a compact package but it makes a great back up when you need it!  It is not for the faint of hearts.  I originally bought it with the intention of converting it to a .357 Sig which is even more awesome but am changing direction.  This is a discontinued model and very well sought after by KT collectors for its uniqueness.

About 200 rounds through it.  Excellent condition.  This is the all-steel frame and slide (they don't make 'em anymore), barrel just under 4” in length.  Weighs 2.2lb, heavy enough that the felt recoil is similar to a 9mm so it’s easy for anyone to shoot.  And if you run out of ammo you could probably do some serious damage just throwing it at your attacker’s head.  It was my carry gun and I love it but I'm moving out of the country and can't take it with me.  The trigger is pretty good, not too heavy or creepy but obviously not a competition single action trigger either.  Mag holds 10 rounds.  It comes with 2 mags and the original hard case.  I had the feed ramp polished and replaced the stock plastic guide rod with a stainless steel guide rod so there’s no plastic components left in the gun.  I had several custom leather holsters made for it, 2 OWB and 1 IWB.  I’m asking $450 the pistol and will include 1 holster for that price.  If you're interested in additional holsters, they're $40 each.

I also have just shy 800 rounds of .40S&W ammunition in a steel ammo can.  This is ammunition loaded using a Dillon progressive reloader, once fired bulk brass and jacketed hollow point bullets from Montana Gold Bullet.  I loaded 1000 rounds and have shot just over 200 rounds through this pistol without any issues.  I’m asking $200 for the ammunition including the ammo can.

If you’re interested in the pistol and ammunition I’ll sell them for $600 together.

Or make me an offer on any of it.  Worst I can do is say no.  Not looking for any trades except maybe a really nice .22 target rifle (no semi-autos) or .22 Browning lever action."
