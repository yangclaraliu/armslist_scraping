Retolaza Hermanos and the Stosel

Stosel No. 1 Eibar Pistol The particular gun in this story is a Stosel, and according to Gene Gangarosa it was made after the First World War, though our gun is clearly marked 1914. Hogg and Weeks in Pistols of the World state that the Stosel was made by Retolaza Hermanos of Eibar.  The Retolaza brothers had been in the pistol business since the 1890’s, when they produced ‘velo dog’ revolvers under the names Brompetier, Velo-Brom, and Velo-Mith, and were one of the firms who manufactured their own line of “Ruby” pistols to sell to the French during the war. Hogg and Weeks reveal that the name of the Russian commander at the 1904 Siege of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese war was Stossel, whose name would properly be spelled with one ‘s’ in Spanish and who would have been well known in the era. 
Hogg and Weeks believe that a Stosel automatic pistol may have been produced as early as 1906-1907, though they note that the earliest date known on one is 1912.  They state that there was a “6.35 1914 Automatic Pistol Stosel No. 1 Patent” version produced during the Great War, as well as the 7.65mm version we have here, and that the 7.65mm is identical to the ‘Liberty’ and ‘Paramount’ pistols also produced by Retolaza Hermanos in the same period.  Hogg and Weeks make no mention of the Stosel being a “Ruby” or “Eibar” type pistol, though they do mention that Retolaza “...joined in the 1915 gold rush, and appear to have continued producing cheap automatics until the Civil War put an end to their activities.”  We have no idea how the gun in our story came into the United States. It is not marked “Made in Spain,” as it would have been if it were legally imported after the war. The fact that it has straight serrations on the slide, rather than curved, may indicate later production, though most likely it simply indicates that Retolaza had better manufacturing equipment than many of its competitors."

I did this earlier in the year and it went great. there are currently 16 slots open I already have payment from myself and 3 others. If your order 2 rifles, I can drop the price to 175 each

the price is 200 firm for a single rifle, with this you get, the rifle, cleaning kit/tools and 40 rounds of ammo.   for an extra 20 I can clean the rifle, and if you want a cherry picked rifle put aside for you, that is an additional 10. It will be first come first serve once the crate arrives. The one I got in march had 6 Hex receivers on top and those went quick. there was also a refinished PU model without scope.

this is a great deal if you want the fun of plucking one from the crate and all things considered 200 for a rifle, cleaning kit and ammo is a steal. 

if I can find 15 people interested from the central Florida area the order can be put in almost asap. would like to get them ordered by end of Sept early October. This is for Local pick up only, no shipping, I do frequent the Ocala range so we could arrange a meet there as well.

Hey all,
I have a really old German Mauser 25 auto pistol that I picked up in trade. I got it with the intent of doing a little work on it and having it be a new caliber, but I have had some things come up that will be eating too much of my time. So, i would rather pass it along and let someone else enjoy her themselves. It is a model 1914 Mauser 25 acp. The serial number dated it to around 1916-17 (best i could tell at least). It is actually a comparatively low serial number (5 digit serial). It is in average condition for its age but not “bad” compared to what I’ve seen elsewhere. Has bluing wear, dings, and a  crack in grip, but is still a decent looking gun. The main issue this one has is that it jams up feeding/ejecting almost every shot. It is most likely as simple as replacing a spring or giving it a really good polishing on the feed ramp/throat. It could even be that the only 25 auto ammo i had to test her with was some cheap blazer stuff, which i have had some issues with in other guns. Either way, I simply don’t have the time to get her “fixed up” or i would and then keep her. I know that in this condition and shooting fine they sell for substantially more than what I am asking. Also, I have found most replacement parts online from normal places, so this could be a fun and easy little project! 

I would also consider trades for most any gun. Mainly looking for a 12 gauge pump that I can “modify” and turn into a “tactical” shotgun (i know, i know). Would also trade for 7.62x25 tokarev pistols, Kel Tec carry pistols, natant revolver, or even 44 magnum ammo or a lot of 7.62x54R or 6.5x55 swede ammo. Honestly, just shoot me an offer and we can go from there. Worst i can say is no!
Thanks all and happy hunting!

Federal, DPX)
I am consolidating my ammo.
I have a bunch of 45 ACP I no longer need. 40 boxes total. It is all new in the box and never opened. Some is standard pressure and some is +P. It has various weights from 185 grain to 230 grain. This is going to be a deal for someone.
I will take $11 per box. For a total of $440 for all of it. Please don't try to talk me down lower, I'm already giving it away. Face to face, No shipping, Will not split up.

The Remington boxes hold 25 rounds each box, And the other boxes hold 20 rounds each  box. Remington =325 Rounds, The others = 540 rounds, That's a total of 864 Rounds of premium ammunition. Double check my math.

Might make a great truck gun but may be much too collectable to be used as such.

It is not counter-bored and has a nice light trigger.

You can look long and hard to find an M38 that is not the typical ""refurb"" so don't miss out on this one, again the more typical refurbished M38's are getting hard enough to find but ones in this much more original condition don't come along everyday, In fact the only other non refurbed M38 rifles I had the opportunity to handle were Finnish capture.

Please do not waste my time asking to see a picture of ""the receiver"" or if this is an ""all original matching"" rifle, if it were it would be much more. I do know what it is and how unusual it is and it's fairly priced or even underpriced IMO.

The difference between the 82 and the 83 is that the 83 takes 380's.  The magazines are the same.  These two double stack magazines hold 13 rounds of 380 or 12 rounds of 9 X 18.  So, if you have an 82 and needs mags, these will work.  The pistol is in good condition with the exception of the grips.  I made the mistake of cleaning the pistol with Powder Blast, and it melted up the grips.  Thanks Powder Blast!  Everything functions perfectly and works great, but the grips are ugly!  You can get a new factory set from CZ for about $20 or other suppliers for about $15.  There are 24 rounds of high velocity hollow points and 163 rounds of FMJ ball ammo.  380 hasn't been the easiest to find lately, so that should sweeten the pot.  Nice gun.  Shoots very accurately.  Feels Great."

The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The new Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and the new profile slide (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.
