4th Generation Glock model 26 Semi Auto Pistol for sale. This is chambered in 9mm. 

The GLOCK 26 in 9x19mm has been a sought-after concealed carry option, because of its size.

High Magazine Capacity & Interchangeable Flexibility... Glock mags are interchangeable within the same caliber, and within the proper model. A full-size Glock 17′s magazines can be used in the Glock 17, 18c, 19, 26, and 34. So this sub-compact Glock 26 can be loaded with a 33 rd. magazine or any other magazine Glock makes.

A  cutting-edge 3-point safety system that utilizes a trigger safety, a drop safety and a striker pin safety, which are all spontaneously disengaged when the trigger is squeezed. There’s no thinking if this gun must be summoned for duty… just point and pull the trigger.

A larger magazine release than earlier generation Glocks; it still has a low-profile design, but the expanded surface area allows for the release to be pressed without changing grips.

For the generation 4, Glock added a new, higher grip stippling (the textured small checkered squares printed into the polymer frame, typically on areas where the hand will contact the firearm) around the entire pistol grip, and there is also horizontal line stippling on the front of the trigger and trigger guard.

Product Information

Quality hunting ammunition designed for maximum performance and reliability. Premium hunting bullets are matched with select powders, primers and brass to create a reliable, hard-hitting hunting cartridge.

GameKing Bullets are designed for hunting at long range, where their extra margin of performance can make the critical difference. GameKing bullets feature a boat tail design to bring hunters the ballistic advantage normally found with match target bullets. The streamlined tapered base of the boat tail greatly reduces drag, which results in higher retained velocity, greater striking energy, a flatter trajectory and less wind drift than comparable flat base bullets. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable cases.

Technical Information 
 •Caliber: 308 Winchester 
 •Bullet Weight: 165 Grains 
 •Bullet Style: Sierra GameKing Soft Point Boat Tail 
 •Case Type: Brass

Pay particular attention to the SKU when you are comparing prices. This isn't the cheap Sport model that can be purchased at Academy. Everything in this package is brand new except for the scope. It has only been used indoors and is in great shape. The high profile ""see through"" scope rings are new and the box is included. This gun includes MagPul MBUS sights that can be seen in the main picture. Must be an Oklahoma resident and legally capable of possessing a firearm and I will only sell face to face. Jason REDACTED"

Rifle has obviously been shot but not abused- took in trade so not aware of round count
A Well balance rife

This chest rig:
Black hawk-tan- holds 8 AR15 mags-mags have been in it, but has not left the house so it is as new.

This ammo:
2500 rnds Winchester Q3131A
1100 rnds Wolf HP - SP mixed in
1020 rnds green tip
690 rnds Remington
625 rnds marked WCCSO
100 rnds Federal value pack
20 rnds silver wolf
17 rnds tracer

Total rnds 6072-I’ll call it 6050 rnds just to insure I did not low count-after counting 6k rounds my eyes are crossing-Looked up this ammo today and its about 2500$ + and that does not include shipping

The Q3131A –is-not-the ammo that Winchester is selling today as ‘target ammo’ I bought this year’s ago as it was rated as a very good self-defense load. It’s in demand today and a quick google search does not show it for sale anyplace-again this is the Q3131A ammo

These ammo cans:
All ammo comes in as new 7.62x51 ammo cans-cans have been written on in black marker
(Type of ammo etc.) But are clean with good gaskets and no rust.

These Magazines: 28 total

 4 new mag pul 30 rnd
 1 new mag pul 10 rnd

23 Used mags: Mags are ugly! Bought them used, stripped off paint of former owner, who installed good springs and green anti tilt followers-some may be more discriminating on appearance, they ran in my last AR15 without issue


This package:
Rifle, Chest rig, 24 mags, 6000+ rounds ammo, ammo cans
I am looking for a deal that someone can drive to, as the ammo is very heavy, but willing to work on a deal with shipping all of it
Total value of all this gear if you were to buy it today is about 4000$ with rifle used, ammo costs, and quite a bit more if you include either shipping or taxes or both!
I am asking 3500$ cash and carry, will take a Springfield .308 SOCOM, or Springfield Scout, or DPMS .308 Recon as partial trade-All reasonable offers will be entertained
Cash, Gold or local PO MO for purchase
Will only ship rifle to a FFL
I will answer any questions, provide better pics and entertain any offers, I am looking to sell to purchase a M14 type package (Rifle, mags, glass ammo etc.) so take that into account for a deal

This is from JP Enterprises website. Our pursuit of perfection didn’t stop with springs though and led ultimately to the creation of the JPSCS™ Silent Captured Spring (patent pending), new for 2012. Maintaining all the benefits of our polished buffer springs and proprietary LMOS™ buffer, this combination buffer-spring assembly eliminates the friction of standard buffer components resulting in outstanding smoothness and sound abatement. What’s more, the spring is removable from the assembly for custom tuning, and both the AR-15 and AR-10 versions of the JP Silent Captured Springs are functional in rifle- and carbine-length operating systems. The AR-15 version fits and functions in any gas-operated AR-15 variant, regardless of caliber and the AR-10 version should fit and function in any large-frame AR-10-type platform. The JPSCS is not compatible with any 9mm AR variant or any blowback system using a solid (weighted) carrier. Compatibility The JPSCS-AR15 will not function with the Primary Weapon Systems (PWS) direct impingement bolt carrier. The design of the carrier will prevent the rifle from cycling."

Pocket pistols and handguns geared towards concealed carry typically lack the features of their larger, easier to shoot service pistol counterparts. That's all changed with the introduction of the Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380 Automatic.

With an actual set of full sized adjustable sights, a practical thumb safety, and a functional slide stop, you aren't giving up anything by switching to a smaller sidearm - except the hassles of carrying a large gun. Unlike most pocket pistols, the slide on the Bodyguard .380 stays open on the last shot. Takedown and maintenance are easy, thanks to the simple to use disassembly lever.

The Bodyguard is uniquely engineered to be the most state of the art, concealable and accurate personal protection handgun possible. Lightweight, simple to use, and reliable - nothing protects like a Bodyguard.

Each of these rifles is equipped with a scope rail and hammer extension that accommodates all popular optics. Rossi varmint rifles and their standard profile counterparts all feature a black synthetic stock with removable cheek piece and are equipped with Rossi's soft recoil pad and distinctive white line spacer, button rifled barrels, adjustable fiber optic sights and sling swivels. Centerfire models have an extra wide positive action extractor to ensure easy removal of the spent case when you open the breech, while the rimfire models carry a powerful ejector that reliably kicks the spent or unfired shell clear. These rifles combine four safety systems to make them as safe and enjoyable as possible. The Rossi single shot rifle incorporates a transfer bar mechanism that stops the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the hammer has been cocked and trigger has been pulled completely rearward. This helps prevent accidental firing from drops or impact. All Rossi rifles incorporate our breech lock system, which prevents the action from being opened or closed when the hammer is cocked, along with our manual hammer block safety and Taurus Security System.

It was only mounted for a short time so it's in excellent condition. The rings are 30mm. The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief. The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse. Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed. Assembly and adjustment only takes a few minutes, then off to the range."

This DVD video explains an easy way of how to convert the very popular semi-auto RUGER 10/22 .22LR rifle into a true full-auto sub machine gun. Optional full-auto template is also offered that will make the conversion faster to complete. There is no modification to the rifle's factory original receiver, bolt face, hammer, trigger, sear, disconnector, or any part of the trigger group. This is a non-permanent conversion. The full-auto converted RUGER 10/22 can be put back into its original semi-auto mode of fire. You do not need the skills of a gunsmith to make this conversion to the RUGER 10/22 rifle. This full-auto conversion functions similar to that of the reliable M3A1 sub machine gun. All other full-auto conversions for the RUGER 10/22 suffer from 'bolt-bounce / light-strike' which cause many malfunctions. The GUN SLINGER VIDEOS full-auto conversion has been tested and proven reliable. To purchase this product send a PayPal or money order.

The Bushmaster BA50. Monstrous long-range power meets long-range accuracy. The ultimate long-range target rifle, our bolt-action Bushmaster BA50 harnesses the legendary force of the 50-caliber Browning Machine Gun cartridge and delivers it downrange with hair-splitting precision. It’s tuned for long-range accuracy with a free-floating barrel. And rearward force is dramatically reduced through our high-efficiency recoil-reducing brake. In fact, it exhibits recoil similar to a 243 Win. We offer a full-length rifle with a 30"" barrel and a carbine featuring a 22"" barrel. Both come equipped with steel bipods with folding legs and are easily disassembled for cleaning like standard AR-platform rifles. The Magpul® PRS buttstock is fully adjustable, with a shock-absorbing LimbSaver recoil pad for enhanced comfort. All this, and they’re built to our unsurpassed standards for durability and quality control. If the range can be measured in miles and your groups in fractions of an inch, your rifle is a Bushmaster BA50.

When you first shoulder the Plinkster®, you'll notice the natural fit of the stock. And it's as durable as it is comfortable; the advanced polymer compounds can withstand harsh weather conditions and rugged use. The 10-round capacity metal magazine keeps you ready for non-stop action and features a last shot bolt hold-open design. Durable construction and fast action aren't all you'll get with the Plinkster® - accuracy also comes standard. A free-floating, 18"" or 21"" barrel is employed with an 8-groove, 1-in-16"" twist, locked to the receiver for long-lived reliability.

Overall it is in Good condition and functions well with 115 and 124 grain ammo.  I don't shoot 147 grain bullets, so I have not tested this one for the heavier projectiles.  It has the arched grip profile and is very comfortable to carry and shoot.  It is a back-up to my primary carry 5903 and it has served that role well, but I really want a Beretta 92 Centurion pistol, so I am putting this one up for trade.  

I have MN ID and PTC and expect the same from a prospective buyer.

     I have my fathers personal collected, very lightly used Kimber Valier Shotguns. I say personal collected because he was a Professional Wing Shooting guide in South Dakota and he was sponsored by Kimber. While guiding he used his demo guns, etc with his guests. These two were only used a few time during family and personal hunts, thus very lightly used. 

     Unfortunately he has recently passed away, and he wanted me to use find these two Sisters a home in order to helpay his final senses and debts. Together would be great but not necessary. 

     They were gradede a year and a half ago, right before coming out and suddenly slipping away. I don't have the exact terminology in front of me at the moment, but I know they were graded Excellent and have been cared for properly. Like I stated, they are Kimber Valier II  SxS 16 and 20 gauged. They both have the Blue coloring, case hardened steel, felt storage bags, custom leather and canvass cases. 

     They are fairly rare one the states. I believe they are made in Turkey. They are used by high end clientele and/or collected. If you are a collector then you know more than I most likely. If you are looking for a high end respectable shotgun to use or show off, etc. Do some research yourself. They are awesome. Luckily I son't need them and unfortunately I do need to sell them to cover his final expenses.. Thus here they are. 

     Last time they were looked over Professionally and graded, the Valued price placed on them was between $4199 - $4495 each. Now I know things change with time and location. Usually good, collectible guns increase in value. I have seen a bit of a range on these Models, although not many put there. The low seem to be offered by someone that either doesn't know what they've got or have used the heck out of them. And yes, there are some out there that apparently must also have solid gold plating!! Haha, I am not trying to take anyone and I am open to discussion. The realistic range that I have been researching and watching has been right in the ballpark of when last graded. I am just hoping to find a good home for these two sisters, if kept together, that be great but not necessary. Hopefully someone who can both enjoy some light use out of them and also enjoy having a great investment..! For the hunters, also have brand new top model Tri Tronics and RE Hunting/Shooting Sport glasses. I will provide pics, as much info, etc if you're interested. Old West attitude, can wheel and deal.

 Thank you for the look,
