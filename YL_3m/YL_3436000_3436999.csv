""SLIM"" is the name of this suave new entry into the Taurus line. No revealing lumps or lines makes concealed carry easier than that larger capacity gun you already have. Cool, neat and ready to go-the Taurus Slim will be your companion for a long time to come. New unique single action/double action trigger system. The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point. The trigger resets to double action until another round is chambered.

HOGUE® TRACTION PANELS

Stay in control of your shot with Hogue Overmolded® traction panels, designed to give shooters a secure grip in any condition.

T/C’s 5R Rifling delivers superior accuracy by causing less bullet deformation, giving greater bullet stability over multiple shots.

With an MOA accuracy guarantee for all 16 available calibers, your T/C Venture Weather Shield will be protected and accurate in any condition.
IN THE FIELD:  OUTSMART THE ELEMENTS WITH THE T/C VENTURE WEATHER SHIELD

For Thompson/Center hunters, the hunt doesn’t stop when weather conditions change. From early mornings watching the sunrise to snowy days when you’re listening for your prey to move through icy ground, the Venture Weather Shield is designed to keep up. This innovative Weather Shield coating has been tested to be 50x more corrosion resistant than stainless steel.
After 350 hours of exposure to the elements, stainless steel showed wear and rust while Weather Shield coating remained impervious. Applied to all critical metal parts (the exterior of the barrel and receiver), T/C’s Weather Shield provides tough-as-nails protection that keeps your Venture performing at its best on every hunt.

I can add two different front sight blocks. First one is a Bulgarian sight block off an AK74 with the brake which has been modified to allow a 7.62 round to pass through and if I might say is an amazing brake. Not only does it help in reducing recoil, it does a damn good job at suppressing flash. I can also put the original non threaded fsb or leave it as is in case you want to thread the rifle yourself. Upgrades are as follows. 

1. Recoil buffer
2. Hogue grip
3. Fuglystick custom handguard
4. Afg
5. Ace skeleton stock
6. Cnc warrior left side folding stock
7. Solar tactical MFER
8. Tapco axis pin retaining plate
9. Texas AK trigger

Just so you know, this is not a princess rifle. It has been well taken care of but it's meant to be shot. This is my go to rifle and my rig is set up for it, I'm just looking to fund another build. 

Price is $1000 with original FSb, $1050 with Bulgarian FSB and brake.

If you search around, you'll find that the Bulgarian brake and fsb will run about $100. It's an easy way to not have to thread your rifle but still get a reliable and good muzzle attachment. Will also sell the brake and fsb for $80. It's a direct fit to a 7.62 Saiga. Also has bayonet lug which allows for an AK74 bayonet to be added with the brake on.

Our introduction of +P 9X18 Makarov ammunition is the result of numerous customer requests. With no high quality +P ammunition available for the millions of Makarov pistols that are now in America, the American 9X18 pistol owner has no viable/effective self defense ammo for use in these high quality pistols, until now.
I am not a fan of using expanding bullets for self defense in smaller less powerful cartridges like the 9X18 or the 380 auto, as the expansion of these light weight smaller bullets often limits the penetration required to incapacitate the threat, but there are circumstances where the use of expanding ammo is an advantage. For more information on this subject, please read our ""technical article"" on ""The Use of Expanding Bullets in Small Defensive Cartridges"" posted under the ""Technical Articles"" category on our home page.
This new 95gr. JHP+P, 9X18 Mak loading, (Item # 34A) is roughly 200 fps faster than normal ball 95gr. Makarov ammo. This new +P load also features flash suppressed powder as roughly 95% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light, when the criminal element is active. This ammunition will not blind the shooter in low light situations, which is an important tactical advantage.
This ammo was reliable and quite accurate in our test guns. We noted no accelerated wear from the use of +P loads in our test pistols, although common sense suggests that any +P ammo will wear any pistol at a faster rate than weaker ammo. Please note the below real world velocities from our stock over-the-counter test guns
1.       1150 fps—East German Makarov, 4 inch barrel
2.       1192 fps—CZ 82, 4 inch barrel"

Instead of needing to buy a completely different firearm for your big-handed self and your small-handed girlfriend, now you only need to buy a new smaller frame for her at a cost of about $50.

If you want to change from a 9mm to a 45ACP gun you don’t need a new firearm, just pay $350 to your parts supplier of choice and a conversion kit will arrive at your doorstep with everything you need to get running with your new chosen caliber…no FFL required. Or if you want to go from a full size gun to a compact carry version, $400 for a new barrel and grip is all you need.

The RO™ is designed to give the shooter exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model, at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs.

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

For sale is the following:


A lightly used Glock 22 .40SW, third generation, RTF2 frame

No more than 500 rounds through it, always cleaned and properly oiled after firing

The RTF2 frame is amazing, it feels very solid in your hands even if it is raining, with sweaty hands, or while wearing gloves

Comes with the original Glock magazines and box


A Lone Wolf 9mm conversion barrel

Less than 200 rounds through it, very good condition

Just as accurate as the stock barrel, and the recoil is so little that you might feel like you are shooting a pellet gun (But much more fun!)

Comes with two magazines. One normal capacity made by Glock, and one high capacity magazine not by Glock


Crimson Trace Lasergrips

Last sighted it in at 30 feet, but you will probably need to adjust it again when you put it back on the grip.

Like new condition, used it a few times at the range and that's it.

Comes with the original cleaning supplies and box


An inside-the-waistband holster. Unknown local maker, very comfortable. Worn very few times, has some wear marks. It should form nicely to a new body since it is leather.



WA driver's license required, CCL greatly preferred. I'd like to sell it all as a single package, but I will consider selling individual items. I am selling because I need the money, and I am no longer interested in owning a gun. No trades please."

When the first all-steel small frame (J) revolver was introduced in 1950, it became an instant success. Originally named the Chiefs Special by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, it has become the first choice for those who insist on an all steel, small frame revolver with greater recoil control and proven performance.  The Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular small frame personal defense revolver on the market. With decades of reliable performance to its credit, the J-frame line offers models capable of firing .22 LR, .22 Magnum®, .38 S&W Special and the more powerful .357 Magnum® loads.  Smith & Wesson offers these revolvers from our production, M&P, Pro Series, and Classics lines in three diverse hammer designs; internal, exposed and shrouded.

I have literally sold 4000 rounds in the last 3 hours. They are all gone. I had some boy scouts, enthusiasts, and families stop by and grab some. I'm glad I was able to get some ammo in the hands of people who needed it, if only to take away from the jerks who are gouging people. 

Hey all,
Do you need some .22LR ammo and are sick of A-holes buying it at Wal-Mart and marking it up? I can help. I'm sick of it, like really sick of it. So I am offering 500 rounds of .22LR for $25. It is a mix of HP's, RN and FMJ. Most is new in box Remmy RN. But there are some super X HPs and Remmy HPs in there too. I have multiple lots of these available, however they are one per person, the only possible exception is if you are a Boy Scout troop leader and can bring proof that you are. You must email me with your Armslist user account email so I can make sure you aren't just going to resell this. If you brought along your Boy Scout son who just wants to shoot his Rascal .22LR...all the better. If you don't prove to me that you don't already have 6 .22LR ammo listings up on Armslist I won't sell it to you. If you are an honest person who just needs some .22LR to shoot, come pick it up in Boulder. I hate to have to police it like this, but I want to make sure that people aren't taking advantage. I'd like to make sure that kids learning to shoot and people hunting small game to feed their families get the opportunity to do so.

This course is open to the General Public and is NOT a factory certification course.

This course is an outstanding opportunity for 1911 shooters to come out and learn more about their weapon from a real world professional custom gun builder. The course is designed to teach the student how to disassemble, assemble, and maintain the 1911 style pistol. It will cover all the common malfunctions and breakages as well as some of the harder-to-discern wear and durability areas.

This is not a course on how to be a custom gunsmith, but rather a course designed to help users of 1911 style pistols identify, analyze and solve problems. Keeping your 1911 up and running in the real world.

Detail stripping, safety and function tests, proper cleaning and maintenance, factory guns and the issues with them (engineered in problems), Extractor issues/fitting, failure to feed, failure to extract/eject.

Prerequisite: You will need your own weapon to work on. We do not rent weapons for the Armorers course. Additionally, you will need protective gear, and tools (see below).

At the conclusion of this course, you will be proficient at disassembly, reassembly, cleaning, lubrication, identification of worn or damaged parts, and parts replacement. You will be trained in diagnosing and fixing recurring malfunctions. After-market parts and modifications are discussed, with an emphasis on what products work and what products won't. Additionally, you will know the best parts manufacturers to choose from and which ones to avoid. This course is a must if you want to glean the decades of experience We Clean Guns - Firearm Service Center`s staff has in keeping your weapons running properly.

The course will cover(but is not limited to):
Brief history, design, nomenclature, variants, features and controls
Field disassembly, reassembly and function check
Theory and cycle of operation/Fire control theory
Complete detailed disassembly and parts identification
Reassembly, inspections and function checks
