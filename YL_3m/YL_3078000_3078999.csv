This energy can penetrate up to two cumulative inches of clothing, or one inch per probe.

In 1999, the ADVANCED TASER M26 began a global revolution in law enforcement. The first electronic control device with true Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) technology, the TASER M26 became the first system short of lethal force that could truly stop aggressive, focused combatants. Field-proven with over ten years of worldwide use, the M26 continues to be a work-horse for many law enforcement agencies, and now is also available to civilians, security personnel, and fugitive recovery agents. The TASER M26 is compatible with the same TASER cartridges used in the TASER M18, M18L, X26, & X26C. With a range of up to 15 feet, the M26 offers the proven capability to incapacitate dangerous subjects with minimum risk of serious injury.

Looking for my Glock 22 #0247 DNR. It was pawned at a store I n Calhoun and sold to a guy locally. The person that pawned it was a family member but I won't prosecute just want to buy the gun back.

Offering a finders fee plus buying the gun back to anyone that can arrange the hook up. Makes some money for your self and no one looses. Just going to buy it back . Carried the gun during the Olympics and was going to give it to my son when he gets older and I'm to old. REDACTED Thanks for any help"

This rifle has been labeled as the ""worlds most popular rifle"". This old girl has been around since 1901 putting meat on the table for multiple generations. She sports a 26"" Nickel Steel barrel...half round and half octagonal, crescent steel butt plate and she has managed to make it thru all of these years with out being drilled for swivels or for a scope. Front and rear leaf folding sight are original to her, the stock appears to be original as well as I can tell...no cracks, only several light dings and dents. Looks like someone tried to carve a very small crown or flower at the base of the fore end...obvious light surface rusting and blemishing on the receiver sides and bottom, several scratches on the barrel in multiple places but remember she is over 100 years old. Bore shows heavy rifling with light surface rust possibly...no pitting that stands out to the eye. I think this is a great collectors rifle even tho she shows signs of being used and carried many years. She must have made someone very happy."

The cold hammer-forged barrel has a polygonal profile while the slide is made from a solid bar of nitro-carburized steel. Following recent trends in modern pistol design, the P2000 makes extensive use of impact-resistant polymers to reduce weight and production costs. As with other recent Heckler & Koch pistol designs, the P2000 is modular to suit individual needs. For instance, the grip is modular with exchangeable backstraps, allowing the user to customize the pistol's grip size and feel. There is a universal accessory rail built into the dust cover in front of the trigger guard that allows for the use of tactical lights, laser pointers and other accessories. This is in contrast with the USP series which uses a proprietary H&K mounting rail that limits the types of accessories that could be used with the pistol. The P2000 is a hammer-fired pistol with an exposed spurred hammer; a bobbed hammer is optional. It has an ambidextrous slide lock and a fully ambidextrous magazine release installed in the trigger guard."

This rifle is the 3rd model and was manufactured in 1915.  Overall condition of metal and wood is good considering the age of the rifle.  No rust on the exterior of the metal - just normal patina with the bluing faded and worn away. There is one of two handguard screws missing, other than that all parts are there and the rifle is fully functional.  The bore is bright and rifling is present but there is some minor pitting in the bore.  The wood is in very good original condition with no cracks or significant dings although there is a small notch filed into the pistol grip of the buttstock on the under side just behind the lower tang of the receiver.  No idea what the notch signifies but it must have been placed there by an owner long ago after some kind of achievement with the rifle.  Serial number is 552079 and additional pictures are available upon request and I have many pictures that can be emailed of all parts of the rifle.  This is a nice rifle to add to a collection and I think it would be difficult to find one in better condition at this price.  This is an estate item and the price is firm.  Thank you for looking.  Available for face to face pick up in Stillwater, MN or I will ship it to a FFL or C&R holder for $25.00 shipped in a carefully packed rifle box from the CMP.  Price is $550.00 - not interested in trades.  THIS RIFLE IS SOLD PENDING RECEIPT OF FUNDS!!"

678,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3078678,For Trade:  Berkeley County seizing weapons from vehicle,"Moncks Corner, Charleston, South Carolina",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, June 5, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have brought this up again because it is time for elections in Berkeley County and the Sheirff's office is at stake. Know your rights when it comes to legally storing your weapon in your vehicles according to state law and while carrying/ or not with your valid CWP.
1) State Law prohibits local municipalities from taking your weapon from your vehicle.
""Officer safety"" is satisfied when you are standing outside your vehicle or seperated from your weapon. 
2) Officers cannot seize your property unless you are under arrest.
SC code section 23-31-520
This article denies any county, municipality, or political subdivision the power to confiscate a firearm or ammunition unless incident to an arrest. 
If you are being arrested and your car is being impounded they can seize the weapons in your vehicle. That's it.
3) If you are a CWP holder and your gun is not on your person, you do not have to present your CWP in a traffic stop. This has been mistaught in many CWP classes. If your gun is stored legally in accordance with state then you are not carrying a concealed weapon. This has been corrected my CWP instructor and was verified with the SLED head of CWP program.
Funny. I will probably still show mine. Just seems like a nice thing to do. Never had any issues in other municipalities.
4) See MIchigan v. Long, 103 S. Ct. 3469 (1983)
Search the above court ruling to read where they denied the right to search for and seize weapons for ""officer safety""unless certain criteria were met. Namely the officer has to consider you dangerous and believe that there is a reasonable chance that you can get away from him and back into your vehicle to get your weapon, if there is a weapon.
I wasn't even so much as patted down even after presenting a cwp so the officer certainly wasn't afraid as he turned his back on me to enter my vehicle with me directly behind him.
Since I did not pose a threat to the officer and I was not under arrest, he can not enter my truck and confiscate my property.
Three lawyers agreed that my civil rights were violated but there was no financial loss substantial enough for them to sue unless I shelled out cash. And honestly, I am not the sueing type. I just don't want bad cops, or bad departments with ""unspoken or unwritten policies"" patrolling Berkeley County or anywhere else I may roam.
I kept an arrest journal of every contact I had with the officer and his supervisor. I will gladly share the information with you. The supervisors comments are the most shocking, especially when posed a question about entering my house. I have asked for recordings of all of the interactions but was told none of them were recorded. The stop was not recorded either but I recorded the second half.
I contacted Sheriff DeWitt about this and spoke with him twice. I can only assume that his inaction on this matter means 1) he supports the actions taken, 2) made this unspoken policy, or 3) has no control over his department.
This interaction coupled with statements made by DeWitt after Sandy Hook leads me to the conclusion that our Sheirff and his department's philosophy on gun control when dealing with law abiding citizens does not match that of his constituents. 
What do you think? Have you kept up with the frequent mishandling of gun control issues across the country by local municipalities and the militarization of local enforcement agencies with federal monies? We need a pro-2nd ammendment sheriff who will see to it that his deputies operate in accordance with state law and the mandates of the Supreme Court. It is election time. This is an important election at an important time.

FYI-
I have MANY friends in law enforcement and all agree with my position on this. Not one offered an argument in favor of the officer or supervisor especially after learning that 1) the officer did not check me for weapons after presenting a card saying that I have one on my person 2) knowing that I am 235lbs of scary looking redneck and the officer turned his back on me while I hovered over his shoulder 3) The officers unfamiliarity with my SERPA holster leading to him repeatedly (and laughably) yanking on a loaded weapon.
Number one comment from cop buddies(and gun buddies) is officers are not trained on how to operate every firearm system and it is unreasonable to assume that they can all clear every weapon without incident. Many guns can be stored in vehicles and they can all function differently or even malfunction because of miscare by the owner and officers take a risk in handling unknown weapons. 
Ever tried to check a Phoenix HP-22 to see if it is loaded(total pain in the ass)? Ever pulled a slide back and have an unintended discharge due to a broken firing pin? Ever seen a cop mishandle a weapon and shoot himself in the foot (youtube)? Ever seen anyone accidentally shot while standing next to someone who is trained in firearms mishandling a weapon?

After my last post I received numerous emails with the same story. One from Richland County as well but his weapon was concealed on his person. 
Think about it folks... Can your local cops take your guns from your home if they see them while checking a complaint about dogs barking? NO but I had a BCSD supervisor tell me yes. Can BCSD seize a weapon from your vehicle that is stored lin accordance with state law during a routine traffic stop? State law says NO, but it happens and is apparently supported even though I was repeatedly told that IT WAS NOT A WRITTEN POLICY.  Officer safety is satisfied when you are outside your vehicle away from your gun. Hell, I haven't been seperated from my gun or asked to exit the vehicle in two stops with Goose Creek PD and one with Moncks Corner. (tail light malfunction, I am not a regular offender, Truck's getting old)
This is the wrong time to have this kind of law enforcement mentality.
This is a second and fourth ammendment issue right here in Berkeley County.
This isn't something going on in Nevada or New York. Call your neighbors with the Gadsden Flag on their house and the DeWitt sign in their yeard and let them know they are quite mistaken about his policies, and perhaps character."

He wants $50 for one box or $90 for both. This isn't my ammo, so I can't negotiate on the price. He said that he doesn't know when he'll be able to replace it again, so he won't part with it unless he can get a good price for it. It is high, but not much more than I've seen it on the shelves for lately, and you don't often find it on the shelves. I know we're all accustomed to paying $0.05/round, but that reality hasn't returned since the gun craze after the school shooting. Hopefully some day soon things will get back to normal. I'd like to get back to indiscriminately firing a box of rounds in an afternoon, and not questioning the cost.

I personally had nothing to do with the coating. it is NOT paint. 
i have an official appraisal.  

DESCRIPTION ; Smoothest firing revolver youll ever own. it is an original with less than 25 rounds put threw.
had it appraised, at right around 2800-3000$. i do have the box and this particular one has been duracoated (will not rust or degrade, and will not desolve to oils) . it was previously owned by a secret service member in the family as used as nothing less than a carry gun in the 90's. he has long since passed, and now its up for grabs (hope that doesnt sound to harsh) there has only been one owner to this fine example of a revolver.

honestly id keep the gun ,but i want something more practical. this is really a collectors gun for colt collectors. as its discontinued.

Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories.
