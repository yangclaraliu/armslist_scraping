In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, Taurus took this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.

I will not be able to drive for a long time. I have a 91 mustang roller project and a motorcycle I bought a month ago. the mustang has a 1400$ cobra body kit on it. absolutely no rust, to the strut  towers or any other part. sunroof doesn't leak. I JUST paid 1500$ for the car with no motor or trans. I did however trade a different mustang for the proper motor and trans. so I have almost the complete car minus the exhaust... the motorcycle I bought from a buddy for 1500$ who said all it needs is a stator and possibly a new battery. I bought the stator just haven't had time to put it in. I was just released from the hospital now I am home bed ridden. I probably can get the bike running it would just take a little time.

For an extra $400, I'll include the bipod, bipod adapter, scope, and scope mount. This is a steal for all of these accessories. This is a 6-24 power Weaver optic. This optic is lightly used and comes with flip up scope covers. I bought this scope lightly used for $350 (I believe brand new, these scopes MSRP for at least $600), attached it to this rifle, and have barely used the rifle at all. The scope mount is a Burris P.E.P.R. and I paid $80+. The bipod is a Harris - telescopic legs and tilt base. I paid over $100 for the bipod + the adapter. This is easily $500+ worth of extras that I'll throw in for $400. I'll also throw in a couple boxes of ammo.

$1200 gets you a loaded long rage rifle that is sighted in and ready to go.

DPMS lower with a black hogue Magpul grip. DPMS upper with forward assist and dust cover. 24"" stainless bull barrel with a 1-9 twist. Upgraded Yankee Hill handgaurd. This is an upper that is very hard to find. The top has a full rail and there are smaller rails at the front of the guard on the left, right, and bottom sides. Includes the bolt carrier group.

There are less then 100 rounds through this rifle. It's a great rifle, but I don't use it as much as I thought I would and need to sell. You can text me at 330-808-zero-nine-nine-three or call me anytime after 5 if you have any questions. I am located in the Sugarcreek area. I'll drive a reasonable distance in your direction but you'll need to come most of the way. You will need a valid Ohio driver's license and be willing to sign a bill of sale."

Benelli manufactured this gun in 1999, all of these guns stayed in Europe as was the norm for all of their limited guns of this era as they didn’t start sending these types of guns into the US until the mid 2000’s. This gun was featured at the 2001 Las Vegas shot show, I have the plastic ring depicting this for it but I did remove it so as not to scratch up the trigger guard. Conversations with Benelli USA have yielded the result of their statement this is the ONLY one ever bought into the States so unless someone purchased one in Europe and had it shipped back this is a one of a kind here. Completely unfired and absolutely flawless, this is an amazing gun"

They were not made very long and are now fast-appreciating sought-after collectibles. The kit is comprised of the Smith, a waterproof case, and many survival items. The very powerful Smith and Wesson 460ES was designed on the the larger X-frame. This 5-shot 3 1/2 lb revolver is much more versatile than the .500 S&W Magnum, as it will chamber and fire 45LC, .454 Casull, and the .460 S&W (which propells a 200-grain bullet at a velocity exceeding 2300 fps with over 2400 ft. lb. of energy). It is configured with a 2 3/4"" barrel with a recessed-crown muzzle, adjustable rear site and comfortable rubber grips. The topstrap of the frame is tapped for a scope mount. The case features a rubber O-ring for an airtight seal, a pressure relief valve, and contains the following survival items: an S&W Extreme Ops folding tactical knife, a Coglan’s Magnesium Fire-Starter, a Fox40 Micro Whistle, a Silva Polaris Compass, a combination thermometer, compass and whistle on a lanyard, the Unbelievable Survival Saw, two Space Emergency Blankets, a Rescue Flash Signal Mirror, the book “Bear Attacks of the Century”, and 6 fire-starter blanks. The gun appears to have only been to the range once and is in excellent-plus condition with only a few handling marks. The only one worth pointing out is a small scratch on the right side of the frame right above the trigger, with is light enough that it is visible in pics 10 & 11 (taken in bright natural light), but not visible in pics 27-30 (taken in diffused quartz-light). Please refer to the many digital pics to verify the collectible condition of this rare piece and to view the many accessories."

Comes with 2 tail caps and zero tool. This laser looks like something from STAR WARS!! Thanks so much for looking and have a good week.

These are the same shotguns that were recently banned from import by President Obama. And like all EO bans in the past (Chinese weapons and ammunition by Clinton and then Bush Jr) this ban will likely be in place forever ensuring prices on guns like these will go up. Prices on these will only continue to increase because there is now a finite number in the United States and over time that number will decrease making these more and more valuable with the passing day. The same thing happened in 1986 with machine guns and we have seen how much they have increased in value since then. The recent ban mentions these guns specifically so they will no longer be imported but because they are not banned from sale between individuals their value will continue to rise. 

As far as what I want in trade I have no clue but here are some things I might be interested in:

 AKs with cash
 RPK with cash
 RPD

 S&W Shield w/o safety with cash

Now on to the interesting stuff.

This Saiga was built with only one intention, to have the most reliable fighting shotgun humanly possible and this one does not disappoint. 

It is a 12 gauge with the reliability that AK's are known for. 

All modifications or parts added were done by a professional to ensure reliability as well as to give you the advantage to win the fight. The HK sights are probably the best sights on the planet for a fighting shotgun. If you have used them you understand this statement. That is why all the big name Saiga builders, like Tromix, install them. It also has a complete rail system installed to allow the use of optics, lasers, VFG's or lights. 

A TAC-47 automatically adjusting gas system was installed. You can run target loads or full power defense loads without any damage and without the excessive, punishing recoil felt by most other defensive shotguns. The TAC-47 ensures the gun is properly gassed ensuring bolt speed is not excessive and thus preventing damage or premature wear. Being properly gassed also reduces the felt recoil, keeps the gun cleaner, keeps you on target and reduces wear. It has ALWAYS been run with a buffer to prevent rear trunion damage and it does not affect reliability at all. I will also include a 6 way manually adjustable gas plug. 

This Saiga 12 was imported by Russian American Armory, the original importer of these shotguns. It has a 19"" chrome lined barrel that is threaded for a flash hider and includes and American made one. 

The following modifications have been done: 
•Complete rail system $150
•The FCG, bolt and bolt carrier have had the ""glass bolt"" mod done. They have been polished to mirror like smoothness. This was done to ensure 100% reliability, not for looks, and this one modification increases the guns reliability substantially. This also makes it easier to lock in a loaded magazine with the bolt forward. $100
•HK sights welded in place with full depth welds. The rear is a REAL HK sight and the front is designed for Saiga shotguns. This cost over $200 for all the parts and labor 
•Installed a TAC-47 automatic gas regulator. This allows you to shoot low brass and full power defense loads in the same magazine without fear of ruining your rear trunion. $50
•US made FCG. The trigger started out as a dual hook trigger and the second hook was turned into a over travel stop. This is the BEST AK trigger you will ever pull and it does it with the factory hammer spring to maintain 100% reliable ignition. The FCG costs $40 but with the additional work it would cost over $75 to duplicate.
•Billet aluminum trigger guard. $35
•Includes an American made flash hider. $35
•Picatinny rail installed in the rear sight slot for optics use. $50
•ACE 9.5"" stock. $65
•ACE rear trunion block. $45
•MOLOT grip (the best grip on the planet for an AK). $10
•Vertical forward grip $20

I will include all magazines I have for this shotgun and all magazines have been tested for 100% reliability.
•Three ProMags, 2 of which have been fitted to the gun and are 100% reliable. One is new in the package. $90
•Two SGM magazines, both fitted. One is a 10 round and one is an 8 rounds. They are 100% reliable. $90
•Three 5 round magazines, one factory, one KeepShooting and one ProMag cut down to hold 5 rounds. $30

All parts, magazines and labor would cost over $1,200 to duplicate and that does not include the value of the shotgun itself. Comparable shotguns are selling for $1,500-$1,800 on Gunbroker.

Here is one I would consider comparable on GB that SOLD for $1,500.
http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=437730358
But this one doesn't have HK sights, the auto gas block, a bunch of magazines, the polished bolt and carrier or the trigger work mine does. 

And here is another one that SOLD for $1,700 but, again, without any of the modifications , magazines or add ons mine has.
http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=438314737
We have already seen a rise in selling prices since then and once the retailers run out these will double almost over night.

You will not find a better, or more reliable, fighting shotgun. No expense was spared because this gun was going to protect my family.

I will answer ANY questions you have as well as take any additional pictures you might want. I can meet at any public range in Knoxville to allow any potential buyer to shoot the shotgun, you will not be disappointed. Please no tire kickers as trips to the range are an ordeal for me. And you must provide the ammo. It will shoot 2 3/4"" as well as 3"" shells.

If you ever wanted a Saiga fighting shotgun now is the time to get them because they are only going to go up in price. Right now will be the lowest they will ever be. And this will also be an investment you can use because most desirable guns outperform the stock market. Or buy it, list it on Gunbroker and make $300-$500 within a week. Go look at what Saiga 12 shotguns are selling for right now.

I also have a video proving this gun is 100% reliable and I can email it. I also have dozens of more detailed pictures I can email upon request. You will not be disappointed.

If you want to talk about it email me your number and I will call or text."

Previously Sig Sauer made some P226 Equinoxes in 9mm because 9mm Equinox slides were built by accident and they finished the guns instead of destroying the slides. Those guns were never available again after that run. We are not sure if the same mistake happened with P229 slides and the factory finished the guns or if this is a limited short-term run of this configuration

USP COMPACT
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
No snag, bobbed hammer
Flared recurve trigger guard
Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories

The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 AUTO offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands.

It weights just 31 ounces which is even less than a S&W with the Scandium frame. Makes it nIce to carry, but the recoil is no different than on heavier 1911s I have shot. Only has a few hundred rounds through it so it is just broken in, and it runs flawless. Asking $950 cash for it which is a steal for a 1911 of this quality and packed with this many features. If you are interested and serious, please reply with a phone number to contact you on. Price may be slightly negotiable for serious buyers but only in person and with cash in hand.

Comes with low profile night sights (that still glow like new), flared mag well, match grade barrel, match grade trigger, full length guide rod, match grade stainless steel barrel bushing, ambidextrous safety, front strap checkering, skeletonized hammer and trigger and more all straight from the factory on this high end model. 

The fit is awesome on this pistol and the trigger is super crisp. It also has the premium KIMPRO ll finish and has been upgraded with a Wilson Combat mag and VZ grips. I'm sure I am probably forgetting some things but all the details and specs are at the links provided below.

Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with a pistol buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator's forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user. This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using a pistol. ATF has reviewed this product and determined that attaching the SB15 to a firearm does not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the firearm to NFA control. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of every Pistol Stabilizing Brace goes to support the veterans of HAVA (Honored American Veterans Afield). www.honoredveterans.org Note: The ATF has specifically determined that this accessory is a brace to be used on pistols.

This is not your average AR-15 This is a Precision Rifle built with the best parts. 
It is chambered on .223 wylde ""The .223 Wylde is a proprietary rifle cartridge chamber with the external dimensions and lead angle as found in the military 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and the 0.2240 inch freebore diameter as found in the civilian SAAMI .223 Remington cartridge. Rifles with a .223 Wylde chamber will typically accept both .223 Remington and externally slightly larger 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition.

The .223 Wylde hybrid chamber was designed by Bill Wylde of Greenup, IL to exploit the accuracy advantages of the .223 Remington chambering without pressure problems or compromising the functional reliability of semi-auto weapons like the AR-15 family when using 5.56×45mm NATO military ammunition.[2] Coincidentally, it shoots the relatively long and heavy 80-grain (5.18 g) bullets commonly used in the Sport Rifle Competition very well and is one of the preferred chambers for that use. The Wylde chamber is used by a few rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers.""
Seekins Has a lifetime warranty on the rifle. Must see in person to truly understand how amazing this rifle is. 
From Seekins about this rifle:
