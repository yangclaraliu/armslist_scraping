This pistol is a shooter grade firearm! If you would like to have a Colt revolver that you can actually shoot and enjoy without worrying about hurting the value, this is it. The gun hasn't been fired much and the action is tight and crisp. The cylinder is still tight when you swing it out. The blueing is in good condition for the most part with barely any muzzle wear at all. The only detraction on this little snake is that it had been stored poorly at one time and it began to rust a little around the hammer and side plate. It is not that bad and could easily be re-finished if you would like. These guns are getting harder and harder to find at reasonable prices, so here is a rare opportunity to get a nice Shootable Colt Diamondback for a decent price.

I'm looking for old wooden stocks to practice re-finishing. I have never tried to re-do a stovk and would love to practice on a piece of junk. If antone has an old one they have no use for I would love to play around with it.

.38 SPC
$3500.00 (cash, credit/debit +3.5%, M.O.)

This is a very scarce revolver for the military collector! 
""This is a Smith & Wesson M13 ""Aircrewman"" that was made for the United Stated Air Force in 1954. Chambered for the .38 Special cartridge, these revolvers were built on an alloy K-frame and feature 6-shot aluminum alloy cylinders as well. The early test/evaluation guns had a 5-screw frame, ""Aircrewman"" marked barrels, Air Force medallion stocks, and a special serial number range. After the initial run and subsequent adoption some changes were made to the M13. Among these modifications were the deletion of the upper sideplate screw (note that this change occurred in the Aircrewman before the same change occurred in the commercial revolvers in 1955), deletion of the name ""Aircrewman"" from the right side of the barrel, deletion of the U.S. Air Force emblem from the stock medallions (replaced by standard S&W monogram), and the serial numbers were mixed among standard commercial production. This is one of the ""standard production"" M13's with the later features. The top strap is correctly marked ""REVOLVER, LIGHTWEIGHT, M13"", the back strap is marked ""PROPERTY OF U.S. AIR FORCE"", and the left side of the frame has the single ""P"" military proof marking.""
This revolver:
very good condition
The serial numbered parts are all matching 
The revolver retains most of the original anodized finish with some normal handling and thinning
The stocks are in very good shape with some handling wear but no cracks
The mechanics are in good working order
The bore is very good with bright, sharp rifling. 
Includes Leather holster and original ammo carrier."

Buds sells this pistol for 962.00 cash price. I figure with the buyer saving tax and TICS 800.00 is a fair price. 

Buyer must be able to legally own a handgun in the state of TN, and be willing to travel to Murfreesboro (or relatively close) and meet in a public venue. I am not interested in trades at this time.

The gun is in excellent condition with the usual holster rubs on the high spots.  The spot that looks like a scratch on the front of the slide near the muzzle is the Trijicon H3 logo.  

The polished ramp means flawless feeding, and that open slide design means no stove pipes.  Shells eject hard and right.  No shells in the head.

It has a lifetime warranty and the diamond can be replaced if lost. The warranty and service plan are included as all that is needed is the paperwork that I have for lifetime service. The diamond is an si1 and Marquise cut. I can get the specifics from Jared's if needed. The diamond also has its clarity imperfections on the bottom of where it is set so that they are not really noticed.
