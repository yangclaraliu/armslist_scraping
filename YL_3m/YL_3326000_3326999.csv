162,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3326162,For Trade:  Rare .45 Golden Saber for nice scope.,"Auburn, Montgomery, Alabama",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, July 28, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have several boxes of Remington's Golden Saber .45 ACP ammo. Most of it is 230 grain, some is really rare 180+P Grain. I paid over $45 per box plus tax for each box. I want to trade some of it away to get a nice scope. This ammo is super expensive, but also super well made. My S&W1911E, like most 1911s, is picky on hollow point ammo. It loves to eat these because they are more round nosed than most, but also has a sharp and deep hollow point. These are premium bullets and new from the factory in original boxes. I have only been able to find this ammo at Gander Mountain (Occasionally and high priced) and at random gun stores. Both scenarios are pricy and rare to find. The Golden Saber was replaced by their Ultimate Defense Line, which is a cheaper bullet (as with most things, the older stuff is the good stuff). So, Golden Sabers are going to be very hard to find and comparable to the Black Talon line in price and availability.

The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

The new GLOCK 42, in .380 AUTO, is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable single-stack .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42.

Mystery Ranch 3 Day Assault to be the last word on assault packs. Big enough to carry sustainment gear, extra ammo, IFAKs, and all manners of tactical radios. The 3Zip design gets you in the pack fast –rip, unzip and you’re in. PALS web on the sides and on the inside back panel give you options to expand. The side compression straps compress the bag down when not fully loaded and can hold longer items, like M4s, aiming stakes, or tripods securely. Built for Military use, the 3 Day Assault pack is popular with hunters and Police tactical units as well.

Inside
When you open the 3 DAP the first thing you'll notice is the internal molle attachment points with a pocket below it on the back.  On each wing (left and right) are two pockets large enough to carry extra water bladders and two small mesh (heavy quality) pockets on each side.  The top of the pack has two pockets, one big enough for maps and a field message pad while the other has small organization pockets in it for kit and enough room for snacks and fast grabs right on top.

Waist Belt...Disappear
Here is one feature to brag about.On the side of the pack is a quick release buckles.This is where you store your waist belt when not in use. It’s very annoying when your waistbelt is just dangling away. What you do is just flip the waist belt up and tuck it away in the flaps and boom.No more waist belt.

You simply grab the optic one-handed, pull back, move it in-position, release, and you're good-to-go. Once it's in position, it does not move unless you want it to. The design allows the Aimpoint 3X to fit over top of most flip-up rear sights.

The LT755 shown fits 30mm bodies, such as the Aimpoint 3X Magnifier. The mount is available by itself, or as a Aimpoint 3X combo special. Both Mounts and Combo packages come complete with QD adjustment wrench, vial of blue Locktite and Instructions.

I have only shot them a few times each. The AR is in excellent condition, it is exactly as it came out of the box. Never had 1 single problem with the rifle. I bought it brand new and put about 700 rounds through it 

The AK works fine never had a problem with it either when using steel mags. The tapco mags do not feed but I ony tried them once, I think they need to be broken in. In order to get them to fit into the gun I had to shave them down so the edges are chewed up. They fit 100% with absolutely no wobble whatsoever. Steel magazines fit into the WASR perfectly with no wobble. 

Included is :
Colt AR model 6920
13 magazines 
2x bore brushes
original Colt cleaning kit
WASR AK GP-63
14 magazines
cloth case 

I want to sell them both as a pair. Price is firm. I live in Maryland so I will have to come to PA to transfer them or if you want to check them out in person. Serious buyers only please. thanks for viewing

This is a modified benjamin that will shoot over 900 fps with lead pellets that can be purchased at walmart. In other words it shoots regular standard weight lead pellets at over 900fps. It will shoot the lighter pellets well over 1000fps. It has a modified exhaust port to permit more air flow. It has a modified exhaust valve seat  and delrin exhaust and check valves to permit more air flow under increased pressure. It has an adjustable piston to get the full travel of each pump. The great thing about it is you can pump it a few pumps and just target shoot or pump it 14 and wallop a squirrel at 40 yards and drop it. If you just have a spring air rifle you can only shoot it at one velocity all out where the pump air rifle allows how much velocity you choose. $200.

FROM THE MANUFACTURER: The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

FROM THE MANUFACTURER:
The first of the many recent additions to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 and incorporate features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike. Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines."

This gun was purchased in 2011 and has seen a moderate amount of range use. The finish on this gun wears very easily, which you can see in the photos. Despite the less than stellar appearance, the gun functions very well, and runs reliably with a wide variety of ammo.

The firing pin broke in 2013, and was sent to ATI (the importer for GSG) who repaired the pistol for free. The magazine disconnect safety has been removed, and the original curved mainspring housing has been replaced with a straight one. The original parts will all be included if you want to reinstall the safety.

Also included is the original box, manual, and barrel wrench (for removing the threaded barrel cap if you want to install a suppressor adapter). I can include a Silencerco thread adapter for an additional $20.

Comes with 2 mags. FROM THE MANUFACTURER: Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models."
