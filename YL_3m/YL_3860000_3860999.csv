This C93 is a reproduction of a HK 33. The parts are interchangeable with all HK OEM parts. The C93 meets and exceeds all qualities of an HK 33. The rifles are virtually identical with a 4k price gap and thats if u can even find an original HK33. The century arms C93 is a highly reviewed rifle satisfying all HK lovers needs. The gun uses a roller lock bolt system which is arguably one of the best actions of our time it has 30 to 40% less recoil then an Ar15 or M4 that shoots a 5.56/.223. Its a must own before another ban takes affect.

The USP has been designed and developed especially for military and law enforcement applications. The results speak for themselves: The USP is universally applicable, extremely reliable in operation, and guarantees high consistency and precision when firing. 

But the USP has even more to offer: As a modular system, it allows individual tailoring of safety and trigger mechanisms to suit any requirement. The modified Browning locking system with patented buffer system also minimises the recoil forces when firing. This significantly reduces the felt recoil.

Also I do not plan on doing any driving, So if you plan on buying, Keep in mind I am ""NOT"" going to meet you somewhere, And wait for a ( NO SHOW ) for a couple hours, I am done getting burned by people playing games, So plan on coming to my location if you want it, And I will meet you in a public place at a local business around where I live.

Also I will only deal FTF with other Ohio residents with proper Ohio ID or Concealed carry permit holders, CCW permit holders will be moved to the front of the line, And all Federal Laws will be observed, You must be 18 years or older to buy any type of long guns, And 21 years of age to be able to buy any handguns, And be willing to sign a bill of sale.

The T-120 is the full-size version to the T-100. This semi-auto pistol is great for home defense and target shooting. The T-120 offers a rail under the barrel for laser or flashlight mount and features scalloped ridges on the slide for better grip. It is constructed from a steel alloy for all the ruggedness of steel without the extra weight. It features a double/single action with rear snag-free dovetail sights and a fixed blade front sight. It also features a black polycoat or chrome finish and black polymer checkered grips.

Made in Turkey, VERY SOLID! Excellent quality control, Mil Spec Standards, Torture Tested and PROVEN RELIABILITY. Slide rides INSIDE THE RAIL for Accuracy and SUPERIOR ERGONOMICS. Do your own research on YOUTUBE:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUO8S_snAXs

Double action trigger is buttery smooth on both the stroke and return, I can't feel any creep, overtravel or stacking.
Lockup is tight on all cylinders.
There's no sign of cracking around the forcing cone nor flame cutting near the top strap.

Stainless is in good shape with only a few minor scratches. The grips are showing some signs of wear, but these are the inexpensive Dymondwood grips that you can buy new from S&W for $30 (or just put on whatever grips you prefer).

Sorry I don't have a better camera to show you a good picture of the bore or cylinders, but you can see for yourself they are free of any rust or pitting. Bore is shiny with all rifling intact.

If you have any questions or would like to see additional pictures please let me know.
I'm willing to meet you at the NRA range if you want to try the gun yourself, but please bring your own ammo.

Before firing it, I took it to my gunsmith who told me it's actually 45 ACP.  Cool gun but not what I wanted.  I'm looking to trade for a single action army clone, preferably a nice Ruger Vaquero, blackhawk, or one of the nicer Ubertis in 45lc.

The 1917 comes with 12 rounds of 45 ACP and about a dozen moon clips.  The finish is nickel. If I were keeping it, I'd probably get it refinished but wanted to leave thee finish alone if there were any collectors who care about that stuff.

Developed during WWI to supplement 1911 auto pistol production, the Colt Model 1917 is based on the New Service double action revolver modified to chamber the same .45 ACP cartridge used by the Colt Automatic. Loading and ejection are fast using spring steel ""moon clips"" to hold the cartridges. This early gun has the bored through cylinder chambers so the moon clips are a must. It wears the standard 5-1/2"" barrel that is ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY"" marked along the bottom. This revolver was overhauled at some point between the World Wars and was reblued (before Parkerizing became the standard). The frame, yoke, cylinder and ejector assembly have been arsenal numbered to match although the original Colt factory serial number is also matching inside the frame and yoke. Overall condition is good, with some finish loss and spotting from a chemical spill (or possibly blood) as well as some thinning to the grip straps. There are some handling marks but no significant pitting. The brown plastic grips feature silver Colt medallions and are likely WWII or post-war replacements. The revolver functions alright although there is some play between the frame and yoke when at rest. Lock-up is good with the trigger held to the rear. The timing is slightly late in single action but works perfectly fired double action. The bore is very good with strong rifling that is light frosted (but free of deep pitting). A well worn black stained 1917-dated U.S. holster is included."

 Gen 3 Glock 29SF 10mm.
This gun has been a medium use carry gun and shows appropriate holster wear. Functionally it has been a great gun! Since obtaining this handgun it has seen almost  500rds though it with no issues. Only reason it is getting sold is to make way for other firearms.

 Included with the gun is:
114rds of BVAC 180gr ammo. Value: $57
70rds of mixed Double Tap and Hornady Personal Protection ammo. Value: $70
1- IWB Hybrid Holster custom made for the gun. Very comfortable! Value: $65
2- Kydex OWB Holsters also custom made for the gun. Value: $115
2-10rd Glock Mags with Pierce grip extensions. They came with the gun.
2-15rd Glock Mags. I paid $67 for both of them in September.
1- Mag pouch that came with the holster. It's not the greatest but it's better then nothing.

The gun also has a set of Trijicon night sights on it. Only 1 of the 3 dots actually glows.  I got them for free because a buddy damaged them putting them on his gun and didn't want to look at them.  I put them on the gun because they are better then the stock sights that Glocks come with. I also have a Ghost trigger connector that I'll throw in with the package.

The package is worth well over $850.  I am asking $775 for the whole package. I am open to trades. Mainly looking for a Glock 19/17/34. But will consider other trades as well. Don't be afraid to shoot an offer my way. Worst I can say is no."

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

This is a rare Daisy Softair Model 12 airsoft gun. This was the beginning of the airsoft craze. These were manufactured in 1988 and only made about 1 year before they were pulled from the shelves for being almost identical looking of the guns they were made to resemble. It uses actual shells to hold the softair bb’s, which, when fired eject from the gun just like a real firearm. It does use the standard airsoft bb’s of today, so if you still want to use it there is no shortage of ammo. Resembles the Tec-9.

Hard to find AND complete, unused, and in the original box!!!
This originally sold for $69.99 back in 1988, so it wasn’t a cheap toy.
Excellent condition with the exception of the box top left corner has a slightly small wrinkle (see pic) and some minor shekve wear. Cash on pickup. Postal MO if shipped.
Will ship to the lower 48 States only where legal. No sales to New York City, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Staten Island, New Jersey, Chicago, CA, Washington DC or Philadelphia PA. or other areas where prohibited. Know your laws regarding airsoft guns. By bidding you are telling me that it is legal for me to ship to your address and that you are 18 years of age or older.
It is your responsibility to make sure this is legal to own in your area.
