It is a CMMG flattop upper receiver with a 7.5"" match grade barrel. The barrel is phosphate finished with a .073 gas port. Has a 1:7 twist. Aluminum low profile gas block with a stainless steal pistol length gas tube. The muzzle device is a KAK Industries flash can. Also included is a KAK Industries extended buffer tube designed for the Sig SBX Arm Brace. I have an ACE buffer tube foam installed on it with a CAA stock saddle. The quad rail is a super slim free floating AXC rail with integrated QD sling mounts and steal barrel nut. This rail is extremely rock solid. Rail system actually slips over the nut and bolts directly to it. 
The upper receiver is used. The barrel assembly with the rail system and KAK flash can is brand new. Never had a round down the barrel. The KAK buffer tube and CAA saddle stock are also brand new but have never been used. They were installed and removed so the buffer does show some signs of wear from installation and removal. I have over $400 invested in this upper and buffer. I am realistic. I know I will not recoup what I have spent on this and for that reason I offer it for trade. #1 trade interest is a Glock 30. Aside from the G30 I would be interested in a Glock 23, Glock 27, or compact model 1911. Or if you would rather purchase this upper and buffer for cash my starting price would be $425. willing to negotiate from there.*** I also have an RMA BCG and standard charging handle with extended latch that I can include for the right price or trade. They are also used but have very low round count on bolt.(~200 RNDS). If included I ask $500 with the BCG and CH.**Also are two 30 CAL flash hiders that were purchased for a 300 Blackout build but never used. They are brand new. One is a 5.5"" and the other is a standard 3 prong. Sell for $20 each. And a 5"" riser that I will include with for free. If interested please text REDACTED. Thanks"

If one wants ""Formula 1"" race car performance at a reasonable price, rather than a VW Beetle, these are guns to consider.

The ""next gen"" after the 208 International, with a 2 stage trigger and adjustable trigger shoe position is the 208S, for sale here.  This specific gun also is a commemorative edition, with somewhat better finish and gold lettering.

This is NOT a Sig-Arms import gun which had a safety at the rear of the slide.  Additional magazines and other mass front barrel weights (160-240 grams) are available with purchase (NOT sold separately).

SHIPPING AND FFL transfer available.  For IL FOID holders, transfer on FOID card IS possible, WITH state police confirmation of card validity.  For NH residents, personal transfer with either NH permit and or state residency and confirmed validity of paperwork from your local police department.  Please note, in some localities, this gun may be classified as an assault weapon.  It generally is considered ""legal exempt"" in CA.  In a few areas and towns, it may be considered an assault weapon.  8 rd magazines are available.

A LEFT HAND target grip is available (illustrated) if needed, and slab type combat grips as used on the 212 can be provided as well.  Grips NOT sold separately.

The 208 probably descended from the Reising Target pistol of the 1920s, via the Walther Olympia.  After WWII, Walther was prohibited from handgun manufacture, and sold the patents to Hammerli, which primarily made reproduction guns and some precision firearms at the time.  A series of improved versions resulted, of which the 208 and 208S, and their economical form, the 215 were the end stages before the company was sold, and plastic versions were offered by Walther and SIG-Arms.

Since the S&W M41 also is a descendent of the Walther Olympia, in essence the 208 is am M41 that Smith and Wesson never made.

The 208 offers adjustable trigger pull, and a frame mounted rear sight that is adjustable for windage and elevation.  The trigger is single stage, and not adjustable for position.  The basic gun (fired from machine rest) is more accurate than even the best S&W M41.  The adjustable trigger pull renders it even better in actual hand-held use.  The adjustable barrel weight allows both refinement of balance of the gun, and use of the precise position of the weight for tuning of the barrel and gun in actual firing.

Standard velocity ammunition only.

The 208 S is very slightly less accurate than the older 208, but the difference is very difficult to detect.  In competiton, the S model has never out performed the 208.

One 208 with safety and rapid trigger adjust also remains available.  

The gun for sale is the LAST one imaged, but is NOT the gun shown.  The one for sale is with a Morini RH grip, and has better finish and gold lettering.  The current Armslist rules for non-dealers make it unwise for me to change the images.  The LH grip available IS the one shown in the 4th image.

This model is a kit that includes an extra spare cylinder for faster reloads. 

This revolver has been looked over and it's a great example. The cylinder locks up tightly and each position of the hammer is a strong click (no mush). The cocking to single action was also set well at the factory and doesn't engage too rear in the hammer's travel. The trigger pull is about 2.5lbs. 

As a buyer, you'll be allowed to test the trigger pull with a dry fire buffer to protect the cylinder nipples. 

Retail price for this kit is $299 at Cabelas plus tax. 

No paperwork is needed for this antique replica as it's not classified as a gun. Cash and carry. Willing to meet at Easton Fish and Game or a supermarket in the area

$500 FIRM. Save yourself tax and a few bucks, and get the free ammo, night sights, grip, and holster. I would rather trade.

I have a S&W Bodyguard .38+P. It was originally bought from Bass Pro by the previous owner. She shot one round and decided she wanted a smaller caliber. I have shot about 15 rounds through it. I am really a single action guy, not a revolver guy. I did dress this one up to keep however because it is so light and easy to carry, but I would consider selling/trading it to get something else. 

I have installed a XS Trijicon Night Sight (big dot) that really improves accuracy and target acquisition. It is new and glows bright. I have also installed a Hogue Tamer grip made for the Bodyguard that allows for a full hand grip but it still is light and can fit in the front pocket of my jeans no problem. It had a huge impact on accuracy because the factory grip would twist in my hand, this one does not. I do not use the laser, but it is sighted in perfectly. This is a great, lightweight, dependable, and accurate self defense CC gun.

If you want to see this revolver in action, this guy does great reviews and he has this gun with the same additions in this review. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp82Hkk1MQk

FOR SALE: ***DCM / CMP SPRINGFIELD M1D GARAND SNIPER WITH DOC

Ladies and Gentlemen: .... For your consideration I am offering for sale, an M1D Garand Sniper, built on a Springfield receiver. ... This particular rifle was sold to the general public through the DCM, (now the CMP), as an ""M1D"" on June 13, 1995. ... This rifle is one of many from the estate of a life long collector and personal friend. ... The rifle is in excellent condition. The wood is in fantastic condition with only one blemish, less than half the size of a dime, on the right side of the top, rear hand guard, (see the last 3 pictures). ...The TE is a ""1""! I was not able to measure the ""ME"" because of the flash suppressor but I generally find the ""ME"" to be about half of the ""TE"" so I am speculating the ""ME"" to be 0. ... The cartouche's and firing proofs are well struck and defined, and they are visible and identifiable from about 20 feet! ... The serial number of the rifle is 2509005, indicating it was originally born an M1 Garand sometime around February or March of 1944. ... I do not know when the rifle was converted from an M1 to an M1D, however, judging by the condition of the wood and the fact that the ME and TE are both minimal, I do not believe the rifle saw much utilization as a sniper while in government possession. ... Neither the current owner nor myself have fired the rifle. ... I disassemble the rifle for documentation purposes and everything works fine. ... I do not know the number of owners of this particular rifle

I think that's all. As you can see, I'm not asking retail, nor should I since it's been fired. I won't have a need for anything else if the gun sells so it's all together. At 60 rounds fired, this might as well be unfired. Text and DM are fine; my number is 740-358-6one87. I'm in Auburn but work in Ft. Wayne if you would like to meet in either."

Growing up my father has always had a pre 63 Model 70 in 270, so when I graduated from college I had my first job and decided to built a custom version of that gun. I found the firearm that I was looking for, and gave it to a local gunsmith when I lived in Wisconsin. After about a month and a half, I received my firearm back, and it was better than I could have ever expected. I had him fit it with a custom laminate stock with a limbsaver pad mounted on it and he also bedded to the action. He also trued the action, and I bought 2 boxes of core lokts to see what it can do, but never got around to trying it out. When I moved back home my father gave me his gun, and this one just sits. I have over $1500 invested in the gun. I also have the original stock for the gun to go along with it. The original stock is missing the pad on the back though. I am open to trades, but am looking for higher end firearms. If you have any questions feel free to ask me. Also, I have had a couple emails about it, the Serial Number is 66XXX, and if the ad is still up the firearm is still available."

Ruger 10/22  w/ 20"" bull barrel, Tasco 3x9 world class scope, and a Houge rubberized stock.

Incredibly accurate little rifle, it's sighted in at 75 yards, at that distance I can punch 1/2"" holes all day long. With the 20"" bull barrel, when using sub sonic ammo it's about as loud as an air rifle, so no need to run a suppressor other than the cool factor.

I would like to trade for a 10/22 takedown, or a lighter 10/22, I put a decent amount of money into this rifle so when making your offer please consider how much your rifle is worth and try to make a fair offer.  This ruger is all metal no plastic and that's s plus.

I also have a wide variety of AR parts and a bunch of ammo for trade or sale

Description
The XPS2 is the shortest, smallest and lightest EOTech model holographic weapon sight available without night vision. Its size and weight make it convenient for hunters and law enforcement officers to carry.

This sight has the same body style as the XPS3™ model, but the XPS2 does not have night vision-compatibility.

I have a Mossberg 590A1. This 20 inch barreled beast has the weight to mitigate recoil, proper length to clear a house, and holds SEVEN 2 3/4 inch or SIX 3 inch 12 plus 1 in the chamber. The safety is on the top of the weapon with a big orange dot to easily identify the condition of the shotgun when the adrenaline is pumping and shotgun is shouldered. (as opposed to the Remington style models.) 

This model includes ghost rings, orange front sight blade, bayonet lug (yes, if you feel the need to add a bayonet to your shotgun, you can do that too!) speed loader stock that holds an additional 4 rounds in the stock. That means you can carry 12 rounds of 12 gauge 2 3/4 inch shells at any time without that pesky shell saddle to get in your way. It also comes with an aftermarket Picatinny rail and sling mount if you want to add a sling or a flashlight to your shotgun. (sorry, the light is not part of the deal).

This shotgun is solid as a rock. This is THE shotgun the military uses for overseas operations....we had 2 in Afghanistan and they were pocket aces during CQB. If you are looking for a ""tacticool"" shotgun with magpul furniture, flimsy 2nd tier lights in the fore-end, special zombie finish etc, this is NOT your shotgun. If you want a dependable, reliable shotgun when/if it comes time to defend you and your family's lives....you can have it for the low cost of $650 firm. I paid $700 new out the door plus an additional $50 for the light/sling mount. I fired 25 rounds out of it and owned it for 1 year.

It's all numbers matching except for the bayonet but that's pretty normal. The stamping on the receiver is fairly light, but you can still make everything out and all the other numbers are very deep. Very good shooter, the bore is dark but still has sharp rifling and is as accurate as I can be. I do still have the box for this rifle I believe. Also has the sling, 3 ammo pouches, and tool kit.

Next up is a 1946 Izzy M44. This rifle is beautiful. All numbers match and are easily visible. Bore is nice and shiny with sharp rifling. This thing shoots true though I will say the bolt is just a touch sticky.

I also have 872 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo to go with the guns. 440 in a sealed spam can, 340 in 20 rd paper packages (from a previously open spam can), 34 rds of wolf, and 58 rds of loose surplus. I also am including 20 stripper clips to the first person who wants them. I WILL NOT SEPARATE THE AMMO OUT, unless the guns go first and the buyers don't want the ammo. 

I would obviously like to sell everything all together as a package. Price for it all would be $650

The second is a pretty decently used .38 S&W Airweight, this model has the exposed hammer, this was a ""truck gun"" so it's got a fair amount of wear from being in a glove box, console, etc. etc. but is a great shooter with no issues.
