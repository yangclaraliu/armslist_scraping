DESCRIPTION

At middle distance ranges (where field of view is ultimately more important than magnification) the Armasight 4X night vision rifle scope strikes just the right balance between the two. Small on dimensions, but big on value – the Nemesis 4X will not unbalance your rifle; it mounts on an adjustable mount that will fit weaver or Picatinny rails, and can be mounted in seconds without tools.

The Nemesis 4X has multicoated all-glass lenses and an internally adjustable fine reticle that makes precise shot placement incredibly easy. This night vision riflescope is also water, dust and sand proof for increased reliability. Complete with tactical rails for lasers or illuminators (high power IR illuminator included as standard), the Armasight Nemesis 4X is ideal for the predator hunter, tactical marksmen, or anyone that needs a compact, light medium range night vision rifle scope.

Hey all,
I have this really old 22lr single shot for sale. It is a remington targetmaster model 41. It is in rough condition, but would be and awesome little project or gun to teach a kid on. The stock has a thin crack in it that seems stable (and being such a small caliber probably ok), the bluing is all but gone, and the rear sight has been replaced with just a bent piece of metal (yeah, backwoods fixed for sure!). But it is still a really neat gun. Shoots decent and has normal rimfire occasional FTFs, but could've been the cheap cheap ammo I was using (old coffee can stuff). I would keep it because it's just beat, but I've found something else that I really want to get, so one of the toys has to go! I have a bunch of 22lr ammo I could sell with or add to trade value at their cost to me. I would consider trades towards a pump 12gauge, a type 53 or M44 Nagant, or possible other revolvers in 38spl and larger cals. Honestly, just shoot me a message and we can go from there. I'm located in Norman and need to meet in Norman as well. Shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there! If you want any other pictures or info just message me and il get it to you ASAP. 
Thanks all and happy hunting!

It been in a safe for 30+ years and its time for it to see daylight and have a good polishing. It's in good shape but does have a few small dull areas (nothing that wont polish out) and has been shot very few times. It came in a wood presentation box. One of the grips that was touching the foam in the box is darker and the finish is dull. The foam is deteriorating and there is a crack in the plastic recess where the gun lays.

The upper receiver and the lower receiver are Anderson.  The upper is a sport upper with no forward assist and no dust cover to reduce weight.  This gun was built with light weight in mind.  The gun weighs an ounce over 6 lbs. with an empty magazine.  The barrel is a 16"" with 1-9"" twist, chambered in 5.56 NATO (you can shoot both .223 and 5.56), and it has a melonite finish on it.  The barrel is threaded but has a thread protector on the end.  I can swap that out for an A2 flash hider if you wish.  The hand guard is a free float tube to increase accuracy.  This is an optic ready setup with a low profile gas block so you don't have a front sight to look through when you put a scope on it.  This would make a great coyote gun due to the optic ready flat top and the light weight."

My experience with numerable Armslist users dictates, that at least half of you do not give a single shit whether or not a person provides a NH drivers license or P/R License. Because you almost never ask it of ME during a trade or purchase. This has been my experience in over 12 face to face transactions conducted via Armslist.com.

So if someone is offering to pay RETAIL PRICE for a USED firearm...guess what you should do?

ASK THEM TO PROVIDE A VALID NH DRIVERS LICENSE AND PISTOL/REVOLVER LICENSE OR YOU WILL LIKELY BE ARMING A FELON OR VIOLENT CRIMINAL.

Either that, or someone ignorant enough to buy a USED gun for that which it costs NEW -- and in such cases, arming a person who should not be armed in the first place.

Is it illegal to NOT ask someone to provide these things? Maybe so, maybe not. But what is illegal is selling a deadly weapon to someone who is not lawfully permitted to own one. And because you make that choice at your own discretion, you and you alone inherit the consequences of it. 

So THINK about who you sell your guns to, or the sweet $500 you gain now will be a sweet prison sentence later. 

You're welcome."

For sale is a Remington 870 20-gauge pump with vent. rib, 2-3/4"" receiver, mfg. in 1982.  This gun has been USED, and shows it, but not abused.  It is in good shape and functions perfectly.  A previous owner had cut off the end of the barrel to make it a 25"", shorter, lighter, easier to hunt in thick cover or brush.  The choke is stamped modified and I have pattern shot the gun to see how the cut-off may have affected the choke ( I don't know how long the barrel was originally or how much was cut off ) the pattern did have a more modified grouping and not a real wide-spread cylinder bore (straight bore) pattern, so my guess is that the modified choke was not completely affected or cut off.  However, all that being said, the gun functions perfectly and is great for HUNTING (instead of sitting in a safe!)  It is still a better gun than the cheap ""Express"" models. This is also a gun that won't ""break the bank"" at $250.  New case included. If interested please call REDACTED.  Sorry, I can't ship."

Perfect accessory for cowboy action shooting (or maybe you just want a piece of unique gun leather to keep your smoke wagon in.)

There is a good amout of finish wear, but the metal is in good shape. NO rust. 
The rifle had a new barrel in its life. The bore is a little dark (none of these were ever chrome lined so a dark bore is par for the course) the rifling is very strong.

Action is smooth and the gun functions perfectly. Comes with one 10rnd magazine.
Numbers on bolt and receiver match. The barrel is non-matching. NO import marks!
(I listed Century as mfr because I had to put something)

The only sporterization was the cutting of the stock. If you were so inclined, you could pickup new forend parts and reassemble the rifle in its original configuration most likely.

Nice gun, took it in a trade and I already have a sporterized enfield that Ive put a lot of work into so this one is of no use to me.

Has minor holster wear.
The Vertec is a full sized single double action with a great trigger reset. It is a all steel gun with accessory rail.  Its grip angle is the same as a 1911, which is much different than all other Beretta's.  The grip on the Vertec is also made to make mag rips more accessible and easier.
It has a slide mounted safety which is also a decocker.  Has loaded chamber indicator, which is noticeable in the day or night.  Magazines hold 13 with one in the chamber (18 rounds with 9mm) also accepts Beretta 25/32 Round magazines.  To change the Caliber of this gun all you have to do is change the barrel, magazines and gun stay the same change calibers in 30 seconds.
Many accessories are available for this gun including guide rail lasers so you can have a laser and light on this gun.  Weighted Guide rails are also available for competition recoil management.
It comes with Gunfighter high visibility Steel sights which are removable.  You can easily put any sights on this gun without taking it to a gunsmith.  It has a stainless steel barrel which is slightly shorter than the normal M9/FS barrels.  It has a larger trigger guard easier to be used with gloves. Comes with 2 holsters (New in package Retention Holster, a double mag carrier, and 2 Magazines.
This gun is no longer made however all wearable parts for this gun are made and highly available.  All parts are the same as any M9/FS Beretta.  Many after market accessories are made for this gun from triggers to large magazines.

Willing to accept partial trade and cash let me know what guns you have.    Must have a valid ID, and sign a bill of sale.  $700 OBO. 

""Differences between the Vertec and the parent M92FS are readily seen. The rear strap of the butt is straight rather than arched and the stocks on the Vertec are both flatter and more aggressively surfaced for a better grip. In addition, the trigger blade has been thinned, to better allow reaching by one’s distal joint to fire the first round by the trigger cocking method. The barrel is also a few tenths of an inch shorter and terminates at the end of the slide.

In addition, law enforcement agencies requested an accessory rail to accept flashlights and laser sighting devices. This feature is becoming more the rule than exception, as departments attempt to limit their liability for errant shots by affording the operator both a way to positively identify one’s assailant and provide a secondary aiming system.""

It's rated at 1200 degrees for 30 minutes.   It will come with the brackets for the shelving, but you will need to cut new shelves to suit your needs.   The inner door panel was removed, probably to re-combo the lock, and never put back on.  Both the Shelves and the panel could be done with a half sheet of plywood and the finish of your choice.  I've got some thick Nylon Webbing that can be added to the door panel to hold pistols.

From what I've found online, this was sold at WalMart for $589.   My asking price is $300.   You haul, but I'll help you get it loaded, safe weighs around 200-250lbs.

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

This is an 8 hour course (includes range time) that teaches basic handgun knowledge (both for semi-automatics and revolvers), gun safety, gun handling skills, shooting fundamentals, positions, gun maintenance and much more.

Serial number in the 7900 range, all newest updates.

Rifle is multi caliber, to change calibers, you basically change the bolt and barrel, which takes all of 60 seconds.

This rifle has a rare EDZED ACR folding stock adaptor, along with a ACR stock.  You will not find a folding stock that locks up tighter.  If you do your research, no more than 100 or so of these have ever been made.

Rilfe also has a custom folding charging handle, again, not many made, nor do I believe like the ACR stock adaptor are any more being made.

Rilfe has had only 50 rounds down through her as I'm the original purchaser.  It is CLEAN.  

Rilfe DOES NOT COME with EOTech.  Rifle will come with Larue VFG as well as Midwest Industries flip up iron sights. 

Total sell price (less EOTech) $1,850. 

If rifle is shipping out of state, you will pay the actual shipping costs (I'd estimate it to be around $50 for standard ground.  If your FFL will not accept a firearm from a Non FFL dealer (they have to get me a copy of their FFL so I can ship it myself), add $20 for my FFL to do the paperwork on my end.

I deal with a brick and motor gun shop local to me that has  a website and phone number.  Have no issues leaving the rifle at the gun shop (which you can verify) prior to USPS money order being sent.  This is the internet, I'm fully aware that we have scam artists on this forum, but I am not one of them.  Anything over $100 is a crap load of money to myself and I'd like to protect my investment, as I'm sure you would as well.

Trade interests are BOLT rifles with threaded barrels (prefer 300 blackout or .308 caliber) or looking for a host for a 45/9mm suppressor.  I have a bunch of Sig 226/229 mags and would really dig a Sig 9mm with threaded barrel.

This shotgun is in like new condition with only four shells through it. If you are not familiar with this shotgun it is made in Turkey by the same factories that make the Canik CZ75 clones and TP9, Winchester SXP, and many other quality firearms. This is a 5+1 pump action that will chamber 3 inch shells. Has a built in recoil pad and pistol grip, as well as a nice set of fiber optic ghost ring sights, a receiver mounted picatinny rail, a removable breacher choke, and is VERY lightweight. This is a Benelli pattern shotgun and will accept extended benelli magazine tubes. Very similar to a Benelli M3 (sans the semi auto functionality) for a fraction of the cost.

In great shape but Ive had a few shotguns with pistol grips and ring sights and Ive found that I prefer a straight stock with a bead sight. This shotgun retails for $299, Id like to trade it for a similalrly priced 12 gauge shotgun with a straight stock, bead sight, and 18-20 inch cylinder bore barrel, such as a Remington 870, Mossberg 500/maverick 88, winchester sxp, or similar. Only looking for combat/hd style shotguns, absolutely not interested in field guns, sorry.
