Up for sale is a beretta 92fs . I've put close to 10,000 rounds through it and noticed a slight bulge in the barrel . I've never had a squib and have personally put most of the rounds through the gun .so I contacted beretta and they said it was common with barrels towards the end of their life . Not sure how I did it with 10,000 rounds, i think theyre rated for over 30,000 rounds and I haven't even put many hp through it . But I don't shoot it anymore so I've factored a new barrel and new recoil
Spring into the asking price .Also , the rifling looks perfect . Typically you'll see a dark spot where the bulge is located but the rifling looks brand new which leads me to think there was some sort of defect in the barrel to cause it to start to fail
Prematurely . I had a gunsmith friend of mine look it over and shoot it . He said it wasn't an issue . The only reason I even mention the barrel is so you know exactly what your getting and so there's no surprises  once the deals been made .
It's in good condition other than than the mentioned problems . Some small scratches in the finish as well comes with 2 mags  ( us made
Model )


Up for sale / trade is a used glock 22 . It shoots great but I got a gen 4 the otherday for my birthday so it's time for it to find a new home .

Comes with two 15 round magazines and one 22 round with metal ( si vis pacem para bellum ) base plate . All magazines fActory .

Found a Hi Power with a broken safety that would allow the  hammer to strike the firing pin and would discharge told the owner who at first said its normal (yeah right last time I checked a Hi Power should not be able to discharge with the safety on) but then took it out back for ""work"". A few days later its still in  the case same price no note of caution assuming it was fixed I took a look an same safety problem and still not sitting flush with the frame creating a condition where it could fire while partially locking the slide (awsome way to loose a eye when the safety sheers off) asked employes why its not fixed and they never knew the owner simply put it back the employee looked and confirmed it was broken still and said ""its an accident waiting to happen"". Would not trust a repair by them anyway having heard from an employee to using YouTube as their repair guide a couple years ago when discussing a modified Glock. So I looked at a Glock instead only to find a crack on the slide confirmed by an employee it was quickly dismissed by the owner again by saying ""its a Glock its fine"" and back in the case it went to wait for its new unfortunate owner at no price change or warning. This makes me think the owner would rather make a quick couple hundred than worry about the safety of the customer. Unfortunately this is just a week I could go on forever about this place. If any concerned buyers on the south shore/coast have any concerns feel free to ask. Some dealers are great and check out every used gun but others like this one put profit before people so know what you looking at and look close its really the new or inexperienced buyers that will loose the most by places like this and make the mistake of trusting the dealers word."

Price is $750 or best reasonable offer. PSA has a great deal on these for $400 (as of 2/12/15) but with not half as many extras.  Do the math with the cost of shipping and taxes for it all and my deal is better. And by dealing with me, you have the advantage of personally inspecting the rifle.

I'd strongly consider a trade for a Wasr 10 in great condition with a few extra mags. Possibly a 223/556 AR at a similar pricepoint.

Here is the original M-16 trainer introduced during the Reagan Era, and wildly popular during the Bush Sr / Clinton Ban Years. This M-1600 is manufactured by Armscor of the Philippines, the company that brings us their excellent 1911 pistols that perform so very well.  Action type is, of course, blowback semi-auto, and it is a direct descendant of the Remington 550-1 rifles that are still in service after 60 years. Sights are correct aperture rear and post front with authentic carry handle and gas housing replicas. Magazines are 10 round blue steel, housed in a correct-looking and fitting AR-15 type housing. Extra 10, 15, and even 25 shot magazines are in production. Forend and buttstock are classic Colt SP-1 Vietnam Era styling black ebony stained hardwood. The forend configuration allows barrel exposure for better heat dissipation. Barrel is 18 1/4 inch blue steel with 1:16 rifling, and receiver is blued steel as well. Weight empty is a well balanced 6 1/2 pounds. When the 550-1 phased out, the Filipino manufacturers filled the gap with a good quality economically priced rifle now marketed by Armscor.  ARMSCOR uses only high grade ordnance steel for all major parts for durability and mechanical reliability even in the most adverse operating conditions. Instruction manual and magazine indicates high velocity 22 LR for the best results try Winchester, Federal, and Aguila coppercoated ammunition.

The stainless frame was blackened to match the slide. The ring hammer that has also been jeweled, extended beavertail, serrated mainspring housing, forward & rear slide serrations, topside slide serrations, 3 dot Novak sights in dovetails, lightweight aluminum trigger which is grooved & adjustable, reversible extended mag release & soft finger-grooved Hogue grips. The slide release & safety are as slick as can be, very user friendly piece. The pistol is in great shape, no damage just light handling marks & a little holster wear. Mechanically sound; functions better than new & the bore is excellent. This was recently acquired from the original owner whose best friend was the gunsmith that tricked it out. It has seen very little use & I think I have fired it more than he ever did. It is a pleasure to shoot & as accurate as any 5” barreled 1911 I have fired. See the pics; we show it all so you know exactly what you are bidding on, nothing hidden & NO surprises."

a threaded A2 birdcage flash suppressor (for a total length of 17.25""). The
bore and chamber of the barrel are chrome-lined for ease of cleaning and
longevity, and the carbine has a Mil-Spec manganese phosphate outer coating
that protects the barrel and critical steel components from corrosion and
rust. The upper receiver is offered in A2 and A3 configurations. The A2
upper receiver (SSI 13231) has a 300-800 meter rear sight system with 1 MOA
elevation and 1/2 MOA windage adjustments. The A3 upper receiver (SSI
13230, 84824) features a Picatinny rail, a removable carry handle, and a
300-600 meter rear sight system with 1/2 MOA elevation and windage
adjustments. The carbine ships with a magazine, an operator safety manual,
a chamber flag, and a sling.

BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE Premium 35 Whelen Supercharged 225 gr. TSX (2800 fps) - 20 Round Box



Again, as per customer request, Buffalo Bore has developed two new 35 Whelen loads. Item 42A features a Sierra 225gr. SPTZ-BT bullet @ 2705 fps out of my Remington 700. (24 inch bbl)  At the expected impact velocities, this bullet will mushroom readily, but hold together on large game like bull elk. We recommend this load for use on smallish big game (like whitetail deer) through Yukon Moose and Bison. However, on very tough (other than broadside) angling shots on large big game, we recommend the use of our item 42B, which features a 225gr. Barnes TSX bullet @ 2654 fps out of the same rifle. The TSX load is a bit slower than the Sierra load because the long-for-weight all copper TSX uses up more case/powder capacity than the shorter Sierra bullet of the same weight.

If you desire the deepest possible penetration from an expanding bullet in 35 Whelen, the 225gr. Barnes TSX bullet delivers. It will out penetrate a 250gr. typical premium partition bullet, but gives the advantage of higher velocity, flatter trajectory and reduced recoil of the lighter 225gr. bullet. You can use this TSX load for bad angle (quartering or going straight away) shots on the largest North American big game.

This ammo is designed to be the highest quality, most powerful/versatile, 35 Whelen ammo, in the world. It exhibits sub MOA accuracy in our test rifle."

I will include an extra factory mag,  a box of ammo, and a pocket holster to get you started.

The bottom line- I'm like most everyone else, I always stayed away from Taurus guns, thinking they were inferior firearms. The 738 was designed for the typical 7 yard encounter. I have shot this gun on the 25 yard range with excellent results, and most important, it never failed at anything, ran flawlessly no matter what ammo I used."

Details
To meet specific Federal LE use requirements the SkyOps for the Sig P229 (model SKY250B) comes standard with an “enhanced retention device” known as a tension unit. 

You need to carry a full-sized pistol behind your hip, you don't want to wear a jacket or your shirt tail out, you want stationary holster placement, and you want total concealment. 

That's a lot to ask, but one Federal LE agency and many CCW customers asked. Galco delivered, with our SkyOps™ tuckable concealment holster."

This is the original Mark XIX made in Israel by Israel Military Industries (IMI).  It was one of the first batch before they brought production to the US in 1995.  I have read that later models had reliability issues, so this is one of the good ones.  According to Magnum Research, this particular gun was manufactured in 1994, so it was one of the later ones in this first batch.

This is an heirloom air gun that you'll pass along to your grandchildren and beyond.  It is in like-new condition and used only a few times.

Highly adjustable two-stage trigger, which has a serrated surface for more control, will help you extract maximum accuracy from the P1.  It has a solid metal gun construction with finely checkered walnut grips (interchangeable with .45 auto grips). It is ambidextrous with safety catch lever on both sides. The 11mm dovetails make it easy to mount a pistol scope or a red dot sight.  Adjustable rear sights for windage and elevation.

Selling this excellent condition, perfectly-functioning 10.5"" LWRC M6A2 upper in 5.56mm. Less than 2,000 rounds (factory loads only) fired thru this upper; purchased new in 2011. I am putting a new LWRC M6IC-A5 upper (for suppressed shooting) on my lower (which is why I'm selling this unit). * AAC 51T Brakeout is included, I will also include the standard LWRC flash hider that came with this upper...this upper has the single-piece/newer bolt carrier.

***I currently own 5 LWRC 5.56mm rifles: 8"" & 10.5"" SBR's, 16"" M6IC-Enhanced & an 18"" M6A5-DMR (plus an M6-SPR which I am listing for sale soon), but the 10.5"" is my favorite hands-down...this upper shoots great & they've all eaten everything I've feed them (brass & steel) without a single malfunction--ever! I honestly don't want to sell this upper (& will not be discounting it below the current price) and may just end up registering another 10.5"" lower with this upper so I have two of them. If my other 8"" PSD upper sells first, I will be pulling this item from sale. This upper is also listed for sale on GunBroker, but if this ad is still up--that means the upper is still available.

This item could be put onto a pistol-engraved lower receiver immediately; or, on an SBR-registered lower with the appropriate BATFE tax stamp. As you may already know, if you submit a Form-1 (to build an SBR) with the ATF electronically for your Trust/Corporation, their approval time is only 4-6 weeks! The approval for my last Form-1 (filed in Oct-2014) took just 37-days total. *If you require additional pictures &/or information about this item--please message me.
