If you don't know about Elzetta do your research they are the main supplier to SF Units around the world. This light ie wicked even in the daytime and forget about seeing at night if you get hit with it. Its sitting in a Elzetta ZSM mount with optional side rail. Last but not least is the best part it has a new Aimshot LS8300 green laser. These are only sold to SF UNITS on military POs only they are no longer sold to even LE Agencys.

You can follow the beam even before dark and after dark it looks like something from Star Wars. Comes with zero tool and two different tail caps. Would rather trade than sell. Thanks for looking.

Below is from Diamondback's website:

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAMMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.

The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAMMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.

DISCLAIMER: Crimson Trace Corporation© DB .380 specific laser mount is not designed for the DB9. Use of the CTC laser mount on the DB9 will void the manufacturers warranty.

--Just because your AR-15 has optics and an after-market grip does not make it a ""custom"" rifle.
--Most of us know one Generation of Glock from another, but as a courtesy go ahead and provide that info.
--Most buyers need and want more than just ""Winchester 30-30"" in the description. Is it an XTR, Ranger, Commemorative? Year of manufacture?
--Why are you asking more for your gun that what I can buy a new one for?
--A Llama 45ACP is not worth $450 no matter what you think.
--Know your AR-15 chambers. Is it .223 Rem, 5.56 NATO, or .223 Wylde?
--A 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 year old gun is not ""new"" whether it's been fired or not.
--Just because you built it does not make it worth more.
--Of course we've got pro- and anti-union users of this site, so I'm sure I'll ruffle some feathers with this next one.  I'm going to peg on Colt...
Colt has a union represented by UAW (WFT?) and for about the past 35 years has done nothing but manufacture over-priced sub-standard firearms.  (Do just a little research and learn how they screwed around and lost the M16A2 contract.)  At one time the Rampant Colt truly deserved its premium price and prestige--but those days are long gone.  If you want to dish out over a grand for a run of the mill 1911 that has the Colt name on it, go ahead, it's your money.  If you want a REAL QUALITY 1911 that won't send you to the poor hose, look into the Ruger SR1911CMD.

I do want to add that after researching this scope I'm under the impression that it is best suited for a rifle chambered in a .20 caliber variant or lower. Rifles in a .30 caliber or larger seem to knock it off zero after a couple hundred rounds due to recoil. This problem may be able to be fixed with better quality rings.

Bought it as a range toy from a local shop. Works great, never had an issue with it. Probably only 75-100 rounds through it and I cleaned it every time. Comes with 4 35 round magazines.

Apparently the last owner couldn't help himself and removed the weld on the stock and rigged up a system in the trunnion to use it. It wasn't pretty, and it was very illegal so they JB welded it shut. I get it home and put a magazine through it and it pops off. So I took it to the shop and sawed the stock off cleanly.
Everything is still functional, perfect version for someone who can't resist the urge to dremel welds off..

The draw weight is adjustable for 45, 50 & 55 lbs. This can be done without a bow press by turning the bolt that holds the limb on, in or out and aligning the limb with the marks on the bow 

The bow has a hunting stabilizer and nocking points and a new roller rest installed, also included is a Vintage Browning ""tape on"" fishing reel and two fishing points. Along with the line on the reel there is about half a spool of line left. The bad is that half the label is missing from the spool, and I can't remember the exact test of the line! 
But I used to over kill on everything? So I almost guarantee that it is between 100 and 120 lb. test line.

Last but not least, there is a camo soft case made by Kolpin, to store / carry the bow in. The case has reinforced stitching around the carrying handles. 

This bow does have some scratches but I was attempting to make a bow-fishing rig out of it and did not want a new bow in case of disenchantment.  But I did not get the chance, I've had heart surgery, as a result this has left me with many restrictions! Resulting in physical as well as draw weight restrictions.

Just trying to recover my money to get a crossbow... Asking $150.00.

""J. Stevens Arms Company was founded in 1864 at Chicopee Falls, MA as J. Stevens & Co. In 1886 the name was changed to J. Stevens Arms and Tool Co. In 1916, the plant became New England Westinghouse, and tooled up for Mosin-Nagant Rifles. In 1920, the plant was sold to the Savage Arms Corp. and manufactured guns were marked ""J. Stevens Arms Co."" This designation was dropped in the late 1940s, and only the name ""Stevens"" has been used up to 1990. Beginning in 1999, Savage Arms, Inc. began manufacturing the Stevens Favorite again as the Model 30G."

This thing is awesome I purchased a few custom parts that just makes it one of a kind. First lets start with the phantom flash hider which makes this gun shoot so much better, of course every part taken off is in box incase you wish to put back on which in my opinion your nuts, this thing shoots straight on at 200 meters. Next I purchased a houge rubber pistol grip which once you feel this you are going to love it. It's grip is amazing! After that I wasn't a big fan of the underfolding stock so I removed this and replaced with a CAA buffer tube and then purchased a magpul STR stock. Now this is my favorite part to the gun. It's adjustable just like a ar15 stock. Love it. As I said every part i took off is In original box I care about my guns. Of course the ammo will be included which is around 1100 give or takes few. It has roughly 200 rounds down range and then was cleaned put back in safe. 
 If your wondering why I'm selling I'm going to build a long range gun and need to purchase a can / suppressor so this is what's going to make way for that build. I hope that theirs somebody who can appreciate it as much as it deserves. It will come with everything I own for it 3 sets of yugo wooden hand  guards which are hard to find, 3-30 rd mags 1-40 rd mag. 
All this for $1000. I'm being realistic and I'm not price gouging anyone. That's $750 for gun and $250 for ammo. I WILL NOT Sell gun without the ammo must buy whole thing. It'll be face to face I won't travel but 30 miles from 17745 you need to show I.D to prove Pa residence or you transfer it in your name and buy at my local gun shop! Cash only no trades"

Great rifles, but I never shoot it as much as my other ARs

Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.

**Please note that the Vortex scope is for sale separately

Price WITHOUT Optic: $1200

___________________________________________________

Bottom Rifle: This rifle is a great optics ready carbine. The upper is a Bushmaster factory upper with 16"" chrome lined barrel and lightweight profile. It has a fixed mil-spec front sight on it, and I swapped the furniture out for some Magpul furniture and vertical pistol grip. I have a Diamond rear sight that is on at 100yds. The lower is a DPMS lower with mil-spec trigger and some more Magpul furniture including pistol grip with storage, enhanced trigger guard for shooting with gloves, and lightweight 6 position buttstock.

Price: $750 or make an offer

I am not looking for any trades at this time. I do have some 30rd magazines and ammunition that I can sell you if you don't have any - just ask."
