It also comes with the ghost Ring peep Sight. It now has a 3-Dot sight on it. Fully adjustable rear sight, up/down/right/left.

I have shot this Hi Point 9mm at the range and have found it to be very reliable. It has not failed to fire for me, not even when I empty the magazine as fast as I can, it has not given me one problem.

It is bulky for a 9mm, but I can hit the bulls eye at the short range every time, it will do the same for you at home.

Hi Point wanted to make a pistol that is affordable to all Americans, this is the pistol for the average person, if you need to protect your home and family with an easy to use pistol at a very fair price that comes with a life time warranty, this is the gun for you.

I'm asking $170 for this pistol. It comes with two 10 round magazines and the two 8 round magazines, almost a full box of ammo left, I think it has 11 rounds used. I lost one good 9mm in a crack in the dirt.

9mm Luger ammo is affordable and always in stock.
Reply by email for call REDACTED for more information.

Open to trades for .22 WMR ammo."

I have a really old German Mauser 25 auto pistol that I picked up in trade. I got it with the intent of doing some work on it and having it be a new caliber, but I have had some things come up that will be eating too much of my time. So, i would rather pass it along and let someone else enjoy her themselves. It is a model 1914 Mauser 25 acp. The serial number dated it to around 1916-17 (best i could tell at least). It is actually a comparatively low serial number (5 digit serial). It is in average/decent condition for its age but not “terrible” compared to what I’ve seen elsewhere. Has heavy bluing wear, dings, and a crack in grip, but is still a decent looking gun. The main issue this one has is that it jams up feeding/ejecting almost every shot. It is possibly as simple as replacing a spring or giving it a really good polishing on the feed ramp/throat. It could even be that the only 25 auto ammo i had to test her with was some cheap/older blazer stuff, which i have had some issues with in other guns. Either way, I simply don’t have the time to get her “fixed up” or i would and then keep her (or sell for double! haha). I know that in this condition and shooting fine they sell for substantially more than what I am asking. Also, I have found most replacement parts online from normal places, so this could be a fun and easy little project!"

This was a basic upper that came with m4 hand guard but I took it off to put a rail on and don't have it anymore. Handguard cap etc is also cut off as I put a Centurion Rail cutout rail on it but took it off to sell separately, so the upper is rail ready. 

It also doesn't have a Bolt Carrier Group. The upper was shot at a range to sight it in. Maybe 90 rounds total and has been sitting since. My plan was to cut this one down to 11.5"" for a suppressed SBR, but I think I'm just going to build one from scratch.

The upper was built from a DX'd upper from the old US Army CAR-15 rifles.  The upper was DX due to combat damage where a round struck the carrying handle.  The upper is in GREAT shape, with only a small nick on the handle.  The barrel is a DPMS 16"", with a clamp-on A-frame gas block.  The forearm is a Brownell's free float tube.  The rear sight has been taken out, and needs to be replaced.  Midwest and Brownell's offers an A2 rear sight for about $30.  There is a two-sided rail mount on the A-frame for mounting flashlights (included), and lasers.  The muzzle brake is a kineti-tech barrel shroud that keeps the muzzle very nice and level.  All in all, this is a great upper.  Sad to get rid of it, but have been updating my stock lately and just need to get some newer stuff.  Includes the flashlight and two mounting options for optics.

This Belgium made Browning BAR is the Cadillac of hunting rifles. The Browning BAR rifle is primarily known for three things: reliability, strength, and durability. It is also the number one selling auto-loading hunting rifle in the world.
This particular rifle is a perfect example of the high quality workmanship that goes into these rifles. I am very particular about my selection, care and maintenance of my rifles.  The condition of the stock I would say is 95%. The condition of the blueing I would say is 90%. And most importantly, the condition of the rifling, bore and chamber is 100%-like new. This rifle is very lightly used. You will not be disappointed with your purchase. $995."

When your safety is already at risk, it may be too late to buy that first gun.

Why do I say that?

1.  You’ll be lucky to find a gun at a gun store when EVERYBODY is trying to buy one.  And IF you do find a gun, it may not be the best gun or the most suitable gun and it’s going to cost you a lot more money than it would have before the emergency.

2.  You may not be able to find ammunition for your new gun.  And IF you do find ammunition, it may not be the most suitable ammunition for self-defense, you may not find it in the quantity you want, and it is going to cost you a lot more money.

3.  You may not be able to purchase important accessories for your new gun.  Things like spare magazines, holsters, slings, and optics.  Not having enough magazines or not having a holster could put you in a real bind.  You may not have time to research which accessories you need or be able to install them quickly if you can even find them.

4.  By not having bought the gun ahead of time and now being in the middle of an emergency, you won’t have the time to take the gun to a range to do important things like:

 a) making sure the gun actually works and is not a one-shot or even a zero-shot wonder

 b) making sure that the ammunition you purchased works in the gun

 c) practicing with the gun to become proficient in its use and to know how to do critical things, like reloading the gun quickly while under pressure 

 d) becoming comfortable and familiar with various controls such as thumb safeties, grip safeties, or de-cockers

 e) adjusting the sights on the gun to make sure the bullet is going to go reasonable close to where the gun is aimed

  f) installing and testing any accessories, like bipods, tactical lights, laser sights, or custom grips

The time to become a gun owner is NOW when you are NOT in the middle of a riot or some other emergency.  

The time to do it is when you have time.  When you can purchase the gun you want.  When you can purchase and store a quantity of the ammunition you want.  When you can verify the gun functions properly and is sighted in properly.  When you can study which accessories you want and have time to get those accessories.  When you can practice and train with both the gun and the accessories so that you have confidence in your ability to protect yourself and your family.

All of that can be done in a reasonable amount of time if you put enough effort into it, but it can’t be done instantaneously in the middle of an emergency.

If you’re going to become a gun owner, and you don’t live in Ferguson, MO, there is no time better than RIGHT NOW."
