50 rounds of Hornady XTP 

After checking Brownell's, Cabela's and a couple of other places to find sll of the brands, added up, without shipping or tax, this package would be about $155 if you could find all of them (I had to go with some prices from sellers who published a price, but didn't have them in stock)

I am selling the lot for $135 because I don't have a .32 and the boxes show handling.  The ammo doesn't show oxidation.  and the boxes don't show any water damage.  The FMJ should be reliable practice ammo and the Hornady XT should live up to Hornady's reputation for quality.

70,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3704070,For Sale/Trade:  LaRue Tactical Automatic Sniper Target,"Fayetteville, Fayetteville, North Carolina","$ 1,000","Listed On: Thursday, November 20, 2014",Rifles,Larue Tactical,no type,no type,no type,"Slightly used but fully functional. All it needs is the charger which you can order directly from Larue.
Here's the link: http://www.laruetactical.com/larue-tactical-sniper-target-battery-charger

LaRue Targets are made of the highest quality materials and are produced on computer numerically controlled (CNC) machinery that gives consistent high quality.

The overall dimensions are 28 inches high, 32 inches wide and is made of 3/8 inch steel plate that is hardened to 500 Brinnell. Silhouette plates are rated to accommodate 7.62mm NATO, but have been shot them with .300 Winchester Magnum at ranges as close as 200 meters without ill effect.

LaRue targets are battery powered and will cycle through approximately 1,800 down and up cycles before requiring a recharge. After being hit, the target returns to the upright position and automatically shuts off until the silhouette is again hit and knocked down. This is the primary reason for the systems long battery life. It also precludes having to turn the targets off and on, although there is a master on/off switch.

The targets are weatherproof and can be left out without damage. Users have reported leaving LaRue targets exposed to the weather over a year's time without affecting their operation. LaRue Tactical stands behind the quality of its targets and will repair or replace any target that is found to be defective.



Some of the main advantages over traditional targets are:

Battery Powered. Automatically resets 1800 times between charges.

Man Portable. 72 lbs total weight.

Self Contained. No assembly required, no set-up, no hoses, no wires!

Battle Tough. 3/8"" thick 500 Brinnell target. Withstands .223s and .308s.

Weather Proof. Leave LaRue Targets out year-round."

Description: Compact, accurate and completely trustworthy, the REC7 is designed specifically for situations in which there’s no room for error. Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life. This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine. The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance. The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.

This load was designed for those who need a deep penetrating 357 mag. or 38 SPL load to be fired from lightweight alloy 357’s and any 38 SPL revolver. Lightweight alloy 357’s develop multiple problems when firing our 180gr. 357 mag. hard cast turbo charged (Item 19A) ammo or any make of full power 357 ammo. Yet many folks want a deep penetrating “outdoor” type of load for their lightweight pocket 357’s, so here it is. Whether you are shooting gators or bears in the head, this load utilizes a hard flat nosed bullet, at sufficient velocity, even from 2 inch barrels, to fully penetrate either.

This load is safe to shoot in all 38SPL and 357 magnum firearms of modern design that are in normal operating condition. In the super lightweight alloy revolvers (around 11-12 oz.) the bullet will not jump crimp under recoil provided you do not subject an unfired round to more than 5 or 6 firings. In all steel guns, even short barreled ones, crimp jump is not an issue as the all steel snub nosed revolvers are much heavier than the alloy versions.

This load utilizes a flash retardant powder that will not blind the shooter in low light conditions, which is important as wildlife and criminals get much more active when darkness comes.

This bullet is hard cast and properly lubed and as such will not substantially lead your barrel. You should find no degradation of accuracy when firing many cylinders full of this ammo without cleaning.

We never use extra long laboratory barrels to produce our advertised velocities, which we feel is dishonest to the customer as those extra long barrels produce extra high velocities, which you cannot duplicate with stock revolvers in the real world. Instead, we use stock firearms and you can see the velocity results below.

Assortment of 37mm rounds.  They are only legal if you don't own a 37mm launcher already. If you own a 37mm, these can be fired through them if you register your launcher as a DD, they are low pressure rounds, and safe to fire through a 37mm flare launcher.  Rimmed to 40mm for use in M203 as well. These can ship right to your door. All NFA rules apply

Modifications to the rifle include:
Aftermarket Archangel stock 
Rock Solid industries 3 point mounted picatinny scope rail
4-16 x 42mm Mil dot scope (optional lighting in 3 colors)
Lower picattiny rail mounted for use with bipod and similar accessories
The barrel has been shortened, re-crowned and threaded
Muzzle brake
Custom bent bolt


The brake on this rifle is is highly effective at reducing perceived recoil.   The opening is .030"" over bore rather than .105"" like what is commonly sold for this caliber.   This causes the brake to perform at peek efficiency while still allowing plenty of room to prevent bezel strikes.

The bent bolt is a custom design made for a comfortable fast cycling action.  There is some slight pitting in the metal (see picture) as it was attached with an arc welder. rather than a tig.

All of the problems commonly presented by the Archangel stock have been addressed.   Shells do not jam in the magazine.   If you firmly tap the mag into place with the bolt closed the first shell will load, and most importantly each round will cycle correctly provided good ammo is used.   Using brass ammo such as PPU or similar the actions works perfectly, I do NOT recommend using mil surp steel case ammo.   This can cause the bolt to stick after firing the round.   I have put several hundred rounds of 180G mil supr through it, but in order to keep the discharged cases from sticking a slight bit of oil was applied to the neck.


All of the accesories pictured ARE included in the sale of the gun.   I also have the 5 and 10 round mag which are included.

This is a heavy barrel, 9mm (9x19) version of the legendary K-frame, 6-shot M&P revolver. S&W made 10,270 of these from 1980-1985; 6486 round with butt (and 3"" barrel), and 3784 with a square butt and 4"" barrel (one listed). Supposedly, this was the most difficult-to-manufacture revolver that S&W ever made.
In the late 1970's, the Israelis wanted to arm the Palestinian Police force with a 9mm handgun, but didn't trust them with an auto loading pistol. Instead, they wanted a simple-to-use a revolver chambered in 9mm (and by ""simple-to-use"", they meant ""no-moon-clips""). They contracted with Smith & Wesson to make it for them. Instead of the usual ""star"" type extractor, the Model 547 features a horn-shaped extractor with small beryllium-copper spring tabs that grab the rim of each case.
Soon after Smith & Wesson delivered the first shipment of these revolvers, the Israeli government cancelled the rest of the order and instead bought an IMI revolver that was a Model 547 knockoff. S&W released the remaining guns to the civilian market, and ended production due to extremely high manufacturing costs."

Not interested in Hi-point, Lorcin, or any low end stuff. This gun is built like a tank and you just don't see them often. Most you find online are chambered in 40SW. I also might trade for a 357, but not really interested in any other calibers at this time. Sorry for the stock photos but if you are interested I can text you pics of my actual gun. FTF transactions only in the Huntsville area and I only trade or sell to CCW carriers or folks with voters ID. Just don't want my guns falling into the wrong hands! Thanks"

No.....I'm not the scumbags in Burnsville, Bloomington and somewhere in Minneapolis that....

....I did not sell my 'last' 22LR.
....I did not oddly stop shooting 22LR.
....I still do shoot 22LR (for those scammers that 'just don't shoot 22LR any longer' - lies).
....I didn't buy 'too much'  BS; who buys 'too much' ammo, especially 22LR?

My story is I got a pistol that doesn't like Stingers, it likes all the other stuff.  Plain and simple so now I have a brick +50 of Stingers that will do nothing but take up space.

Price?  Not sure, make a good offer.  I don't expect anyone to pay what Capra's is charging, $24.99 for 100 Mini-Mags (yeah, that's not a typo).  But I do expect a good buck.  Sure, if you want to pay Wal-Mart prices for them just go to WM and buy them - that easy.

These are fairly new, in pristine condition as they were purchased and promptly stored.

Trade interests are listed below, but feel free to make me an offer.  Worst I can say is no?

Serial dates guitar to 70/71/72.

Guitar was a victim of the 80s, was routed for humbuckers & a floyd rose. All repairs were done by Guru Guitar Shop. All holes filled with proper wood, refinished in a gold top with a light patina to match the natural aging of the binding and back. Neck wear is original, not a relic. Installed custom wound, vintage spec mini humbuckers made by Gene at Guru & new electronics. New Gibson case.

This is obviously not a collector guitar, but a fantastic player, piece of history & professionally restored by the most reputable shop in the area. That's why its a $1400 guitar, not a $3000 guitar.

PLEASE SERIOUS INQUIRES ONLY. I've had 3 people set a time to meet only to stand me up. If you do not intend to pay cash for this guitar, please don't bother emailing me."
