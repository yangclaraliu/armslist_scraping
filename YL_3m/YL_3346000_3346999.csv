I have been replacing the leaf spring every year, and this gun proves to be reliable, and a good shooter! The gun is older, and although not perfect, but close, its a real looker as well! It comes with the original case, documentation from Tom Wilkenson, 2 chokes from Tom, and receipts for the parts as well as a diagram. This gun has become more rare, and with the barrel work and unmodified trigger (doesn't have the coil style spring) its really climbing in conductibility and value. I am asking $2500 cash or open to trades for handguns, rifles, and possibly shotguns.

Two things are bad with this gun.  The ""Bolt"" or slide as I call it is cracked, as it was not intended to be shot with hi velocity ammo-Standard Velocity Only, or so I have read.  it was cracked when I got it,  and the original 12 rd.  magazine is missing.   I have been holding onto it, as he stated he had the magazine, but it was really misplaced as it is gone and can not find it?  Replacement 10 rd mags can be found for 43.00.   Other than that the gun and grips are in really nice shape.  The Bakelite grips appear to be in Fine condition, with no scratches or damage.  I am not a gun guru, and have not fired this gun.  I can tell you it seems to function fine.    I can take pics of it for you, if you specify what you are looking for.   From what I have read, they made a little over 10,000 of these.  This one has the serial number of 10,xxx, so I would say it is one of the last ones built?  I don't really know what to value it at, I would say somewhere between 250.00 and 800.00?  Going off of Numrich's gun site, the parts I have , that they have available are either available or out of stock-This gun by their parts guide would be valued at 358.20 - in parts.

I was hoping I'd shoot the Mosin alot more then I do as well as I was also hoping I'd shoot outdoors more then I do. My Mosin is just a safe queen and all I have been putting through her is new production brass case ammo.

From what I gathered from my online research this is a Light ball steel core (147-149gr) made in 1976. The lettering isn't the same as Russian cans, it's most likely Polish. This is an unopened can and I DO NOT HAVE THE CAN OPENER. There are other ways to open these cans.

Since I shoot alot more indoors (and that I don't shoot the Mosin much), I really don't have much use for this steel core ammo. It CANNOT be shot at ANY indoor range and it is corrosive so cleaning your gun afterwards is a must.

For sale is a like-new 3.8"" Springfield XDM Compact 45ACP. This is a great carry gun with the 9-round flush mag in it. It also comes with a 13-round extended mag, which makes it better for those with bigger hands, at the range, or for those who just like to have the extra rounds with them at all times.
The XDM series is Springfield’s upper-line models and include carrying case with mag and pistol holster, three interchangeable backstraps, match grade barrel, and a rail.
I’ve put about 50 rounds through this, and it shoots great. It does have a small flaw in the left-rear white dot as shown in the photo. It came from the factory like that, but it didn’t affect my aim at all.
These popular guns with the extra mag and kit retail for at least $580 before tax, shipping, and FFL fees.

Mini-Thirty assault rifle in 7.62x39mm caliber.  It is constructed of alloy steel with traditional blued finish, and the 16” barrel has a 6-groove bore and a 1:10” RH twist, which is better suited to a heavier bullet than a standard 123gr 7.62x39 (Russian SKS and AK-47).

 The rifle has a Hammers SF2-8x26CE scope with elevation, windage and distance focus adjustments, and flip-up lens covers.

The furniture is a military grade TAPCO modular INTRAFUSE Mini-Thirty stock system.  The fore-end features a top barrel cover with an integral Picatinny single rail, and an integral bottom Picatinny rail with cover for the addition of a vertical fore-grip or other accessories.  The butt-stock is identical to the TAPCO T6, adjustable to 6 positions and includes the sling ring.  An integrated TAPCO style composite pistol grip with storage completes the system.

An adjustable bench-rest height Harris bipod with sling and rail mounts is attached to the under-rail of the fore-stock.  In front of the bipod is an Omega Tactical E.T.G. XP-6E combination laser/flashlight unit with independent laser and light function and remote pressure switch, mounted under the barrel with a Leapers UTG Universal single rail barrel mount. 

The rifle comes with six magazines, 3 of which are 30-rnd black composite Ruger-matched ProMags.  The other three magazines are Sturm Ruger factory steel mags, 1-10 rnd, 1-20 rnd, and 1-30 rnd.  The rifle also comes with a NcStar digital camouflage soft side carry case with sling and five external magazine pockets. 

Despite the production year, the rifle is barely broken in with less than 40 rounds down the pipe, and is a great deer rifle.  I can get 3” groupings out of it at 200 yards with a 147-154gr cartridge and minor drop adjustment to the scope, but a more patient shooter could probably tighten that up a bit. 

I am selling the rifle with all accessories for a FIRM $1,100.00 cash, or $850 without the scope, bipod and laser.  Buyer must have a valid Wisconsin ID (driver’s license) or CCL, and complete the transaction face to face (I will NOT ship the rifle)."

Bought from J & G sales for $329 and was surprised how bad the finish was although it functions and fires well with a fairly good condition barrel (carried a lot, shot a little).  I stripped the finish and applied matte black duracoat bake on finish and also added $60 wood grips which really enhance the gun's appearance.  Between paint, time, and grips I am easily into over $400 in it and I am asking $350 firm.  9 X 18 is only slight less powerful than 9mm (9mm = 9 X 19) and is cheap and plentiful to get.  For $350 you get a nice looking highly rated 12 shot easily concealable double action pistol that doesn't kick like most of these tiny .380 and 9mms people usually buy.  Fun to shoot equals more range time with cheap ammo which translates into increased confidence and ability with your pistol.  Again, $350 firm and I'll throw in 150 rounds to get you started.

Gun is in great shape, with the only spot of light rust being where the receiver and magazine tube meet, which isn't uncommon in shotguns. Has 4+1 capacity, and lacks the ""dimples"" in the end of the magazine tube that would require removal if you wanted to add a magazine extension, making it easier to add the extension. 
Comes with two barrels, one 18.5"" Improved Cylinder with bead sight,  and one 28"" vent rib  with removable choke, which is currently a Modified choke. 28"" barrel also has a fiber optic sight that attaches to the rib, along with a bead sight up front. 
Also comes with two stock sets, the original wood set from factory, and a Hogue Overmolded stock in OD Green. 
Gun operates with no problems. Only problem I've ever had out of it was when I was trying out those Aguila 1 3/4"" mini shells."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer. MSRP: $466.00

Exact same set up is going to run you about $560-575 in the store for gun+tax+extension.  Price is fair, save around $100 over going and buying it at the store.  Cash offers for less than asking price will not be answered.  And I don't care if your friends, brothers, half-cousin knows a guy that read somewhere they were $199.95  (you get the point).  Not being a jerk just seems like AL has turned into a joke with people that aren't even buying anything wasting the gun enthusiast on here's time.

Disclaimer:  I'm not a jerk, there are just a few people that frequent this site solely to aggravate people.  As far as all my conditions, I'm just straight forward and honest so there's no question as to where we stand.  Makes like a lot easier.
