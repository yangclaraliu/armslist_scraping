There is some minor pitting on the frame of the gun, although hard to see as it is under grips. Gun has parkerized finish, and I have added the rosewood grips from Altamont, although I still have the original walnut plastic grips that came with it. Comes with 2 magazines, the original with the gun and a second aftermarket. All of the springs in the gun have been replaced with Wolff springs, but I have kept all the originals.

The Henry Pump Action Octagon .22 rifle joins faded jeans, Mom’s apple pie, a restored ’57 Chevy as an all-American icon. Now fitted with a blue octagonal barrel, it resurrects the great old days of the traditional shooting gallery. The Henry Pump Octagon, available in calibers .22LR or .22 Magnum, is one gun that is built for fun.

It also sports a grooved receiver for mounting a scope, and Marbles semi-buckhorn fully adjustable rear sights with standard 3/8? dovetail slots enabling you to change sights if you choose to do so. Beautifully finished American walnut is used for the stock. The .22LR version can hold 15 rounds of .22LR and as much as 21 rounds of .22Short. If you must extract an unfired cartridge from the chamber, we have included a grooved release button at the right front of the trigger guard. When pressed back, the lever unlocks the forend allowing it to be retracted to eject the unfired round.

I'm looking to pick up so 44 magnum casings for reloading. I decided to finally get off my can and work up a load for my bisley and cougar. I either have other brass or even factory defense ammo I could trade, or if the price is fair I could pay cash. Fired brass or new brass is fine with me. So long as they are in good shape. I'm fine with regular brass or nickel plated. Cleaned or in the rough! Haha. I'm located in Norman and need to meet in or close to there (unless it's a deal I can't refuse that is haha).  We all know what we can find it for elsewhere, so please don't waste either of our time asking prices higher than I can pick up online or from other local sources.

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. Windage).  Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs.

This non-railed pistol features a Nitron® slide over a Natural Stainless frame and is accented by beautiful custom wood grips. The slide is further accented by polished cocking serrations and a Flat Top which enhances the two-tone aspect of this pistol. The slide is topped off with adjustable combat night sights while the frame is outfitted with a magwell for fast smooth reloads. The all stainless steel frame and slide of the STX are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance. The frame features 25-line per inch checkering on the front strap – while the mainspring housing has 20-line per inch checkering – and both the frame and slide are de-horned for comfortable full-size carry. Like all SIG SAUER products the 1911 STX pistol contains only premium internal parts including a match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. For safety the 1911 STX features a beavertail grip safety with speed bump, extended ambidextrous thumb safety, firing pin safety and hammer intercept notch and ships in a plastic gun case with cable lock.

I purchased this gun this past spring, took it out to clean the packing oil off of it and put it back in the safe.  I have other 1911's that I shoot all of the time and decided to sell or trade this something else.  It is a great looking gun, actually too nice for the way I shoot so I think someone who can appreciate it more than me should have it.  It is in new condition, unfired, no marks of any kind.  Everything that came new with the pistol is included.

Face to Face transaction only.  You must be willing to sign a bill of sale with your Concealed Carry # or Drivers license #.  I am willing to do the same if a trade is involved."

The Rock Island Armory 1911 series consists of a product line of single-action recoil operated semi-automatic pistols. They are designed and manufactured by Armscor in Marikina City, Philippines, and distributed in the United States by Armscor USA, located in Pahrump, Nevada.

RIA (Rock Island Armory) 1911s are clones of the US Military G.I. M1911-A1, the standard issue US Service pistol from 1911 to 1985. Most RIA models are targeted for the low-end price point of the 1911 pistol market and are basic entry level MIL-SPEC versions of the 1911, however, the RIA Tactical, Compact, and Match models offer additional semi-custom high end features. The Compact model features a skeletonized hammer and beavertail grip safety while the Tactical model also adds a target-grade hammer and trigger as well as an ambidextrous safety, and enhanced contrast combat sights. Armscor is an ISO 9001 certified-compliant company which manufactures Rock Island pistols using CNC (Computer Numerical Control) equipment. RIA 1911 series pistols are constructed of 4140 chromoly steel with a cast frame, and are available in .45 ACP, .38 Super, 9mm Luger, and .22 TCM chamberings.

Gun is in good shape, shows normal use i.e. rub marks on stock (pictured) No gouges or cuts anywhere on gun. It is however missing the front fiber optic sight.

These guns have the Armorlokt coating which basically wraps the gun in polymer, making it extremely resistant to adverse conditions. 

It has a 28"" forged barrel which shoots a real nice pattern. It is also aggressively textured on the forearm which was great when wearing gloves last duck season. Shoots everything from 3.5"" down, and the Supercell recoil pad DEFINITELY takes away a lot of the push from the magnum shells. Has the original factory Modified choke in it along with the plug, will also come with an extra Full choke ($30 value) purchased last year.

Adult owned. Only been out of the case twice.
Less than 100 rounds fired. Perfect condition. Comes with pump and soft carry case.
Also comes with BSA platinum 8-32x44 scope.
This rifle is very accurate (.5"" groups at 50 yd)
Pcp rifles are easier on scopes and more accurate than piston rifles. Just fill the cylinder with the pump or scuba tank and get 30-40 full power shots without having to pump / cock. Just work the bolt like a regular rifle and drop a pellet in the chamber.

This rifle is also quite a bit lighter and easier to handle than a piston /break barrel rifle.

It's a great way to practice shooting in neighborhoods. Cheap fun!
Bought it to take care of some pests in the yard, no longer need it.
Ive got $500 in this set-up, will take $400 or best offer.

Really? You bet! How about a 13 slot Picatinny Rail on a slick side flat top receiver, or an integrally-forged enlarged trigger guard. Don’t forget other high-end features like a Nickel-Teflon coated Colt match-target trigger, or 16” 4140 Chrome-Moly steel air-gaged match-quality barrel and even a low profile gas block. And we didn’t forget that people don’t come “one size fits all”. Which is why we made sure that this little Colt has a six-position adjustable carbine stock in an improved M4 style. It may look like a cross between a military and competitive rifle, but we assure you – it’s a sporting rifle!

441,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3351441,For Sale:  MDT Chassis Systems on sale at Badger State Ordnance (TAC21 and LSS),"Mosinee, Wausau, Wisconsin",$ 399,"Listed On: Monday, August 4, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"On sale at Badger State Ordnance - www.badgerstateordnance.com
The TAC21™ Remington 700 chassis is a combination of benchrest accuracy, superior ergonomics and specialized design. This chassis brings the Remington 700 to the next level in versatility and modularity, with an instant improvement in accuracy.

The drop-in chassis serves as a base to which the operator can add tactical components according to the desired functionality. The stock is manufactured out of aluminum hard anodized to mil spec type III, with a top full length MIL-Spec picatinny rail. The built-in mounting rail has 20 MOA (Minutes of Angle) on the action housing and is parallel to the barrel axis on the fore-end.

The TAC21™ chassis is designed to accept any AR-15 butt-stock and pistol grip (purchased seperately), offering the option to customize from the wide variety of accessories available on the market.

The TAC21™ chassis uses AICS style magazines in .223 and .308 caliber for Short Action and .300WM or .338LM magazines for Long Action rifles, and supports installation of bolt on picatinny rails on the fore-end and side of the action housing. Mounting holes are spaced for Magpul style L5 (11 slots) and L3 (7 slots) rails (1.600” / 3.200”).

TAC21® chassis is engineered to minimize warping and distortion. The rifle receiver only makes contact with the TAC21™ chassis on the V shape bedding and recoil lug area insuring the best accuracy and repeatability. The generous clearance on the fore-end makes any barrel (diameter up to the receiver size – 1.350”), free floating.

It is chambered in 223 wylde and will shoot 223 or 556 ammo. It has the rifle length gas system for smoother operation and less recoil.

I also have the sopmod stock and factory parts that it came with if the buyer wants them but the stock had a soft cheek pad installed and I didn't like the looks so I removed it and it has a large sticky spot from the adhesive that should come off easily with little effort. Its hard to tell how much money I have invested since I removed some of the lower end parts (which most of will come with the rifle as well) and then added better quality items. The rifle sells for over $1900 alone and there is a lot of money in aftermarket items installed on it. Parts list below shows additions. May take partial trades just ask. Call or text REDACTED.

Citadel is supposed to have ""the best triggers out of the box for an entry level 1911"" and I agree. This 1911 has a wonderful trigger. Very clean, precise and predictable. 
Citadel is made by Armscor, makers of Rock Island Armory - and the Citadel lifetime warranty care goes through Rock Island/Armscor.  

This 1911 has the Parkerized finish and good wooden grips. It has a skeletonized trigger and hammer, and stock black Novak style sights.  LOOKS WAY better in person. I do not take good photos. 

It is a good shooter, no issues at all with the gun - and only 100 rds through it. 

It includes the Polymer hard case, two Act-Mag magazines, 1 Chip McCormick Power mag and one unmarked 1911 mag. It also includes the cable lock and owner’s manual. 

Price is $425, firm. (OF course, No tax. no shipping, no ffl fees)

Finally a mounting platform designed for the serious shooting enthusiast and professionals world wide!

The all new WARNE Rapid Acquisition Multi-Sight Platform, or RAMP, is a cantilever style scope mounting platform that allows proper scope installation on the popular AR-15 rifle. By design, the AR platform was intended for fixed iron sights and did not offer an acceptable mounting surface for optics. As the weapon system evolved from the military designate M16A1 to the M16A3 and M4, Picatinny mounting systems became standard equipment, however, the rail system found on the A3 and M4 weapon systems still did not allow a variable power optic to be mounted far enough forward with conventional scope mounts.

The new Warne RAMP modular mounting system positions the front ring forward of the upper receiver by 1 3/4” allowing the optics to be mounted farther forward allowing the shooter to position their head in the proper position whether upright or prone and not sacrifice their shooting position due to improper optic positioning.

The new Warne RAMP also offers unique 45 degree mounting rails on one or both sides of the optic. As you know, variable power optics are great for distance but not CQB scenarios. Additionally, CQB sights are great for close quarters and entry scenarios but not for distance shots or target ID. So which one do you choose? Why not have both? The R.A.M.P provides exactly that. The primary sight can be as small as a 1-4 or as large as an 8.5-25 or larger variable power optic. With a mini red dot on one or both sides of the ocular, a shooter can transition from scope to dot or dot to scope in less than a second by rotating the weapon 45 degrees left or right. While the technique is not new, the position of the red dot is. By placing the sight under the ocular of the scope, we have provided a wider field of view thru the mini red dot and make acquiring the dot in the sight faster than you can imagine. And once again, you won’t have to sacrifice your shooting position when transitioning from sight to sight.

FEATURES:

    6000 Series Aluminum
    #8 Torx style fasteners with steel threaded inserts
    Cantilever design for proper eye relief
    Dual 45 degree mounting rails (with the option to remove one or both) for quick transition between scope and red dot

This thing was babied. Almost no external wear and the internals have always been spotless. The bore was broken in and conditioned using Tubb's Bore Conditioning System. Depending on the loads I used, I could get 1/2""-3/4"" groups at 100yds. 

The rifle is for sale/trade without the bipod, scope, mag, or rings. However, if you want the SWFA SS 10x42, sunshade, scope caps, Burris Tactical rings, Harris 9""-13"" adjustable bipod, and Magpul 20rnd polymer magazine with a Florida-legal limiter, add $500. 

This rifle was $1200 brand new. So, I'm not one of these delusional gun owners that thinks their rifle appreciates in value as it gets used. I also don't need to sell or trade this thing, so don't insult me by offering garbage or lowball offers.

The half eagle was the first gold coin actually struck for the United States.

This is a 1913p Indian Head Half Eagle ($5) Its in pretty good condition, theres still a lot of definition in the head and the reverse side eagle. the only problem is a mis-shaped star, one of the 13. Rated at MS62. This is your chance to own a part of american history, the fist gold coin from a US mint! Kinda sad to see this one go, but its time. Open to offers and trades. 
Thanks. 

Coin Facts
Bela Lyon Pratt’s $5 Indian Head Half Eagle Gold Coin design replaced Christian Gobrecht’s Liberty Head design which had been used since 1839. Minted between 1908 and 1929, Pratt’s design (shared with the $2.50 “Quarter Eagle”) was unique in US coinage history for using the unusual “incuse relief” style, according to the wishes of President Theodore Roosevelt. The obverse of the coin features an American Indian in war bonnet. The word LIBERTY across the top edge of the coin divides the thirteen stars draped across the upper portion of the coin, and the date is found below the bust. The reverse features a standing bald eagle atop a bundle of arrows wrapped in an olive branch. Compared to the $10 Gold Eagle, the two mottos on the reverse of the Half Eagle are switched: “E Pluribus Unum” appears on the left, with “In God We Trust” on the right.

The Crimson Trace Lightguard™ for Smith & Wesson M&P features a highly compact and slim design specifically for ease of holstering. Its 100 lumen tactical white light seamlessly attaches to your defensive pistol, much like Crimson Trace’s Laserguard®. Compatible with the LG-660 laser sight, Lightguard also uses the same instinctive activation that Crimson Trace laser sights are famous for. Lightguard removes the need for a flashlight separate from the pistol – giving you a free hand. Both of these low-light tools can be operated separately or simultaneously with a single hand.

Weighing 1 Troy Oz, each, the .45 ACP version of Silver Bullet Bullion won't actually fire in a weapon, but will target your financial goals with devastating power. Pure investment-grade .999-fine silver, available in boxes of 10 or individually. Celebrates the cartridges designed by John Browning in 1904 for use in his Colt semi-automatic .45 pistol. 
 Also available are 7.62 NATO Silver Bullet Bullion, weighing 2 Troy Oz, each, and at 2.72” in length every bullet is a near exact, non-firing replica of the round developed in the 1950s accepted as the first standard NATO cartridge (also called a .308). The 7.62 NATO (.308) Silver Bullet Bullion is two troy ounces of solid .999-fine silver, a unique weight that makes it handy for bartering.
 The 7.62 NATO round was designed to retain the ballistic performance of its predecessor the .30-06, but with a shorter cartridge length that worked more efficiently in newer, detachable-magazine rifles. It was first used by the US in the M14 infantry rifle and M60 machine gun. Though mostly replaced in modern service, the 7.62 NATO round remains popular for its superior performance in long range applications.

- Good Looking gun.
- Superb action.
- B&M Belding & Mull bolt sleeve peep sight for the Model 1903 Springfield rifle. These sights were carried in the B&M catalog in the mid 1920's and were very expensive for the time. There was a great desire at the tome to move the rear sight as far back as possible to increase accuracy and target acquisition. This sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation.  It also has its own side mounted safety lever, since mounting it required removing the original wing safety. 
- Very very nice shiny bore.
- Stock has been modified in the grip area to add a bit of a pistol grip, I suppose.  Added wood is also walnut with similar grain.
- Heavy steel buttplate, see photos.

Send best offers. Must be sold by the 17th, back to school.  If the ad is up the rifle is for sale.
