The 3-15x50 Tactical Riflescope (Matte Black) from Weaver has been specially engineered for tactical applications. It has been manufactured to the strictest tolerances in order to perform in the harshest environments. The 3-15x50 Tactical riflescope is waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. It has a 30mm, single piece tube construction. This riflescope is endowed with a Mil-Dot reticle and has fully multicoated lenses that contribute to the brightness and contrast of the optics. Locating the reticle in the first focal plane allows the size of the pattern to increase as the magnification is increased. This is preferred by many tactical groups for use as a point of aim and as a means of measurement.

The side focus feature allows parallax adjustment to keep the reticle and target aligned regardless of the shooters head position. An extra-hard coating on the exterior lens surfaces protects the optics from the scratches and abrasions that all too often occur in the rough and tumble world of tactical endeavors. With a comfortable eye relief of approximately 4 inches and a ¼ MOA click value for the windage and elevation turret adjustments, this riflescope is provisioned with all the features required for serious tactical work. This is a serious glass for serious situations.

30 mm tube

One-piece construction

Argon purged to eliminate internal fogging

Reset-to-zero turrets allow consistently accurate and precise target acquisition

Waterproof, shockproof and fogproof provide rugged and durable protection to the scope

Powerful 5 times magnification to move quickly from a wider to a more defined field of view

Reticle located in the first focal plane allows the size of the pattern to increase as the magnification is increased

Fully multicoated optics: multiple layers on all air to glass surfaces for a brighter, higher-contrast image with less eyestrain

Side focus parallax adjustment provides compensation for the shooters head movement as it affects the apparent movement of the target relative to the reticle

The Mil-Dot reticle is the standard reticle used by the US Army and Marine Corps that enables long range distance calculations. A series of dots on the cross hairs gives the shooter the ability to judge bullet drop and the proper hold over for accurate long range shot placement

It was restored by the previous owner around 06-07. It was Rhino-lined inside and out which is nice because you can just hose out the mud. The interior is amazing. Racing split-bench seats with 4point harnesses. It has a Sony Explod sound system. The heater works great but there is no air conditioner. The rear window was replaced with a sliding tinted glass. All the weather stripping has been replaces as well. There is no sun damage to the dash pad or arm rests. The drivers side window regulator needs to be replaced.($47.00) The steering column has been rebuilt and there is no rattle in it at all. Has a Grants racing wheel. The outside is also rhino-lined as well which prevents scratches and provides a lot harder surface to dent. The rhino lining for inside and out came to $4500. The truck has been taken down to the frame, brushed and undercoated. The gas tank has been replaced as well as all the gas lines and hoses. I also installed an electronic fuel pump. There are traction bars in place as well. Under the hood we have the original REBUILT 351m motor. Everything was replaced with performance parts. It has a Magnaflow exhaust system with headers. It has a new Edelbrock 4bbl carb and matching Edelbrock air intake and a K&N lifetime airfilter. The old fan 5 blade was replaced with a new stainless 6 blade. The radiator is also brand new. The old points and condenser were traded out for an electronic ignition. And has a Flamethrower 45,000volt coil. New plug wires and spark plugs. New ignition box, master cylinder and larger break booster. It has an automatic C6. Both 4 wheel high and low works great. It has locking hubs for better highway fuel economy. Tires- Trxus 39.5 with 15 inch rims. I bought the truck last July and its been good for the time I've had it. When I bought it I was not able to acquire the receipts of all the work he had done on it but I've taken it by several places and they told me he easily but 16,500 in just restoring it. I just cant afford to be running two trucks like this. The truck will be sold as is. Please do not contact me if you are not interested in my price. If you are serious, email me and I will get back with you as soon as I can. This truck is a blast to drive!

I have had this shotgun for over 10 years.  My grandfather gifted it to me and it has been very well taken care of.  I have cleaned it every year even when only used for shooting at the range.  I haven't used it for hunting for a few years since I have 3 other guns that I use for those situations.  The only reason I am selling this gun is because I would like to buy another turkey gun and really do not need 5 shotguns in the safe.  I only use this gun for the range and can use any of them for that so I thought someone else might as well get as much joy out of it as I have.

I had the gun appraised at $350 a few years ago, but am only asking $300 due to the slight wear on the butt stock.  The gun fires and reloads like a new gun.  I love it but just do not use it anymore.  I would rather sell it for lower than its value and know it is getting used rather than just having it sit in my safe.

I have a very well taken care of Winchester 1400 MKII 12ga., Semi Automatic , 28 inch barrel, modified fixed choke with a 2 3/4 chamber. This shotgun is not a safe queen, it has a few ""field use"" marks on it. 

I bought it about a year ago, cleaned her up and put her in the safe. I had my nephew shoot it a few months back and the old 1400 was flawless. He said it ran as fast as you could pull the trigger. 

Asking $280.00. Very affordable for a Semi-Auto! I'll even throw in a couple boxes of shells if I get the asking price.

Description:
Used by Special Forces, hunters and sport shooters
The CompM2, also known as the M68/CCO (when used by U.S. forces), is the standard sight for the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, and the armed forces of many NATO countries.
Designed for extreme conditions - submersible to 25 meters
The CompM2 is ready for use around the clock due to its compatibility with all generations of night vision devices (NVD)
When the CompM2 was released, it became the benchmark against which all other combat optics are measured. While primarily utilized by armed forces, the CompM2 is also available to hunters and sport shooters who want a professional-grade sight.
Holds up under the roughest physical handling and can withstand the most severe weather conditions and temperatures
Completely submersible and will withstand pressures up to 2.5 atmospheres allowing it to be taken up to 80 feet (25 meters) under water."

So I find myself sitting on more .22 than I really need. I am looking to unload it all ASAP looking around it seems like people are charging upwards of $.20/RD I think that while, cost does go up as supply goes down, it is crazy to ask that much. Here is what I have for Sale,

4 CCI ( they are the AR Ones) 300 rds per box $135.00

400 Rds CCI Stinger $44
225 Rd Remmington Golden Bullet JHP ( 225 box) $40.00
Total for 4625 Rds of 22LR NIB $529
OR toss me an offer Don't bother low balling me I don't need the cash, and the ammo is taking up space so I want it to move, but I am also not selling it for cost as time effort and gas went into obtaining this ammo. I live in Aurora, and being new to CO I tend to not know the area well my normal meeting spot is Gander MT off 225 Exit 5 but I can also meet at Bass Pro @ Stapleton."

Comes with all original gear (box, carrying case, manuals, ghost ring sight, etc) plus one extra ten round magazine and a Hogue grip sleeve. Hell, I'll even throw in what's left of the box of 40S&W I've got. (I'm not counting them, a quick glance says... 30 rounds?) Comes with Hi Point's lifetime warranty, as well.

Bought it new a couple years ago as a cheap plinker, did a little work to it (polished the feed ramp, smoothed out the firing pin channel, added the grip sleeve, etc.), decided I didn't much care for it after all, dumped it in the safe. 

It's been shot a few times since then, cleaned, and put away in a humidity controlled safe. Which is a bit of overkill for a Hi Point, I know.

FOID required, obviously. Cash only, no checks, I will not deliver, I WILL meet you somewhere if it's close, etc etc etc."

 I can find no pitting or bluing wear (I'd rate it 95-98%) and only a slight turn ring in the cylinder. There is one small spot on the right grip where there appears to be a slight blistering or something similar on
 the varnish.
Smith and Wesson says this pistol was manufactured in 1978.

$925 trade value, and, $850 cash sale ..... All laws will be followed and I will supply a bill of sale for both parties. I prefer a Face to face exchange in the Greensboro area, but, I will travel up to 50 miles for the right deal and will ship to your FFL for $25.00...

Barrett has been at this 30-plus years of making history, the powerhouse rifle that started it all is still leading the pack. With its low felt recoil and self-loading action, the Model 82A1 offers rapid, accurate firepower that never slows down. For more than three decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so infinitely precise it is hard to believe it's man-made.

Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot. Not for sale where prohibited by law.

This particular rifle has been fitted with a wide OD green handguard and enlarged charging handle, the original slim handguard and charging handle are included. The standard HK flash hider is included and removable if you wish to attach a different muzzle device. A Picatinny scope rail has been welded to the top of the receiver by the PTR factory, which included re-Parkerizing the rifle. Also included are the factory hard case, six 20-round aluminum magazines, one 10-round aluminum magazine, as well as spare small parts for the rear diopter sight (springs, bearings, screws, and lock washers - lose one of these while adjusting windage and you'll understand why).

I've owned this rifle just under a year now, and have fired 339 rounds of 150gr .308 Winchester ball through it. The manual recommends a break-in period of 200-300 rounds, but I have not experienced a malfunction of any kind thus far, and have kept the rifle clean and lubricated throughout. This past March I sent the rifle to the manufacturer to have them weld a Picatinny/1913 scope rail to the receiver since claw mount options are iffy, expensive, or both; they attached the rail and re-Parkerized the rifle while it was there, but I have not yet mounted any sort of optic to the rifle.
