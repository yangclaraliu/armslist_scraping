asking price is $1900 obo. CASH/TRADE/COMBO. If youre not serious, dont waste our time. this is a fully functioning, museum quality piece. a genuine piece of history.  1911A1s made at Colts Manufacturing Co. from about serial #848000 to about serial #2360400 generally have applied the final Ordnance acceptance mark of “G.H.D.” that was applied by civilian inspectors at Colts under the authority of Colonel Guy H. Drewry.  Mr. Drewry was promoted to Brigadier General on September 10 1942 and he was therefore a General Officer at the time this pistol was accepted.  This pistol appears to be in completely original near new condition.

This rifle was purchased in 2008, back when S&W actually put quality gear on their rifles. The barrel is a 16 inch M4 Profile barrel with a 1:9 twist, and is chambered in 5.56 Nato. I replaced the blocky 10 inch quad rail with a 13 inch Troy Alpha Rail. It's a lighter, longer rail system that provides a more narrow grip surface for the shooter, and is modular, so you can mount brackets wherever you would like to add an accessory. I have one long and one short rail attachment that goes with the gun. There is a Knights Armament forward vertical grip. The iron sights are M&P marked flip ups, made by Troy Industries. The front is adjustable. The rear is windage adjustable. They're solid metal sights, not the cheap plastic Magpul BUIS type. The furniture is all stock, just as it came from the factory. The buttstock is a 6 position collapsible stock, with S&W markings. Pistol grip is standard milspec. The trigger is a standard MilSpec, but I replaced the springs a few months ago, and gave the contact surfaces a light polish, resulting in a smooth, crisp trigger pull. I will also include 6 USGI metal magazines. I am also including a Magpul ASAP Plate, for sling attachment.

This is no ""custom"" gun, like I keep seeing advertised for sale here on Armslist and on the local FB forum pages.   This is an all S&W rifle, not a frankengun that was thrown together with the cheapest parts available on the internet.  No sub-quality crap here, S&W is one of the few manufacturers that are actually MilSpec, ie pressure testing, magnetic particle inspection, etc.

I bought it in Texas where I put a couple hundred rounds through it, then moved to Hawaii, where it was never shot (commie gun laws, and no place to shoot). I've used it for 3gun matches here in North Carolina, and it's an accurate, dependable rifle. I regularly ping steel out beyond 400 yards with this boomstick. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this rifle. I recently upgraded to a Daniel Defense V5, and I have more M4 variants in my safe than I can realistically justify to my wife, so it's got to go. 

I am asking $900 firm, and am not looking for any trades. This model retails for $1159, so that's a 22.5% savings under retail, not counting the magazines, the $199 Troy Alpha Rail, and the ASAP Plate. See the below links:

asking price is $1900 obo. CASH/TRADE/COMBO. If youre not serious, dont waste our time. this is a fully functioning, museum quality piece. a genuine piece of history. 1911A1s made at Colts Manufacturing Co. from about serial #848000 to about serial #2360400 generally have applied the final Ordnance acceptance mark of “G.H.D.” that was applied by civilian inspectors at Colts under the authority of Colonel Guy H. Drewry. Mr. Drewry was promoted to Brigadier General on September 10 1942 and he was therefore a General Officer at the time this pistol was accepted. This pistol appears to be in completely original near new condition.

Originally a Type 45 that was adopted by the government of Siam (now Thailand) in 1903, it was later converted to 8x52R, the rear sight was lowered and remarked (flatter shooting trajectory) and was designated the Type 66.  This is a solid, gorgeous Mauser action that has proven a great basis for that custom rifle project.  Becoming harder and harder to find, particularly in this condition; the metal is gorgeous on this, after all these years.  Dust cover intact, as are all markings.  Currently there are 3 listed on www.gunsinternational.com, for $599, $495 and $450.  Priced to sell (as I have my eye on another project) and can be yours for $300.00. Many more pics available; just let me know!  This is one gorgeous and exotic Mauser to really round out your collection."

•	The ISR takes advantage of the best characteristics of the 300 Blackout by integrating key components into one package, eliminating the need for two separate tax stamps.  While the rifle utilizes a 10.3” barrel, it is not classified as an SBR (Short-Barreled Rifle) because the suppressor is permanently attached.  The DDM4ISR 300’s sound suppressor is threaded and welded to the proprietary ISR Integrated Gas Block, bringing the barrel length to 16.145”.  While the rifle is at the 16” legal limit, the ISR’s integrated suppressor will require an NFA tax stamp.   Using the tool provided, the ISR’s baffle core is removable for cleaning.  With the inclusion of the Daniel Defense Modular Float Rail (MFR) 12.0, it provides the shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability.  This rifle can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube.  In addition, the 3” Modular Picatinny Rail sections allow the end user to customize the rail set up.
•	It is the buyer’s responsibility to make sure they comply with all NFA rules and applicable laws."

PWS is a smaller company, but one that makes some of the best guns on the market and quite arguably, the best piston system out there. Ever wonder why there's so few short stroke piston systems in any combat rifles other than AR15s and why nearly everything else is long stroke? Because it's better. With guns, most of the time, simple is just better and what PWS has done is so simple, it's amazing. They basically took an AK piston assembly and put it in their AR pattern receiver. The result is one of the smoothest, lightest (It's under albs), and most reliable systems out there. The handling puts the likes of LWRC, LMT, Adams Arms and pretty much everyone else to shame. You get the weight and handling of a top quality DI gun, but the clean running and ridiculous reliability of a piston system. There's really nothing like it.

You'll be pretty hard pressed to find a rifle this nice for anywhere near this price, let alone a piston gun at this price. I'd love to hold on to this one, but I need the cash more than the gun. The price is firm. Not really looking for a trade as I need the cash."

Once you paint this gun, it will be a beautiful rifle.  You won't find a better rifle for this price.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver. Each SA M-7 receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Las Vegas, Nevada. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive and Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability"

The wood on this gun is absolutely beautiful.  You won't be disappointed with this gun.  It's already sighted in and ready to go target shooting or hunting with the 5rd magazine.  This gun shoots the cost effective and available 7.62x39mm ammo that will easily take down a deer or wild pig in Oklahoma.  This gun will out shoot any other 7.62x39mm gun out on the market easily.  Two Rivers Arms is well known for their quality and workmanship, so you know that you're getting a quality gun.  If you think an AK can't shoot very well, then you'll change your mind after shooting this gun.  I have put approx. 200 rounds down the barrel on this gun without any problems.

The buyer must be willing to travel to the OKC area for a Face to Face purchase.  I'm only willing to sell the gun to an Oklahoma resident with a valid Oklahoma Driver's License or a US military member with proper paperwork for an Oklahoma Duty Station.  This is a cash only deal, so please no trade offers.  I'm firm on my price.  You can contact me through the link in the ad on this website.  Thanks for looking."

These are up for sale at a discount due to some minor cosmetic issues as detailed below. Both holsters were made to fit the Glock 19/23 size pistols, but will also fit the 17/22 and 34/35 models. This is possible because the bottom of both holsters are open, which means they will also fit a 19/23 with a threaded barrel.

Also, these holsters were made to fit a smaller waist size (29-33). If you would like them to be made to fit a larger waist I can re-bend them for $5.

Holster #1:
Color: Olive Drab
Sweat Shield: Yes
Cant: ~10 deg
Kydex thickness: .080""
Belt size: 1.5""
Belt loop kydex thickness: .080""
Notes/Issues: Not many. The edges aren't perfectly matched and polished, but typically you have to be in the business of holsters to really notice this. Also, the belt loops aren't perfectly shaped, but again, this does not effect functionality. 
**Price: $45**

Holster #2:
Color: Coyote 
Sweat Shield: Half
Cant: ~15 deg
Kydex thickness: .080""
Belt size: 1.5""
Belt loop kydex thickness: .125"" (These loops are STOUT and won't be breaking anytime soon.)
Notes/Issues: Not too many on this one either. Since the loops are about an inch wide and .125"" thick, they had to be heated up more than normal. In the process of my experimentation with this thickness, I overheated them slightly and they became a little shiny. Also, the corners of the loops are a little ugly but not terrible. Finally, the edges on this holster aren't as perfectly polished and matched as my normal holsters. These are only cosmetic issues and do not effect functionality.
**Price: $45**

I am willing to accept trades for reloading dies for 308 Win, .224/.223 projectiles (55gr through 80gr), .308 projectiles (147gr and up only please), .452 lead projectiles, primers (SR, LR and LP), various powders, a good case trimmer would be nice, a relatively nice scope (plus cash on my end maybe), 30mm rings for a CZ 550, and of course if you have 22 ammo feel free to offer that up as well!

Built around an awesome Bison Armory stainless steel 18"" 1 in 10 twist barrel chambered in 6.8 SPC II.  it's attached to an Aero Precision upper.  You'll hold a Rick River Arms 14"" TRO free float rail.  It has a UTG bipod attached.  It has a nickel boron BCG which is very smooth and easy to clean.  All this is sitting on a Mag Tactical lower with a CMMG LPK.  You'll be looking through a Vortex Diamondback 3-9x40 MOA reticle optics. It has exactly 120 rounds through it, is very accurate, more accurate than i could shoot.
I think that's about it.  Let me know what you think.

The only thing I would consider trading for is a very nice 308 bolt like a Remington 700 SPS tactical.  I would do both with optics, or both without optics."

Frankly, many of the ads I see on Armslist are borderline insane.  Assuming you actually want to sell or trade your gun, here's a few tips ...

 - Take the time to make a few clear, well-lit photos.  It ain't that hard and greatly increases your chance of a sale.  90% of buyers will ignore an ad without photos.

 - The internet is your friend, do some research before you post. Your used gun is NOT worth the same or more money than it can be bought for new. Unless you have a rare/vintage piece, out of production and desirable with collectors, it's going to be worth maybe 75-85% of the LOWEST available new price, and that's for a minty piece in the box. 

 - You WILL lose money on a customized gun. Just because you put $300 worth of aftermarket parts on a $500 gun doesn't make it worth $800. On the contrary, most buyers would rather have a LN unmolested OE piece.  If you can, put the OE parts back on the gun and sell the gun and parts separately. You have a better chance of getting a sale and might even make more money if you separate.

 - Be nice, be approachable.  Putting statements like 'no lowballers' or 'don't waste my time' in your ad just makes you sound like a jerk. I don't bother with jerks and most other folks won't either.

 - This is the 21st century for christ' sake. Refusing to read emails or text messages is just dumb. It's how people communicate now, you can always follow-up with a phone call.

 - Stay On Topic!  This isn't 'iPad List' or 'Hot Tub List'.  The people reading these ads are interested in guns, gun parts/accessories, and gun or hunting-related items.  They're NOT interested in your unrelated junk. Posting these types of ads are a waste of your time, nobody reads them.

Good luck next time."
