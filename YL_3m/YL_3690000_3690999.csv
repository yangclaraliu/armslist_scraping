NRA GOOD CONDITION: In safe working condition, minor wear on working surfaces, no broken parts, no corrosion or pitting that will interfere with proper functioning.

This one has some scratches and small dings in the stock and the bluing is worn in spots.  I feel it falls under the NRA good condition standards.  There is light pitting and freckling on the barrel but nothing that interferes with function.  Great little plinker to hit the range with or to let new shooters borrow.

While I am not aware of any safety issues all used firearms should be inspected by a competent gunsmith prior to use.

CONDITION IS NRA VERY GOOD- In perfect working condition, no appreciable wear on working surfaces, no corrosion or pitting, only minor surface dents or scratches.

There are very light marks on the stock from being moved around in the safe.  All of them are surface marks mostly on high spots with no deep dents in the wood.  

These are the same as a Marlin 60.  This is a pre 1980 model I believe, as it has the 22"" barrel and 17+1 capacity. I have not fired the gun myself, but it looks like everything is in working order. Only selling because I already have another Marlin 60 which is almost identical.

First gun is a Remington 522 Viper .22lr with scope, bipod and two 10rd mags. Scope and bipod are not high dollar but work great for a 22. $135. Update: viper is being held for a week.
2nd gun is a GSG 522 SD .22lr with Rex red dot, some sort of cheap laser that I got with a used gun, single point sling, and FIVE .22rd mags. The gun has about 150 to 200 rounds through it and from what I've found, is not picky about ammo. The red dot was $40 and the mags were $45 for a two pack. The sling was like $15 or so. I put over $440 into this gun. Selling all together for $360.
I have .22 ammo available for the gun buyers as well. More pics and info available upon request. Email or text REDACTED. I tend to screen calls, especially if I'm at work. I will not drive very far from my location. Thanks for looking. Sorry, but ammo is only available to people buying a gun. Must be willing to show ID and legal to own firearms.

This is a Mossberg 44US(a) 22lr bolt action.  Comes as shown with the original magazine which is in excellent condition. 

 I spent several hours and completely disassembled the rifle. I cleaned every nook and cranny on the gun, lightly oiled everything, and put it back together without issue. I did not polish, refinish, sand, or hammer anything on this gun. I simply made sure it was spotless and put it back in order. The action is smooth and the bore looks great. These are supposedly amazing shooters, but I have never fired it to confirm that. The finish appears to be the original blueing which is just starting to take a nice patina. 

The rifle has a set of high quality KINGS sights installed. This is a professional installation, not a hack job. 

 The gun is missing the sling swivels on both the front and rear. I will never use a sling and have no intention of tracking a sling/sling mount

While I am not aware of any safety issues all used firearms should be inspected by a competent gunsmith prior to use."

This AR Pistol has a Karris upper with a floating aluminum handguard. Milspec Bolt carrier with staked key and milspec bolt assy. Barrel is 7.5 inches, has a 1:7 twist, and a krink muzzle break which directs the sound and flame forward (not down or sideways). The front and rear sights are Magpul Mag 247 and Mag 248 (not PTS). The lower is an Aero with a Ergo grip and Fab Defense Magazine well grip. The forearm brace is a Sig Sauer SB15.

I started this off with a saimese Mauser for 500$ Bought a stainless shilen heavy barrel for almost 200$ Had a gunsmith remove the old barrel, install the new, check headspace, etc as well as test fire for 300$+ also had him drill , tap and install base mounts for 40$ I then had it duracoated snakeskin camo for 200$ with brush colors to match our landscape.

A 2 stage trigger is currently installed. 

A ramline stock comes included and came with the gun. Someone tried removing material to fit the gun and got really close. I tried to fit it and it only needs a little material removed for the gun to be complete. This is 5-10 minutes of work. Fit it in this stock, or an aftermarket Mauser stock of your choice.

This is a Stevens single shot 20ga.  There are no model or serial numbers on this gun, I would guess 1930s but who knows.   This locks up tight with no play between the barrel and receiver.   I have not fired the gun.  While I am not aware of any safety issues all used firearms should be inspected by a competent gunsmith prior to use.  

This is the middle gun in the picture.  The .410 is gone, I am debating on selling the 12ga pictured but have not decided yet."

The polyurethane finish will be on the higher side, due to the fact that it is thicker and take a little more time to remove. 

Price for Apply filler (if needed), staining, and finishing stock to a slight/medium gloss- $150-225. Large military stocks will be on the higher side of 150. This includes a complete cleaning of the firearm, removal of small rust spots, and minor fixes/lifting of dents. 

Barrel and receiver bluing available. Price depends on the length and overall mass of the firearm and how much rust is present(if any). I use Blue Wonder for all my bluing projects and have had wonderful success compared to other brands. 

Your satisfaction is my number one priority. I take pride in what I do and really enjoy doing it! Please contact me with any questions. 


Note: I do NOT build custom stocks and have no experience with fabricating stocks! What I'm great at is staining and finishing stocks, also fixing minor imperfections and dents."

Hate to get rid of this beauty! Sorry, no trades. If you're new to the 300 Blackout, it's a great ""plug & play"" upper for your AR platform. Just pin it on your lower and you're shooting a 30 caliber round out of the same lower and magazines as your 5.56/.223. You can fit 30 rounds in your standard mag - it's a seamless transition, and it's a great round for running suppressed."

If you have never handled one, there is no way of me describing to you how high quality and high tolerance of a weapon this is. The trigger is ridiculous. I kinda screwed myself on buying it and now I need to get the money together for a ring. I may be interested in some trades plus cash. Possibly:

Glocks
Rifles (high end ARs. 308 type ARs (Scar 17) 
Scopes (high end- Nightforce. Premier. Schmidt and Bender)

Other than that. I'll probably pass. From all the other high end 1911s I've had, this will be gone in a couple days. I will accept offers but don't even bother with low balls. I won't even respond because I'll be busy responding to people who actually have the cash. Also, the last Dan Wesson I had actually sent for more than I originally asked due to a bidding war. There's no doubt that this is the best handgun (1911) that you can find. It really doesn't get any better. Or any sexier. I'll start at what I paid for it, because, these are investment guns and don't loose value. Also, it's a custom gun that you would have to wait 2 years to get in your hands. A lot of people find that more valuable than anything. Thanks for lookin guys. Happy hunting"

It is a vet Bring Back so no import marks. It is a mismatch though with the upper carrying # 1810 & the lower carrying # 228. All the upper parts that are marked are # 1810. The lower is marked # 228 and marked Germany under that. The bore has darkness in the grooves and somewhat worn. I would rate the bore 7/10, With shooting it may improve. I have not had it to the range. If you are looking for a shooter, I think this would be a great candidate. The grips have honest wear from being carried and there is a hairline crack in the top of right grip. it has a wooden bottom mag that is mismatched. It comes with a WWII brown holster that is marked as seen in the photos with no mag or tools. The holster does have a small hole in the muzzle end of the holster that should be an easy repair. I did take this out for a test fire and it ran flawlessly. Feel free to email me for pics or specific photos. This will need to ship to at least an 03 FFL. Shipping by USPS Priority."

Bent bolt, 3 position safety, 5 round capacity.  Chambered in 8mm Mauser.  Please email, text or call me for more information or more pictures.  I will include 3 boxes (80 rounds) of 8mm ammo.  When you compare prices on Gunbroker or other sites online, please note the following:  this is not a Yugo, it's not sporterized and it's not a fake Mitchell's Mauser.  I live in south Greeneville.  For those in Greeneville & north, I can meet at the Greeneville Walmart.  If you live south of me, I can meet off 81 at the 11E exit.  $450 cash / $500 trade value.

This aerosol can is completely new and unused.

My asking price is $30 for this aerosol can of DuraCoat. 

My price is firm on this, because I paid higher price myself than this. I also had to pay a high Hazmat shipping and handling fee for just this one can of DuraCoat.

I will meet you face to face in Lower Bucks County for a cash-only transaction. 

I will ship this item if you really want me to, but this item can only be shipped with all applicable Hazmat fees.

DuraCoat is much more than just some ""paint"" from a hardware store. I have not yet seen these products being sold at any stores, or even at any gun shows, either.

DuraCoat aerosol cans have a unique can-within-a-can feature which provides the hardener right inside the can.  No measuring or mixing is necessary to use this item. You instead just shake the can for two minutes, then release the hardener by activating the catalyst inside the can, and then shake the can again for two more minutes, and then you will be ready to apply the spray. 

DuraCoat will provide protection against rust and corrosion, plus excellent protection from UV rays of the sun. DuraCoat can be applied to all types of metal, plastic, and wood. DuraCoat can be applied over bare metal, parkerized finishes, anodized finishes, and blued finishes.  

This can of aerosol DuraCoat will remain usable for up to 48 hours once activated. This can of aerosol DuraCoat contains enough material to cover 2 entire rifles or 4 entire handguns, or 1 entire rifle and 2 entire handguns. DuraCoat can be used on almost anything else besides guns, too...things like paintball guns, bows, crossbows, knife or machete blades, ATV or truck parts, etc.

No baking or preheating is required to use DuraCoat. This can of DuraCoat has an adjustable nozzle for vertical or horizontal spraying.

If you would like to see an official product demonstration for a can of aerosol DuraCoat, you can view the Youtube video for it here:

Up for sale is a Savage model 16 FCSS ""Weather Warrior"" chambered in .308 Winny. This particular model has the AccuTrigger AND the AccuStock (a little better than the  regular stock, aluminum bedding). I had the stock hydrodipped in ATACS-FG for a little quieter approach when elk hunting. Detachable box magazine. Will include the Simmons Pro A/O scope that is on it, the Millet mounts and Leupold rings. Not a super high end scope (think I paid $149), but it gets it done. Right now it's zeroed at 200yds with an asskicker made by DoubleTap that is a 200gr projectile. There are a few scratches in the hydro coat from hunting, other than that rifle is in really good shape. Maybe 40 rounds down the tube after proper break-in procedures were followed (60ish total). 

Sale $600, FIRM, here is a link to it on Buds. All lower offers will be ignored.(http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/14482) where just the rifle (not including mounts, rings or glass) is selling for $665...also have some ammo you can purchase for me if you want to take it right out and hunt with it.

These are nice, inexpensive little knives which I've used myself on my place.  I've used them to cut open feed bags, cut twine on hay bales, whittle wood, etc.  They hold their edge well, and seem to be of decent quality for their price range.  At the same time:  If one is lost it's not going to hurt the way losing a more expensive knife such as Buck, Gerber, etc. would.  Discoloration on the first knife is some oil I didn't get wiped off.

The one knife is a MADE IN USA lockblade.  

It's a spring assisted opening knife with a button which allows you to close the knife when you're through using it.  Anyone would be proud to own this little knife imo it's really nice.

I can sell these face to face, or would be happy to mail them to you.
