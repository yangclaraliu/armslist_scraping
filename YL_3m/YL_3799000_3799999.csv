I built it last year and never thought I would sell it but I need the money for my business. I have about 1,200 rnds of .223 I'm giving with it which is over $500 in ammo alone. With all the mod's I've done the Rifle alone is worth almost $2,500 but price is negotiable. The rifle itself has had less than 200 rds through it. It is worth noting that the bolt is also coated so any carbon transfer is minimal because it is two stage piston driven but any carbon can simply be wiped off. There is also no heat transfer to the BCG during firing which means it does not have to be constantly soaked in CLP to operate properly. 

It has a Magpul Rifle Stock, Magpul AFG2, Magpul MAID pistol grip with CLP storage, Boron Nitride Coated Bolt and Rainier Arms charging handle, as well as RAC flash hider and rails with Magpul heat shields.

This is an all matching except one electro stencil forcematch by factory.  Even the stock matches the rifle.  It is all original from the factory included the Romanian Shellacking on the stock.  The bore is bright which is rare and the stock is sealed which is rare.  Normanlly these have huges gouges in the stock but this stocks imperfections are still covered by the factory shellacking.  The Romanian SKSs were rarely imported into the US and the ones that made it are usually non-matching, beat up, and shot out.  This is one of the rare ones.  Made in 1960, the Russians sent all of their original equipment to the Romanians after the Russians stopped sks production when the ak47 was introduced.  So the Romanian are built on all Russian tooling.  They are closer to the original Russian rifles than the Chinese, Yugo, or Albanian.  In fact these are basically EXACT copies.

Never fired. Received this as part of a trade. Has a few dings in the stock from bottom of a storage rack, but nothing bad. Could probably be taken out with steam, but since they are so minimal, I havn't bothered. The wood on the stocks has very nice patterns as seen in the pics and the flaws are only noticable from inside 2 feet, or else I'd be advertising this as brand new.

Closes up tight and crisp. Has the double triggers. These are listed used all over for $350 and my father just got one in 410 gauge brand new for $450 minus the $50 mail in rebate.

I'm really tempted to try it out, but havn't yet. Bore obviously is mint and looks shiny and perfect.

More about the rifle:

I purchased this rifle brand new in September of this year (2014) It is a great rifle and I really love how smoothly and reliably it shoots. I do not have the cheek riser or the Ar-15 style grip that it came with because I was going for the authentic swiss type look. To achieve that I added Troy Micro folding battle sights $(150). This sights sit a little lower than standard Ar sights and they are perfect for this rifle due to the dip in the Swiss style stock; They match up to form a perfect fit. I also have added the authentic Sig Swiss grip as it flowed with the rifle better and provides a more stable grip. 

The ;ight black finish on the gas block which is attached to the barrel has a little wear along the edges from general use and disassembly for cleaning. Also there are a few light scratches on the upper receiver (no dents) from use in the woods, shooting prone and doing drills and also setting the rifle down on tables and benches at the range. This rifle is in great overall shape and looks great.

This rifle has been flawless for me so far and I have not experienced any malfunctions whatsoever, with various types of ammunition; it just works and works, just like an AK. I have had it out in the woods and to the range a few times and accuracy has been very good. I have put exactly 270 rounds through this rifle. I hate to see it go but I have one to many in the safe and this one is the newest.

Since this is the Swat model it cost me about 1300 NIB. I am asking $900 due to the light scratching only and I am pretty firm on the price. I will meet at almost any FFL in the Grand Rapids area to conduct the transfer or may consider FTF in the Grand Rapids Area, although I prefer FFL. Cash only and no trades. If interested please contact me. Thanks for looking."

This is a Shadow Ops lower receiver with a PSA upper, BCM bolt carrier group, ALG trigger, KNS roll pins, Magpul UBR stock, BCM KMR 10"" free float rail, Troy modular vertical grip, BCM pistol grip, AAC 16"" barrel (1:7 twist), Primary Arms Micro dot on a Seekins mount, PWS Triad flash hider, and Magpul sights (not pictured, still new in the package).

Rifle has about 300 rounds through it without issue. I've shot it suppressed and unsuppressed with various bullet weights (147-220). Though the heavier subsonic loads only cycle with the can on. That is to be expected though. Stabilizes 208 and 220 GR subsonics just fine.

-Williams® fiber-optic Fire Sights, Elevation adjustable
- Sling Swivels

For serious extended-range shot gunners, the Model SP-10 is the ultimate in lethality – from duck blinds to the turkey woods and everywhere in between. Its 3 1/2"" 10-gauge payloads are significantly superior in patterning efficiency to 12-gauge 3 1/2"" guns, and even produce less felt recoil. It features a corrosion-resistant gas-operated action in which a small cylinder – not the entire piston – moves, helping dampen rearward force. Ultra-reliable and smooth, it’s the only shotgun worthy of the ultimate bird-leveling payload.

This is gun is no longer in production and so they are quite rare and quickly becoming a collectors item. Please serious inquiries only."

1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR Conversion Kits for the GLOCK pistol.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

Included is an excellent Cabela’s Alaskan Guide Series 4.5-14x42mm scope, with  rangefinding and bullet drop compensating reticle out to 500 yards. The scope also has an adjustable objective to eliminate parallax and ¼ MOA repeatable click adjustments for reliably dialing in MOA adjustments for a longer shot if one chooses. The scope is mounted to the rifle using Warne Maxima, matte black, steel 1” Ruger integral rings. Everything is in excellent condition, and less than one hundred rounds have been shot through the rifle; while nearly all factory hunting loads that I have tried, have shot less than minute of angle groups, with many consistently grouping under a ½ minute of angle.

These are made by the same guys as the ACOG scopes in use in the military and one variant of these reflexes is used in the military as well (the RX01NSN).

Basically it us superior to Eotech and Aimpoint products using a  better reticle than just a dot, being very rugged, and due to the fact that you never need to change batteries as it gains its power from ambient light through fiver optics and from a Tritium power supply. 

Includes the mount and polarizing filter:
RX14 Flat top mount (as these don't generally sell with mounts)(retails at $136): https://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=RX14  
RX20 Polarizing filter (retails at $26): https://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=RX20
The setup would basically run you $650 new.

Sorry for the picture quality, I'm no expert photographer. The reticle is indeed the triangle, not the dot as the blurred image would have you believe. 

Sale price is $350 OBO. I can ship with insurance for another $20. Reasonable offers will be entertained, looking to have this gone soon so I can spend more for Christmas."

The advantage of the super mag as a hunting shotgun is its ability to fit even the large 3 1/2 inch shells which pack more punch. At the same time you can shoot even the small shells out of this gun. The receiver is designed to match any size. Remington's classic 870 design also guarantee's durability and function. This gun was just recently bought for me as a gift but I already have too many shotguns. It's a 4+1 tube loader, pump action in all black. Everything on this gun is brand new. I have not shot any rounds out of it and it comes with all the parts from the box including the instructions. I have however oil it twice since I received it since most guns come from the factory fairly dry. This would make an ideal hunting shotgun but would also be excellent for home defense. Remington makes an extended ammunition tube for fairly cheap which is installed very easily for those who would use this for home defense.
