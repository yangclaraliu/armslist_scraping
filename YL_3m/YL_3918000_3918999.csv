- Also more info on the trigger group & housing: 
      (a) The trigger group is from a HK G36. The only modification to this pack was the removal of the secondary sear. There is a spring and spacer in its place which can easily be removed for the installation of a REGISTERED CLASS III sear. All other components are intact, including the secondary sear release lever. This makes for a perfect reg. sear host. 
      (b) The housing is from a HK MP5, and has been clipped but not pinned. I have a kit to add the fake pin look, I just never got around to it. I think it looks fine as-is but will include the kit as well. If the new owner wants me to install it for them, I will do so.

For Sale: 
Bobcat Weapons BW5 (MP5 Clone). 
Caliber: 9mm
Action: Semi-Auto
Stock: A2 (fixed)
Year of Manufacture: 2005

This is a rare gun. I know BW is still producing clones, and even though they are hard to find on their own, nothing being produced today can even come close to the rifle you see here. 

I am one of the early adopters, and pre-ordered this rifle in 2004, when it was announced. I was on a waiting list for over a year. This gun was one of the first 50 off the production line, back when BW was located in Scottsdale AZ. Only about the first 100 units shipped with German bolts and carriers. The reason that is of significance, is due to the manner in which the receivers for created for these clones. In the beginning, BobCat Weapons used an original, German manufactured, HK94 receiver as a template. These units functioned perfectly, since the bolt carrier was also of German origin. When the german parts ran out, BW was forced to source their bolt carriers (and other components) from after-market suppliers. About 50 rifles actually shipped under this condition and those are complete and total garbage.

When customers started complaining, the folks at BW took a closer look at what was coming off the assembly line. Stovepipe rounds, FTE, and numerous other feed issues were obvious. These failures pointed straight to the aftermarket bolt carriers. Turns out the modern carriers had minute differences in both dimensions, mass, and weight distribution. Not being able to locate a new source for the carriers, BW patched the issue by designing a modified receiver with slightly different tolerances. This resulted in far fewer feed failures and seemed to make customers happy. Having known someone who owns a “patched” bw5 and having shot it myself, I can tell you that it fails far more frequently than this gun, but thats not the point I am trying to make here. The most significant problem with the patched receiver is that since it was designed to “fit” a non german part, one can never confidently use german parts in one of these modified receivers.

In my decade+ of owning this piece, I have made MANY upgrades and modifications, all of which are outlined below. The price next to each item is what it cost ME at the time.

1. Original German Made H&k MP5 SEF trigger housing - $50
2. Original German Made H&k G36 FullAuto Trigger Group - $150 **NOTE: this is not a Class III weapon. While the trigger group is FA ready, the secondary sear need for FA has been removed. This makes this gun a great host for anyone with a Class III sear though.
3. SureFire Weapon Lite Forearm - $350
4. Additional Original German Made H&k Navy Trigger (housing only) - $150
5. Advanced Armament Imitator (fake Can) Conversion - $350 **NOTE: Another desirable trait of the early BW5’s they were made using Original German Made H&k MP5 3-lug barrels. A fake can shipped with the unit, but I had this conversion done by AA in Georgia to make to improve the looks of the gun.
6. Original German Made H&k 3-Lug Flash Suppressor - As I mentioned before, there is a real MP5 3-lug barrel on this gun. If the new owner lives in a state that allows SBRs then the pin can be removed from the AA fake can. This is the only situation in which this FS can be used. If you don't want to make an SBR, you can sell the FS for around $150 online.
7. Original German Made H&k Law Enforcement Marked 30round curved Magazine - $75
8. Original German Made H&k MP5 30round Straight magazine. - $25
9. Original German Made H&k A2 fixed Stock - $200 **This is not plastic like you see on most clones. This is the real deal, German made, from a MP5.

I have over $1400 in just the upgrades alone. I paid $1500 for the gun back in 2005. You can buy clones for $1500-$2000 today, but nothing being produced today can come close to the quality, reliability, and authenticity of what you see here.

I am asking $2000 firm - The only trade I would consider would be for subcompact, plus cash. Something like a Ruger LCP or Sig P250. Otherwise, cash only.

This just happens to be my latest purchase/build and therefore it has never been shot. I ordered it custom from PSA with various high end equipment and parts. 

The Lower is installed with the upgraded and hand tuned trigger group (also stainless steel as shown in the pic). The LPK is their enhanced kit, meaning better quality pieces that are all guaranteed Mil-Spec.

The Upper is all Mil-Spec chrome lined internals made be FN (same company that provides barrels for the US Military M4 and M249 rifles). CHF, MPI, and HP tested chrome lined barrel with a 1:7 twist rate. 

The BCG is Nickel Boron (along with the bolt and internals). This makes cleaning much easier, wears better, and can run longer in dry/dusty/sandy conditions without lube. 

Has an upgrade Mil-Spec charging handle for better grip and use in adverse conditions and/or with gloves on.

I added (all 100% new):

-Vortex Strikefire Red/Green dot (awesome optic which I run on my other AR's as well). Is currently is setup in a 1/3 co-witness with the front sight post. 
-MagPul rear BUIS flip up sight (also 1.3 co-witnessed with optic and front sight post).
-MagPul B.A.D. level 
-Single point sling adapter, along with single point sling
-Magpul MOE forearm
-MagPul MVP foregrip

Priced to move at $1100. Although not pictured, also comes with a nice carrying case, 90 rounds of 5.56 Lake City brass ammo, and 3 30 round magazines. 

NOTE: This is not your typical PSA entry level or ""freedom"" series rifle. This is loaded with top end equipment and parts, very much on par with the Colts, Rock Rivers, etc. Plus it has very classy and functional additions (sling, red dot, foregrip, etc.).

I will include the original case and a few a USGI mags loaded with XM193 ammo.


This rifle has about 100 rounds shot through it.  I purchased it a year ago, but relocated further in to Orlando to go to school. I do not have the time to drive out to rifle ranges enough to justify owning this great rifle.


When I zeroed in the irons it was shooting around 1 MOA with XM193 @ 100yds.  This is the nicest AR i have ever shot.  Very light on the recoil impulse due to KAC's extended mid-length gas system.


I have cleaned and maintained the rifle.  It does not have any blemishes or wear marks.


Just to note; the Magpul stock pictured and the red dot sight are NOT included.  The standard LMT Sopmod stock is included.


The only changes I made to the rifle have been the Tango Down grip ($30) and I also added a BCM gunfighter charging handle ($60).


For $1400 I will toss in 3 USGI mags loaded with XM193 ammo.


I will only accept cash or USPS Money Order, no Paypal/dogs/other trades please.  Only exception would be for a pistol with AT LEAST $700 cash tossed in.


Proof of military service and I'll drop price down to $1300.


This is an amazing deal, considering MSRP on these rifles is around $2k and it's condition.

I also have 70+rounds of 12ga. shotgun shells I will throw in just to get rid of them as I no longer have a shotgun.
Will sell outright for $220 cash or add a little cash for the right trade.

if you’re looking for a cheap AR, this isn’t for you.. if you’re looking for a very high quality custom AR made from the best parts, you’ve found your rifle!

please take the times to copy/paste the below links into a new tab in your web browser to see the prices and reviews.

i’ve only had this rifle out to the range twice, and now it has to go. 

Every part below is absolutely great, here are some of the highlights: the barrel is cold hammer forged and 14.5 inches long, the flash suppressor uses a reverse cone system that greatly reduces muzzle rise, the bolt carrier is BCM HP tested and MPI, the lower parts kit is simply the best one on the market with all the upgrades and coated in nickel boron, the trigger is the nickel boron spikes battle trigger and you have to shoot it to believe how nicely it brakes, the sights are the new MagPul pro set (all metal) and they use detents (not springs) for holding a better zero, BCM VLTOR gunfighter charing handle is hands down the best… you get the picture.

this is one awesome rifle. 

thanks for looking!

This just happens to be my latest purchase/build and therefore it has never been shot. I ordered it custom from PSA with various high end equipment and parts. 

The Lower is installed with the upgraded and hand tuned trigger group (also stainless steel as shown in the pic). The LPK is their enhanced kit, meaning better quality pieces that are all guaranteed Mil-Spec.

The Upper is all Mil-Spec chrome lined internals made be FN (same company that provides barrels for the US Military M4 and M249 rifles). CHF, MPI, and HP tested chrome lined barrel with a 1:7 twist rate. 

The BCG is Nickel Boron (along with the bolt and internals). This makes cleaning much easier, wears better, and can run longer in dry/dusty/sandy conditions without lube. 

Has an upgrade Mil-Spec charging handle for better grip and use in adverse conditions and/or with gloves on.

I added (all 100% new):

-Vortex Strikefire Red/Green dot (awesome optic which I run on my other AR's as well). Is currently is setup in a 1/3 co-witness with the front sight post. 
-MagPul rear BUIS flip up sight (also 1.3 co-witnessed with optic and front sight post).
-MagPul B.A.D. level 
-Single point sling adapter, along with single point sling
-Magpul MOE forearm
-MagPul MVP foregrip

Priced to move at $1050. Although not pictured, also comes with a nice carrying case, 90 rounds of 5.56 Lake City brass ammo, and 3 30 round magazines. 

This is not your typical PSA entry level or ""freedom"" series rifle. This is loaded with top end equipment and parts, very much on par with the $800-$1000 Colts, Rock Rivers, etc. Plus it has many very classy and functional additions (sling, red dot, forgrip, etc.). Nothing more needs to be done to this AR, take it to the range and enjoy it.

Must be 18 with a valid OH ID. CCW, like myself, preferred. FTF only, no shipping. Thanks for looking."

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, V7-300 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

This setup & scope is awesome. huge scope = great visibility at dawn/dusk, so low-light shots are not a problem.

North American Arms Sidewinder with Conversion – .22 Mag / .22LR Mini-Revolver – NAA-SWC

You’re likely familiar with North American Arms, the makers of the near-legendary tiny stainless steel single-action .22 caliber revolvers. Thousands ride in cops’ pockets as back-up guns, in hunters’ coats as snake guns, some are used for concealed carry and some are even handy for plinking and targeting. In the past, it’s been necessary to actually take the cylinder out of the frame of the little revolvers to load or unload them. You remove the cylinder base pin, drop the cylinder into your hand, use the base pin to knock out empties, reload then basically “reassemble” your gun. That’s fine if you only need four or five shots!
Hot off the presses at North American Arms is their newest design, the Sidewinder. By simply pulling the ejector rod forward a tiny bit, the cylinder actually swings out, just like a “real” double-action revolver. While the Sidewinder is still single action, the new model also has a genuine ejector rod and ejector star, which will push the empties out all at once, at least far enough you can pluck ’em with a fingernail. It’s definitely easier to load/unload than the other designs.

From Manufacturer:

Whether you choose one chambered for .22 LR, .22 Magnum, or .17HMR, the Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design.

The Golden Boy rifle’s awesome 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, brass buttplate and gleaming Brasslite receiver will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America’s Old West, when our company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original Henry lever action rifle.

Small game hunters and plinkers will appreciate its substantial 6¾ pound heft. It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness lever-lovers long for. Get one in your hands and take aim. See what a natural pointer it really is.
Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. The .22 Mag holds 12+1 rounds and will provide a whole lot of shooting pleasure before it’s time to reload their tubular magazines.

The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters. The P-32 has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

The MTAC is designed to stand up to the hard use of tactical shooters. This scope features a superior light gathering glass. These high quality lenses with hilume multi-coatings provide a crisp, clear picture from dusk to dawn. Another major improvement in the MTAC is the independently moving power ring, separate from the ocular bell. This improvement lets the shooter adjust the power range without any visual interruption. Double-spring tension and an oversized ball-joint secure the hand-fitted internal zoom-assembly. The main tube is constructed of aircraft grade 6061t6 aluminum. Each scope is purged with laboratory-grade nitrogen to eliminate internal moisture and sealed with Burris-exclusive quad seals. The adjustment system is positive and repeatable with audible clicks ensuring unfailing shot-to-shot accuracy in all environments. Another key feature is the ballistic cq reticle which allows for rapid engagement of close quarters targets while also providing holdover points out to 600 yards when shooting a 62 grain 5.56x45mm load. The Burris MTAC rifle scope is covered by the Burris forever warranty. 

Note: The rotary illumination switch is located on the left side of the adjustment turret and features 10 brightness settings in which every setting is protected from any unwanted changes by a solid detent. When you need to eliminate illumination immediately, there is an off position located between each setting.

This is a fun gun to shoot, vey accurate and reliable. Looks cool too. Lot of gun for the money. Surprisingly quiet for a 45ACP. Every time on the range I get comments on its looks, no to little recoil for a 45 caliber, how quiet it is etc.
FFL transfer only. Buyer pays the fees.
Cash only, no trades. $385 firm.
I also have 45 ACP ammo if you are interested.
If you buy the gun, you can have 5 boxes  for additional $100.
Thank you for looking."

The 82G is a single-shot, 1-in-16 twist, Heavy Competition barrel (25"") bolt action firearm. It was built to the standard of being sub-MOA rifles. The butt stock is adjustable for Length of Pull and all spacers are included. stock is walnut and has some beautiful tiger-striping that doesn't really show in the pictures.

If you are looking to get into smallbore competitive shooting, this is simply the least expensive way to get in without dumping 1400 bucks into the lower-end anschutz rifles. 

This rifle is UNFIRED. It was bought as new (non-rusty) from the CMP when they still had these. The stock HAS NO CUT IN IT. This one was hand selected from the South Store in Anniston. The finish and stock are flawless. This rifle is unfired.It was brought it home, given  a complete disassembly, cleaned it thoroughly and put it back in the safe.

The bow is in very nice condition and has served me well the last few years. The reason for the sell is because I got a good deal on a new bow, I was not even planning on giving this bow up. I have a full draw kisser and a peep sight installed. The bow is 50-60 lbs and a 27-30"" draw length. Below is the details I could pull off Cabela's sight when they sold the bow. It had 5/5 stars with no complaints, all around a very solid bow. The bow and case are the only thing included, no arrows. $220 FIRM, No Negotiations and no trades

The combination of an exclusive alloy TEC riser and parallel split-limb technology makes the Reflex Growler one of the lightest bows in Reflex's lineup. At a mere 4.13 lbs. and 32"" in axle-to-axle length, this pint-sized powerhouse is easy to handle. But don't be fooled by its size: it is definitely not light on performance or execution. For pinpoint accuracy, the FX Cam & 1/2 System? works with an innovative control cable that forces the smooth-drawing cams to fire at precisely the same time, producing IBO speeds up to 303 fps. This innovative cam system even lets you easily adjust draw length in half-inch increments, without the need for a bow press. The ProLink Pocket System securely links the limbs to the riser with zero tolerance to eliminate side-to-side movement. StringShox? and RizerShox?, both made of LimbSaver's? sound- and vibration-dampening Navcom?, virtually eliminate string noise and hand shock. Wooden grips are custom-molded for added comfort.

674,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3918674,"For Sale:  NEW 1911 Andrews Leather holster w/ body shield, torque plate, steel hardtop","Florida Keys, Miami-Dade, South Florida",$ 60,"Listed On: Monday, February 23, 2015",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Good day, 

I am selling a solid black Inside Waist Band (IWB) MacDaniel II custom leather holster I just received from Andrews Leather. I bought two different colors, but really only need one, so I am selling this one. This is an absolutely beautiful holster. I bought it for $120, selling it for much less. It comes with two belt loop sizes. 

For the jokesters; gun in photos not included :)

Description: 
-The slim profile allows all-day carry with comfort.
-Belt loops are mounted on a locking swivel for more carry options.
- Roughout design provides a firmer carry than a slippery smooth finish. The smooth side is turned inward for ease of draw and reduced wear.
- High relief hand molding gives perfect weapon fit. A high site track clears tall front sight blades.
- A spring steel reinforcement plate is contained within the rear flange. This prevents 'foldover' of the flange. More importantly, it creates a stiffened paddle over which the belt lays when the holster is worn. This pulls the butt of the weapon up firmly against the side. - A full band of steel prevents the collapse of the holster top when the weapon is withdrawn. This allows a one-handed return without having to look at, or wrestle with, the holster.
- The mounting screw must be loosened before changing the loop angle. There is a toothed washer between loop and holster to prevent 'spin'.
- Body Shield Option - leather shield stands between the side and the top of the slide, but leaves the grip area clear for a full hand grasp.

the barrel had been on my 870 for a few years as a backup deer gun for use in wet/raining stalk hunting/scouting trips so I had applied a light coat of flat/black & od green camo on it, but I've since removed that with liquid deglosser (no sanding) so the matte finish on the barrel yet is not in perfect shape, but isn't rusted/pitted or sanded out smooth. a coat of liquid blue or repainting it as you like would be up to you."

I have the following available;

1 RCBS Competition Die Set-.308 Winchester. This set includes a seater die with a micrometer adjustable seating depth, a beveled internal collar for precise bullet alignment, and a front loading window for ease of access. It also includes a competition full length sizing die with an elevated expander ball on the stem. Also included is an RCBS tall based shell holder needed for use with the seating die. This die is in excellent condition, in the original factory storage case, with instructions. 

1 RCBS .308 Winchester Case Mic set. This kit includes a .308 caliber base coupling with a head space measuring nut, a land/free bore measuring nut, and an overall cartridge length/seating depth measuring tool. This set is also in excellent condition, in the original factory storage case, with instructions. 

1 RCBS .308 Winchester Full Length 2- die set. This set includes the RCBS standard full length seating and sizing dies. This kit is in good condition-a little dirty but barely used ( I used the sizing die to push the primers out of dirty cases.) This set is also in the original factory storage case with instructions.  

1 Lee .308 Winchester factory crimp die. If you're shooting a semi-auto, this die is pretty much a must. This die is in the factory original case-no instructions, but YouTube will teach you everything you need to know in minutes.

For all of the above, I am asking $120.00 cash. But wait-it gets better....

I also have a pretty good selection of .308 Winchester brass. I have not counted it, but I weighed it and it weighs in at 10.1 lbs in 4 gallon sized freezer bags. It is all Federal, Black Hills, Lapua and Lake City M118LR brass. there are a few Remington and Hornady stragglers, but only a few. Most of this brass is once fired, and all but a few have been de primed and tumbled in media...it's good brass.

I also have 1 Lee Pace Setter 3 die set for 7.62 x 39 Russian, brand new in the box with the instructions and all of the little gadgets that come with it. I know, I know-it has nothing to do with .308. My wife got this idea a few years ago that she would glue rhinestones onto dummy AK bullets and put them on neck chains and sell them. I made the first 10 dummies...she's still got them all...go figure. Thus, this die set is like new.

So if you want the whole shebang-all the dies, the case mics, the brass-the whole enchilada-$160 bucks takes the gig. Don't need a 7.62 x 39 Russian die set? Dude-it's 40 more bucks for 10 pounds of high end brass...use the AK dies for shot glasses or something."

The bow is 60lb draw weight (adjustable down to about 50lbs) and 28.5 inch draw length. The strings and cables have always been very well waxed and are in great condition. Its a 2010 bow, and sold for $1000 then for just the bow. This is a very high quality bow that shoots great, has a smooth draw, is quiet, fast, ect. It is hands down one of the top bows on the market in my opinion. I am only selling because I can get a steal of a deal on a new Mathews NoCam bow (which by the way is the only bow I think shoots better than this one).

$800 for all. Cash only. I would also be willing to switch out the Whisker Biscuit rest for a RipCord CodeRed drop away rest for an additional $50. If there are other items in the package you do not desire(like if you just want the bare bow, or if you don't want the stabilizer, ect), or if you have archery related items (rests, sights, stabilizers, ect) that you would want to trade, feel free to make me an offer. I am open to suggestions. This is a great opportunity to get into a top of the line bow without breaking the bank. Thank you for looking!! 

Note: I would be willing to travel to other areas of the state to make the swap."
