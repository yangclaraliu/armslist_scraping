Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches  along with a forward-mounted steel bipod.

Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or Chinese-made AKM, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62x39mm ammunition.

It will come with:
. flash hider

This compact, multiple-output Helmet Light features three yellow-green LEDs, two infrared LEDs, and one blinking infrared LED that serves as a personal Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) beacon. The yellow-green primary LEDs are perfect for general-purpose, close-work illumination; the infrared secondary LEDs are for use with night vision devices (NVDs) and provide an invisible light signature when viewed by the naked eye. 

Helmet Light features a durable, watertight polymer body in Desert Tan. Attaches to any Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) via an included ambidextrous mount with 20 preset positions that allow the light to be rotated 360 degrees when attached. Once either mount has been attached to the helmet, Helmet Light can be quickly and easily slid on and locked securely in place. Pressing a lever on the mount unlocks the light, allowing for quick removal for servicing or transfer onto its optional Z71 carry clip, which attaches to any MOLLE or ALICE vest.

I also have a brand new RCBS hand priming tool. The turret press is a 6 hole...not the T7. I purchased this set-up quite a few years back intending on getting into reloading and just never did. It is all completely brand new in the original boxes except the powder trickler which I let a buddy use for a bit. Otherwise it is as new and never been unpacked. The press is the predecessor to the T7 which Redding currently sells. I wish to sell this as a complete package so please don't ask to separate. I believe all of this would run you around $600 plus tax if you were to purchase online. I'm looking for $450 cash but always willing to listen to trades. Mostly interested in Silver Eagles, Gold, and firearms but would consider other items as well. This is a very heavy package so I wish to sell locally and not ship.

Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers â only in a smaller, more concealable design.The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact âLEMâ (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 â 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 â 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 â 15 pounds (53.4 â 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation â one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.

The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooterâs hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.

A set of abbreviated âindustry standardâ mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines.

Selling a BNIB Mossberg 715t .22LR NEVER FIRED with its original 25 round magazine, as well as 6 additional 25 round magazines that I had purchased with it at a cost of $29.00 each (see receipt picture).  The reason it was never fired (and why I am selling) is that I bought another .22LR rifle later the same week, and have no reason for having two.

I see that the current market price is between $250-$300 for this semi-auto .22LR AR, however you will get one magazine, no soft carrying case (new) with pouches for your additional mags, and have that killer AZ tax added onto the price.

THIS IS A PRIVATE SALE. NO TAXES (as I have already paid them when I purchased the firearm).  At the price I am listing, believe me it will be your gain, my loss.  I just do not need it and need to make room for some of my bigger toys. $400.00 FIRM
Thanks.

ADDED UPDATED INFO:

EDIT:  PLEASE do your RESEARCH & CRITICAL THINKING FIRST prior to contacting me.  NO I will NOT sell the mags separately, it is all or none.  PLEASE take into account the ENTIRE PACKAGE BEFORE contacting me with either a trade offer or buy.  YES this model runs in the $250 to $300 price range, HENCE the reason I included the EXTRA MAGS RECEIPT that indicates the $29.99 X 6 BRAND NEW MAGAZINES.....ALONG WITH A NEW SOFT CASE with mag pouches and other additional storage pockets.

So say $280.00 - Mossberg 715t
         $190.00 - X6 additional magazines
          $35.00 - NEW Black Soft Case

You do the math, it equals $505.00 (NOT including the high tax rate, something I already paid. Add $32.00 in taxes at a 6.5% tax rate AS THIS PACKAGE IS NEW, ALL OF IT....you would then be looking at $537 and some change) all I am wanting $400 OUT THE DOOR in order to free up room for my higher end firearms. So SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY...PLEASE.  I will bump maybe one or two more times, after that screw it I will try my hand at painting it, shooting the crap out of it, and give it to one of my team members kids. 

Please no more time wasting ""tire kickers"", I am a 43 year old U.S. Navy Chief that RETIRED at 38 with 20+ years of active duty 1 week after my 38th b-day, 9 of those 20+ years I was attached to JSOC (SMU).  MATURE INQUIRES ONLY.....PLEASE! I spend time volunteering to assist U.S. Border Patrol conducting C4ISR supporting operations along the Southern border in my off time.  So I DO NOT HAVE THE TIME for the madness that I have I have received from ""interested parties"", LITERALLY.  I AM NOT DESPERATE TO SELL, I COULD CARE LESS REALLY...so it makes it that much more painful to deal with corresponding with some of my less informed brothers and sisters in arms.

To that one guy who was all set with a trade and told me the deal was a go and where he worked at IN TUCSON (I am in the Fort Huachuca region) and was ready for me to make the 180 MILE ROUND TRIP, and you know who you are....ONLY TO LATER SEND AN EMAIL WHILE I WAS OUT GASSING UP TO MAKE THE TRIP TO SAY ""Wait a minute...I looked online and that rifle costs only $280,00"", YOU ARE LUCKY I CHECKED MY EMAIL (after we had already exchanged MULTIPLE EMAILS & TEXTS indicating we were mission go IRT the deal) AND DID NOT MAKE THAT TRIP BUDDY.  You would have met one VERY PISSED OFF former special operations veteran.

EVERYONE UNDERSTAND...THIS DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO ME, BUT TO EVERY SELLER ON ARMSLIST WHETHER THEY ARE FFL, OR JUST SOMEONE THINNING OUT THEIR COLLECTION.  IF YOU ARE A NEW GUN BUYER, OR NOVICE...I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR MOST OF US WHEN I SAY....PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST BEFORE CONTACTING!  Thank you."

This was my wife's carry gun. she has chosen to go to a lady smith and wants to sell.. less than 200 rounds rounds thru it..

If you do the math on it. She paid 500.00 for the gun 65.00 for the trigger job, 85.00 for the night sights and 30.00 for the slide stop that comes to 726.00 with tax for this gun... so at $460.00 I would say that's a pretty damn good deal."

I am helping with the sale as far as the transfer goes only.  Pulled the add last night as I thought it was sold. Owner has told me there is a possible deal in the works, but nothing set in stone from either side. I will pull the add once I know for sure there is a solid deal in place."

I'm mostly looking to trade it for a .308 or .223 bolt gun (like a Remington 700 STS Tactical) or sell it for enough to buy a .308 bolt gun. Also, I can do a trade plus cash from me if you have a Rem 700 w a scope.  

The upper:
The upper on this M4 is all-Colt. It has a Colt flat top upper w feed ramps and the rare and sought after Diemaco ""D"" (Canadian Colt) forge mark. The barrel is the same barrel our troops are issued; a Colt NATO Govt. profile 14.5"" w 1/7 twist rate. I had a BCM A2x (extended A2) flash hider professionally installed to bring it to a legal 16"" to make it legal.  It has a Knights Armament RAS rail and a Knights Armament handstop with QD swivel. I'm also throwing in a Knights Armament vertical grip. I have less than 500rds on this barrel. The bore is super perfect.  

The scope on this is a Nikon P223 (designed specifically for AR-15s) with super sexy turrets and the scope rings are Weaver Tactical high-rise scope rings. This thing sits at a perfect height and gives a crisp field of view perfect for close range use and for slightly longer defensive ranges too.   

Oh and there's a mMidWest Industries sling mount clamped around the buffer tube. That's yours too. 


The lower:
The lower is an Anderson stripped lower with a Daniel Defense lower parts kit (professionally installed) and a Daniel Defense buffer tube, Daniel Defense buffer and an LMT SOPMOD stock. Yes, I know, ""Anderson"", but I have a Colt lower too that I can swap (and paint to match) but it'll raise the price by another $600.00 and this Anderson stripped lower is every bit as well-built as any Colt lower I've ever had and the Daniel Defense parts kit inside it works great; nice trigger and everything operates smooth. 

There is currently an A2 grip on it but I can put a Tango Down grip on it if you'd prefer that (it is painted to match) and I'll include the USGI mag that is painted to match as well.  If you don't want the scope (you'd be a crazy person because this scope is actually fantastic) I'll swap it out for a Colt carry handle instead.   

Anyway, this M4 is as close to an authentic M4 as you're going to find and the fact that I built the lower on an Anderson (during the ""big scare"" when no other lowers were available) means that it's way more affordable than it otherwise would be."

The G30 Subcompact Pistol is a popular choice of plainclothes policemen and protection personnel. The G30 combines GLOCK's highly accurate firing characteristics and the big bore power of the .45 ACP in a size previously occupied only by snub nose revolvers. Like larger GLOCKs, the G30 pairs a corrosion-resistant, ergonomic, stronger-than-steel polymer frame with a durable cold-hammered steel slide and barrel coated with GLOCK's high tech Tenifer 64 HRC surface treatment.  The Safe Action trigger system teams a trigger safety, trigger bar, and firing pin lock that automatically deactivate one after another as the trigger engages.  GLOCK barrels feature rounded interior profiles for easier cleaning and longer lasting precision. Loaded chamber indicator. Double action. Fixed sights."

It has only taken her 6 months, but I am finally caving.  In order to reduce any cognitive dissonance on my end, I have convinced myself that I really need to do it in order to make room for my remaining collection. I might be selling a few other firearms in addition to the couple that I have posted thus far, it is just easier said than done...as I am sure many other enthusiasts can understand the situation. Anyhoo, here are the gun stats:

K=Stainless Steel
P95=9mm Model
PR=Picatinny Rail 
DC=De-cocker Option

Comes with 3 factory original 15 round magazines in 9mm, along with loader and everything you see pictured with the case (minus the bullets as it served more as a ""bedroom nightstand"" firearm than in the safe, however always remained in the case).  Being that my 1st handgun I had ever owned was a Ruger P89 9mm, I had been already familiar with this platform therefore the low round count as a visual inspection will reveal as much).  There is not so much as a single blemish on this gun, it is as new as the day it was originally purchased. Buyer will NOT be disappointed.

Some quick facts regarding this particular firearm:

The P95PR was introduced in 2005, it incorporates a Picatinny rail into the frame and adds a new non-slip texturing in the polymer frame. This model replaced the original P95 in production.

In December 2004, Ruger was awarded a contract for 5,000 KP95D pistols by the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois.[6]

The P95 was slowly phased out in recent years in favor of the newer SR series. Eventually, the P95 was quietly discontinued in October 2013 and removed from Ruger's website catalog.

The P-Series is NO LONGER in production as it has been replaced by the SR-Series.  Here is a chance to own a very like new example that has been referenced to as one of the most dependable & reliable pistols made as they will shoot anything you feed it whether steel or brass. Thank you."

It's been fired maybe 200 times, cleaned, lubed, and stashed in the safe. The ACOG is a TA11j-g which is the 3.5x35 dual illuminated green crosshair reticle. It has much more generous eye relief than the 4x32, while it is a few inches longer and a few ounces heavier than the 4x32, I've found many reviews and comparisons where the 3.5x35 was said the be the preferred acog by the reviewer. They had both the 3.5x35 and 4x32 acog at a gander mountain, they let me put both optics on my Tavor to compare and the salesman, my wife, and myself preferred the 3.5x35. I of course have the case and everything the ACOG came with, and everything the Tavor came with including the box. Depending on the trade, we'll adjust to what's required, but either way, you'll need a permit to purchase/carry and we'll fill out some kind of Bill of sale or something saying the Tavor is now your property.

Its a winchester model 69a bolt action rifle. Shoots .22lr , .22 long , and .22 short. Comes with 1, 5 round mag. The mags are pretty available on ebay , u can find 10 rd ers as well. 

The bluing is basically 100%, as is the condition of the stock. (Has original buttplate as well) Could of even be re blued way back when. I cant believe how minty it all is. Shoots perfect and is beyond accurate. No pitting or rust . Few minor scratches on stock. You would have no idea this gun was from the 30s!.   This is a real find. 

What makes this rifle extra special is that it was made in a short run of these that werent made with a serial number on them (somtime in the 1930's). This increases its desirability to collectors and value by quite a bit. No dros or ffl transfer is necessary for this gem. Cash and carry ( this is just about the only scenario you can still do this) 
This Rifle isnt just a safe queen or a wall hanger ,, if youre looking for a perfect shooting .22 bolt this will fit the bill and definitely last many generations to come! 

 was quoted by a collector this thing could easily go for 5-600$ for this run of the model 69a and its condition. So send me fair trades with pics!

pretty much only interested in trades.. but make an offer!"

The Olympic Arms lower is a standard AR-15 lower receiver that has a Rodgers magazine well funnel fore grip with finger grooves, the longest buffer tube on the AR market (9 1/8 inches long) with a rubber cap on the end, Hogue rubber pistol grip, ambidextrous single point sling attachment end plate, and utilizes the 10 round modified UZI (with an adapter block welded on the back of it) magazine which comes with a total of 4 magazines (and locks open to the rear after the last round is fired). This lower can be used with any other AR platform and the buffer tube is set up for the future installation of a SIG TAC Brace (if the new owner wants it that way). With the long buffer tube installed, it makes it easier to have a good place for a cheek placement when sighting in and firing at the range without your face too close to the sights.

 If you have inquiries or questions, all that I ask is that you would respect the sellerâs wishes when the questions/inquiries are answered. What I am asking is--please don't low ball my selling price for any outrageous offer. The price is $1,100 or best offer--and I'm NOT asking for any trades please. For NC residents, you will need a photo copy of your NC driverâs license, your NC CCW permit, and sign a bill of sale along with a photo copy of my NC driverâs license and NC CCW permit. All NC laws and ATF laws apply in this transaction. If youâre looking for an FFL transfer and shipping, then the extra costs will apply to the buyer. This AR pistol was my second build to own and loved it ever since. My son and I (both of us former military) have taken this firearm to the indoor range, along with my other AR pistols, and shot this with great performance. This is not the first time that I've sold other firearms of mine.

Both guns are in great condition and only have a few rounds through them.  Both guns have tritium night sights which are fantastic and last forever (I prefer over lasers).  Often referred to as a mini 1911, it is one of the nicest handguns I've ever shot. Great trigger and balance helps you to hit your target every time. Very light and great for conceal carry. Shoot a Ruger LCP or Kel-Tec P-3AT to see why this gun is worth every penny.

Well I guess the question is do you feel lucky today? I have here a piece of iconic S&W steel. This is a Smith and Wesson model 29-3. Albeit not the exact model 29 (no dash) that Clint Eastwood used in Dirty Harry but still the same gun!

Mine is, as mentioned, a 29-3 late 80's model revolver. It is a 6"" barrel and has the original grips as well as a set of Pachmayr rubber grips, one speed loader, and the original Smith and Wesson box. The information sticker on the side of the box is original and does match the serial number on the gun.

Its heavy-duty stamped receiver boasts a thickness of 1.6 mm and includes a parkerized finish to offer enhanced protection against rust and corrosion as well as increased resistance to wear caused by moving parts. Everything you could possibly ask for in a standard AK-47 is here, only improved. Laminated wood furniture is tossed aside in favor of beautiful stained maple.

Put an XD Mod.2 in your hand, and youâll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. 

Enter the GripZone: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZoneâ¢, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. 

The GripZone doesnât stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand grip relief and High-Hand beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistolâs felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. 

If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, youâll want to pick up the new XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact.

The G42 is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42."

If you know anything about this gun then you will know it is one of the top combat side arms with its sexy trigger reset (fast) and very very fast mag release. I purchased this gun brand new and I can tell you anything and everything about it. Purchased new for $700 paid close to $50 each mag. This is a fine German made fun that will not let you down ever! Go to YouTube and there is a video that shows you that it will fire frozen in a block of ice, full of and underwater, ect. The Germans and Austrian's do it best with pistols. The Italians did good as well but German all the way! Tom REDACTED"
