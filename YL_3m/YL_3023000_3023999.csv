 yeap, I totally agree, prices for used and new guns posted in Denver-Armslist are WAY overpriced.  If you are a seller, don't you think the buyer can look up the same gun from other vendors, other states, other on-line stores, other discount gun stores, pawn shops, etc?  It is true, you pay nothing for the add so you figure, ""oh shoot, I'll just overprice it and see who takes the bait' or ""I paid this much so is worth that much"".  Well, no replies to your add, NO PHONE CALLS OR what you call ""low baller"" is what you get when you overprice your stuff.
Wanna sell? price accordingly, just because is a free add does not mean you can ask whatever you want and it will be ok. it's not. makes you look greedy and out of touch with what the market can bear as the OP said.

As for the FFL'ers charging more than $10 for person to person transfers (some greedy bastards want 30-40-50 bucks), they are CROOKS and are taking advantage of YOU.  See NRA synopsis for CO gun laws. It states specifically transfer fee is $10  !

http://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/state-laws/colorado.aspx

Buyers of shooting guns (not collectors), educate yourselves.  Sellers, be reasonable on your asking price, specially if it is used stuff.  One round fired from that gun after the test shot, it is in used condition and depreciated some 25% already! just like your car, your fridge, stereo, etc."

From the manufacturer:

The MEC Steelmaster is the only shotshell reloader that comes specifically equipped to load steel shotshells. And the bonus? It works equally well for lead shotshells.

The Steelmaster’s resize station handles brass or steel heads in either high or low base. The E-Z Prime auto primer feed, which dispenses primers automatically, is standard equipment.


MEC® Steelmaster Reloader

Specifically designed to reload steel
Wide-mouth shot bottle and drop tube
Includes steel-shot-specific charge bar
All MEC reloaders incorporate features that allow you to produce shotshells that will outperform factory loads at a fraction of the price! These top-quality features include: flip-top measure to permit powder and shot containers to be inserted or removed without spillage. Adjustable rammer tube for applying proper wad-column pressure. Cam-operated crimp for precise crimping and closing pressure. Automatic primer feed. Spindex2 crimp starter for automatic rotation and realignment on the original factory crimp. 

The Steelmaster is specially designed and completely equipped to reload steel shotshells. The single-stage Steelmaster features a wide-mouth shot bottle and large diameter metal drop tube for clean, clog-free shot flow. Also, a steel Shot Charge Bar with a rubber insert in the shot cavity that “swallows” shot to prevent jamming and eliminate damage to the shot and charge bar. Power Ring collet resizer completely resizes both high and low brass back to factory specs. Adjustable rammer tube applies proper pressure on the wad column. Exclusive three-stage cam-operated crimp provides precise closing pressure and crimping. Made in USA.

You can also change calibers and sizes by swapping the trigger control group. 

It ran flawlessly for the 100 rounds I put through it with zero failures of any kind. It was also very accurate and easy to shoot. I am a huge fan of this pistol but I need to sell it to fund another purchase. 

It comes with everything it originally came with, including a Sig Sauer holster, one 15 round magazine, lock, and plastic case.

I prefer a 1-4 or 1-6 with an illuminated reticle, but I would consider a slightly higher power as long as it starts in the lower range.  A Leupold Mark 6 1-6x would fit the bill nicely.  A Nightforce 2.5-10 might also scratch my itch.  If you have a scope that might work for me, I have a pile of cash with your name on it.  I have a Remington 870 tactical that I would trade off.  I also have Leupold Mark 4 CQ/T 1-3 to trade if that interests you.  It will come with the original box and ARMS QD mount.  It's a fantastic optic but I just want a little more power for my AR10.  I might trade the Daniel Defense DDM4V5 that it's sitting on if you want that. I'm flexible.  I might even trade the Mark 4 for a Glock 26, 30, etc., but the scope is at the top of my list.  Oh, and I might also be interested in some type of Aimpoint for a different rifle.  Texting is easiest for me and will get you a faster response- REDACTED"

Only thing lacking to make the gun fully firing capable is the internal bolt parts and the bolt stop. I found the parts and instructions at a website called hoosiergunworks.com. Those guys are extremely nice and helpful. After it was cleaned up it actually doesn't look too bad but I just don't have the time. This should make someone a fun project especially for a beginner interested is Mil-Surp rifles. All numbers match, even the bolt body so there will be no headspace testing required.

This was my father's and was stored in his home in Dallas until recently. I know very little about its history. I have not fired this pistol. I simply looked it over, did a simple function check, took pictures and posted the ad here There are two chips missing from the left side wood grip, everything else appears to be in excellent condition. To the best of my knowledge the round heavy barrel has been discontinued by Browning, is has been replaced with a Slab-side style.

Grips of all sorts, all other sorts of target and tactical accessories and different barrel options are available for this pistol online. It is a very versatile .22lr platform.

Despite its small size, the P224® maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 12+1 rounds of 9mm
and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.
Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, the P224 will be available in a number of configurations. Initial models
will be available with the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and
.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.
Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in
most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."

If you really talk with the sporting goods stores and stores like Walmart, BiMart and Fred Meyers that sell it they tell me they don't get that much in anyways. Everything in America we buy was bought by someone before us. It is all part of the wholesale/retail and supply/demand game we all live by.
