This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a lightweight package with an overall length of just 45 inches. The Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power while allowing the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds, reload with a fresh magazine and get back on target in seconds.

Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. The steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. All Barrett rifles are designed for easy field stripping, so the two receivers can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools.
The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation designed for speed, reliability and safety. It slides effortlessly on machined-smooth rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. This bolt carrier assembly is a simplistic design with a quick release lever for fast disassembly. The firing pin is driven by dual springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time."

This rifle features a weather resistant composite stock with matching fore end and an ergonomic pistol grip. It also features a hammer forged barrel and specialized safety lever. Unlike the first batch of PAP rifles, the N-PAP has a built-in side rail mount for true hold accuracy when mounting a scope and comes with the proper double stack bolt to ensure consistent feeding. Legally accepts all high cap mags and drums regardless of country of origin and comes complete with a 30 round Tapco magazine and cleaning rod. Rifle features an exclusive safety lever design that also acts as a bolt lock / hold open for ultimate safety and lightning fast chambering. Receivers are stamped but slightly heavier than the typical AK stamped receiver. The Yugo AK's are regarded as some of the finest quality AK rifles in the world, they are extremely well made with very tight tolerances - These rifles will feed, function and fire flawlessly for thousands of rounds. The finish of this rifle is flawless except for a few handling marks and comes with one 30 round magazine."

History: My son and I are restoring a classic wooden boat. I found and drove 10 hours round trip to Ohio to purchase the motor. The old gentleman had only used this motor 4-5 times on lake Erie then stashed it covered in his garage. This motor is virtually in Mint Condition with only a couple of scuffs on the cover. Note in the photo's the flywheel is barely marked from starting and the motor is CLEAN. Like and Idiot, ""After"" bringing it home I find that the long shaft will not work on our boat thus the sale. I do not have room to store it all winter thus the LOW Break Even Price. If I do have to store it, come Spring it is going to be a lot more money. For additional photos, please send your direct email address. Thanks for Looking. All ""Reasonable"" Offers Considered. 

I've received a Lot of email about changing the lower unit out to a short shaft. ""Thank You for the Suggestion"" but I have explored that. Other than messing with a showroom condition motor, we went with a motor that is the correct year for our boat."

Its lightly used and in pretty good shape. Very accurate with minimal recoil, +P rated. This is the relatively rare six shot M856, not the M85; it is one of the very few 6 shot J frame sized .38 snubs out there. Easily pocket carriable which is a plus in the summer heat.

I'm interested in trading for a compact .40 handgun such as an M&P Shield .40 or Ruger SR40c, or similar. Really only interested in .40, but might also consider a Taurus PT92. Depending on what you have to trade or what comes with it I have a little bit of .38 ammo I could include, or maybe some cash.

We conduct abortion on demand
up to the twelfth week (three months) of pregnancy. Abortion is a
process of ending a pregnancy. If pregnancy is confirmed and is below
twelve weeks, then abortion pills are best to expel the contents of the
uterus Abortion pill is widely known as RU-486. RU stands for
Roussel-Uclaf (the initials of the pharmaceutical company) and 486 is a
lab serial number. Using abortion pill is a type of abortion that can be
performed using a combination or a single pill of two medications,
mifepristone and misoprostol. These two pills can terminate pregnancy in
about four hours. It is safe and effective when used within twelve
weeks of pregnancy. These medicines are either taken orally or
vaginally. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone levels that are
needed to maintain a successful pregnancy. Due to the blockage of this
hormone, the uterine lining begins to shed, the cervix get soften and
bleeding (an indication of abortion) may occur. This is when the
termination of pregnancy is taking place and it is within three to four
hours of taking the pills and you are done. The bleeding may be light
much like spotting towards the end of a menstrual period or heavy

Also have a Viridian laser\light for M4 carbines. Super bright 180 lumen led and a green laser.

It is stainless for the price of a parkerized finish and feels incredible. With the stainless finish it would be a great full size CCW. I will include 100 rounds of ammo with the purchase.

This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a lightweight package with an overall length of just 45 inches. The Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power while allowing the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds, reload with a fresh magazine and get back on target in seconds.

Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. The steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. All Barrett rifles are designed for easy field stripping, so the two receivers can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools.

The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation designed for speed, reliability and safety. It slides effortlessly on machined-smooth rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. This bolt carrier assembly is a simplistic design with a quick release lever for fast disassembly. The firing pin is driven by dual springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time."

HERE IS AN ARTICLE ABOUT THESE GUNS I FOUND ON THE INTERNET!
J.C. Higgins Model 88

High Standard introduced their Sentinel revolver line in 1955, probably at the request of Sears Roebuck, which was a major customer and owned quite a bit of High Standard stock.  Sears wanted a low-cost kit gun or “tackle box” revolver to sell under their J.C. Higgins brand.  It was sold by Sears as the J.C. Higgins Model 88.  The J.C. Higgins guns were given distinctive grips, cylinder flutes, and cylinder release pins.  Private label versions of the Sentinel were also made for Western Auto and Armamex (Colonel Rex Applegate’s company in Mexico).
The Sentinel was a 9-shot .22 revolver.  It was advertised to have an anodized aluminum frame, high-tensile carbon steel barrel and cylinder, single-stroke multiple ejection, a swing-out counterbored cylinder, a movable square-notched rear sight, a non- slip scored trigger, a diamond-checkered grip (though they didn’t mention it was plastic), and target accuracy.

The innovative design was completed by Harry Sefried, High Standard’s young design engineer, in a mere six months.  Sefried wasn’t afraid to incorporate good ideas wherever he found them.  The squared-off grip on the first model was modified from the Colt New Model .36 Pocket Pistol of 1862, and one shooter was said to remark that it was “the first decent grip on a revolver since the Civil War.”  It remains to this day one of the most comfortable revolver grips I have ever encountered.  The simplified cylinder lock design was taken from Hugo Borchardt’s experimental revolver of 1876, which he designed while working for Winchester and which was observed by Sefried during his own five years at Winchester.  The gun, like the Broomhandle Mauser, is screwless but for the grip screw.



These two are R-101 Sentinel revolvers made in 1958.


The top revolver is an R-106 Sentinel Deluxe from 1974, and beneath it is an R-103 Sentinel from 1965.

There is an integral thumb rest molded into the frame behind the cylinder housing on each side, making the gun feel quite natural in the hand.  The grip section and frame are die cast from aluminum.  There is no cylinder thumb release to interrupt the smooth frame or complicate manufacture and assembly.  The gun can be broken down into four main component groups: (1) the cylinder and crane, (2) the trigger-guard/grip, (3) the barrel and frame assembly, and (4) the hammer, trigger, and other lockwork components.  Everything is held together by the hammer pin, which runs through both the trigger-guard/grip and the main frame.  Coil springs are used throughout.

Sefried designed a unique ratchet mechanism that utilizes nine holes drilled into the rear of the extractor, worked by a traditional pawl that extends from the frame.  The holes give the pawl a positive interface, providing flawless cylinder rotation and reducing the machining necessary on the frame and cylinder.  The design also reduces wear to the ratchet mechanism that eventually causes problems with more traditional designs.  The nine-hole ratchet mechanism was abandoned in later-production Sentinels.
The Sentinel has an extended forcing cone that nearly eliminates lead shaving as the bullet enters the barrel.  I hate it when a revolver spits hot lead out the side when I’m standing next to the shooter--it could be a fatal distraction in a fire fight.

The Sentinel was originally available in a so-called blued finish (which was actually a selenium black).  The nickel finish was available in April of 1956.  The early nickeled guns cost $5 or $6 more than the blued guns.  The MSRP for the blued gun in 1955 was $37.50.  The Sentinel had a one-piece wrap-around plastic grip.  Originally the blue guns had a brown grip and the nickel guns had a white grip, but that scheme was not retained throughout production.

A 1955 catalog says the gun was available with a 3 or a 5 inch barrel.  A parts list circa 1957 or 1958 shows 3 inch, 4 inch, and 2-3/8 inch barrels were available.  By 1956, a 6 inch barrel was also available.  The 3 inch barrel was dropped in 1964.

In 1957 a snub-nose model of the Sentinel was introduced, with a rounded butt on the grip.  The early guns had a bobbed hammer, through about 1960, after which they featured a spur hammer.  Color finishes in gold, turquoise, and pink, known as Dura-Tone colors, were offered for the snub-barrel Sentinels.  The Dura-Tone guns came in a deluxe presentation case and had white smooth grips.
In 1958 a line of western-style revolvers was spun off the Sentinel line, the first model of which was called the Double-Nine.  It was sold by Sears as the J.C. Higgins Ranger Model 90.

Sentinel Series Numbers

R-100.  The first Sentinel series was called the R-100.
R-101.  In mid-1956, the hammer and trigger mechanisms were slightly modified for the R-101 series.
R-102.  In 1961, for the R-102 series, a return spring was added to the ejector rod.  On the earlier models, if you didn’t remember to manually retract the ejector into the cylinder before closing you would put a nasty scratch on the left side of the frame.
R-103.  The R-103 series had slots milled into the ejector instead of drilled holes.
R-104.  In 1961 the R-104 Sentinel Imperial was issued with a full-sized grip frame, two-piece checkered walnut grips, a ramp front sight, and a target-style trigger.  (The regular Sentinel was still available with one-piece plastic grips and blade front sight, and it retained the old R-103 designation.)
R-105.  These guns were originally made for Sears, but were returned to High Standard when Sears dropped their handgun line in 1963, and were rebranded as High Standard guns (the barrels and grips were replaced).  They retain the distinctive cylinder flutes, cylinder pin, trigger guard, and one- piece grip design of the J.C. Higgins guns.  As best I can tell, this is one of the least common Sentinels.
R-106.  In April 1965 the Sentinel Deluxe appeared, with the R-106 series number.  The ramp front sight was replaced with a blade, but the gun retained the checkered walnut grips of the Imperial.  The old Imperial continued in production.
R-107.  This was also a Sentinel Deluxe.  I have been unable to determine the difference between the R-106 and R-107.  Externally they appear to be identical, but the part numbers for the frame, grip, trigger, and hammer were all changed..
R-108.  In 1967 the Snub-nose Sentinel was given a two-piece grip and the R-108 series designation.
R-109.  The Kit Gun was introduced and given the R-109 series designation.  This was the first model with a fully adjustable rear sight.
MK I and MK IV.  In 1974 the series numbers were eliminated and the Sentinel MK I and MK IV were introduced.  These guns had optional adjustable rear sights, wrap-around walnut grips, and the first steel frames to appear in the Sentinel line.  The MK I was chambered for the .22 long rifle, and the MK IV was chambered for the .22 Winchester magnum.  The MK I and MK IV were available with 2 inch, 3 inch, or 4 inch barrels.  The Camp Gun was introduced in this same period. It was similar to the MK I and MK IV, but did not have the barrel underlug which shrouded the ejector rod. The Camp Gun came with a standard 6 inch barrel and adjustable sights, and was available in either .22 long rifle or .22 magnum.
Steel Sentinel.  At some point the Mark I and Mark IV designations were dropped and the steel frame gun was sold as the “Sentinel” with interchangeable .22 LR and .22 magnum cylinders.
MK II and MK III.  These were rebranded Dan Wesson .357 Magnum revolvers.  They were sold from mid- 1973 through February of 1975.  There are persistent rumors that High Standard made the Dan Wesson pistols, but they are completely untrue.

The P226 features an ergonomic beavertail grip and is a DAO gun. The trigger is tight and clean and performs very nicely. The P226 offered is in 9mm and built like a tank, this is not a sissy gun, it is all metal and feels like it. The pistol functions 100% perfectly and is in good shape all around with very little visible wear. It has always been cleaned and stored properly and would make a fine addition to anyone's collection. It includes a red Sig case and 2 mags. Enjoy and hopefully this gun meets your needs.

This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a lightweight package with an overall length of just 45 inches. The Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power while allowing the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds, reload with a fresh magazine and get back on target in seconds.

Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. The steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. All Barrett rifles are designed for easy field stripping, so the two receivers can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools.

The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation designed for speed, reliability and safety. It slides effortlessly on machined-smooth rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. This bolt carrier assembly is a simplistic design with a quick release lever for fast disassembly. The firing pin is driven by dual springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time."

This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a lightweight package with an overall length of just 45 inches. The Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power while allowing the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds, reload with a fresh magazine and get back on target in seconds.

Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. The steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. All Barrett rifles are designed for easy field stripping, so the two receivers can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools.

The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation designed for speed, reliability and safety. It slides effortlessly on machined-smooth rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. This bolt carrier assembly is a simplistic design with a quick release lever for fast disassembly. The firing pin is driven by dual springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time."

However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies across the US, while its versatility and accessorize options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.

key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel
lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in
line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability""
while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both
recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target
faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of
ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing
any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the
typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

LMT Defender Standard Model 16 with SOPMOD Stock 5.56

This may be LMTs ""Standard Rifle"" but its built with unseen features that put it in a class by itself. If you want a serious, well built carbine, this is it. LMT uses top quality mil-spec parts AND testing procedures in their builds, not like some companies that claim mil-spec and its only mil-spec coatings or dimensions. This rifle has everything you need and nothing you don't, you can add custom options, but its not because you have to. You can run these rifles hard without worry.

This is one carbine we suggest for LE officers that buy their own rifles and have to have a rifle their lives and the lives of others depend on.

Specifications:

The Defender Standard Model 16 features a standard flattop upper receiver with 16"" chrome lined 1:7"" twist 5.56 barrel, standard semi-auto bolt carrier group, tactical charging handle assembly, Defender lower with SOPMOD buttstock and standard trigger group. Ships with a sling, operators manual, tactical adjustable rear sight, (1) heavy duty push button swivel (included as of 2011 orders) and (1) thirty round magazine.  Direct gas impingement, Overall length with SOPMOD collapsed: 33.25"" Overall length with SOPMOD extended: 36.25"" A2 Birdcage Compensator 1/2 X 28 thread pitch Cryogenically treated barrel to increase accuracy, barrel life and easier cleaning Electronically tested and recorded trigger pull"

Russian PSO-1 sniper scope Прицел снайперский оптический ПСО-1 (Chinese Version)
PSO-1 Specifications
Magnification power 	4x
Field of view 	6°
Exit pupil diameter 	0.23 inches
Eye relief 	2.68 inches
Resolution limit 	12°/second
Length with eye cover 	14.75 inches
Weight 	1.28 lbs

The PSO-1 (прицел снайперский оптический = sight sniper optical) was developed in 1963 specifically for the SVD sniper rifle. It has 4 power magnification with a 24mm objective lens diameter and 32mm occular lens diameter. This means what you see at 25 yards with the naked eye will appear the same size at 100 yards through this scope. The exit pupil measurement is 6mm (24\4=6). To clearly see a target in normal sunlight the human eye only needs 4mm of light transfer through a scope, so this scope's 6mm exit pupil will be sufficiently bright for good weather daylight operations.

The main advantage of this scope design is it allows the sniper to aim at a target and calculate the distance to the target at the same time. It also allows for horizontal and verticle hold over using the reticle markings, all while never taking time to turn the adjustment knobs. This allows very quick and precise shooting, especially at target that are moving. The reticle is also illuminated for shooting at dusk or in very dark conditions.

We have additional higher resolution pictures of this item available upon request.

caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300
AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round
capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide
extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming
chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to
accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™
flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX
III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories.
The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high
hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also
a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme
corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a
single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened
steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement
in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind
even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium
ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible
life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower
strength S7 more commonly used. 

Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with
Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a
Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by
MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are
not included.
The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides
an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition."
