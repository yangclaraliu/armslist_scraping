The MEPRO 21 reflex sight offers users the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open.

I can meet in the Kitsap County area most days of the week. Easy to meet in either Silverdale or Bainbridge Island. 

The barrel and gun are clean. There is a minor scuff or two on the polymer frame but function is perfect. I can email more pictures if needed. Went shooting this weekend and it shot flawless through 200 rds.

Has 4x 10 round mags
Holster included is a basic paddle holster 
I have attached a Surefire Adaptor so you can mount a light using a regular rail. 

I will need to see a WA drivers license and good guy card. Please contact me with any questions and I will try and get back as soon as possible."

This thing weighs about 1200 lbs and has the following selling-points:

 External hinges: These allow the door to open a full 180 degrees. The hinges can be cut off, however the locking bolts are on all 4 sides of the door...so even if a burglar cut the hinges off, that door is staying closed. 

 Flush floor-to-frame: you won't smack anything against the bottom of the doorframe when you remove items.

 The frame of the door has a full-contact surface with the sliding bolts when they lock....this improves security and increases the strength of the safe. Also keeps smoke out.

All I'm interested in is a trade for a quality, forged slide/frame 1911, preferably in a Government profile, though Commander length may be an option as well depending on the build. Doesn't have to be custom or high end, but needs to be in good shape. 45ACP only. I have no interest in any other trades outside 1911s, and I'm not really interested in selling either, but you're of course free to make an offer if so inclined.

Email me if interested. If we can work something out, I'm willing to meet at the range near Flag for a test fire should there be any questions or concerns, though that's entirely optional."

It is chambered for .22 Short, Long or Long Rifle. This one still has at least 95% of its bluing. The stock is a very nice Black Walnut. The metal is very nice with only tiny flaws but you have to look for them. The stock is in fantastic shape for its age with only very minor flaws in the clear coat finish. No major scratches, dings or dents anywhere. These are going for 275 on Gunbrokers and they are nowhere near this nice. I did see several in the 150-175 price range but most look like 9 miles of pounded dogs ass. This thing is an absolute tack driver if you do your part. By all original, I mean that it has never been drilled for a scope nor has the stock been fitted with sling swivels. I prefer cash on this one but I will consider trades. I will let it go for 195 cash or trade value. Trades considered are limited to firearms and ammo only. I am not interested in services, pottery, tools, car parts or your neighbors chickens. Ammo I am interested in is .17 HMR, .22 LR, 9mm, .40 cal, 10mm, 45 acp, 357 magnum and .357 Sig, 5.56 Nato/.223, 5.45x39, 7.62x39 and 7.62x39 and 7.62x51/.308. No other calibers interest me at this time. I am also interested in mags in 5.45x39, 5.56/..223, 7.62x39 and 7.62x51/.308. Cash or mags with ammo will get my attention before any other trades.
The drop down list to choose from doesnt give all choices, so if you dont know, this is a single shot bolt action with the safety on the back of the bolt. This is a fantastic beginners rifle since there is no live round in the chamber after firing the round. We all know what is like to have a beginner wave a firearm around after firing one or more rounds while another is chambered and the safety has not yet been engaged. Please do a little research and look at the condition of all the others out there. You will be very happy to see the condition of this particular rifle. Feel free to contact me by email or phone.

I bought it for the stock. Its an awesome tiger stripe Maple stock. The rifle overall is in pretty dang good condition for its age. This one is a fantastic candidate for a refinish due to this stock. It fires very well but the safety is kind of goofy. It has a tendency to stick in the safe position from time to time. It is a tube fed rifle that holds 17 rounds of .22 LR. The rear sight elevator has gone MIA but are under 2 dollars from Brownells if you dont have one laying around. I bought this rifle for 150 dollars years ago just to get the stock. I then sold it on Auction Arms for 125 only to have to refund the buyers money in addition to paying 65 dollars for his gunsmith to work on the safety. I also refunded shipping costs to the buyer and paid shipping to get it back as well. I then took it to my own gunsmith who charged me 50 dollars to fix the safety and its still not right. As you can see, Im going to take a big ol kick in the teeth on this one. The receiver has already been drilled and tapped for a scope, both on top and on the side giving you two options for mounts. The rifle shoots true and accurate despite the missing rear sight elevator. I would like 125 for this rifle and chock the loss up to experience with auction sites. I will also trade it for 150 dollars of mags and ammo in a wide variety of calibers."

The Burris AR-332 is perfect for quick shooting at point-blank to intermediate ranges. 3X magnification plus the Ballistic CQ reticle provide for instinctive target acquisition. The black reticle is etched directly onto the prism with red and green light illumination available with the turn of a dial. Reticle dots correspond to bullet drop from 5.56 or 7.62 rounds, however this tough optic is built to handle much heavier recoil if needed."

I will let this one go for 650 cash money. It has had exactly 280 rounds run through it out of a 1080 tin. I also have a brand new 750 round case of WPA which stands for Wolf Performance Ammo. These are 225 dollars plus shipping. I will sell the entire package for 800 dollars cash money. I will look at trades for complete AR15, AK 47s with mags and ammo and quality hand guns. If your trade is not worth what I have please be prepared to come up with some cash as well. As you can plainly see, I am offering this at a substantial discount so please, no stupid or BS offers. You would just be wasting my time and your breath."

Kahr CW380 Recent Production Model in great shape with zero issues. This Kahr has roughly 150 rounds through it and fires true and accurate for such a small package. My Kahr has been sent to Kahr to have the feed ramp polished and all rounds including hollow points run like butter. This CW380 is my wife's and she has went back to the S&W442 so I am looking to trade it for a Glock 42 due to me having larger hands. My CW380 will come with everything it did new along with a Kydex IWB Tuckable Holster. Depending on trade I do have extra magazines / ammo / kydex mag carriers for the CW as well. If you haven't looked at the CW380/P380 you should if looking for a small pocket pistol around the size of a LCP but much better quality and trigger in my personal opinion.

The popular Bobtail Commander is now available in the Valor series in the form of the V-Bob. The Valor series is our flagship line, meaning it’s the best we have to offer. Frankly, we feel it is the best built production 1911 on the market.

The V-Bob is loaded with features, including a forged Bobtail frame with 25 LPI checkering front and back, an undercut trigger guard, tactical ledge night sights, VZ slim line G10 grips, EGW carry bevel bushings as well as our tool-steel fire controls and other premium small parts. Every piece that goes into the Valor series is hand-fit, polished and blended to provide you with not only the best functioning gun we can provide, but also the best looking.

The V-Bob  can be had with either a matte stainless glass bead finish or our super durable black Duty finish. This finish is a revolutionary treatment process that actually bonds to the components and creates a super-durable matte black skin. Our Duty Black finish beats any of the spray-and-bake finishes most companies use today, hands down. Our durability testing proves it and our customers love it – which is proof enough for us!"
