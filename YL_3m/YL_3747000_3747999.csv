I will also include a partial box of .40 S&W defense HP rounds.
This pistol shoots any kind of ammo problem free and has a great trigger- that being said, I am just more interested in the 1911 platform.
As such, I would like to make a trade for a mid-range 1911. The main one I would be interested in would be a Springfield Armory Mil-Spec. Otherwise would be interested in anything comparable, like models from Para-Ordanance, Ruger, Remington, etc. Mainly interested in a commander size, but will consider full and officer size models as well. Might consider basic models like Rock Islands but will expect some cash on top.
Otherwise I will sell for $600 OBO.

The trigger is made by FN and is set at 2lbs. The barrel is a 24 inch heavy stainless barrel (premium grade) made by Douglass. The stock is a top grade walnut stock from FN. On top, the rifle has a Redfield 4-12x accu-trac scope. This scope was made in the 70s to 80s before Leupold bought Redfield out. The same model scope was used by the USMC and is based on a 200 yard zero. This is truly one of a kind rifle.

The AR57 Upper Receiver Assembly converts an AR-15 to shoot 5.7x28 FN ammunition. The unique upper design loads on top and accepts FN PS90 50 round magazine (included) and ejects downward through the AR-15 magwell. This upper is precision machined from a one piece aluminum forging. The integrated picatinny-style quad rail system allows attachment of various accessories. A parkerized chrome alloy bolt and full-floated barrel ensure reliability and accuracy. The teflon-infused hard coat anodized aluminum upper and rails guarantee durability for years of shooting enjoyment. The updated charging handle and magazine release of the Generation 2 allows for easy manipulation of the controls. New and improved lightening features, such as the fluted barrel, shave a pound off this receiver when compared to the Generation 1 upper assemblies. The top feed and bottom eject also help to make this upper fully functional for right or left handed users.

I am asking $25 or best offer.

I bought this in the spring for reloading rifle ammo but then decided to stick with pistol reloading.  The jug is unopened.

Here is the description for the powder:

Trail Boss is designed specifically for low velocity lead bullet loads suitable for Cowboy Action shooting. It is primarily a pistol powder, but has some application in rifle. It is based on a whole new technology which allows very high loading density, good flow through powder measures, stability in severe temperature variation and most importantly, additional safety to the handloader. 

This powder was made in Australia and packaged in America.

This rifle is a blast but not worth it just sitting in the closet for me.  I have about 1100 into this set up rifle and scope alone.  Lower end psa ar-15s at monsours are 1k + tax and have lower end trim by far. I did actually use this in the woods for deer and coyotes this year.  Worked fine but just to nervous about brush so im letting it go.

The SD variant of the Beretta PX4 Storm is the result of the U.S. military’s Joint Combat Pistol program of 2005. The premise behind this program was to replace the aging stock of M9 pistols currently in use with U.S. armed forces with a superior weapon. It stipulated that the weapon be chambered in .45 ACP, more resistant to salt spray be capable of mounting a sound suppressor and be capable of firing 5,000 rounds without failure. Furthermore, the replacement pistol should have a grip no larger than the standard M9, feature a low-glare finish and ideally be in FDE.

I am asking $35 or best offer.

I bought this in the spring for reloading rifle ammo but then decided to stick with pistol reloading. The jug is unopened.

Here is the description for the powder:

Introduced in January 2012, this versatile spherical rifle propellant incorporates in its formula CFE, Copper Fouling Eraser. This ingredient, originally used in military propellant, greatly deters copper fouling. It contributes to longer periods of top accuracy with less barrel cleaning time. Being a spherical powder, metering is superbly accurate. CFE 223 yields top velocities in many cartridges such as the 204 Ruger, 223 Remington/5.56mm NATO, 22-250 Remington and the 308 Winchester/7.62mm NATO, plus many, many more. Match, Varmint and AR shooters will love this one!

It was shipped to J.P. Moores & Sons New York City NY in a shipment of 45 guns. The Colt factory letter accompanies this fine pistol. This is a rare civilian model that was blued with a case colored frame and 1 piece walnut grips. The pistol has all matching numbers with its original grips. The mechanics are excellent with no issues. The indexing, timing and lockup are as new and solid as a vault. The barrel address is of the 1st style Italicized lettering and all frame markings are crisp and legible with no hint of any tampering at all. The bore is excellent with strong lands and grooves and shiny from muzzle to chamber. The cylinder walls are excellent also with shiny finish original blue remaining. This fine Peacemaker locks up tight as a vault with all 4 audible clicks. The barrel and cylinder blue has worn or flaked off but there still remains the original charcoal blueing on the trigger guard and front and back straps. You can see the original bright blueing on the flats. There are small remains of faded case colors on the frame. All metal edges are sharp and flush as they were when the gun left the factory. The grips could have been refinished long ago but fit tight with no gaps and no cracks or repairs of any kind. There is no play in the action anywhere and the original mainspring is as strong as the day it was made. The hammer retains its sharp factory bordered checkering which is indicative of little use. A beautiful and rare Colt SAA pistol for the advanced Colt collector and one that is missing in most advanced collections. Not many Colt SAA's of this period remain today and when usually seen are plain no finish guns with much heavy wear, chopped barrels and replaced or missing parts. Original Colt Civilian SAA's from 1874, 1875 and 1876 are real prizes for the advanced collector."

- Graphite Black Cerakote on slide. All work was done by an extremely well experienced gunsmith.
- 200 rounds (4 boxes Sellier and Bellot) through it with no failure. Hasn't been broken in fully yet. Very soft shooting recoil compared to a Glock 19 Gen4. 
-Extremely accurate pistol. I can hit the same hole without even trying at 10 yards (using Sellier&Bellot 115gr). With the 2014 barrel twist rates, increased accuracy with 9mm ammo of varying weights.

It is made by Larue tactical - one of the top manufacturers of precision AR type parts and riflesI am selling a great AR15 Upper Receiver.

The upper is complete including bolt carrier group and an AAC Muzzle break, supressor attachment.  Larue sells these uppers for $1200, but they have a waiting list that's anywhere from 1-2 years.  As a result Larue Rifles and Uppers frequently sell for well above MSRP on gun broker simply because there is such a high demand for them and they can't keep up with supply.

The upper is capable of shooting almost 1/2 MOA with match grade ammo.  I can provide target sheets if you want.

The rifle has a 13 inch free floating quad rail also made by larue.

I have included some stock photos because the one I am
Selling is in almost new condition.  I've only shot about 10 rounds thru it to zero it once.  It served as a backup upper for one of my larue competition rifles.

I want $1000 for the upper.  I would consider a partial trade towards a JP AR in 5.66.  That's it though.

I also have a like new glock 22.  It was also a spare for my production competition guns.  It's unmodified and i will sell it with 1 magazine for $425 firm.  It's a gen 3

Last for sale is an older glock 23.  It was a law enforcement pistol that the department sold and has visible wear.  The finish is still in decent shape and mechanically it's perfect.  Will sell with one magazine for $350 firm.  This is an earlier gen model that does not come with a tac rail.  But it's a great carry gun and that's what I've used it for.

willing to meet in twin cities and to make sale following appropriate MN and FED laws.  Hand written bill of sale - must have carry or purchase permit for the pistols, no paperwork is required by the upper.

I also have 5-6 chip McCormick 8 round 1911 mags for $20 each
Used glock 19 mags for $15 each

Also many parts like magpul PRS stock for ar15 and all kinds of other stuff.  Let me know what you're lookkng for

Serious inquires only.  Would consider trades toward a competition JP rifle - an AR.  Gold or silver coins, morgan dollars, Eagles, bars, or whatever.  Beyond that not interested in any trades i can think of but would possibly consider certain high end optics or a new aimpoint micro.  Plus or minus cash depending.  Oh.. Lastly would consider trades for large quantities of ammo.  Match grade 762, or 556.  Also any non steel 556, 9mm and 40 cal.  No low end or junk ammo. No reloads.

This one is particular in that it does not have any import marks.
I've checked on the barrel, under the stock, and around the trunnion and I don't see any sort of import marking. The previous owner I bought it off said that he got it as a bringback, unfortunately there isn't any paperwork to authenticate that so it's just a theory, but it's still interesting to see an unmarked Russian SKS. 

The gun comes with the pictured sling, and I'll throw in 10 stripper clips and 100 rounds of ammo. 
I can meet in the Bellevue/Factoria area.
