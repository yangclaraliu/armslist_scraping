In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system.   The barrel has an A2 style profile, is mil-spec phosphate coated, and MP/HP tested.  The upper is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, and an A2 flash hider.

IN DEPTH SPECS:
Barrel: Barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN Manufacturing using their proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system.   The barrel has an A2 style profile, is mil-spec phosphate coated, and MP/HP tested.  The upper is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.

Bolt: Bolt is made of Mil-spec shot-peened Carpenter 158 steel. Gas key is secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked per mil-spec. Bolt carrier is parkerized outside, and chrome lined inside."

Hey all,
I got a really good deal on a big lot of defense and target ammo, so instead of putting up separate listings for each caliber, I decided to put them into one listing. All of the prices are listed and they are for pickup in Norman. I would also consider trades towards a nice PF9, Full size 357 mag or 38spl +P rated revolver or possibly lever gun, or even potentially a 7.62 Tokarev pistol/carbine. Possibly a single stack 1911 in 45 or even a nice Nagant pistol or rifle. Aside from that I would consider most any gun trades so long as fair on both sides. Just be reasonable on your gun values, i know what guns actually sell for versus what people ask for them. Here is what I have available as of now (I only have the listed items on hand, not everything in picture):

45 ACP
-1X 20rd box Winchester PDX1 Defender 230gr BJHP- $16 each

-11X 20rd boxes Hornady Zombie MAX 185gr Z-MAX- $16 each
-7X 20rd boxes Federal 230gr JHP “Personal Defense”-$16 each

I don't ride the kat much (switching between bikes is dangerous) and she deserves a good home. Asking $2750.

1999 Katana GSXF600 w/ ~31,000 miles --$2750 OBO.

•	New battery
•	New pilot power 3's (~150 miles, still has the nipples in the center)
•	New EBC brake pads (spare front and rear set included too)
•	New fork seals/synthetic fork oil (never been wheelied, just started leaking last summer and it was time to replace given their age - rubber)
•	New synthetic engine oil (every change done at 3k or less, emphasis on the ""less"")
•	New oil filter
•	New air filter
•	New steering head bearings (gave me a little wobble before, the new bearings are phenomenal)
•	New valve stems (with new tires)
•	Stainless Scorpion exhaust (never needs to be repacked, sounds great, loud but not obnoxious)
•	EBC wave rear brake rotor
•	Zero gravity smoked wind screen
•	1.5 season old chain and sprockets, done at the same time (clean, shows no wear, hasn't needed adjustment)
•	Rear ""shovel chop"" with led signals and license plate light

All work was done by me (some with help from close friends here and there), save for literally installing the tires on the wheels and the last valve adjustment/carb clean/carb re-jet. 

Everything was done last year in early September in preparation for my week long vacation in Tennessee, but then I decided to ride my triumph to instead (i.e. I prepared my bike for a 5,000 mile trip knowing if it wasn't perfect my annual vacation would be shot, this thing is basically brand new). Since then, I've ridden the katana from Indy to Fort Wayne and it's been in my garage since (Note: I run it every week or so to make sure the fuel doesn't varnish, and my brother has been out on it once or twice for short trips too).

As for why I'm selling it, as I said before I have a new-to-me 2007 triumph speed triple and I don't ride this anymore. I'm not pressed to sell it, honestly if I saw this bike for sale knowing what I know; I'd probably buy it all over again. No sense paying for insurance though and I find it dangerous to go from one bike to the other. Time to let her go!

Prefer to deal local in the Vancouver area, also prefer to deal with a CPL holder. I would like to do the transaction through a local FFL here in Vancouver, as my schedule can be kind of hectic and they are willing to hold and finish the transaction for me. I, of course will take care of the fees.

PSA SPECS:
Barrel: Barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN Manufacturing using their proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system. The barrel has an A2 style profile, is mil-spec phosphate coated, and MP/HP tested. The upper is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.

Bolt: Bolt is made of Mil-spec shot-peened Carpenter 158 steel. Gas key is secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked per mil-spec. Bolt carrier is parkerized outside, and chrome lined inside.

The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied."

Hello i have a less then year old krakatoa by fox pro. has over 100 sounds tons of distress and coyote vocals. runs off 2 battery packs which it comes with along with charger. comes with a carry bag a coyote decoy a turkey decoy and a crow decoy. This is the loudest caller on the market it will flat scream. perfect for calling in are kansas wind. would sale everything for 650.00 or will do some trading. heres kind of a list i can think of but will listen to all offers. shoot me a text with what ya got REDACTED. Only reason for getting rid of the caller i have another one and im going to really bow hunt deer hard this year so probably wont have a lot of time for chasing predators. this is a top of the line caller not a low end unit.
