Thinning the Enfield collection a little and found this one in the safe.  It's a 1904 (best I can tell) Sht Le 1* that has been chambered in .410.  This was done for the Indian Police and prison guard force for 2 reasons...  The first is that the guards needed something that would not penetrate walls and the other if the firearm was stolen, ammo would be hard to find.  

The rifle has what appears to be replacement upper wood and the buttstock was replaced due to being damaged.  I will include the original buttstock if wanted.  Bore is bright and shiny (and is smooth like it should be) and the rifle closes on GO but does not lock down on NO GO.  Overall, the wood is good and the metal is ok. I'd still have it checked by a gunsmith before firing.   Ammo has just become available again and I'll include 20 rounds with the sale.  

Asking $250 obro.  Trades considered.  I prefer milsurp firearms but will consider newer production firearms as well.  Not interested in non-firearm related trades (reloading equipment excluded)."

BT-99. The ideal competition shotgun for trapshooters of all ages.
Browning quality can be found at every level of the shooting sports. And when your chosen sport is American singles and handicap trap, the revered Browning BT-99 wins the hearts and minds of many. There is not a finer example of simplicity, quality and clay-busting performance than the classic BT-99. When it was introduced in 1969, it immediately gained a loyal following among both beginner and veteran shooters alike. They appreciated the consistent, reliable performance and great value the BT-99 offered. Today is no different.

INVECTOR PLUS™ CHOKE TUBE SYSTEM
The Invector-Plus interchangeable choke tube system provides consistent, dense shot patterns in the constriction needed for your shooting situation. The longer choke taper inside an Invector-Plus choke tube works with Back-Bored Technology to produce patterns with more uniform densities and fewer flyers. The superior design eliminates gases slipping between the choke tube and barrel that could damage the choke tube and the barrel.

CHROME CHAMBERS
The BT-99 features a chrome-plated chamber to resist the toll thousands of shells can take on lesser quality guns. Corrosion resistance is also greatly improved.

VECTOR PRO™ LENGTHENED FORCING CONE
Longer, tapered Vector Pro dimensions minimize shot deformation and maximize pattern uniformity, consistency and density. Back-boring increases bore diameter specifications and decreases friction between the shot cup and the bore to maximize shot pellet velocity and reduce felt recoil. Reducing constriction from the forcing cone on the shot column results in fewer deformed pellets for more uniform patterns, and keeps more pellets in the central part of the pattern where they’re needed to smoke clays."

It is a beautiful rifle and shoots even better than it looks. It will shoot 5 shot groups at 200 yards that make 1 hole. I have been extremely careful with the barrel, about not letting it get too hot and keeping it clean. It has a full round muzzel brake that makes it have no recoil, and on longer shots it makes it so you can watch the vapor trail of the bullet going to its target through the scope, that is very cool to watch. The scope is a BURRIS FULLFIELD II 6.5 X 20, the scope has crystal clear optics with the traditional 4 plex. The trigger has been adjusted down to 3.5LBS and it has a very clean break, then again all remingtons do. It is set up for varmint hunting and is a blast to shoot, whether you are going to shoot praire dogs or all the way up to deer this rifle will do it. This rifle dont miss, the guy shooting it will.

This holster is an Outside the Waistband (OWB) duty-carry holster. It features great retention to hold the weapon securely in place. It will not fall out when running, jumping or even upside down. The weapon only comes out when you want it to. Use a smooth definitive draw to release the weapon and enjoy a smooth return with a comforting ""click"" when holstered. The high line-over-waistband attitude of this holster makes it more comfortable than most when seated and also still accessible. The belt clips offer a firm grip on your belt line without requiring your belt to be removed every time you need to take the holster off and they are stiff enough to be used as belt loops. Of course, if you prefer solid belt loops 1.5"" and 2"" belt loops are available at no additional cost, just specify.

This holster is an Outside the Waistband (OWB) duty-carry holster. It features great retention to hold the weapon securely in place. It will not fall out when running, jumping or even upside down. The weapon only comes out when you want it to. Use a smooth definitive draw to release the weapon and enjoy a smooth return with a comforting ""click"" when holstered. The high line-over-waistband attitude of this holster makes it more comfortable than most when seated and also still accessible. The belt clips offer a firm grip on your belt line without requiring your belt to be removed every time you need to take the holster off and they are stiff enough to be used as belt loops. Of course, if you prefer solid belt loops 1.5"" and 2"" belt loops are available at no additional cost, just specifiy.

- Handmade in USA. Made to order.

The S&W M&P Shield is a reliable, durable, and accurate firearm that is built from the ground up to be easy to conceal and easy to shoot.

The polymer frame is lightweight but still allows for a full grip which provides for exceptional recoil management. Compact, lightweight, and with ample capacity; the Smith & Wesson M&P Shield gives you a heavy advantage without weighing you down.

Trigger pull is smooth with a combat-oriented double action and light single  action for target shooting.  The gun also has adjustable tritium night sights and nicely figured American walnut wood grip panels.  Low round count on this gun, probably around 500.  Gun comes with extras: Bianchi #111 leather holster that can either be worn strong-side or cross-draw, custom corridor shoulder holster, 2 HKS speed loaders, package of various factory weight and reduced-power springs, original rosewood grip panels, original box and papers, and the certificate of authenticity for the limited edition run.  Price is firm, and I’ll only do face-to-face in Missoula to a Montana resident.
Only trades that I would consider negotiating for are old-school S&W target revolvers in 38 special, 44 special, or 45, or a glock 41."

UTICA M5 Bayonet: Made for the M1 Garand. It is marked U.S. M5 and UTICA with the Ordnance Shell and Flame. The grips are in excellent shape with what appears to be a 1 on one grip and a 5 on the other. The blade is in excellent shape, has not been sharpened, and appears to have the original parkerizing. There is the slight formation of surface rust in certain areas underneath the grips (see pics). The crossguard is tight with no movement. I have fixed the bayonet on one of my M1 Garands and there is zero wiggle or movement when attached and it is somewhat difficult to unfix. Tightness may vary depending on condition of bayonet lug/gas cylinder lock screw.

USM8A1 Scabbard: Scabbard is marked USM8A1 with TWB below. There is no period after the U or S and the letters are wide spaced and small. Glove fastener is marked RAU CO. Corrosion is present on the backside of the glove fasteners but does not affect function. Scabbard has the number 85 on the backside of the throat. The inside of the scabbard is clean.

Vintage Manufacturing Date of 1975 

This is a very shiny and desirable vintage 1975 Colt MK IV, Series 70 Government Model .45 auto, finished in Colt’s beautiful Bright Nickel. The pistol has polished slide flats, and matte slide top and undercarriage. The pistol has factory checkered wooden grips with gold-colored Colt medallions that look really nice against the Bright Nickel finish. The grips have black grain running through the brown. The stainless factory magazines are Colt-marked. The pistol has some small but noticeable marks primarily on the slide. Otherwise, the gun is in very nice condition with a shiny bore and a very smooth trigger pull – overall condition is around 90%. Series 70 Colt 1911’s keep going up in value, and the nickel finished guns are quite desirable."

Trapdoor buttplate. Nothing inside. Barrel date reads 9-18.

Asking $450 OBO. Trades welcome. Been looking for a Gustav mauser or a Carcano, but open to any military surplus, or pretty much anything if the price is right. 
If you want to offer me a Mosin-Nagant, the only ones I have any interest in are M39s, M27s, 28/30s, and other original Finnish stuff. K11 carbine and a (walnut) K31 would also be considered.

Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories.

It appears to have some holster wear and a few small scratches on the left side of the grip, but besides that its in great shape, no scratches on the frame itself that I can see. The proof markings under the barrel indicate that she(yes, its a she)was made in 1991.

I have personally put around 500 rounds thru her with zero malfunctions. I ran every cheap type of ammo I could find and had zero issues. Shes a great shooter and very smooth. The only reason Im selling her is because I originally bought it to be a home defense weapon but unfortunately my girlfriend has very small hands and cant handle the weight or reach the trigger comfortably.

I have a Diamondback DB9 in like new condition. Comes with everything as buying new box and a total of 3 - 6 round mags. I have about 200 rounds through it and it has proven to be a reliable carry gun. Fully loaded it weighs just under 16 ounces and truly is the lightest and smallest 9mm you can get. I have read several mixed reviews about these firearms, but wanted to check them out for myself. I have had a good experience with them.

On that note, this is NOT a good first firearm. This firearm is best for an experienced shooter looking for an easily concealed pocket 9. It shoots well and it is accurate, but is not a gun will you will take to the range and put 200 plus rounds through it.  50 rounds do just fine, but after that your hand may not like it.  It can be somewhat picky about ammo and it does not like limpwristing. Most of my 115 gr went through fine and it feeds very well with Hornady Critical Defense. As with any defensive gun, make sure what round you plan to carry will feed reliably.

If interested, please contact me by phone/text at REDACTED. You should have an Indiana ID and valid handgun permit and we will do a bill of sale. If not, we can do transfer at FFL. OH, please be 21 or older (I know 18 is legal, but my own rule). Thanks for looking and have a good day / night."

Check out our website at www.wideopenarmsinc.com for additional selection. Thank you for looking. Please note this is the L.E. model of the VP9 not to be confused with the standard model. This model comes with (3) 15 round magazines as well as tritium night sights. The standard model which sells for under 600 dollars only comes with (2) 15 or 10 round magazines and is equipped with glow in the dark sights which must be charged using a light source and last only a short time in the dark prior to needing to be re-exposed to a light source. In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis."

I have a Diamondback DB9 in like new condition. Comes with everything as buying new box and a total of 3 - 6 round mags. I have about 200 rounds through it and it has proven to be a reliable carry gun. Fully loaded it weighs just under 16 ounces and truly is the lightest and smallest 9mm you can get. I have read several mixed reviews about these firearms, but wanted to check them out for myself. I have had a good experience with them.

On that note, this is NOT a good first firearm. This firearm is best for an experienced shooter looking for an easily concealed pocket 9. It shoots well and it is accurate, but is not a gun will you will take to the range and put 200 plus rounds through it. 50 rounds do just fine, but after that your hand may not like it. It can be somewhat picky about ammo and it does not like limpwristing. Most of my 115 gr went through fine and it feeds very well with Hornady Critical Defense. As with any defensive gun, make sure what round you plan to carry will feed reliably.

If interested, please contact me by phone/text at REDACTED. You should have an Indiana ID and valid handgun permit and we will do a bill of sale. If not, we can do transfer at FFL. OH, please be 21 or older (I know 18 is legal, but my own rule). Thanks for looking and have a good day / night."

This gun is registered with federal agencies in my name. I will only sell to law abiding citizens who will follow the proper protocol to register in their name etc.  Military welcome. This is a classic gun you will not see around much. After my tours, I'm in school and need cash, otherwise I would not be parting with this, my first and favorite pistol. It has always been cared for. Never in the dirt. Very clean and fires true routinely. Heat doesn't seem to effect targeting. The only easier gun I've fired is Glock's longest.

Everything was adulted used and, handle with care, with no negligent damage, such as dry firing, or prolong full automatic fire. If you bought everything new, it would set you back around 550 dollars. So i think a fair asking price is 300 trade value.  
i'm open for trades for just about everything, but if you travel to me 250$ cash would take it."
