The gun does not show wear from ever being carried. It was well kept and cleaned after every time it was took out to shoot. This is basically Kimber's finest .45 when it comes to 1911's and certainly packs a punch. It does include the original box as well as all paperwork and the gun does come furnished with factory night sights. If you have any questions, feel free to call or ask.

The M95 was the service weapon used by the Austro-Hungarians during WW1, and most M95s were then sold to Bulgaria in the 1930s and used by the Bulgarian Army during WW2.  It uses a unique straight pull action, which I found is faster and smoother than a traditional bolt action.

The carbine is a M95/30 carbine, produced in 1916 in Steyr, Austria. It was originally a M95 long rifle that was later modified to carbine length by the Bulgarian Army in the 1930s.  It retains the original long rifle rear sight.  The numbers are force matched.

Interestingly, the markings show that this Austrian-made M95 was not used by the Austro-Hungarian Imperial Army like most M95s. Instead, it was used by the Hungarian Honvédség, which was the Hungarian territorial army. Both Austria and Hungary had home defense armies, independent of the joint Imperial Army.

The carbine is S-marked for 8x56R ammo.  It was refurbished by the Bulgarians after WW2, and is in great shape with no rust, pitting, cracks, or mechanical issues.  It has a very good but somewhat frosty bore with prominent rifling.  The rifle is still in the original cosmoline.

Also included in the package are 255 rounds of 8x56R FMJ ammo, 19 enbloc clips, and 10 once-fired brass cases:
80 rounds of Austrian Nazi-headstamped ammo on clips and in the original boxes
10 rounds of Austrian Nazi-headstamped ammo on clips (no boxes)
100 rounds of loose Austrian Nazi-headstamped ammo
10 rounds of loose Bulgarian ammo wrapped in paper
50 rounds of boxed Prvi Partizan 208 gr. FMJ (Reloadable!  Boxer primed and brass cased.)
10 once-fired Prvi brass cases
5 rounds of Prvi Partisan FMJ on a clip

For the entire package of the carbine and all the ammo and clips, I'm asking $400 cash.  I'll need a copy of your AR Driver's License or AR Concealed Handgun License, as I have to log this out of my C&R bound book.  I'll also trade for the items listed below, +/- cash as needed.

I'm not interested in splitting up the package, or selling some of the ammo separately.

Cleaned religiously and very we'll taken care of, it's still basically brand new. Also comes from the factory with laser grips and meprolight tritium night sights. Will come with original pistol case and everything it came with including kimber mag and paperwork, also I have Wilson combat mags and a nice king tuk IWB holster to go with it for the right deal.

 I built this to have the accuracy of a sniper, high power of competition guns, decent rate of fire and put it in a compact package for easy maneuverability (CQB). It has a rail for optional red dot, scope...ect. It also has a surrounding rail on the front of the rifle for numerous accessories. Standard this rifle has a PEQ box with a battery in it on the side of the rifle. I got rid of that by putting a stick battery in the stock and rear wiring it. Only ""issues"" would be no safe or semi. I didn't care about that thou. On full auto a good shooter can shoot semi, bursts and lay down automatic fire. Also the mock charging handle is no longer working, this is just for show so I didn't care. Also the paint job is not camo, but that was intentional as I wanted my gun to be one of a kind (and it wont be used in real war!) Great gun that will have the envy of youre friends when they see the comparison to their rifles.
 Total costs:
 $180 Standard M4
 $40 Magazine
 +$250 parts
 $30 new battery
 Selling bc I will be leaving for the military and wont be using this anymore. I know what it is worth. No low ball offers. Can ship anywhere.

UPC: REDACTED17

The Barnett Vengeance represents a quantum leap in crossbow evolution. It is the first crossbow to combine a lightweight CarbonLite Riser with reverse draw technology. In this radical new reverse draw configuration, the limb pockets are moved closer to the trigger assembly and the limbs face forward on the bow, thus shifting the center of gravity closer to the shooter's body. This drastically reduces the weight at the front of the crossbow, which is essential for a well balanced shot. The most technically advanced riser ever created for a crossbow, the CarbonLite Riser removes approximately 43% of weight from the riser, which dramatically shifts the balance point to the shoulder. The combination of the reverse draw design with the CarbonLite Riser allows the Vengeance to provide the steadiest and most accurate shot possible. Decorated in a carbon fiber finish or in a high definition camouflage, the Vengeance is available through retailers as a complete package with crossbow, quick detach quiver, three 22"" arrows and an illuminated 3x32 Multi Reticle Scope.

It takes its namesake from the Japanese martial, or underworld where the word ""Kobun"" means ""soldier"". It's a fitting name for a knife like the Kobun®, which was effectively designed to be ""a good soldier"". In profile it closely resembles our Master Tanto, but it sports a thinner blade, and that supports its main function; to be a light weight boot knife.

Like our Tantos, it features the Tanto styled reinforced point. This contrasts sharply with most boot knives on the market today which are notorious for their paper thin points which are easily broken or bent. In contrast, the Kobun's® point is highly resistant to bending or breaking because it is reinforced by the full thickness of the blade's spine which runs almost to the very tip of the blade.

The Kobun's® deeply checkered Kray-Ex™ handle is designed to offer minimum bulk with maximum grip. Its cross section was made as thin as possible (approximately 1/2 inch), then contoured to resist turning or shifting in the hand. The Kobun® comes complete with a Secure- Ex® sheath.

Blade Length: 5 1/2""

378,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3633378,For Sale:  COLD STEEL Safe Maker II - Push Dagger/Neck Knife/Boot Knife,"East Side, Janesville, Wisconsin",$ 50,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 26, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Cold Steel has been making push knifes for a quarter century. In those twenty five years we have continually been refining our designs, discarding features that didn't perform as well as we would have liked and enhancing those that did. These blades, and the wealth of experience that has gone into their manufacture, have paid off handsomely for Cold Steel as they have generated quite a following among law enforcement and military personnel around the world. This is because they offer ""big knife"" cutting and piercing potential in a very compact, easily portable size, and, unlike a revolver or semi automatic pistol, they never break, malfunction, or run out of ammunition.

Designed by Lynn C. Thompson, our Safe Make™ push knifes are, without doubt, the finest commercially made push knives in the world. The blade, shaft, and 'T' shaped tang are all drop forged from one piece of AUS 8A Stainless Steel. This process, though costly, eliminates any unwanted sharp edges or surfaces that would irritate the hand or fingers when the knife is clasped in a closed fist, and it produces a better knife, since the subsequent vacuum heat treatment and sub zero quench, renders the blades virtually unbreakable.

Well made blades deserve equally well-made grips. A lot of time and energy went into the production of our 'T' shaped handles. Made of shock absorbing Kray-Ex™ they totally encapsulate the tang and part of the shaft so they can be comfortably and securely grasped in the fist with the blade jutting out between the fingers and used to deliver absolutely devastating punching and slashing blows.

The Safe Maker knives are available in two sizes; each includes an easily concealable and sturdy Secure-Ex® boot/belt sheath. The smaller version includes a steel bead chain lanyard so it can be worn as a neck knife.

Has rail system in bed for fifth wheel and gooseneck.  Also plug in bed.  Towing package with new automatic brake controller.  Back up camera. Edge power programmer. Extra belt, fuel and motor oil filters.  Does have some dents.  Like most powerstrokes it has rusted rear fender wells (design flaw). Has lifetime brakes and rotors. This truck has the option of running on waste vegetable oil (this is not biodiesel but it can run on that too). I have put over 80k miles on veggie.  I have over 100 gallons of extra filtered veggie, extra filters.  It has a 60 gal tank in bed with its own filter, heating system and fuel lines.  There is a switch in the cab that changes tanks.  It has to be started and shut down on diesel to clear the filter and lines. I run lucas or sea foam fuel additive in every tank cause it may be over a thousand miles before I drain a tank of diesel.  I get the veggie for free, locally.  Most restaurants have to pay to have it taken off, so they are more than happy to have a free pickup.  I hate to sell and start paying for fuel but I have had back surgery and can no longer filter veggie or drive such a big truck. This truck is mechanically sound with no issues.  I have replaced parts as they needed and some preventative like glow plugs, transmission flush, radiator flush,.  All my veggie equipment comes with the truck. This truck gets around 16 city and as high as 22 hwy.  I think its rated for 14k lbs towing. Asking $16,500. May take partial trade on a smaller 4x4 that must seat a family of 5. Reply by email, if I don't respond it may have gone to spam, so re-send it. Any questions or parts that have been replaced, leave a number and I'll call you. I have a lot that goes with this truck.

Author: John Ross
Publisher: Accurate Press
Pages: 863
Format: hardback
Publication Date: 1996

Unintended Consequences is a novel by John Ross, first published in 1996 by Accurate Press.[1] The story chronicles the history of the gun culture, gun rights, and gun control in the United States from the early 1900s through the late 1990s. Although clearly a work of fiction, the story is heavily laced with historical information, including real-life historical figures who play minor supporting roles. The novel also features unusually detailed and intricate facts, figures and explanations of many firearms-related topics. The cover has a picture of Lady Justice being assaulted by an ATF agent.

Background:
The story hinges upon the enactment and subsequent unintended consequences of several important pieces of U.S. gun control legislation and regulation: the National Firearms Act of 1934, the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, the Assault Weapons Importation Ban enacted by Presidential executive order in 1989 and the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.
Its thesis, as discussed in the Author's Note - A Warning and Disclaimer in the beginning of the book, is that enough bullying, by what is widely perceived as a hostile occupation government, will inevitably end in revolt if the occupied area is large enough and has a culture that is significantly different from the occupying state, and that this revolt will be undefeatable if the rebels use very low-tech ""leaderless resistance.""

Reception: 
The book is out of print in its hardcover form. The hardcover edition is available for used purchase. The novel has sold over 60,000 copies over four printings.[4] After having been out of print for several years, a paperback edition was reissued in June, 2013.[5]The author's web site states that he is working on a shorter sequel that was originally scheduled for publication in 2006. However, this sequel has not yet been released.[6]

Timothy McVeigh controversy:
Timothy McVeigh read the novel while awaiting his trial for the Oklahoma City bombing. He loved the book, and noted that if it had come out a few years earlier, he would have given serious consideration to using sniper attacks in a war of attrition against the government instead of bombing a federal building:[7] If people say The Turner Diaries was my Bible, Unintended Consequences would be my New Testament. I think Unintended Consequences is a better book. It might have changed my whole plan of operation if I'd read that one first.	”

John Ross has posted a response to Timothy McVeigh's comments on his website:[4]“	First of all, authors have no control over who decides to admire their work. Remember that when the FBI searched Unabomber Ted Kaczynski’s shack (after his brother turned him in), they found only a handful of personal items and just a single, well-read book. What was the one title that the Unabomber felt was so important it was his only reading material? Earth in the Balance, by Al Gore.

Less than 500 Miles. Clean Title. I would still consider this a prodject bike though. 
All six gears work, the choke cable does need adjustment. It could use a new boot, I have duct tape covering a tear currently. There is an air leak somewhere, either the carb or crank shaft (my guess is the carb could use new seals) . This leak causes the bike to ""disel"" when you down shift. this can easily be corrected by pushing the choke while riding. 

Thats all the negatives.
The bike does have a new battery. The chain is in great condition, and well lubed. The brakes are good, but could probably be improved. See the photos for overall cosmetic condition. All lights and horn operate correctly. Ok for Street riding.

The Anderson Rifle is The World’s Only NO LUBE Rifle.
The Anderson Rifle is the only rifle in the world that never requires lubrication. It is only possible because it is permanently treated with RF85, the nano technology that injects calcium into the molecular fabric of the metal. RF85 is permanent. It is IN the metal. RF85 reduces friction 85% and wears with the metal. Under heat and pressure the calcium nano particles elongate and form a protective barrier that eliminates the need for lubrication."

Very hard to find as these are no longer made.  

This is the heavier barrel for competition accuracy - not some cheap bushmaster carbon 15. This is chambered and stamped both .223 and 5.56NATO

I bought this a few year ago from a guy who still had it new in the original box.  I've taken it out of the box but never fired it.  I did upgrade a few items, but this is a close to brand new as you can get!  It comes with the original cleaning kit that's never been opened as well as built in storage compartment in the stock of the gun.  

As you can see this comes with all of the original parts and accessories and the box.  In addition I've installed a front grip, folding expandable bipod, and aluminum quadrail.  The grip allows for added battery powered accessories like a light or laser and the on/off can be integrated in to the handle.  

This comes with the 2 original Colt branded ar-15 magazines, and I'll also include a brand new windowed MAGPUL 30rd magazine.

Even the little red zip tie that came with it as a chamber indicator. The one thing I've done to it is added a 'Techna clip' which (easily removeable) makes this an even better conceal carry gun. I've kept it clean and taken good care of it, but recently this gun is spending more time in the safe than it should. Round count is at most one thousand, and that's from me maintaining my proficiency with a couple magazines of ammo about every month. I've had it for 3 years. Figure ~ 25 rounds a month. 1,000 may seem like 'a lot' to some people, but to put it in perspective; I've blown thru 300 rounds in one day at steel challenge matches with my M&P. That's why I have a 1911 and an M&P for shooting events and OWB carry.

This is the smallest and lightest conceal carry gun I can comfortably practice with and accurately shoot. Ballistics aside, I can not hold onto those tiny pea-shooting .380's. 
The thumb safety, gun lock and the in-frame lock (deactivates the trigger bar) make it easy to keep this gun safe and secure
