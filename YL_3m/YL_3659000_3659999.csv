In the package:

1.Serbu BFG-50™
Caliber: .50 BMG
Action: Single-Shot
Length: 51.5"" standard barrel
Weight: 22 lbs
Barrel: Match grade alloy steel, 1:15 twist, 29.5"", custom taper
Muzzle Brake: Highly Effective ""Shark Brake"".
Fire Control: AR-15 trigger and safety, custom hammer, spring-loaded firing pin. Average trigger pull is 4.0 lbs
Scope Mount: Screwed-on Picatinny rail 30MOA base.
Bipod: Custom BFG-50™ bipod
Finish: Parkerized (manganese phosphate)

The BFG-50™ is constructed using the most modern manufacturing methods and is made from the highest quality MIL-spec alloy steels. In continuous production since 1999, the BFG-50™ was Mark Serbu's first rifle design. It has been thoroughly proven with over 2000 rifles delivered. While the price of this gun is incredibly reasonable, the low quality that one usually expects with a low price is not a fact of life with the BFG-50™. How can this be done? Low overhead, and a design that's optimized for manufacturability as well as performance and quality. The BFG-50™ is a perfect gun for the enthusiast who has always wanted to have a .50 BMG rifle, but doesn't want to spend $3,000+ to get one.

2. Serbu Monopod - This is a custom monopod that is attached to the butt stock. It's an accessory that allows you to make finite adjustment before pulling the trigger. Very easy to use and very effective in helping to hit your target at longer ranges.

3. Leupold VAR X-III 6.5x20-50mm Long Range Tactical Mil-Dot w/ US Tactical 30mm Scope rings and integrated piccatinny rail

Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold® optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association – men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more – rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes. See overview of each product for more detailed information on hunting, shooting, and competition applications.

These handy pistols are based on the full-size USP models and combine compact size with optimum shooting performance.

Smaller and lighter than large frame USPs, the reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact designs that use a ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of magazines between an extended or flush-fitting magazine, making the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing conceal-ability.

Designed with a modified link-less Browning-type action, the USP compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a safe, reliable, accurate, and concealable pistol.

Between November 1 and December 31, 2014 there is a $200 rebate available from HK!

This barreled action has the right balance for offhand shooting and is as steady as can be from the bench. It starts with a CNC-machined stainless steel receiver. This receiver features an integral Picatinny rail and is threaded to accept the stainless steel barrel of your choice. The stainless steel receiver helps achieve that delicate balance that shooters are always looking for. It features all CNC-machined and wire-EDM components as we feel this is essential in building the best semi-auto rimfire rifle available. The CNC-machined bolt includes a titanium round firing pin, tuned extractor and are black nitride coated for improved performance and function. The stainless barrels can be configured in a variety of fluting patterns and the muzzle can be threaded 1/2 × 28 and fitted with one of the many compensators available. Their TG2000 trigger guard is standard on all of our barreled actions and gives the shooter a crisp, clean 2lb trigger pull. It is set up to allow for pinpoint accuracy off a bench but still be a safe, reliable trigger in the field. It has always been their goal to achieve bolt action accuracy from a semi-auto and this begins with the barrel. Volquartsen's stainless steel barrels feature match bore and chamber tolerances. These dimensions are proprietary to Volquartsen and have evolved from over 25 years of testing. Digital gauging equipment ensures that each barrel meets our stringent criteria.

I want you to take that into consideration for this midterm election on Tuesday Nov. 4th.

Why was there such an issue for shooters and sportsmen to find guns and ammo at reasonable prices? It was because there was a specific party, Democrats, that were fighting to pass into law restrictions that would deteriorate our second amendment rights.

And for all those shooters and sportsmen out there that are thinking that wouldn't happen in WI, well it could if the Democrats held the majority in our state's politics.

Chiappa Rhino 357 model 200DS comes with factory leather holster, fiber optic front sight, case and paperwork. 
The Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment."

This is a great .22 revolver that far surpasses the quality fit and finish of most any modern .22. I'm pricing it right due to the re-blue .

This is a CZ SP01 completely run through by the CZ Custom Shop. 

The CZ SP-01 ACCU Shadow Custom is a competition-ready USPSA Production Division pistol, with some significant upgrades from the already great SP01 Shadow. Let’s talk about the difference

The new barrel bushing is threaded into the slide; the bushing is fitted to the barrel creating far less play than the current bushing system. The bushing also retains the new stainless steel guide plug. Ransom Rest testing at 50 yards with Fiocchi 125 JHP (A ZERO bullet) has proved group of less than 3” compared with a factory new gun at about 5.0”. At 25 yards the groups were around 1.2” a one-hole group. Very impressive!

What’s new and very exciting is the CZC SHRT reset trigger system. People have been asking for a shorter faster reset without the trigger swinging all the way forward in SA mode, now we have it.
The CZ Custom Shop has also taken almost all of the forward movement out of the single action position with the trigger moving on average less than a 1/16 (0.0625”) before stopping. They have basically created a 1911 single action on a double action gun.

Here are some more of the features included in this Custom Version of the SP01 ACCU Shadow:
• Shadow Competition Rear Sight CZ

• Fiber Optic Front Sight

• CZ Custom SA DA Hammer & Main Spring Drop in Pr B Short Reset / Swing forward Disconnector (NEW 2014) Ext Firing Pin, Lighter Spring Pin Spring (NEW 2014)

• Stainless Steel Guide Rod

• Tune Trigger Components (Reduces Single and Double action trigger pull)

• Installed and Tuned 13lb Main Spring and 11lb Recoil Spring

• Polished Disconnector and associated surfaces.

• Profiled Slide Stop For Magazine release with Heavy / Long Bullets

•Thin Black Aluminum Grips

•Includes (3) 18 round 9mm magazines.

•Reliability Check. Zero Check with Factory Ammunition

The spring has been replaced with a stiffer, stronger spring for a smoother eject and reload action. The piece is very clean and all the work was done by a professional gunsmith to insure accuracy and integrity of this firearm. The reason the piece was reworked is because it was going to be used in match target completion, but due to medical reasons was not. This pistol is AMT's attempt to copy the Colt 1911.

The receiver is blue steel, the barrel bore is bright with no pits and the action is in excellent condition. There are no plastic or MIM parts used on this gun (unlike the Express model). It was built to last with an action smooth-as-silk. The 870 POLICE MAGNUM has these improved characteristics: An aluminum trigger group as opposed to the plastic one used in the Express models. An old style magazine retention system. A much smoother finish inside and out with minimal machine marks or burrs. The Police gun receives a higher level of inspection and finishing and is built in a special area of the plant from 100% inspected parts. It has a one piece barrel and the bore was polished. Heavy-duty trigger / sear spring. Heavy-duty shell lifter spring. The barrel is locked down with a ""ball detent"" system (as opposed to the lesser grade ""synthetic magazine spring retainer"" lock down used in the Express models). A milled extractor (as opposed to the MIM extractor used in the Express models). Remington builds these guns specifically for law enforcement and military use. They have to be 100% reliable and able to withstand the toughest of field conditions. For these reasons, the 870 POLICE MAGNUM was built to the highest standard for endurance and reliability.

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing.(includes rifle, HK 30-round steel magazine, set of HK diopter sights, HK multi-tool, lock, and case)."

Stainless Steel Frame with a Blue Steel Slide and Rubber Grips.  10 + 1 gun. 
EAA Tactiacal Elite, model #D.E.A., made in Italy!

Gun has an oversize Beaver-Tail on the grip frame for a very comfortable & controlable purchase.  Sights are 3-dot target type, fully adjustable for windage & elevation.  Both front & rear are on dove-tails so they can be drifted off of slide to change to something else if desired.  Also, there are both front & rear cocking serrations on slide as an added plus.

Included with gun is one 10 round magazine, plastic carrying case & cable lock.  An insturction booklet can be obtained from the company or downloaded from the Net.
Don't let this one get away, the quality & condition of this piece is outstanding and this model is no longer being made!
When I registered this gun for the warranty, they sent me a sheet indicating this gun was one of a 'special run' that was never completed & delivered.  That means there are very few of this exact model ever made or in circulation anywhere!  You will probably not be able to find this exact model anywhere, let alone in this condition.  

This gun is in excellent condition w/very little use on it, it has spent the last seven years in a safe, unfired or used.  This is an excellent gun for both target shooting as well as defensive purposes.  It is 'very' accurate, double/single action and hi-capacity of 10+1.

I am located in Horseshoe Bend = N.C. Arkansas.  I will travel a reasonable distance to conclude sale to a serious buyer.  I can also ship gun to any FFL holder or dealer in the U.S., buyer to pay 'only actual' cost of shipping.  IL residents need a FOID card.

Any questions...please drop me an email or call REDACTED  If you're looking for a great all around 45 that you will be happy with & proud of for many years to come, this is it!  This would make a wonderful addition to any 45 buff's collection.  And don't forget, Christmas is just around the corner.

explination i found online about the 360j

That is a model 360J, they've made a coupe of runs of them, the first one a few years ago. Scandium frame, steel cylinder (carbon steel originally, I'm told they have stainless cylinders now), a plain Jane no frills, lower cost, .38spl version of the M&P 360. Lots of speculation out there on the origin of this model but I don't think anyone knows for sure and S&W isn't saying. They're great guns, very solid, they weigh a couple of ounces less than the 637 Airweight. I bought mine in 2009 for a 9mm customization project and have been very happy with it, carry it almost everyday, it has held up extremely well."

The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

Do you find yourself regularly fending off unstoppable robot hordes? 

This is the lightest weight production 50.bmg rifle on the market. This isn't a Hess or some other bargain basement rifle that will explode because its made of melted geo metros in some clowns basement. Serbu has been building these rifles for a long time and the craftsmanship reflects that. The action is smooth as butter and the gun takes down easily for cleaning. 

This rifle has a 22"" barrel with Serbus advanced muzzle break. This allows easy movement with the rifle (it weighs in at 17 lbs, the same as my remington 700 setup).

Plus you can rapidly engage pesky robots at close range that pop out of closets, cars, and hovercraft. Despite the short length of this maneuverable mash-up of overkill and CQM, it has little felt recoil. Of the 60 rounds through this gun, almost twenty were standing from the shoulder - fired doing typical Army ready up drills at 100m like an MRAP slaying boss. Send along a cell phone number and I will text a video of me firing it. Its great.

Comes with a heavy duty M60 sled bipod, SWFA Super Sniper Scope Rings with red dot top rail.

Comes in a rugged wheeled locking case (Pelican 1750, 350 bucks) and has custom Kaizen foam inside of it that I will include (100 value) 

Rifle comes with four loose 50 cal rounds, including armor piercing and an incendiary armor piercing for those robot mini-boss' that regular stuff cant handle. 

I've also got significant quantities of additional ammo. That stuff is expensive, but I can be persuaded to part with it if the money is right. The price of the stuff is not negotiable.

Selling a freshly built AK47. If you are a AK purist, move on.  If you are looking for a wicked AK, read on- 
Here is the story....
I started with a MAK-90 parts kit, bought down at Knob Creek. Looked around for the best possible heat treated US made receiver for the Chinese parts. Stumbled across a company called My Guns Northwest out of Talent Oregon. The owner Matt Yeamens, is the only guy in the country (to my knowledge) that builds and sells awesome quality, pre manufactured, 1.5mm thick US replacement receivers for Chinese builds. After doing my homework, it turns out that Matt is a renowned AK builder and one of the best in the country. So, needless to say, I found my builder for the project. I bought a 20"" Green Mountain rifled barrel blank, a few tasteful Tapco parts, got my stuff together and sent it off to Matt, to have him build me a killer AK. Before I sent my parts, I stumbled across Sabrewerks 13. A company that builds the best scope mounts for AK's, PSL's, RPK's, etc. After speaking with the owner, I decided on the PSL/RPK scope mount and rail because it was designed for a heavier barrel, which in turn allowed Matt to do the heavy barrel build. This mount is pressed and pinned onto the barrel and is the absolute most solid mount I've ever seen. And It should be for $250! I had Matt thread the muzzle concentrically to the bore & with 5/8x24 RH threads for standard .30 cal US muzzle accessories. Has the Tapco G2 trigger. Got the gun back and had Andy Morris of AM Custom Firearms do the matte black cerra-kote. He did an excellent job. I literally have over $1300 into this build and it runs strong and looks beautiful. Test fired for function check only.
