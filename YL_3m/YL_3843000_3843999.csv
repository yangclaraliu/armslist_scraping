I have shot 180 rounds of Federal Gold Medal Match ammo through it and have the brass and boxes that I will include in the sale.  This gun was shooting an average of about 1.125"" before the above work was done and now averages about .92"" with the FGMM ammo.  Again that is my average, you could be better or worse.  These tests were done while firing 5, three round groupings.  I have lost my long range shooting property and have no desire to lug around this heavy rifle for deer season so it is for sale.  The rifle is in great shape the only cosmetic issue is some discoloration from where I had my picatinny rail on it (loctite and bluing don't mix).  If that is a concern I can send a pic to show you.  It does not impact performance and would be covered up by any one piece rail.  I have the original box, x-mark trigger, empty brass and a 9-13"" swivel bipod that I will include for $700 OBO.

Stoeger M3000 semi-auto shotgun. It's the 24"" barrel that holds 9+1 shells in it. Shoots 100% flawless as I've put 150 shells of 3DRAM birdshot (Walmart Federal bulk pack), 50 shells of 00 & #4 buckshot, about 10 slugs through it, & 50 rounds of Walmart Federal #8 shot.



This is a very fun shotgun to shoot and is based off the Benelli M2 intertia-driven system. Much more reliable and cleaner than the gas/piston setups in the JM Pro, VersaMax, and other semi-auto shotguns. This is ready for 3-gun or other shotgun competitions - the same shotgun & setup as what Jesse Tischauser uses on the 3-Gun Nation pro circuit. I put a shot vid down below to show the shotgun in action.

Description

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger or .40 S&W calibers.



The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.



The 9mm SUB-2000 can be configured in the following magazine types: GLK17, GLK19, S&W59, BERETTA92,  SIG226."

These model 1871 rifles were very similar to the Model 1870 rifles, but differed in some details. Field experience with the Model 1870 showed that the mechanism jammed too easily in dusty conditions. Users also did not like loading the weapon at full cock. The Model 1871 included a locking bolt in the breech mechanism. The user pulled the hammer to the full cock position, retracted the breech block spur to expose the chamber, and inserted the cartridge. When the breech block closed, the hammer automatically fell to the half cock position, and the weapon could not be fired until the hammer was once again pulled to the full cock position.[6] Over 20,000 Model 1871 rifles were eventually purchased by the state of New York. The U.S. Army did not greet the Remingtons with much enthusiasm. Foreign sales of the weapon were much more successful. Denmark ordered many of the Model 1870 and 1871 rifles. In 1873, Spain ordered 50,000 Model 1871 rifles, which were delivered in 1875. Numerous other countries, such as France, Chile, Argentina, Cuba, Greece, and Puerto Rico also purchased this rifle.This is a Springfield Tower 1871 three ring musket is missing screw in front ring. Everything else looks to be there including rear flip up sights. All original with wood, bore and rifling in good shape."

Beautiful Monte Carlo Stock.  All blued. 

Getting rid of it as I got it to back yard plink...well long story short I wanted to get rid of a squirrel that was in our bird feeder saw this and it looked like a big game rifle which I liked.   after the hole was shot through the squirrel and both sides of the plexi on bird feeder and into the pool shed while I stood in awe under the gaze of disapproval  by my wife with the barrel I think actually smoking ??..The pissed off and traumatized wife made me go get something that wasn't going to destroy half the neighborhood.  I have been happy with my cheap 150 dollar plastic gammo and no longer need this air rifle that could be some lucky kids or adults.  it has been a safe queen which is hilarious for an air rifle.

It was around $220.00 is all and I grabbed the scope for about $40.00

I will trade for pretty much whatever. I have a CCW so if you have a little handgun great..throw something my way and take this beast off my hands..lol  I also have shotguns and some handguns for trade too if you want to multi trade for something else."

The 4566 is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It is constructed almost entirely from stainless steel and is thus extremely resistant to harsh weather conditions. The 4566 is a traditional double-action/single-action pistol. The first shot is fired in double action mode. Each subsequent shot is fired single action mode. It features one-piece Xenoy wrap-around grips with either a curved or straight back strap. The 4566 was produced from 1988 to 1999.
Like most 3rd generation Smith and Wesson semi automatic pistols, the 4566 features a combination safety lever and decocker mounted on the slide, a plunger type firing pin safety, a magazine disconnect and a pin mounted, pivoting spring actuated external extractor.
The Model 4566 is the Mid size version with a 41⁄4"" barrel on a full size steel frame.

This 4566 is in excellent condition. The only blemish are scuff marks near the ejection port.
It comes with 4 factory 8 rd magazines, a nice Don Hume holster and a hard case.

It is an amazing gun, super accurate it will come with 4 mags, original box, paper work etc. Second gun is a fnh fnx 9 with some work done to it, it has a polished barrel, feed ramp, and front slide rails. It also has night sights, 3 mags and a nice fn leather galco holster. These guns together WITH the work I have had done I have about 1550-1600$ in it, but fact of the matter is I know they are considered used, so trade value I feel 1350-1400 is reasonable. With that being said I can put cash with my two guns and that's something we can discuss how much through email. So if your interested send me an email and we can talk. Thanks"

Gooooood evening fellow gun nuts! This has been my EDC gun for 16 months now (it replaced my 1911 due to size constraints) but after running a couple of advanced courses with it, I can't employ (nor do I feel like I need, as a safety precaution) the long DAO trigger as well as I can my SA/DA or striker-fired pistols, so it's time for her to go.

If you prefer DAO for safety (pistol has no external safety) or simply like the feel better than SA or striker, you'll love this pistol. It's incredibly reliable (only two FTEs ever, running reloads. None with factory-loaded ammunition), as accurate as anyone could ever ask a compact DAO to be (once you get used to the trigger), and extremely concealable in almost any carry position. She's got around 650 rounds through her (mostly Speer 147gr and Federal 115gr) without any notable hiccups, and has been gently and properly broken in.

The only ""complaint"" I can speak of is that she IS NOT rated for +p or +p+ ammunition, so if you carry hot 124gr rounds, you might want to look into switching to the 147gr instead.

I will be purchasing another Gen3 Glock 19 (I gave my last one to my wife, who refuses to give it back after shooting it), so if anyone has one they would be interested in trading for I'm open to options. Beyond that, I'm not really interested in trades unless someone has an AR10 they want to trade for even-up. 

I run a training group, so if anyone is interested and would like to test-fire her just let me know, bring your own ammo, and you're welcome to try before you buy!

Thanks for looking!"
