Fantastic little pocket pistol easily comes out of a pocket with no snags. Sights are milled into the slide. No rust, and original blue. It has an awesome patina. Tool-less field-strip. The barrel/breach is part of the lower frame, and does not move with the slide… which actually makes it a pretty darn accurate little pistol. It also has some neat little import roll-stamps on the slide, chamber, and just behind the trigger. A cool little vintage piece that still shoots well!

Most ""pen guns"" fall into the legal category of ""any other weapon,"" and as such, must be registered. R.J. Braverman’s Stinger Pen Pistols, however, must be folded into a gun-like shape before firing, earning them a Title I designation from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (Title I firearms are just ordinary guns with no additional regulations imposed upon them).

These little pistols were produced in the early 1990’s and were chambered for .22 LR Rimfire, .22 Magnum Rimfire, .25 ACP, .32 ACP, and .380 ACP ammunition. They were just over 5 1/2 inches in length with a 2 inch barrel when folded. This example is in .380 which is the most rare and hard to even find one on auction sites.  This pen gun comes with original pouch and paperwork. Video of me shooting below as well as a GB link for one that went for almost 900 after shipping.

It's lightly used and has only had about 200 rounds through it with it on the rifle, bought new earlier this month. Does reduce recoil as intended, but I think I'd like to try something different. These work particularly well on ar pistols and help tame the recoil and muzzle rise (while throwing 5 foot fireballs out the side!). Will fit on any ar15 with standard threads or barrel with the same threads. Will come with two washers, I believe one is a peel and one is a crush, but they are used and I can not guarantee they will work on your rifle, so you may need to get a new one.

I'd like to trade for Magpul Pmags, I'd trade for 3 of them in 30 or 20 round versions. Might also trade for. 223/5.56 ammo, but would prefer mags.

I have had it since around 2007 or so. I've shot in maybe 30 times or so sighting it in and verifying its zero.  I got if off this older guy at a gun show not a vendor,  I traded a pistol for it and gave home a little cash.  The first two deer I shot with this dropped in their tracks.  One at 110 yards and the other at 145 yards. It has a sling, a 3x9 Busnell scope, the original mag and a spare mag, and a butt pad. This rifle is squared away all the way around. Got another rifle no need for this anymore. Not willing to trade or ship.  I have it sighted in at 1.5inches high at 100 yards and it likes 150 grain Horandy Interlock. This is a great package. Pretty firm on this price. This is a classic and is very nice. Will let go without the sling or scope for 425. This rifle was produced between 1978 and 1980 with a serial number around B705xxx."

The M2 hb had been used for decades by US military ground and naval forces. These guns are absolutely devastating at ranges exceeding 1 mile. For the civilian NFA collector and shooter, the M2 50 cal belt fed machine gun represents the maximum level of firepower one can acquire. Relatively few M2's were legally built and registered for civilian use prior to 1986. As a result these guns have continued to climb in price to levels once thought unlikely with no end in sight. This should be an excellent investment. The gun you are bidding on comes as shown and is a NEW unfired since build, Ramo MFG gun. According to the ATF paper work, this M2 is manufactured by Ramo Manufacturing. The caliber for this weapon is .50"

(Note the SN is obscured by paper, that is not a mark on the lower.)  This is a well made lower and I really like that you can swap out the trigger guard on this lower if you want a larger trigger guard for hunting.  I ordered it for a 300 BLACKOUT hog build, test fired the lower with a mag of 223 to verify functionality and put it away.  In the meantime I decided to just swap barrels with my other lowers when I want to hunt with the 300BLK upper and sell this to fund other builds.  This complete lower goes for about $255-$275 plus shipping and xfer fees, this saves you shipping and fees.

With extensive research on the form and function of the tactile-enhanced grip, the operator will find the design enhances control, while providing consistent hand placement. The flared magwell aids in fast and reliable reloads while the extended magazine base pad provides a secure grip during loading, handling and shooting the DB FS Nine. 

Diamondback has incorporated a trigger safety and firing pin block safety with a short, positive reset, minimizing trigger travel for faster cycle times. A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide.  Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user’s hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation. The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75” Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25” sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition."

* DA/SA.  I don't want double action only like a regular LCR or SW Bodyguard and I don't want single action only like a cowboy gun.
* I probably don't want a Charter, Rossi, or Armscor unless the price is very low - Taurus is about my floor for quality & those can be iffy so it will need to check out.  
* Does not need to be +P rated.  

I have cash in hand and a CCW.  If you would prefer to trade or partial trade I have lots of ammo, reloading supplies, bricks & bricks of .22, Nikon Monarch scopes, etc."

The Mil-Spec 4150 chrome moly vanadium steel barrel comes equipped with 1 in 7"" twist rifling, M4 feed ramps, a low profile steel gas block, and is finished inside and out with a protective black nitride treatment for superior durability and corrosion resistance. The muzzle is threaded with a 5/8""-24 pitch for easy installation of a silencer, and is topped off with an effective AAC 51T Blackout flash hider.

The upper features a forged M4-Style flat-top receiver onto which a Knight's Armament free floating URX 3.1 Quad Rail System is rigidly attached. The heat-treated, full auto bolt carrier is finished in a slick Nickel Boron coating, and comes equipped with a properly-staked gas key and Carpenter 158 steel bolt assembly.

This 16"" 300 Blackout upper utilizes the versatile carbine length gas system, a good choice for this cartridge if various weights and types of ammunition are to be used. Most subsonic and supersonic loads, fired from either a suppressed or unsuppressed gun, are compatible with this configuration. However, some subsonic ammunition may not always cycle reliably under adverse conditions or in a severely fouled firearm without a sound suppressor attached to provide extra backpressure.

Claw extractor, controlled feed (will chamber a round at any angle, including upside down). These are the go-to rifles for dangerous game hunting, and the Mauser 98 is arguably the strongest action out there. 

Forged receiver, all stainless bolt / shroud / firing pin. Hammer forged barrel. Fully adjustable trigger. Semi-beavertail Monte Carlo stock with satin finish (traditional oil finish, not polyurethane. Scratches are easy to fix).
Barrel floated and receiver bedded from the factory. These were considered semi-custom rifles.

The trigger is adjustable from around 10 pounds to under a pound. VERY nice trigger.

This rifle is in beautiful condition. Only VERY minor handling marks. I have scope bases to go with it.

$500

The P250, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (.380ACP, 9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size (subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from SIG SAUER."

The Magpul Battery Assist Device (B.A.D.) is an extended bolt release that allows the shooter to keep his hand in the ready position on the pistol grip and operate the bolt catch with the trigger finger. Streamlines bolt catch manipulation to get the weapon into battery more quickly for improved operator readiness and weapon handling efficiency. Easy to install and remove—no weapon disassembly required. The B.A.D. lever clamps securely to the factory bolt release with a Torx® head screw and extends a paddle through the front of the triggerguard to the right-hand side of the weapon. Trigger finger can stay outside the triggerguard as you operate the lever, and factory bolt catch retains normal function with B.A.D. installed. Made of a high-grade aluminum alloy, hardcoat anodized to MIL-A-8625F, Type III, Class 2 spec for extra strength and wear resistance."

For info on those items, please see the NAA website. For the Sidewinder, let's start with the basic specifications: • Part Number NAA-SW • Caliber: 22 WMR • Capacity: 5 • Barrel Length: 1 inch • Overall Length: 5 inches • Overall Height: 2-7/8 in. • Width: 1-1/16 in. • Weight Unloaded: 6.7 oz The single-action Sidewinder Mini Revolver, scheduled for introduction at NRA Annual Meetings & Exhibits, features a swing-out cylinder connected to a frame-mounted crane arm. The cylinder falls to the right side of the revolver when the cylinder pin is pulled forward to release it from the frame. With the cylinder to the side, the cylinder pin actuates an ejector star to eject spent cartridges. The addition of these new features to the Sidewinder has increased the weight of the revolver by only a fraction of an ounce in comparison to the standard .22 Mag. mini, but reloading will be a much faster and simpler process. The first Sidewinders off the line will be chambered for .22 Mag. only, but .22 Long Rifle conversion cylinder assemblies will not be far behind. The pre-production model is fitted with a 1 5/8-inch barrel, but the development team is working to make a shorter barrel available. Other features include a stainless-steel frame, laminated rosewood grips, a bead front sight and a newly developed cylinder shroud."

The CLAW® Sling System is widely known for having the best non-slip pad incorporated into a sling. The extremely durable and odor resistant pad is molded into the sling webbing to allow approximately 1/2” of stretch. This stretch spreads the weight of the firearm across the shoulderarea greatly increasing your comfort. The unique gripping action of the non-slip pad keeps the firearm in place on your shoulder, eliminating the tugging, rolling and pulling caused by other slings on the market.Hunting in extreme conditions this season? The CLAW® Sling will last as long as you do in anything from miserably hot to arctic cold weather conditions. The pad will remain flexible to -40 degrees fahrenheit and is U.V. stabilized to eliminate fading or cracking. The durable CLAW® Rifle Sling can be used with rifles, shotguns or any firearm with swivel studs mounted on the buttstock and barrel. As an added value, the CLAW® Rifle Sling includes HUSH STALKER II™ QD Metal Sling Swivels. Comfortable to use and easy to clean, the CLAW® Rifle Sling will not hold water like foam, urethane or leather slings."
