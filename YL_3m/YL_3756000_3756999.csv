This is not a beat up police trade in and it is in great shape for its age, probably around 90% cosmetic condition with the only wear worth mentioning being a very small amount of finish wear at the muzzle.  Excellent trigger and tight lockup and timing as these revolvers typically are.  Has the original S&W wood grips and a T grip adaptor for a better hand fit.

This is one of my absolute favorite handguns, but I far prefer the round butt configuration for carrying purposes.  I would be interested in trading for this same gun, a 3 inch Model 10 with a round butt in similar condition.  The only other trade I would consider would be for a S&W 686 with a 2.5-4 inch barrel, I have a TriStar C-100 in .40 that I can trade in addition for one.
Not interested in selling, I will keep it if the right gun doesn't come along.

This is a legit 9mm MP5 not that 22lr look alike. Made by Turner Fabrications who has been making MP5's for a long damn time, its the closest you will get to an Genuine HK MP5 without taking out a second Mortgage! Note, HK does not make MP5's anymore, they havent for awhile, finding one for sale is near impossible, and if you do it is going to cost a but load. This thing is in perfect condition and functions flawlessly.

$3000 cash FIRM or trades listed below. You will pay over $4,000 to buy all this new after its all said and done, Get mine and save $1,000.



So here it is:
-MP5, All parts German HK, minus the US made Receiver(LSC Manf.)!!!!! There is one NIB on Gunbroker right now being sold by Turner Fabrications for $3100(Gun and 1 Mag!), I'm asking $3000 for everything listed in this ad!!!

-Fluted Salt Nitrate barrel, Threaded 1/2x28 and 3-Lug for both types of suppressors.

-NAVY SEF trigger group/housing (this MP5 shoots Semi-Auto ONLY tho)

-Has a ""Action 3"" bolt group with F style bolt carrier, this means it will fire F/A with a NFA Registered F/A Trigger pack. These bolt groups are banned from further importation and cost about $1,000, check hkparts.net(SOLD OUT) to confirm for yourself. Couple this with a registered F/A Sear installed in a F/A pack and your ready to blast rounds. Obviously NFA Rules apply if you take this route, and it costs $$$.

-MFI Low Profile claw mount($130)

-3 Mags ($50 ea)

-Bushnell TRS Red Dot($100)

-Brand New Folding stock($140) in separate box, I was going to make this MP5 an SBR but spent money on a suppressor instead and just haven't done it yet. I probably will if I keep it, so get it while its a Non-NFA Weapon and SBR it yourself!

-Included in this ad is 1,000rnds of factory 9mm, most are American Eagle, some Remington and Winchester too($300 @ $0.30/rnd). The ammunition container pictured is one of my 9mm containers and contains 2,000 rounds which you will be getting half of. I will sell an additional 500rnds($150) or 1000rnds($300) if you want more. 

----Note, installing the Stock on this ""Pistol"" makes it a SBR(Short Barreled Rifle), which needs to be Registered with the NFA branch of the ATF. Do not install it without registering it first, you will be getting pounded by a big fat guy in prison if you do and get caught.


Serious offers only, do your research before making a Low Ball Offer, also have an offer ready when contacting me, please no emails like ""How much do you want for it"". All NC laws apply, meaning YES, you will need a Pistol Purchasing Permit OR Concealed Carry Permit, violation is a State AND Federal Crime.....

Brand new Smith & Wesson Shield. Bought this gun two months ago from a local FFL dealer. It's an August 2014 production gun. Unfired by me, or anyone else except from the factory. Comes from the factory with 2 mags (1-8rd, 1-7rd), factory box, spent casing, security lock, and owner's manual. Plus, I'll throw in an extra brand new factory 8rd magazine (cost me $35), and a brand new Tagua IWB/OWB leather holster with the deal. In addition, I installed Talon grips (two of the mags has matching Talon grips trim on it, pictured). Talon grips are excellent as you know. This gun is absolutely brand new. 

Second gun:

Brand new Kahr CW9. Unfired by me except from the factory. Comes with one factory magazine, box, papers, owner's manual. In addition, I'll throw in a like new Galco leather belt/hip holster (pictured). This is a really nice gun. And there are plenty of excellent reviews on the internet on this particular gun. 

Must be at least 21 years old, or older and be a Kentucky resident, and have a valid Kentucky driver's license to trade both guns.  KY CCWL preferred. Local deal/trade only. No out of state shipping.

Both guns for trade only (will not reply to cash offers). Trade value around $1,000. No low ball, or BS please. Got over $1,000 invested on both guns and extras. Package deal/trade only. Will not separate guns, mags, holsters, and ammo. Please don't ask. Deal includes 620 rounds of assorted ammo, two leather holsters, and two gun cases. I like both guns a lot, but I want something else. Especially an Arsenal or Saiga AK-47/74 guns.

I have had this gun for a few years now, I just don't shoot it enough and I would like to sell it. It has about 1000 rounds of 40 through it and 600 rounds of 9mm through it. The gun is in great shape still. I am looking to sell this as a package deal and it is quite versatile with the caliber conversion. The RTF2 grip texture is nice and aggressive and is a rare grip pattern to find to have on a glock from factory. Blue label glock.

The PT22 is a steel frame and slide, manufactured in the USA. It has a spur-less hammer, and a long but smooth double action only (DAO) trigger. 
Something these little Taurus pistols have been praised for is the tip-up barrel design. What looks something like a slide release on the left side of the gun is actually a barrel release. Press it forward and the rear of the barrel pops up for loading a round directly into the chamber.  There is no need to rack the slide, which is a benefit to those who, because of arthritis or other hand weakness, are unable to operate conventional auto pistols.  Very accurate for its size with almost no felt recoil.

Comes LNIB with everything it came with from the factory.

Import-banned.

I am in Northwest Houston / Spring, and I will not travel far to show this. You can travel from wherever you want  in the state, but PLEASE figure out in ADVANCE where Spring, TX is, and decide if that is an acceptable distance to you BEFORE asking for a time and place to meet with me.

I will consider selling to a genuine, eligible adult. You must be able to legally own a firearm, show state photo ID, and fill out bill of sale. I will ask for a photo or scan of TDL before meeting up with you. I will meet in a public place where security cameras are present, and where law enforcement is not far.

 This is not a gunsmith-special or a wall-hanger; it is a new-in-box, never-fired (unless factory-tested), recently-imported (recent year) recognized item. You can read all you want online, and window-shop at some local stores if you really want to look it over, handle, drool, dream, and think about it. I don't want to devote half-hours here and there to people who just want to see one.

If you seem funny or shady, I will simply give up on the possible deal. Individual-to-individual sales in Texas can only be to the eventual, intended, legal owner. If you are trying to buy one of these for a non-eligible friend, or as a gift for a family member, you will have to go elsewhere. Please understand I am just trying to carry out a decent, legitimate, legal deal.

If you are seriously interested and legally eligible to buy, I am a decent person to work with.

Many love the semi-auto shotgun idea, but found the modest-price Saigas to be too much trouble to get working well; those are noted to not be reliable, and to have difficulty with lighter loads. Once the VEPRS were imported, this solved everyone's problems. The VEPR is overall a nicer, more well-constructed firearm.

Reviews say it reliably shoots out of the box, including lighter loads.

I got one of these that was imported before the ban kicked in. Now, they are nowhere. If you find them being sold retail, they are expensive, since they are so rare and no one knows when the ban might be lifted, and how long it might take for any new shipment to reach our shores.

The folding stock is welded in place in order to keep this in the legal ""sporting"" category, rather than the ""semi-auto assault"" category. Most reputable sources say that if you replace six parts on these VEPRs with USA-made parts, you will have ten or fewer imported parts, and so you can go ahead and cut the weld in order to have a folding stock.

This possibility is there, but it is up to you and the law. THANKS!

From Sig's Website:

New from SIG SAUER®, the P238 SAS. The pistol has gone through a radical dehorning process resulting in an ultra smooth, snag free profile that’s ideal for concealed carry. It’s just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 SAS is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with custom wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights. The new SIG SAUER P238 SAS is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine.

This is a Colt Match Target Comp. model AR. It has had maybe 60 rounds through it, if that. I bought it new, sighted it in with iron sights then put this scope on it, cleaned it and put it in my safe. The only reason I am selling it is that I just dont have the time to shoot it anymore. This is an incredibly accurate AR and this platform is used often in the Camp Perry National matches. It comes with the bi-pod, 20 rounds of M193 ball .556 ammo, one 20 round Brownells mag and one brand new Magpul 30 rounder. The scope is 3 x 9 x 40 variable magnification and it is made by Leapers. It has illuminated reticle in red or green with mil dots. Although I never got a chance to shoot it with this scope, im sure it would no doubt wring out more impressive accuracy than it had with the iron sights. Although primarily designed for competition it would also make a great varmint rifle. The barrel is chrome lined 20 inch and is 1/9 twist. (about 21 inches with the competition comp on it)  I'm not really looking for a trade but you never know, just let me know what you have to trade on if your interested. Thanks for looking!

The tubular magazine is extra easy and fast to load, especially with the magazine tube lock that securely snaps the tube in place. The three position hammer operation is time tested and operates exactly as you expect, and are used to, on the best lever-actions.

It is almost brand new (about three months old) and has had only 60 rounds fired out of it. It comes with the following equipment:

- 16"" M4 profile barrel (I forget who makes it)
- 13"" UTG PRO SlimRail (full picatinny rail on top, with modular attachment points on all sides for rail sections)
- 3 2"" picatinny rail sections that attach to the UTG slim rail 
- Magpul MVG (Moe Vertical Grip)
- Aero Precision upper and lower receiver
- Offbrand grip with storage compartment inside
- Magpul CTR collapsible M4 stock  
- Single-point sling attachment base-plate 

The rifle is in great shape and fires smoothly. It was built by professionals at Area 51 Tactical, so no hack jobs or garage wonders here. It's a solid rifle. 

Rifle comes with the following in accessories/gear:

- 360 rounds of ammo (mixed American Eagle .223 and Independence 5.56)
- One Magpul Gen2 Pmag
- Four aluminum GI mags 
- NcStar Mk III tactical scope (fixed 4x zoom, adjustable focus, quick-detach mount, green and blue illuminated mil-dot reticle)
- NcStar Heads Up Reflex sight (multiple reticle version)

I paid $850 for the rifle alone. The scope is $95 brand new, and the reflex sight is $30. The mags are worth about $35 collectively. The ammo I'm pricing at $7 a box, which is a steal (the American Eagle is usually $7.99 a box and the Independence is $8.99). That leads us to a grand total of $1,130 or so. 

I'm asking $950 for the whole package, or $850 for just the rifle, mags and optics (no ammo). The rifle is in great shape and is well worth that. It has a lot of customizability in it and is very accurate. I've just come to realize that I am not an AR guy.

It has a small bit of wear on the grip o the stock, a few scratches here and there from being carried through many miles of brush. It's a great gun, functions fantastically and shoots like new. This gun has never let me down.
