Asking $500 or I can add cash for an AR.

I have a S&W Bodyguard .38+P. It was originally bought from Bass Pro by the previous owner. She shot one round and decided she wanted a smaller caliber. I have shot about 15 rounds through it. I am really a single action guy, not a revolver guy. I did dress this one up to keep however because it is so light and easy to carry, but I would consider selling/trading it to get something else. 

I have installed a XS Trijicon Night Sight (big dot) that really improves accuracy and target acquisition. It is new and glows bright. I have also installed a Hogue Tamer grip made for the Bodyguard that allows for a full hand grip but it still is light and can fit in the front pocket of my jeans no problem. It had a huge impact on accuracy because the factory grip would twist in my hand, this one does not. I do not use the laser, but it is sighted in perfectly. This is a great, lightweight, dependable, and accurate self defense CC gun.

If you want to see this revolver in action, this guy does great reviews and he has this gun with the same additions in this review. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp82Hkk1MQk

191,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3976191,For Sale:  Smith & Wesson .45 ACP model 457 Compact Lightweight 3 3/4 inch Matte Blue 3 Safeties Syracuse NY PD,"Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 419,"Listed On: Thursday, November 12, 2015",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"OUR # HG104804U Photo specimen is representative, but buyer will receive a very similar pistol from the same Department. This listing is for ONE pistol; dealers, law enforcement, and collectors, however, may take any number of very similar model 457s we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. After 6 years of success with its 4516 Compact, Smith & Wesson introduced its first alloy frame Compact in 1996, the Value Series Compact .45 ACP, numbered model 457. SKU was 104804. The 457S and the lightweight 4513 TSW followed only in 2003. The few of us who have owned a 4513 or 4516 will notice the relatively squared slide edges on the model 457, and its black polymer dovetailed 3 dot combat sights. Construction is Carbon Steel slide with matte blue finish; and black anodized alloy frame. Barrel is 3 3/4 inch satin stainless with the distinctive muzzle collar that has always produced the 4500 series accuracy. This Pistol is traditional double action; from a resting hammer with safety on fire position, first shot is a long smooth double action pull, and the pistol goes to short pull single action after the first shot because the hammer stands cocked until the shooter disengages by throwing the safety lever, which part also serves as a decocker. This pistol also has a firing pin safety to guard against accidental discharge if it is dropped; and a magazine safety so that it cannot fire unless the magazine is in battery. Magazine capacity is 7+1, total 8 shot capacity of .45 ACP caliber ammunition. Hammer is .260 smooth surface factory bobbed, and trigger is .305 smooth faced combat type. Weight empty is 29 ounces; slide thickness measures only .975 inch. Overall length is 7 inches from the muzzle to the end of the grip frame strut; and height is 5 3/8 inches from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the magazine floorplate. Grips are original factory issue black polymer. Surface detractions are moderate, principally edge whitening and light streaking, with contact scouring on the grips. We classify these pistols as Very Good, 75 to 80 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our finish grading. These are well maintained pistols; Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. We estimate it has been fired no more than 1,000 rounds during its tour of duty, no rounds at all for a 4500 series Smith & Wesson. From their VDM to VYL serial number prefixes, these pistols were probably manufactured in 1997, and they served and protected with the Officers of the Syracuse NY Police Department, issued during Chief James T. Foody’s tenure, and serving until Chief Fowler oversaw the transition to the new M&P .40s from Smith & Wesson early in 2013. Replacement pricing on the latest produced variant of this series, the 4513TSW, approached $900 when it was still in production. We’re offering the model 457 in the photos, however, or one of its very similar mates for only $ 419.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California or the District of Colombia.

Dealers, Law Enforcement and collectors may take any number of very similar pistols that we have on hand, at the same per-pistol price and with no additional shipping charges. From a joint effort between the two greatest companies in our industry comes this cutting-edge, state of the art, Smith & Wesson model 99QA chambered in the popular and effective .40 S&W Caliber. Smith & Wesson Factory Number is 320219, a law enforcement sku. This particular piece served with the Springfield Massachusetts Police Department, so it helped provide security for the Smith & Wesson factory itself. The Springfield Home Boys and Girls on the PD liked the SW99QA’s unique sear system that allows a short, Quick-Action trigger pull that gauges in the 10 pound neighborhood. Frame assembly, manufactured by Walther, is high impact polymer with sure-gripping serrations and textured contours. Frame has integral Picatinny / Weaver slots for light accessory use. Sights are readily visible three-dot, low profile Night Sights with windage adjustable rear. We rate their luminosity at 60 percent of original strength from our dark room inspection. Slide is black stainless with XSE type serrations fore and aft. Mechanism is locked breech type with internal firing pin block to guard against accidental discharge if the weapon is dropped. Manufactured by Smith & Wesson, the stainless barrel is 4 inch Service Size; extreme overall length is 7 inches; maximum height is 5 1/2 inches; maximum thickness is 1.15 inches at the disassembly bar, but the grip part of the frame is only 1 inch thick. Note that the mainspring housings / backstrap parts can be easily replaced to allow shooters to adjust the contour of the grip frame. This is an amazingly good feeling, well balanced .40 S&W pistol. It is furnished with two original Law Enforcement issue blue steel bodied 12 shot magazines, sometimes Law Enforcement marked from the ban period, not an issue in most jurisdictions since the Brady Ban sunset in 2004. From its SAD serial number prefix it was manufactured in 2002. Surface wear is minimal; mainly, scouring on the slide release lever, faint whitening to the edges of the sights and slide, and moderate scouring on the sides of the grip frame. We rate it as a strong Very Good, perhaps even Excellent, specimen finishwise, since no more than 10 to 20 percent of its surfaces are affected by any kind of contact evidence by our estimate. High marks to Springfield PD for their careful weapons maintenance. This pistol comes in an original issue factory blue Smith & Wesson box with instruction manual. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. Photos, at any rate, should suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Last wholesale price on the 99QA series was $600 vicinity. Standard 99 Walthers with night sights are similarly priced, and just as scarce. We’re offering the very attractive Springfield Domiciled P99QA .40 in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates for only $ 319.00 For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 12 shot magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement only, add $ 15 to sub One [instead of 2] new 10 round mag [until we run out], or $15 off with no magazines.

The front site is factory but I've put tritium night sites on the back.  There is a blemish on the front where I had the factory front site reinstalled.  I've taken a closeup so you can see it.  I've fired every type of 45 round you can think of through it and it's worked perfectly.  I'm starting to think you can load it with rocks. ;-)  I guess that's why folks love 1911s.

Dealers, collectors, and law enforcement may take any number of virtually identical 461s we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. Any ammunition showing in our photos is Not Included. Most of the Rossis we sold in the 1960s were model 31 series; there were only a few of the medium frame model 51s that came through. While the Brazilians used Smith & Wesson Hand Ejector milling equipment during that period, and their mechanical designs were close to Smith & Wessons, the model 51 had a Colt Influence as well. This descendant of the model 51 is close to the Colt D frame Detective Specials of the late 1960s and early 1970s, with 6 shot cylinder and shrouded ejector rod. Here is the model R461 that is .357 Magnum capable. Manufacturer is Amadeo Rossi of Sao Leopoldo, Brazil, a Taurus affiliate; this .38 is marked Made In Brazil By Taurus on the right side of its frame. Type is double action only revolver. The hammer does not stand in a cocked position. Construction is entirely blue steel with the exception of the hardened stainless steel hammer nose firing pin and rivet. Frame is D Size small frame, with Round Butt Grip frame and 3 screw side plate. Barrel is 2 inch heavy full lug type, with matte finish verticals and barrel-integral serrated blade front sight. Rear sight is frame integral fixed notch. Cylinder capacity is 6 rounds of .357 Remington Magnum and .38 Smith & Wesson Special calibers. Note the cylinder yoke’s detent latch, a Taurus inspired mechanical improvement that prevents cylinder wobble. Trigger is .380 smooth faced combat semi-target, with factory bobbed .265 smooth hammer. Weight empty is a well balanced 23 1/2 ounces with center of gravity at the trigger. Double action trigger pull is smooth and consistent, 10 pound vicinity. Safety system consists of a transfer bar that prevents the firing pin from touching a cartridge primer unless the trigger is fully depressed, and also Taurus’s innovative internal hammer lock. Note that we have installed a set of Sile Italian Walnut Banana Style Grips for Smith & Wesson J Frame Round Butt, modified and fitted to this Rossi. The Siles were production mates to the ones still found on many Smith & Wessson J and Colt D frame revolvers manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s. Note that an H.K.S. DSA Speedloader Will Not clear the left panel’s recess. From their serial number prefixes, these 461s were manufactured in 2012 or 2013. This revolver is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or showgirl from Firearms Industry trade shows like the annual SHOT show held in Las Vegas. Serial number’s X prefix designates it as such. It is in its original overlabeled factory box with instruction manual, two keys for its hammer lock and its never executed factory registration card. Note that the box top is labeled, Factory Reconditioned. This simply means that if this Rossi develops mechanical problems, Braztech will repair it at no charge, but they will not give a freebie refinish. It does not need any refinish anyway. Surface detractions are negligible, only faint occasional edge whitening and cylinder rotation marking. We rate this R461 as Excellent in Box, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. The only comparable Blue Steel 2 inch 6 shot revolver on the market is the Taurus 605 series, with their prices usually approaching $500 per unit; and two times that for a Colt Detective Special. We’re offering the Rossi R461 Blue 2 inch in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates for only $ 269.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California or Massachusetts.

It has the sig night sights, magwell, front strap checkering, and crimson trace laser grips. It is an excellent conceal carry gun with all the stuff you need and still light enough to carry. She has no issues how ever she does not like any cheap steel cased ammo at all, no problems with any off the brass or hollow points I've used. The battery for laser grips have just been replaced.
We have put close to 400 rounds thru it and it shoots great, I don't consider it to even be broken in yet and still in excellent shape, being a Cabela's gun you know it was pretty pricey to begin with retailing for over 1300.00. All things considered I believe 850 is a fair price  If you are interested in it please call or text Matt at REDACTED thanks.  MO residents, ftf, and b.o.s. ccw preffered."

The Gun comes with (8) G36 Magazines, (1) AR-15 Magwell, (1) HK Multi-tool, and (1) HK Rifle Bag.  This rifle is 922r compliant and comes with the list of US made parts.  For my asking price you can't even buy all the components to assemble this gun yet alone get the labor done to build it.  Gun is ready to take out and fire today don't waste countless months trying to gather all of these materials for a build.

The overall length of the rifle with the stock folded is 27 inches, the barrel is 16 inches and is stamped ""ii 1u"", the length of the rifle with stock un-folded is 36.5 inches.  All the components have been professionally dyed black and match, unlike many of the conversions you see where they are simply painted black.

I have lots of additional pictures that I can send upon request.  Only 200 rounds fired on this build, additonal pics have close ups of the bolt and carrier group which look almost brand new. Avoid transfer fees, shipping fees, and possible taxes, buy local!  Feel free to call with questions REDACTED.

Multiple people have offered $3000 for this setup.  I will sell the rifle for $3k, but that sale price would be just the rifle and two magazines.  The 3k price would not include the dual-optic, 6 additional magazines, the multi-tool, the AR-15 mag well, or the range bag.

Barrel length is 19 inch 1:9 six groove right hand chrome lined bore and chamber, and overall length is 37.4 inches. Stock, receiver and forend material are black polymer with aperture or peep rear sight, conventional military style adjustable post front sight, and picatinny integral rail for easy scope mounting. All internal working parts are steel, of course, and so is the barrel and gas tube. It comes with two polymer 10-shot magazines, but it will accept any AR-15 type magazine, like the 30 round GI Magazine in the photo, which we are including for buyers in most jurisdictions, and we have plenty more at really good prices.

This is the PTR-91KF variant, factory product code 915303. Here is what the company says about their rifles: The PTR 91 was developed with the tooling from the H&K licensed G3 arms plant in Portugal, and retains the major design features of this well engineered popular rifle. With most major parts manufactured in the US, the current rifle models feature a retarded blow back system, .75 inch diameter Match Grade 4 groove barrel with 1:12 right hand twist, all black furniture and powder-coated barrel. Chambering is .308 Winchester caliber or 7.62x51 NATO interchangeably. Magazine is G3 type 20 round, so 20+1 fully loaded capacity. Weight empty is 9.17 pounds. Sight system is G3 type adjustable post front and four position HK type aperture rear. Upper receiver is recessed for a claw lock or B-Square type scope mount, and we usually have economical scope mounts available. Finish is matte black with Black synthetic stock and forend. Replacement pricing on original HK 91 rifles ranges upwards of $3,000 apiece; and the PTR-91 commands prices in our area in the $1500.00 range. Photos show the original brand new magazine plus three extra German Army surplus mags that we are including.

This Super Charged 30-06 load was designed to be the premier deer load for 30-06, providing devastating, one shot terminal destruction of deer “clockwork”. The 150gr. Spitzer is traveling at around 3,000 fps from typical 30-06 rifles and the bullet will mushroom violently at these impact velocities. It may even fragment, depending on bullet placement and impact speed. For big game up to 350 lbs, tremendous penetration is not needed, so this bullet mushrooms radically and might even break up. (Much like our Deer Grenade 44 Mag. Item # 4F) When high speed bullets act this way terminally, the effect is devastating and they absolutely “dump” deer sized game animals in their tracks. This bullet does not give ample penetration for super big game like Yukon moose and we have designed other 30-06 loads for that type of task, but this load will collapse deer sized game unlike any other 30-06 load. This load is designed for any game weighing less than 350 lbs, such as medium sized black bear, hogs, antelope, deer, etc.

Note our below real world velocities, shot from real world rifles. We do not use extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings.

The manufacturer is the same, Akkar of Istanbul Turkey. Only the importer has changed, and we’re glad to see these fine shotguns back in circulation. This Nickel Finish Akkar rivals the Mossberg Marine and Remington 870 Mariner at about half the price. The Akkars are every bit as slick, or even slicker finished than their rivals, Turkish made on Italian machinery, and their smoothness, fit and finish outrank even the standard production Mossbergs. The only deficiency we notice on their finish is some roughness to the lettering on the barrels. An important consideration on today's market is capacity. These specimens of the Akkar model 300HD, Home Defense, are conventional 4 + 1 Capacity on 2 3/4 inch, or 3 + 1 on 3 inch shells; but the magazine tube threads are the same as Benelli shotguns, so extension tubes are commonly available. Barrel length is 18 1/2 inches with Beretta style bladed bead sight, standard police cylinder bore fixed choke; weight empty is a very pleasant and light 6 pounds, taking from the Benelli influenced construction and alloy receiver; overall length is a brief 38 1/4 inches. Forend and buttstock are pliable but high impact polymer, 1 1/2 inches drop at the comb on the buttstock and 2 1/4 inches drop at the heel. Finish is a very smooth, weather-resistant matte nickel. We're offering these fine, slick, Turkish made Akkars, the one in the photo or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 289.00.

This pistol is in 90% condition.  Imported by TG!.  Item 41462-7

Overview:
Manufactured by the Czechoslovak firm Česká zbrojovka the vz. 82 replaced the 7.62x25mm Tokarev vz. 52 pistol in Czechoslovak military service in 1983. It is a compact, double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blowback action. This type of action allows the barrel to remain solidly fixed to the frame, resulting in improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like the U.S. M1911 series). The low bore axis of the vz. 82 provides for less muzzle rise and quicker follow-up shots. For added convenience, both the frame-mounted thumb safety and the magazine release are ambidextrous.  The bore is chrome plated, which gives it three advantages: longer barrel life, resistance to rust from the use of corrosive ammunition, and ease of cleaning. Another feature of this pistol is the use of polygonal rifling in the barrel bore. This replaces the traditional lands and grooves rifling design with a rounded, smooth polygonal pattern which has a more ""hills and valleys"" appearance.

Manufacturer is Zhongzhou Machine Works of Jin An, China. Importer and warrantor is Century Arms of Georgia VT. Type is external hammer, breech loading side by side or double barreled Coach Gun shotgun. Construction is all steel metal, with walnut stock and forend. Chambering is 12 gauge, 3 inch shells or shorter. Barrels are 20 inch blue steel, 3 inch chambered so they will accept any shells from our 1 3/4 inch Aguila Mini Buckshot to standard 2 3/4 inch shells, and all the way to 3 inch Magnum. Barrel muzzles gauge at .730 wide open cylinder on the right barrel, and .725 vicinity skeet or improved on the left, so light recoiling steel shot loads will work just fine; a person can even duck hunt with one of these if he is so of mind. Sight system is .375 serrated top solid steel rib, with Conical end brass bead type front sight. Mechanism is tang mounted breech lever, with tang mounted safety behind the lever. Hammers are exposed rabbit ear type external, .260 width and .375 height smooth spurs at the top. Firing is via hammer strike against spring loaded floating firing pins, and the hammers have half cock and full cock positions. Triggers are double .230 smooth face, forward for the right tube and rear for the left tube. Triggers pull in the 5 pound vicinity. Barrels have once piece extractor block, no shell-slinging ejectors. Buttstock length of pull including their 3/8 inch thick rubber recoil pad is the standard 14 inches, with a 3/4 inch rightward cant, so it is not entirely southpaw friendly. Finish is semi gloss blued steel metal, and satin finish walnut. Note the permanent steel sling swivels; note too, that Century Arms shotguns are never cosmetically perfect. Weight empty is 7 pounds 9 ounces, with center of gravity under the chamber. This shotgun is popular in Cowboy Action circles, but it is also a prize for home defense. Its hammers and safety are a plus; its weight is a plus to prevent heavy recoil. It is attractive, nostalgic, and effective at the same time.

That is a few $ cheaper than any of the local places sell them. However, he has to order in quantities of 5k... and I don't need that many of any given size.
This post is to gage interest in buying boxes of 1k primers if I were to do a bulk order.
These would be:
Wolf for Small Rifle, Small Pistol, and Large Pistol
Winchester for Large Rifle

I'm not looking for $ upfront or firm commitments at this point. If I get a lot of interest, then I'll order and take my chances posting the extra primers. If I don't get any interest, then I will probably pass and just pay the $33-35/box that I can get them locally.

Oh, and he has H335 powder for $150 per 8 LB can. Again, he gets it by the case (2 x 8Lb cans) and I don't need that much. I can find it online for that price, but not in stock, and they have to add the $25+ Hazmat fee on top of shipping. No hazmat or shipping if I pick it up from him. Let me know if you want in on that deal as well and I will order extra.

This is something of a niche item.  Since the hammer is shrouded, it can only be fired double-action.  This makes it  a .22 trainer, and/or a defensive revolver for those who are sensitive to recoil.  It can be used for recreational plinking, but is never going to be a target gun ... unless you're Jerry Miculek.

“The .22 Caliber Killings” by Mark Schorr.

""Israeli Mossad .22 LRs""  by Nick Jacobellis. 
Tactical Weapons.  May 2009

...in February of 1969, Israeli Sky Marshal Mordechai Rachamim engaged several heavily armed Arab terrorists as they attacked an EL Al airliner on a snow covered runway in Zurich. Despite the odds against him, the young Israeli sky marshal expertly used his issued Beretta Model 70 pistol to kill one of the Palestinian terrorists, moments before the Zurich Police arrived and took the remaining terrorists into custody. The three surviving male Palestinian terrorists received 12-year jail sentences for attacking a commercial airliner with machine guns and explosives that resulted in the killing and wounding of several passengers and crew. Sky Marshal Mordechai Rachamim became an instant hero at home in Israel.

Rachamim told the author that during this engagement at least two of the rounds fired from his Model 70 hit the mark and were responsible for one of the male terrorists being KIA — pretty good shooting, considering that Rachamim single-handedly charged the enemy position while he emptied his .22 caliber pistol at the heavily armed terrorists. Even though Israeli Sky Marshal Rachamim was only armed with a .22, far too much was at stake for him to miss his target. Failure was not on option.

In May of 1972, Rachamim participated in another daring and equally dangerous tactical operation involving aviation security when he and other members of Israel’s elite Sayert Matkal commando unit rescued passengers and crewmembers onboard a hijacked Sabena Airline flight at Lod Airport (now, Ben-Gurion) in Tel Aviv.
. . .
Once again the Israeli sky marshals and Sayert Matkal commandos proved that you do not necessarily need to be heavily armed with sub-machine guns and major-caliber pistols to stop terrorists and criminals. Just like David killed Goliath with a slingshot and a small rock, the Israelis in more modern times used .22s to eliminate a different type of monster from the field of battle..."

Very good shooter, the bore is dark but still has sharp rifling and is as accurate as I can be. I do still have the box for this rifle I believe. Also has the sling, 3 ammo pouches, and tool kit.

Next up is a 1946 Izzy M44. This rifle is beautiful. All numbers match and are easily visible. Bore is nice and shiny with sharp rifling. This thing shoots true though I will say the bolt is just a touch sticky.

I also have 872 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo to go with the guns. 440 in a sealed spam can, 340 in 20 rd paper packages (from a previously open spam can), 34 rds of wolf, and 58 rds of loose surplus.

This is Not a youth shotgun; youths and the weak of hand cannot generally manage a 10 pound pull. Barrels have once piece extractor block, no shell-slinging ejectors. Buttstock length of pull including their 1/2 inch thick rubber recoil pad is 14 1/2 inches, with a 3/4 inch rightward cant, so it is not entirely southpaw friendly. Finish is semi gloss blued steel metal, and satin finish light walnut. Note the permanent steel sling swivels; note too, that Century Arms shotguns are never cosmetically perfect. Weight empty is 8 pounds 9 ounces, with center of gravity under the chamber. This shotgun is popular in Cowboy Action circles, but it is also a prize for home defense. Its hammers and safety are a plus; its weight is a plus to prevent any significant felt recoil.

In 2008, Marlin introduced its X7 series that has been going strong ever since. This is Marlin’s latest variant of the XL7 bolt action chambered in the venerable .30-06 Springfield caliber. Manufacturer is Marlin Firearms Company, Mayfield Kentucky plant. Barrel stamping reads, The Marlin Firearms Co., Mayfield KY, USA / Model X7 cal. .30-06 Spgf. Type is Mauser derivative Bolt Action rifle. Construction is entirely steel metal with the exception of the alloy bolt cowl and internal trigger housing, and the hard polymer cartridge follower on the internal magazine. Stock is one piece graphite based synthetic with checkered surface laterals on the forend and pistol grip areas. Note that the trigger guard is integral to the stock, and sling swivel studs are factory issue Michaels blue steel. Barrel is 22 inch, six groove right hand 1:12 button rifling, counterbore recess crowned muzzle. Outside barrel diameter is .687 at the muzzle and .732 at the forend. Note the barrel collar where barrel attaches to the receiver, a similar setup to competitor Savage’s 110 series rifles. Action is long action steel; barrel and action come pillar bedded into the stock from the factory. Bolt is 4 piece fluted steel body, blued into the flutes, with independent bolt face that houses the extractor and ejector. It throws at 90 degrees. The receiver sports a factory alloy 6 slot one piece Picatinny rail that will accept any Weaver type scope rings. The rail also reinforces an already strong action. Trigger is .360 smooth face, but with the Pro-Fire® adjustable trigger that can range from 2 1/2 pounds on up. Photo specimen pulled at 3 pounds with minimal felt creep and no overtravel. Stock is Monte Carlo type, with 3/4 inch right hand cant. Length of pull is 13 1/2 inches from the Pro-Fire trigger face to the end of the 1 inch factory recoil pad. Magazine is ADL type internal box, no floorplate, and capacity is 4+1 rounds of .30-06 Springfield caliber ammunition. Weight empty no scope is 6.75 pounds, with center of gravity at the bolt face. Each rifle comes in its original factory box with instruction manual, factory registration card, and cable lock. Replacement pricing on this rifle is $400 or more in our area.

=========================
As many of you know our Dear Leader banned Russian imports with a stroke of his pen. Major bummer. But don’t fear – you can get one right here and right now, because I am selling my Saiga 223. It is brand new; I could not resist and put 30 rounds (or (6) 5-round mags) through it 2 hours after I picked it up. I am dead-serious. Eats both .223 and 5.56 ammo.

I added an optional Molot factory “Dragunov style” stock, just so *you* can look bad a$$ at the range.

My Saiga comes with additional “Monte Carlo” Molot stock, *one* 5 round mag, box, papers, cleaning rod, oil can, etc.  NOTE - PIC SHOWS a tactical site and mount. Those no longer exist and the price reflects it.

standard Saiga and AK side rail for a sliding mount is there on the left side.


HOW MUCH - I need $700 for the rifle with second stock, as in the picture. Add $75 for (3) hi-cap Tapco 30-rounder mags.  Comes with box and oil paper and all new gun stuff and smell.

BOTTOM LINE: It's a *very* good deal. Second stock alone was 80$. No shipping, no FFL paperwork, no tax.  

So, *come with $700*or*for $775 defend Mother Russia from capitalistic oppression with 3 extra 30-round mags and 20 rounds of tracer .223

TRADES - will trade for cash. I may consider a THREADED BARREL 9 mm or 45 acp glock, Walther or sig. THREADED... maybe a 1911. Threaded.

PS usual disclaimers apply: no liberals, no felons, no domestic violence participants and definitely no minors.
