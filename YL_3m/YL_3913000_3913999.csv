Their rugged, medium-sized frame and cushioned grip system permit repeated firings of powerful .357 Magnum cartridges with minimal shooter fatigue. Because the GP1 also accepts the less-expensive, lighter-recoiling .38 Special cartridges, it is both economical and pleasant for practice at the range. Easy on the hand and budget, all GP1 revolvers boast solid steel sidewalls (no side-plates), and frame widths that are increased with extra steel in critical areas that support the barrel, making them rugged, reliable, and dependable. This model has a 6. blued barrel, a recoil-reducing, rubber Hogue Monogrip, and fixed front and adjustable rear sights."

BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE Premium 358 Win. Supercharged 225 gr. TSX (2500 fps) - 20 Round Box







Due to customer request, Buffalo Bore has developed two new powerful and precision loads in 358 Win.

Item 41A features a 225gr. Sierra SPTZ-BT @ 2545 fps out of a Ruger Hawkeye. (22 inch barrel) This bullet is suited for all North American big game from small whitetails to Yukon Moose and Bison. You should limit yourself to broadside shots on larger big game like moose and bison. At expected impact velocities, this bullet mushrooms readily, but holds together to penetrate large shoulder or hip bones.

Item 41B features a 225gr. Barnes TSX @ 2500 fps out of the same Ruger Hawkeye. This bullet can be used on ANY North American big game at ANY angle. The 225gr. Barnes TSX out penetrates typical 250gr. premium partition .358 bullets, but gives higher velocities, lower recoil and flatter trajectories of a 225gr. bullet. If you desire the flexibility of taking very large and dangerous NA big game at raking angles or at straight away shots, this TSX load delivers.

These 358 Win. loads were designed to be the most powerful and highest quality of any 358 Win. ammo in the world. This ammunition is safe for use in any/all 358 Win. rifles that are in normal operating condition."

A small carry gun when you just can't carry a larger one or for a back-up.
The NAA are the best derringers out there in my opinion.

The NAA .22 Long Rifle is the most popular Mini-Revolver ever produced. With the many current accessories, it is versatile for many applications and is the standard by which other Mini-Revolvers are judged.

As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.

Comes with the small holster, warranty card, small catalog and parts list, small padlock. No case... I am keeping the case.

It comes with the Crimson Trace laser which is the best you can get and isn't cheap, I paid about $175 for the laser alone last year and $50 for the leather/Kydex holster for the gun/laser combo. The plastic guide rod has been replaced with a stainless steel guide rod and the barrel has been polished to match. I am looking to get $425 for everything. I will include the hollow points in the mag so you don't have to go buy any defensive ammo(they will come loose not actually in the mag of course). I will consider trading for another smalll 9mm, preferably a S&W MP Shield 9mm. Email me or text me at REDACTED if interested."

It is a C&R gun and I'd accept a current C&R license, otherwise we'd have to do a LEGAL TRANSFER through a qualified FFL. I am offering this at a LOW PRICE because I need cash now. The price is FIRM.

These are very solid handguns, and it is now quite difficult to find surplus CZ 82 or CZ 83 models available (they used to be common for $200 or less). Very good construction, definitely has thousands of rounds of life left.

Included with the gun:
1 original mag
1 extra mag purchased from CDNN sports (I also have receipts for the mag and firearm).
I will also include a box of Federal hollow-points.
Original screwdriver/cleaning rod

The firing pin, slide and frame are in good shape, grips are a little worn. The only issue with the gun is: the mag release sometimes ""sticks"" when the grip is tightly attached. It operates fine with the screws slightly loosened, and could be rectified by good file work on the mag well (I would do this myself, but I don't have a file set and would like to sell this firearm ASAP).

The bore is good and it functions perfectly. There is holster wear pitting on the slide but overall it is in decent condition, with nice original grips. If you want a 9mm Beretta but are on a budget, here's a chance to grab a true piece of Beretta history, undoubtedly one of the most collectible, being the five hundred year old company's first standard 9mm.

I can accept a current C&R otherwise it must go through a legal FFL. No shipping, no illegal transactions; don't even ask.

NOTE: arms list's pulldown menu automatically ID'ed this as a Beretta USA pistol but it is not -- it was made in Italy by Beretta."

It is brand new in box and never been fired. 

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the new addition to the SAM7 family – the SAM7UF rifle. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features expected in the SAM7 Family. From its reinforced under-folding buttstock to its 14x1mm left hand muzzle threads with muzzle nut, every component of the SAM7UF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7UF rifle is bound to become a sought-after and collectible firearm.

The New Reinforced Under-Folding Stock
The SAM7UF utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, which locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle.  In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it. 

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7UF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.

458,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3913458,For Sale:  Hornady 223 Rem. Custom Grade New Dimension Full Length 2 Die Set,"Monroe, Seattle, Washington",$ 25,"Listed On: Monday, January 19, 2015",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I recently upgraded my reloading equipment and this set of dies is now surplus to my needs. Probably only about 150 or so rounds loaded with these dies. They are like new. I have gone to a different brand which came with my new press. These dies usually sell for $45 and up. I am selling this die set for $25 firm. I do not wish to ship, but if shipping, would ship for the actual cost of mailing them. I do accept PayPal. 

Here is what the manufacturer has to say about these dies:
""Custom-Grade rifle dies begin as specially selected steel that's hand-inspected both before and after it's delivered. The steel is then heat-treated to ensure the durability needed to provide a lifetime of reloading. Then the inside surface of each sizing die is carefully hand-polished to a mirror finish. The result is a die so smooth, guaranteed to never scratch a case. Before assembly, every part of every die is hand-inspected and a protective coating is applied to prevent moisture damage during shipping. The result is the most advanced reloading die set available today.

Elliptical Expander significantly reduces the friction and case-neck stretch associated with other expanders. It threads on so it can't pull loose and eliminates the need for a separate expander die for ""necking up"" to the next larger caliber. Sliding, In-Line Seating System assures in-line benchrest alignment of every bullet seated. The sliding sleeve vertically pre-aligns the bullet with the case-neck as they enter the die body. As the cartridge is raised, the bullet contacts the floating steel seating stem and is kept in perfect alignment as it's being seated.

Every Custom-Grade New Dimension die set comes in a convenient box which lets you store fully adjusted dies, Lock-N-Load bushings, shell holders and a taper crimp die. Wrench flats located on the die body make adjustments much easier and eliminate damage from adjusting dies with pliers. Spindle lock design aligns the expander spindle to perfectly center itself in the die. Provides tight tolerances and precise fit. Expander spindle improves alignment and enhances accuracy for smoother operation. A solid, one-piece rod guaranteed not to bend or break. Hardened-steel decap pin will not break, bend or crack, even when depriming cases with crimped primer pockets. Elliptical expander significantly reduces friction and case-neck stretch. Threaded and replaceable. Expander die flares the mouth of the case preparing it to receive a bullet. Precision ground and polished. Seater adjustment screw easily adjusts for bullet seating depths.

All-steel construction provides added strength and reduces thread wear. In-line bullet seating system includes a floating bullet alignment sleeve, floating steel seating stem and a built-in crimper for benchrest precision when seating bullets. Bullet seater alignment sleeve guides the bullet and case-neck into the die. The free-floating sleeve design assures benchrest alignment every time. Floating steel seating stem assures consistent alignment with a universal design that better seats more bullet profiles. Built-in crimper gives you the option of crimping without an extra crimp die. Sure-Loc lock rings lock the die into position and provide precise adjustment. Locking screws stay free from threads. Features wrench flats. Locking retainer spring removes in seconds for easy disassembly and cleaning of the die."""

Caliber is 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Smith & Wesson brought its full focus on making a viable thin compact that retains all the quality and features of its reigning MP9 series. Smith & Wesson’s new M&P Shield, writes the factory, is a slim, concealable, lightweight striker-fired polymer pistol. The new M&P Shield features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18 degree grip angle, the M&P Shield offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. ... The M&P Shield features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, Melonite coated stainless steel slide and barrel. The Shield is, they continue, standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P Shield is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius [for its 3 dot sights] and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P Shield allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately. Barrel is six groove ECM 1:9 rifled bore, good to go on well made lead bullets where German and Austrian pistols are not. The 9mm Shield comes with a total of two stainless bodied magazines, as the photos show: an extended 8 shot and a flush fitting 7 rounder. It has a firing pin safety, and a single side lever safety for right handed shooters; with no magazine safety. Slide measures .900 thin behind the ejection port, and the frame measures .955 thin at its back extreme strut area. Best of all, a person gets Smith & Wesson M&P series quality at a price that is very competitive. Each Shield comes in its black factory cardboard box with red cable lock, protective wrapper, instruction manual, factory registration card, fired brass envelope, and total of two magazines.

This particular one is for a 5.56/.223 rifle. It uses a flush hider that threads to existing barrel threads standard on most AR15 style rifles and carbines. The suppressor mounts to the flash hider. Gemtech claims this suppressor is soldier proof. As a former soldier I admit I would have a hard time breaking it. IT has been an excellent suppressor for me. I'm selling it because I don't use it much. This is an NFA item and does require transfer approval through the ATF and licensed FFL holder, which I am.

I've got a Leatherwood/Hi-Lux SCOUT scope, powered from 2-7 with the 308 BDC reticle.

They are a perfect match for a ""good enough"" scout scope.

I paid $160 from MidwayUSA for the scope, and $25 for the rings from Amazon. I'll sell the pair for $150 so I don't have to send them both back in two boxes and take off the rings and blah blah blah. It feels like a good deal if you were thinking about trying this scope."

Its short, 60º bolt throw provides plenty of thumb clearance between the bolt knob and the scope, making cycling incredibly fast and comfortable. The rifle’s free-floating, hand-chambered barrel with target crown makes it inherently accurate with the right load, too.

The VZ58 is a piston operated 7.62x39 chambered weapon that served as the Czech's little FU to the Russians when they pushed their ComBloc influence on the superior Czech arms industry in the mid 1950s. The design looks externally like an AK, but the guts and balance are absolutely not. As a NON-AK fan who wanted to shoot Russian ammo, I got one last year. I have put three magazines through it, cleaned it, and put it away. Since I'm moving in a couple of months, I'm letting go of... personal surplus. I've got ARs in 3 calibers now, so I'll probably end up with another one in 7.62x39. You can have my intermediate gun.

Comes with:

Milled US manufactured Receiver, US made barrel, Czech ""beaver-barf"" handguards and grip.
A starter pack of 5 x 30 round magazines, this weird Sheep suede freedom fighter pouch to tote 4 of them, a leather sheath for the removable bayonet, and a cleaning kit.
I hate shooting folding stock steel rods that punch me in the face and don't allow a cheek weld - so I have a super cool-guy ""custom"" paracord cheek protector woven on there - Save your face... use the paracord as a cheek brace.
This thing is a solid 16 oz lighter than an AK, and folds to fit under the seat of your station wagon. Shoots ""internet sub-MOA"" w/ surplus ammo per forum tards - and real world minute-of-man (or hog) at 200-300 yards per every real person's experience.

I keep seeing that there are cool prices on this rifle, but no one has them in stock. Maybe the DHS bought them all. Anyway - the local FFL guy who advertised on here just sold his for $625. I'll do $550. And his didn't have a cool para-cord check piece. If you are a medical professional with a license, LEO/MIL with ID, or have a CHL, I'll drop like 10% lower. So... how about that? Comes in a random rifle box or bring your own bag.

It is one of the first few iconic models that SOG rolled out - which means that it forms the basis of the SOG company history. Just imagine - 9 inches of shiny sharpened SK-5 carbon steel... almost like a mini-sword! This knife is especially hard to come by, and it pops up rarely for sale on the web. This model is the base for the current Tigershark models, like the Tigershark Elite. Many have commented that this SOG knife makes a great camp tool (especially for chopping) and makes very quick work of any wood, largely due to its nice hefty blade that has great weight balance and feel. People who bought this knife certainly did use it well, which explains why it is difficult to find a Mint In Box (MIB) piece. 

The SK-5 Tigershark is also the iconic knife used in the new ""SOG split bullet logo"", of which the picture of it cutting the .45 pistol round can be found at the bottom of this page. It is one of the most sought after knives for SOG collectors today and continues to fetch high prices in sales. The Tigershark model continues to be a popular SOG knife as its largest model (by blade length) and it is still being produced by SOG in modern versions.Specifications:

DESCRIPTION and DETAILS: This is a COLT M16A1 MilSpec Small Hole Upper Receiver w/ BCG and the following details:
•  Original Teardrop Forward Assist & No Forge Code at sight (Pre-1970 between 1964-1969) but there is Faint Colt proof marks on receiver in front of Port Door
•  Flat Handguard Slip Ring
•  0.626"" Barrel Diameter 
•  Colt Marked BCG FA Carrier 
•  Colt marked FSB 
•  Drain hole for front sight 
•  Counter Bored Front Lug with 0.250"" MilSpec Small Hole
•  STD “A1” Port Door Cover 
•  Looks to have a 1969 gas tube 

More pictures available upon request.

This upper can almost completely be dated and manufactured in 1969! The forging places this upper as being manufactured prior to 1970 because it does not have the forging marks under the carry handle. Colt did not start those until around 1971. All other markings date this upper to be manufactured between 1964 and 1969. However, the Gas tube bends were changed in 1969 and this upper has the updated gas tube. This is obviously a guess at best. The gas tube could have been changed previously before it was passed down to me. But all markings positively date it between 1964 and 1969. Now you know what I know. It is a Rare find and I do not expect you to find another like it! Especially with a 10.3” barrel!

Please do not make ridiculous offers. The price is fair - one it is a Colt - two it is rare! I have not found another like it with just over 2 years of searching.

******We try very hard to be within all laws. However, It’s the responsibility of the buyer to know their City, County, State, & Federal Laws.******

******BASICALLY, If this is not legal to own where you live, PLEASE do not ask questions or make an offer.******

NFA DISCLAIMER
This upper can be used on a 'registered' pistol lower without regulation.

However, once this part is assembled into a complete Short Barreled Rifle SBR, it becomes a regulated item by the National Firearms Act (NFA).

NICE! The rifle has a YHM front flip-up sight installed and I will include a MagPul MBUS flip-up sight IF you purchase this rifle WITHOUT the ACOG scope. 

With scope, asking $3,000 OBO. Without, asking $2,000.
