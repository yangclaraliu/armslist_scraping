This PT111 Millennium is 9mm and has an all Titanium slide and tritium night sights! 12+1 rd capacity. Weight is only 14 oz's.  Will not be pulling your pants down all day long as you carry. No longer produced as world wide titanium prices have spiraled sky high and if made at today's titanium prices the gun would have to cost about $1000+. Titanium guns are becoming very collectible and are drastically increasing in price making them good investment guns.

 Has been carried occasionally (by me) but fired very little. Slight holster wear on the slide at the barrel end. See photos. It is the most fire power coming from the least weight. Nice for ladies to carry as it's not like carrying a bowling ball around or anyone seeking a concealed carry gun you can forget is on you its so comfortable. Double action only making it a very safe gun. Has a long pull and easy to pull trigger, again nice and very safe and very accurate. Also has a safety lever on the slide. Included is a Don Hume Right hand Close conceal leather holster.

The M48 is more of a parts gun, although all numbers appear to match (there may be a VERY old force match on the stock) the bore has seen better days. This would be an ideal candidate for someone wanting to re-chamber this gun or simply throw a new 8mm barrel on it. The M44 is a different story though, it is in pristine condition including a shiny, sharp bore, and has a beautiful stock that my friend refinished in the original arsenal stain. This gun was $300 shipped and transferred to me from classic firearms two summers ago. With that in mind I'm open to trades but would prefer a swiss k31 and seeing as the price of k31s is around $300 I feel that a straight up trade for my two rifles would be reasonable, though I can negotiate a little. Other possibilities would be a Mauser of any sort, though I already have a 24/52c, as well as some ammo on top most likely. I'll be posting pictures soon."

Here's the website description:
The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

The barrels are lightweight-profiled with rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).

The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.

Both models come with a 6-position LaRue RAT Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies.

(Iron Sights, Optics and QD mounts not included in price)
Base model includes LaRue RAT Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip, 1 Aluminum Magazine, 1 Rail Strip, and A2 Flash Hider.

About LaRue Firearm Accuracy:
LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results.

It is an L framed 6-shot revolver with the full lug. This is a rare 6"" Nickel model. Gun is beautiful as the pictures show. Fired very little and had been a safe queen for quite some time. Barely noticable turn-line and it looks as good or better in person as it does in the pictures.

Comes with nice Galco holster that has the soft suede inside so as not to scuff the revolver if one should choose to use it. Of course, shoots .38 Specials as well.

That mark in the second picture is just a shadow/bright spot and is not a flaw in the nickel. 

Perfect lockup, trigger action and timing. This model was made in 1987 according to the serial numbers. SandW ceased production of nickel 586's in 1991.

$800/reasonable offers considered. I searched all over the net for a Nickel 586 6"" and could find one decent one for sale, a couple sold in the past, and a few 4"" 586's.

This truck is perfect for working on the farm, for the tinkerer looking for a test bed for their work, or the collector looking for a solid base model to work from.

The Eotech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sight was developed after extensive testing of various optical sights, and US Special Operations Command has standardized on the Eotech Holographic Weapon Sight as its 1X weapon optic for close quarter and urban combat zones. To meet the stringent requirements set and demanded by our elite fighting forces, EOTech has developed the EOTech Holo Sight M 553, modeled after the ever popular, battle proven Eotech HWS design. The EOTech M553 Holo Sight incorporates many additional features required within the SOPMOD Block 2 program. The advantage of EOTech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sights is its holographic reticle patterns that are instantly visible in any light condition, instinctive to center regardless of shooting angle and always remain in view to achieve lightning quick reticle to target acquisition without covering or obscuring the point of aim. The magic of EOTech Holographic 553 Weapon Sights is the edge they provide to you in close quarter or urban combat zones. The EOTech Holographic M553 Weapon Sight will remain fully operational even when the laminated window is obstructed by mud, snow, rain, or even damaged/shattered, as long as you can see through any portion of the laminated window, the entire reticle pattern will be visible on target with point of aim/impact being maintained and fully functional, the operator can still engage with confidence. Pick up this Red Dot Sight for maximum shooting performance!

Most of the model 12 Winchesters from this era have been used to death and are rough, this one is actually very nice. 
You will of course be the judge but for what it is worth I had this shotgun looked at by a couple of experts in the used gun business.  After careful hands on inspection one commented that it is obvious that the user (my dad) had a respect for his firearms.  The other individual by looking at photos stated that the shotgun would fall at the midpoint in the “very good” classification range.
I’m certainly willing to provide additional photos upon request."

This is a blast to fly. No flight experience required. The onboard flight control system keeps this quadcopter in level and stable flight. Let go of the controls and it stops in place; so much so that it will fight the wind to do it. Lose sight of it, turn the controller off and it flies back to where it started. All of this is possible due to the onboard GPS system. I have also equipped it with a FPV (first person view) camera and goggle system made by Fat Shark. This is my favorite part of the whole package. Fly it like you're in it! I've also equipped it with a gimbal system on a stabilization platform which holds a GoPro 3 Black Edition camera. Talk about amazing photos and videos! I bought a professional case and this deal also comes with extra hardware, batteries, charger, original and aftermarket carbon fiber blades, taller landing gear (for more camera mobility), carbon fiber video transmitter platform, prop guards, prop balancer, etc. 

I don't recomend this for small or unsupervised children. The blades can cause bodily damage especially when flown without the prop guards. The videos are better without them however.

Would love to trade for a CZ P-06, HK USP Compact, possibly a springfield xdm in OD green .40. I also have approximately 500 rounds of ammo to go with in trade for .40 ammo. 

The P-01 is a compact, alloy-framed decocker model with light rail.

SKU: 91199.
Categories: 75 Compact 
Product Description

The P-01 9mm (accompanied by the P-06 in .40 S&W) was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN."

Long story short, I bought the Palmettso State Armory lower over 2 years ago and it just sat. This spring, it was fitted with a melonite treated 16"" 1-7 twist Tapco upper, due to the superior qualities of melonite treating (vs chromelining or stainless steel). Rifle wears a Magpul MOE hand-grip, but can be replaced with a standard USGI M16 grip if desired. Rifle is sold with 1 mag, as shown.

About melonite treating:

""Meloniting (nitro-carburizing) is a heat treat process for barrels that hardens the barrel to apx. 70 Rockwell so they last longer, are more corrosion resistant inside and out, and also decreases friction in the barrel which can increase velocity. Chrome lined barrels can decrease accuracy, as it is a built-up layer of material inside the barrel. Nitro-carburizing changes the structure of the metal itself without building a layer in the bore, therefore increasing performance but not decreasing accuracy. Melonite treated barrels have proven to last 30% longer than chromelined barrels, and are more accurate.""

""Venezuelan"" PK-A red dot. A excellent red dot that was built for the Venezuelan Army by the Russians. The great thing about this particular sight it that it uses a regular AA battery and it sits low enough to co-witness the stock AK sights.

My price $1200. Non negotiable!

No Trades unless your looking to trade a M1A Loaded with a stainless barrel.

I will not break up the package it's all or nothing, sorry I just don't want to deal with all the hassle. I'm in no hurry to sell, I really have no need to sell just trying to diversify my collection so the price is the price.

Don't bother contacting me saying ""I found all this stuff at the gun store for $30."" If you did, great, buy it. Don't bother telling me.

You line up the Dealer and cover the fees.
