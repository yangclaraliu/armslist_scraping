The only markings that I can find are the numbers 170 on either wood end in the break of the stock.  There is a scuff in the wood on the bolt side grip area.  Caliber is .177.

I've shot a few hundred rounds of just about everything through it and had no problems.  It is actually a pretty decent trigger for being DOA if I remember correctly.  The only reasons I'm selling it are because it is the only .40 I have, I don't shoot it much, and it just really isn't for me.

I just did an online stock and price check of QUALITY AMERICAN MADE FACTORY FIRST RUN ammo in 5.56, 45ACP, 9MM, and 357 Magnum.  No TulAmmo or other communist crap.  I'm talking Federal, Winchester, Remington, PMC, and Magtech...  The sites I checked were Lucky Gunner, Cheaper Than Dirt, and Ammo Depot.  All three charge shipping of course, and Lucky Gunner charges sales tax to TN (the other two don't.)  I priced everything at 1000 rounds, some of it I had to check by ordering multiple boxes to equal 1000, some was just plain bulk.  This is OUT THE DOOR (tax and shipping included in the prices.)  Here are the prices per round by site:
LUCKY GUNNER:  5.56=.41, 45ACP=.44, 9MM=.31, 357=.55
CTD:  5.56=.39, 45ACP=.38, 9MM=.33, 357=.55
AMMO DEPOT:  5.56=.37, 45ACP=.37, 9MM=.27, 357=.55

I also BOUGHT 200 rounds of Winchester 9MM 115GR FMJ (four 50 round boxes) at the Tullahoma Walmart this morning.  Price per round after tax and ammo fee was 33 cents.

As you can see, Walmart is running pretty even with the websites after you consider tax and ammo fee versus shipping.  The biggest point I am making with this little 30 minute research project is this:  The ammo is available and it is reasonably priced considering the state of affairs at present.  There are too many people on FB and other sites such as Armslist gouging the shit out of ammo prices.  Granted, I am not providing any 22LR info, that is another story in and of itself.  Good luck."

I have put over 350 dollars into the rifle. I am not pressed to sell which is why I'm not really looking for cash. If you offer me something I like, cash-wise, I will consider. But would much rather trade for an AR pistol. And I don't mean a stock pistol with no furniture, sights or what not, unless you offer pistol plus cash. I had a 12 inch free float quad rail and a low profile gas block installed after purchase by a professional smith. Also on is a UTG rubber AFG that feels incredible. A bi-pod that nearly mimics UTG quality, and a Magpul stock. The sight is a NC Star red dot with 7 different brightnesses and 4 different reticles. On the 7th brightness you can see all 4 reticles in bright day light. And lastly, it has a heavy duty barrel that even the gun smith that put the quad rail mentioned how heavy it was. I am looking for an AR pistol that is worth between 1250 and 1400.

I am offering a beautiful condition Harrington & Richardson 929 .22lr 9-shot revolver. All steel construction with rare factory wood grips in perfect condition. This is an all-steel gun, truly a high quality American made firearm. It will not wear out on you and can be passed down through the family. I'm a big Ruger fan and I can tell you this is far superior in quality to the Ruger LCR at a fraction of the price.

There is not a speck of rust or pitting anywhere. Both single and double action are crisp and clean. It was un-shot when I acquired it and have since put only about 20 rounds through her. It is a virtually new condition vintage pistol.

With the vintage leather holster shown in the pictures, I am offering this for $250 firm, or would trade for a great condition Ruger 10/22  FTF only cash only. I will not ship and I will need to see your valid Indiana drivers license and ccw permit.

This one is hard to let go, but I need to downsize.  The gun is about 2 years old--there are ~150 rounds through it and it shoots like a dream.  It loved the light handloads I ran through it.

I am looking for a bolt 308 after I sell this, may be up for a trade + cash.

Included is the Springfield 10 rd mag as well as another 20 rd mag.  I also have the original box and paperwork that came with it.

Iron sights were my usual options, but I will also leave the Aim 2-7 x42 scope on top.  It is long-eye relief and I probably won't need it in the future. (LATER EDIT: I can leave the scope out of the deal and kick 50 bucks off the total.)

I can't give away the handloads you see in the pictures, but I may have some once fired brass and some bullets laying around I can throw in if you want.  Let me know.

I've always had some issues with the gun, I bought it due to the lower price when I was in college, took it to the gunsmith a couple of time and they were able to resolve some of the issues I had. Essentially, it seems like if when you first load a round, if the bolt doesn't seat with some force, you get a failure to fire. If it fires, it will eject no problem, but the follow up shots don't always fire either, not sure what it night need, maybe a new spring somewhere, but I recently bought a new auto loader and don't have the time to tinker with it anymore.

Cosmetically it's in decent shape, I hunted with is, so there are some small scratches here in there, and it has a choke with it (modified or full). It uses Benelli Mobil type chokes.

I'm very much open to offers.

I used a quick Google search to fix the problem but that did not help me.

I then decided to get professional help to solve my problem. After having received many quotations from various companies, I decided to go ahead with Online Tech Repair (www.onlinetechrepairs.com). 

Reasons I chose them over the others:

1) They were extremely friendly and patient with me during my initial discussions and responded promptly to my request.

2) Their prices were extremely reasonable.

3) They were ready and willing to walk me through the entire process step by step and were on call with me till i got it fixed.

How did they do it?

1) They first asked me to state my problem clearly and asked me a few questions. This was done to detect any physical connectivity issues with the printer.

2) After having answered this, they confirmed that the printer and the laptop were functioning correctly.

3) They then, asked me if they could access my laptop remotely to troubleshoot the problem and fix it. I agreed.

4) One of the tech support executives accessed my laptop and started troubleshooting.

5) I sat back and watched as the tech support executive was navigating my laptop to spot the issue. The issue was fixed.

6) I was told that it was due to an older version of the driver that had been installed.

My Experience

I loved the entire friendly conversation that took place with them. They understood my needs clearly and acted upon the solution immediately. Being a technical noob, I sometimes find it difficult to communicate with tech support teams. It was a very different experience with the guys at Online Tech Repairs. You can check out their website www.onlinetechrepairs.com or call them on 1-914-613-3786. 

I would definitely recommend this service to anyone who needs help fixing their computers.

Holster is in great condition, no nicks, visible scratches, or any other abuse. Fits S&W M&P

Features Dual Retention (optional) - If the situation escalates, it is easy to disengage the first (and most effective) level of retention. Once the back is lifted, you can complete your draw at any time. It will not reactivate on it's own, making it also capable of single-retention carry.

Holster doesn't keep too close to your body, allows just enough room between your body and holster in order to fit your thumb next to the weapon and achieve master firing grip easily.

-Long-Stroke Piston

A significant improvement over standard AR-15 direct impingement systems, the PWS long-stroke piston system greatly reduces fouling in the action of the weapon, making it as reliable as the AK-47 it was designed after.

-QPQ Isonited® Barrels

Using only the highest quality barrel blanks turned in house, PWS barrels are designed for the precision shooter.

-Enhanced Carrier

Nickel-Teflon® coated enhanced piston bolt and bolt carrier are precision machined for perfect fit and functionality making the PWS MK1 rifle operating system efficient and effective.

-Ergonomics

A lightweight, free-floated aluminum handguard features the almost universal KeyMod interface to eliminate unnecessary weight and allow for a wide range of accessory placement.

-Buffer System

Unwilling to settle for what the industry had to offer, we designed a buffer tube that’s sturdy, quick to install and controls carrier tilt.

However, feel free to let me know what you have, but only interested in 9mm or .40 handguns, no rifles or shotguns please.

Would far prefer to trade, but make me a REASONABLE cash offer if not interested in trading.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested, texts preferred.

Thanks!"
