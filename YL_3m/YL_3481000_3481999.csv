The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

It would be a great restoration project(could easily have been in WW1) and it's a very good brush/truck gun.  I would also add that while the 303 cartridge isnt used in the states very much, it's used all over the rest of the world.  Ballistically, it falls just under the 308 win.  And it's been a favorite in Canada, Africa and Australia since it was invented.  While it's not as easy to find at Walmart, Cabelas always has it on their shelf for $17.99 for a box of 20."

A cool conversation piece for any gun room, great little storage drawers. And since it's unlikely to be used as a desk, the missing lid is probably irrelevant.

According to the Wilson Combat Customer Service Rep, this pistol was converted by Wilson in the late 1980's.  Today this pistol work would compare to Wilson's ""Protector"" model.  The work performed on a brand new Colt Combat Elite was:  Bobbed hammer, fitted beavertail grip safety, fitted Wilson match barrel , full length guide rod, Wilson front and rear sights, Ultra crisp 4 Lb. trigger job, slide tightened to the frame, and a complete accuracy job. Front strap and flat mainspring housing were serrated at Colt's Custom Shop.  Colt Customer Service Rep told me that this was one of the first Combat Elite pistols made by the Custom Shop. The Wilson employee that I spoke to stated that they bought several of the Combat Elite pistols direct from Colt to do custom conversions on.   This pistol has been fired very little since leaving Wilson.  It is in a Colt box with Colt paperwork.  No scratches or rust anywhere.  I would rate it at 99% with a small rub mark on the recoil spring housing at the right front of the slide.   I have fired this pistol and it is an absolute pleasure to shoot....No better quality than Wilson Combat. $2200 Or will consider offer.  Please feel free to ask any questions or for more pictures.

It is a basically brand new Nikon Monarch 5-20x44mm Side Focus / Bullet Drop Compensator reticle.  You match the BDC reticle with Nikon's amazing Spot-On ballistic software - you simply log onto their website OR use their mobile app ... input your data- Put your caliber, your brand of ammo, your exact load (For example- my ProStaff 4-12x40mm on my Savage .22LR - i might input .22LR, and then select CCI, and go to the exact load, say Mini Mags 40gr RN , ) then you select your exact scope model, and your range of zero and range to target.  Then it shows you , say you have a 25 yd zero, it will give you the point of impact for each of the 4 BDC dots below the center dot.  You can do this for any load or caliber etc, so in THIS scopes case, I had it on a .308 - you might say you're zero'd at 100 yds, and shooting Hornady .308 168gr. ZMAX and I want to use 20x magnification... it will then show you the POI at each dot, like 550, 680, 750, 899 etc  (Making up the numbers here).  It truly is amazing.

Scope is perfect.  Never even been fired once.  I put it on the rifle and it has never moved since..  Basically a little over 1 year old, stored in a great rifle case.  It comes with extra target turrets, flip up scope cover caps, and even a sunshade.

Was a $650 retail scope, I will take $500."

Matching serial # on barrel shank, buttplate, magazine, left side of receiver (at wood line)
This one has many interesting markings and much history.
Tula star with 5 line logo in cyrillics and CCCP on barrel shank (6th line date 1926)
additional stampings found: T or Tula hammer inside circle on top of receiver,Imperial Eagle w/Cyrillic nk underneath it,(small:) C inside square, O inside circle, K-B-or R inside circle on side of barrel shank 
Underside of receiver tang has old style Izhevsk bow and arrow stamp and date 1896, also rough 54
Top of receiver tang has cyrillic P 41
Lower,front, right side of receiver has different serial #,flat underside of receiver has dozens of small proof stamps
Bolt has unusual 21 inside triangle stamp, small 1B, another tiny stamp I couldn't distinguish
laminated stock with metal sling estucions,regular beech or birch handguard, spring type barrel band retainers, 1 Tula marked barrel band and 1 Izhevsk, stock butt has arsonal splice/repair on lower rear

Bore is clean and bright, slightly rounded but strong lands, regular crown/no counter bore

Small CAI Georgia VT import stamp on right,front side of barrel (I got this from Century in around 2001-2002)

This example is far more collectable than most you will find for sale these days. This is why:
1-The small import stamp is barely visable compared to the way they mark them now with the Big Ugly billboard import stamps.
2-It has the older style 5 line Tula arsonal stamp and 1920s date.
3-The imperial eagle is not peened out like most were after the communists took over Russia.
4-It is built on an antique hex receiver (1896) from the original M1891 model Izhevsk,which according to the ATF
   classifies it as an antique firearm rather than modern.

If there is any evidence of wear on this pistol I cannot find it.

I will consider trades, and I will consider separating the ammo and gun. The magazines stay with the Gun though. I am valuing the pistol at $450 with the four magazines.
The ammo is listed at Gander Mountain for $250 so its probably worth $200 lol, so Lets call the ammo $200, I can add cash in a trade.

This is a newer model (Serial puts it in the early 90's) with the crossbolt push safety, and it has the factory scope holes pre-drilled for mounts, but just the open sights on it for now. I bought it used as my first deer gun but haven't used it for years other than take it out once a year and wipe it down with an oily rag. I looked it over last night with a fine tooth comb and found no rust or anything that would lead me to believe its at all deficient.

Original wood stock, one poorly drilled sling stud hole in the butt that's been filled with wood putty and sanded smooth...otherwise in pretty darn nice shape.

I'm looking for a MN deer rifle, preferably with open sights, but also something I wouldn't feel bad about eventually mounting a scope to. Something in 7.62x39...or possibly a later Savage Model 340 (with the pre-drilled scope mount holes) in .30-30...or sporterized .303 or .30-06. Nothing in a punishing caliber as its for a young one - the old military guns seem to suck up recoil better. Hit me up with the offers, and stay away from the Mosins or the semi-auto Remington 760/7600 series. Something that might need some work on the stock or metal isn't out of the question, but I'm not interested in ""mysterious"" ""malfunctioning"" or ""rebarreling"".

Can add ammo and/or cash for the right trade. MN Residents only, must have valid photo ID, and MN PTP/PTC."
