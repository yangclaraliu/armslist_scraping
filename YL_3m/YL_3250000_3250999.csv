I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

Kimber is known for their tradition of excellence and high quality firearms, and the Stainless II simply serves to reinforce Kimber’s superiority.
The Stainless II .45 ACP blends the features and performance expected from Kimber in a stainless steel pistol with increased resistance to the elements. Essentially a stainless steel version of the Custom II with night sights, it has a match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the proven accuracy and performance of the .45 ACP cartridge, the Stainless II is one of the best choices for daily carry.

Been looking for one for awhile but doesn't seem to be much locally.  

I'm looking for something along the lines of a used S&W Model 10 or 64, Rossi Model 68, Taurus M82 or similar.  Doesn't have to be in perfect cosmetic condition, just looking for a good shooter to run my reloads through and carry occasionally.
I'd be willing to spend $200-300 depending on what you have.

My only condition really is that it needs to have a 3-4 inch barrel, I already have a snub and I'm not interested in anything longer than 4 inches.  Also only looking for .38 special, not interested in .22's or other calibers.

Description:
The G41 Gen4 is a practical-tactical .45 caliber pistol designed to maximize sight radius while improving weight distribution and balance. It is built with a G34 slide width on a G21 Gen4 frame and is 1.5 ounces lighter than the G21 Gen4. The longer barrel and slide on the G41 Gen4 help to reduce muzzle flip and felt recoil, while the longer sight radius makes it more accurate for competition or duty use. The G41 Gen4 comes with all the standard features of the Glock Generation 4 pistol group, including the modular backstrap design, Gen4 rough textured frame surface and dual recoil spring assembly.

Check out the review for this boot:
 http://www.hausofguns.com/2012/06/08/magnum-boots-sidewinder-hpi-review/

Magnum builds these boots with one goal: enhance the survivability of the world's most elite operators. They use the hardest durometer of Vibram® soles to prevent tears or cuts from rugged, mountainous terrain. The boot is designed to carry 175 lbs of kit (on top of the operator's body weight) for at least a year of heavy use in a combat environment.

Every detail was scrutinized. They field-tested these boots with Special Forces around the globe and for over 14 months in Afghanistan. A locking cleat keeps laces snugly in place. Eyelets won't glint or shine when scratched.

The iron sights are missing and the metal has the typical patina which would be expected on a rifle of this age. The stock was refinished at one time but looks overall very good. I will also throw in 150 rounds of match ammo which shot very well through the rifle.   Don't know if anyone would be interested....but I also have a stripped 20ga Mossberg 500 receiver and a Daisy BB gun with peep sights that needs new seals.  I can throw those in as well.....

All our gemstones are the real deal, we absolutely do NOT deal with fake or lab created stones!!!   We pay to have an independent third-party certify and appraise all our stones. We don't do that ourselves so people cant say we inflate the price of our gemstones.

 I am looking to trade one or more of these gemstones (in a jewelry setting) for one or more guns. I am really looking for a .45 pistol in either a Colt or Kimber, or any of the snake guns made by Colt (python, anaconda, king cobra). But I am open to a lot of different trade ideas on guns including rifles, shotguns, revolvers, etc.

 Our store has some special stones that you wont find anywhere else. We specialize in opals, emeralds, tanzanite, diamonds (white and black), sapphires, etc etc.

I  have a black diamond that weighs over 9.5 cts and appraised at $3350. You wont find anything like that anywhere else, it us truly a unique one of a kind gemstone. I would be willing to trade that for some type of AR-10 platform. We also have a .65 ct antique old-mine cut white diamond that appraised for $2350. I would trade this straight up for a Colt or Kimber .45. Again, we have a lot of different gemstones and jewelry available. 

 If you have any trade ideas (I am also a gearhead, so I like anything with motors and/ or wheels, please let me know through this Armslist listing. If you are interested in buying anything from our store, please contact me, mention this add,  and you will receive a discount from our store for being an Armslist supporter. 

 Thank you for your time and interest. Brad Fox/ FoxHop Jewelry

1 3/4 lb factory pull. factory flat trigger. 
This thing is ready to go.

amazing pistol. I had this for sale and my daughter begged me to keep it. we shoot IDPA and they don't allow the TS. so its getting sold. the gun is beautiful and comes with all the factory papers, box, 3 mags, extra parts that come with them, etc...

only changes to the pistol are:

 1. Grips, I have a set of Black Diamond cut VZ grips that fit perfectly with the mag well on    it. also comes with factory. 

2. I made one modification that you can't even see but I will put it here for full discloser. IDPA doesn't allow the TS because it doesn't fit in the IDPA legal box. It is just shy of fitting. I filed .060"", yes, only 60 thousandths! off the beavertail and it fit. that has allowed my daughter to shoot local events, but now we will not be able to shoot in sanctioned matches or classifiers where they know this gun. 

This is an amazing pistol with a factory set 1 3/4 lb trigger pull.  I know these guns dont show up often. I bought it new about 6 months ago for 1475. I will take 1000. no less.

It is about 1 year old, give or take. Trijicon made this sight with two different dots. one that is huge and most likely blocks your entire target, and a small one that is better for smaller targets, longer range shooting. Mine has the smaller of the two.

As far as the condition goes, it looks like i just opened the box. there are no scratches on the body, the lens is perfectly clear, and all of the identification numbers are still there.(they sometimes get rubbed off with wear). 

I bought it from a friend of mine around Christmas last year. He only had it for a few months at that point. The only reason I am selling it is because I recently decided that i wanted to put a scope on my rifle and I don't have any use for it anymore.

A brand new Trijicon reflex goes for about 600 new from a store. I would be willing to let it go for what i just paid for my new scope, so about 350$.

I'm looking to free up a little money to help with a down payment, so I'm listing these beauties. 

Word of advice - quit buying crappy quality rifles that won't make it through a two day carbine course. If you want to brag about your POS Windham black rifle to your friends, keep looking. If you want a war machine, then here we go... 

First, a NIB daniel defense M4V1.  Cheapest you can get these delivered is a little over $1250, so I'm gonna ask $1150 face to face. Save $100 and get instant gratification! 

Second is a Bravo Company midlength with Daniel Defense Omega rail. This one has 56 rounds through it - two 28 round pmags. Will also come with a magpul STR stock OR a B5 sopmod - your choice, and Daniel defense rear sight. Gear sector vertical grip and flashlight not included. This one is going to run about $1500, but I'll start it at $1400. Get your hands on an heirloom rifle. 

If you're feeling frisky, I will sell both together for $2,400.

Garage kept, but has logged more than a few miles. Pulls behind my little Toyota just fine. More than light enough to move around with one person pushing on level ground. 

CONDITION
Excellent. No leaks, all gaskets/seals are in great shape. Electrical system is solid and professionally done; I can make modest repairs but I do not work with electrical systems. Frame has no rust and has a good coat of paint. Wheel bearings are well greased. Clear title and registration with permanent plate in Louisiana. Insurance is dirt cheap. No smoking and no pets.

Selling because I am moving in a year or so and can't tow it behind a Uhaul with a car carrier, though it would certainly be interesting to try! Louisiana requires that a notary sign transfer, but there are many title transfer/notary places in town. Located in the New Orleans area and available in that general area for viewing by appointment. Price is firm; there's a lot invested in this thing with the upgrades and upkeep I've done. Similar offerings from commercial manufacturers are considerably more expensive, and this is about what it would cost to do it yourself from scratch.

EXTERIOR
Total length: 10' 6""
Maximum height: 69""
Maximum width at fenders: 69 inches. The lug not covers stick out an extra inch on each side.
Center of gravity/tongue weight is safe and appropriate for length. As with any trailer load distribution is important and easy to tweak. The spare tire could be moved to the roof rack if you want to make big permanent changes, but I find it's easier to move things around in the interior of the cabin.
Lots of ground clearance: frame rides at 18 inches above ground. Trailers with Harbor Freight tires do not have this. Don't get stuck on the road to a campground with crummy toy-sized wheels.
Hi Spec Aluminum 15 "" Alloy Wheels with hub covers and matching full size spare mounted on tongue. Plenty of tread on the tires, and they're in good shape. I don't have a tread gauge but the penny measurement is good. Spare has not been driven on, and is brand new, less than a year old. Items can be bungeed or strapped to top of spare. My grill (not included) usually goes there. Buyer could also have a platform welded or bolted on. 
Full size round fenders.
Adjustable height folding side table.  
Exterior trim is well sealed with flexible RV sealant and fastened with Robertson screws under a protective gasket. Gasket is in great shape and has been treated with 3M protectant.
Lil Bear Roof Rack. Removable. Would be perfect with a small cargo carrier mounted. I never got around to it. It's easier to put a mat down to protect the finish and use ratchet straps to hold things down. 
Fantastic Fan, shaded dome with direction switch and three speeds. Moves a heck of a lot of air, low setting is usully sufficient.
Porch light with exterior switch. 
Passenger side door with locking slam latch and deadbolt and sliding window with screen. Additional sliding locking window with screen on driver side. Plenty of ventilation with or without the fan. 
Streamlined LED running, brake, and turn lights. Just tested to ensure good ground and function.
13 gallon water tank with driver side fill port and passenger side dispenser. Multiple ports for changes to existing setup if you want. My work in progress is a simple gravity fill design.
Weathertight 110 power hookup on rear driver side.
Folding front jack with wheel.
Safety reflectors on rear and side.
Experimental curb finder on rear. 

INTERIOR
Lots of interior room for such compact exterior dimensions, particularly headroom. 
Measurements: 41"" H x 46.5"" W x 80"" L. 
35 Amp Hour AGM battery. Enough for three to four days of moderate usage, or two weeks of light usage. Holds a charge while sitting pretty well, but I periodically run and top it off.
Insulated storage/battery compartment with sliding doors at foot of mattress.
Small heater (included) can be plugged into the socket in the cabinet. Not necessary to run it all night; a few minutes in the evening before bed and when waking up are sufficient.
Flip down DVD player with remote, wireless headphones, and game system. Never used it except to listen to radio and watch DVDs but it works. 
CD player/radio with aux headphone input with 4 speaker Pioneer speaker system. Plenty of volume for listening at camp outside if you leave the window screen open . 
Three interior overhead lights: dome, and left and right directional reading lights.
Red interior nighttime light in footwell. Good for not killing your night vision. Ended up using this one most of the time.
Twin cabinets with doors above the footwell. 
Folding cupholders on each side of cabin.
Twin size dual layer foam mattress.
Carpeted headboard.
Finished vinyl wood floor. Looks pretty good. 
RV breaker and fuse panel in footbox: Progressive Dynamics PD4045KA with intelligent charging features, including a quick charge mode. All circuits are run through panel, so the wiring is good. Has room for expansion. 
1 Interior 110 socket and 2 interior 12v DC sockets. Radio, DVD, charging sockets, all lights, fan, and TV will run off battery. 110 socket obviously only runs off a 110 when hooked up.
ACCESSORIES
Folding Stepstool for easy entry.
Popup changing tent: Trekker Fold-A-Privy in like new condition
Heavy duty power cord

This particular model is discontinued and was built around the same tried and true 870 and 500 platforms. Functions flawlessly and puts up consistent shot patterns. I honestly enjoy shooting this more than my Browning Sporting Clays because it's just a fun pump to shoot and 20g is great for teaching kids to shoot trap and skeet or just something to mess around with on the weekends. Hand checkering on the wood furniture (which is extremely rare) as opposed to Remington or Mossberg's cheap looking press checkering.

I called Colt and they said this gun was manufactured in 2000.The main difference between the Cowboy model and the classic SAA is the Cowboy has a transfer bar ignition system that makes it safe to load all six rounds safely from what I've read.Otherwise It's hard to tell the difference between the original SAA and the Cowboy model. A number of parts are actually interchangeable between the Cowboy revolver and the current SAA—including trigger, barrel, ejector rod assembly, and grip frame.This gun is in excellent shape and I can't see any discernable flaws with the naked eye. It comes complete with the original box, lock, and Colt booklet and a box of 50 Black Hills 230 grain RNFP.I don't know if this gun was ever fired by the original owner or not, I didn't think to ask at the time, but it sure looks clean.Just email me anytime and I will get back asap.

All 3 magazines and the rifle are made by Umarex.  2 magazines are 20 round capacity, and the Colt/HK holds 30 rounds. The 30 rounder has spotty reliability, but I have had no malfunctions with the two 20 rounders.  I had previously painted the rifle and magazines, but decided to remove the paint from the rifle to sell it.  There is still some paint on the rifle, so the price has been lowered.  It shoots just as accurately as the day I bought it, with 421 rounds through it(bought a 425 pack and lost some at the range).  Nothing really much to say, it's a reliable, accurate plinker. Great for teaching someone how to shoot or for learning how to familiarize one's self with the AR-15 platform. Price is negotiable, but I am selling this at a loss.
