This rifle is in absolutely fantastic condition - less than 500 rounds downrange and meticulously maintained. The P-415 rifles are the absolute top of the line in quality, accuracy and performance. I have listed most of the specs below, but please see POF's website for full details. 

You can see the quality in everything from the machine gun rated Rock Creek barrels with gigantic heat sink barrel nuts to the nickel and chrome coated bolt and bolt carrier group, which virtually eliminates the need for lubrication. This rifle runs extremely clean and cool. You can literally dump a magazine and put your finger on the bolt and it remains cool to the touch. This is an incredible advantage that gas piston rifles have over the direct impingement system found in most traditional ARs.

The rifle will come as pictured, less one exception - the AAC muzzle device seen in the picture will be removed and replaced with the proprietary POF muzzle device that came with the rifle from the factory.

IMPORTANT: Buyer must be legally able to purchase and own a firearm, and be willing to sign a bill of sale. This is a requirement and there are no exceptions. 

I live on the north side of Columbus and can meet anywhere in the city within reason. I am not interested in any trades so please do not ask - your request will not be responded to. I can only post 3 pictures in this listing, but have many more that I would be happy to send upon request.

The asking price is $1,550 cash. I can also accept credit cards securely for a 3% surcharge. I am not interested in trades - the intent is to take cash out of this investment, so to save yourself and myself time, please do not ask. I do have DPMS steel and Magpul PMAG magazines and Midwest Industries and Magpul BUIS sights that I can throw into the package for additional cost if you happen to want/need such items.

Some of the specs are as follows:

Barrel: 
- 16"" Heavy contour, Fluted to reduce weight and Heat 
- 4150 Mil-B-1159F Vanadium Alloy (machinegun rated) 
- 70 Rockwell case hardened heat treated ""5R"" polygonal barrels are 2X harder then Mil-Spec & Hammer Forged barrels

Not many were made in the nickel finish. It still has the original hardwood grips, all original, no dash or M (an ""M"" was added to the model number starting in 1987 if they were sent in for repairs). The gun has no scratches, I've put a few hundred down range, probably less than 500. The original owner fired less than 50 when he bought it new in 1983.

The gun still has its original paperwork and also comes with a handmade leather holster by Classic Old West in El Paso, Texas, as well as a six shot speed loader, six .357 snap caps for dry firing, 19 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense FTX magnums, 30 rounds of various 38 Special, and a large size soft carrying case with a Samsonite chord zipper lock.

I replaced the factory pistol grip with a hogue oversized rubber grip ($15)
Steel quick detach optic mount that allows mounting of a scope or red dot ($30)

About ~1800 rounds higher grade (GT - lubricated non-corrosive FMJ) 7.62 - $550
Primary Arms green dot micro-optic that I’ve barely used but planned to use on that rail - $75.
I probably have 200-300 rounds through it and it runs flawless.   A lot more fun to shoot then an AR in my opinion due to the different recoil systems.  Bigger & cheaper bullets is fun as well!
Total invested with the micro-dot = $1,859
I also purchased two duracoat spray packages as I was going to paint this to make it different.  I think I have “coyote grey” and a “flat dark earth”.  They were both like $40.  I’ll throw one in for the right deal if desired."

444,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3749444,For Sale:  Ammo: .308 German Military Practice Ammunition 1000 Round Case Lot of 20 Boxes Polymer Case & Bullet 3000+ fps $3.78 per 20 round Box Equivalent Price,"Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 189,"Listed On: Monday, April 11, 2016",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Our # AMDM18 Restrictions apply on ammunition shipments to non dealer civilians, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for a factory case of 1,000 rounds. That is the equivalent of 50 twenty round boxes. .308 ammunition, or most any center fire ammunition from commercial US manufacturers runs well over a Dollar a Cartridge. Even practice ammunition, mil-spec loads made by Federal, Winchester, and Remington all approach that dollar mark. Our ammunition in this listing, however, runs less than 19 cents a round. Here is German manufactured practice ammunition that the German Army and Security Agencies use in their G3 Rifles, that we know and love as the HK91. This ammunition is designed for the HK 91 family, including PTR91 Rifles and CETMEs, in conjunction with the replacement bolt adapter kit, which we have, but costs extra. Manufacturer is Deutsche Angestellten Gewerkschaft, DAG, with facilities in several cities in Germany. Construction is one piece molded thick polymer case with a bullet that detaches during firing. Firing is achieved by the steel case head and berdan priming system. Since its case head measures .445 diameter, compared to the normal .469 for .308 ammo, extraction may be an issue in some rifles. The Germans have a roller-less bolt assembly adapter for their G-3 rifles. The payload is the 10 grain range blue polymer bullet, and this ammunition performs similarly to the originals at short ranges. It is potentially lethal out to 300 meters. Test reports show 5 MOA accuracy at 100 meters. This ammunition is potentially lethal out to 300 meters, and it even has tactical applications from its highly reduced ricochet factor. This ammunition is Not corrosive at all, and any polymer fouling is much, much easier to remove from a bore than copper fouling, any day. Most important, recoil is negligible, and the lightweight bolt is easy to install and remove. This ammunition comes in factory sealed cases of 1000 rounds, 10 boxes with 50 rounds to the box, sealed in plastic. We’re offering it at a per-20-round-box-rate of $3.78. Own a 1000 round case for only $ 189.00. Add $89 for a genuine German Made HK91 adapter bolt. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>$15.00 flat fee shipping lower 48 for the whole order. No Returns on Ammunition.

Description

2211-A-BK-LMX

The SureFire 2211® Luminox® WristLight—the first of its kind—offers tactical light output that’s instantly accessible since it is securely strapped to your wrist, and it also boasts an integral Luminox timepiece. This 2211 model—rechargeable like the original—features a high-performance LED whose light is focused by a refractive optic into a broad, intense 300-lumen wall of light designed for tactical situations. Its Swiss-made Luminox timepiece is integrated into a lightweight, rugged body that straps securely to your wrist via a durable rubber wristband, and its watch-face features self-illuminated hands for low-light applications. This is the ultimate hands-free light and watch combination—and it’s ready for any challenge, especially if things go south. 

All 2211 models were developed with input from law enforcement officers and feature brilliant light output that automatically aligns with your pistol when using a standard two-handed grip. This broad, room-filling wall of white light effectively illuminates threats and non-threats at close to medium ranges, and it’s always ready. The revolutionary, versatile 2211 Luminox also provides convenient hands-free illumination in a wide range of low-light applications including close-up work for law enforcement, EMTs and other medical personnel. It is also ideal for industrial professionals, across all trades, since the light from the 2211 is directed where it’s needed and permits the use of two hands. 

The multiple light-output levels of the 2211 Luminox are easy to access via its integral pushbutton switches. Simply press either switch to instantly activate the 300-lumen maximum beam to respond to a sudden threat. Press the switch again, within 0.5 seconds, to activate the low-level 15-lumen setting. Another press of either switch turns the light off. 

Press and hold both ergonomic switches simultaneously to cycle through three levels of useful illumination: 300 lumens of blinding white light for tactical situations; 60 lumens of mid-level illumination great for everyday tasks or nighttime walks; and 15 lumens of low-output light ideal for any situation where low-level light is needed for extended periods of time. Release the switches when the desired level of light is activated; press either switch again to turn the light off. Light output can be programmed to cycle from high- to low-output, or from low to high, depending on your personal preference. 

The integral Luminox timepiece features a classic design, a high-quaity Swiss quartz movement, a unidirectional rotating bezel with timer markings, and self-illuminating tritium hands and markers that glow continuously, for the ultimate in readability in low-light situations. It also boasts a hardened, scratch-resistant mineral crystal, and it’s gasket sealed for water resistance. 

Constructed of lightweight, hard-anodized aerospace aluminum, the 2211 Luminox features a heavy duty rubber wristband that holds the unit securely but comfortably in place. It’s powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a built-in LED fuel gauge that lets you know when it’s time to recharge—which is easily done using the included USB cable. Although it was built for the demanding needs of law enforcement, the 2211 Luminox is available to anyone who wants a one-of-a-kind hands-free illumination tool that’s always ready. 

NOTE: The integral Luminox watch runs on its own lithium disk battery that is unaffected by the USB charger.

Features
High-performance LED and proprietary refractive optic produce a broad beam at three useful levels: 300, 60, and 15 lumens
The press of either ambidextrous pushbutton switch activates the LED on high, or it can be cycled through all levels by pressing both buttons simultaneously
Securely straps to support-hand wrist via a durable rubber wristband for instant access and automatic alignment with pistol when using normal two-handed grip
Integral Luminox watch features self-illuminating dial for low-light readability
High-strength, lightweight aerospace aluminum construction with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for extreme durability
Built-in LED fuel gauge lets you know when to recharge battery
Includes rechargeable lithium-ion battery, micro-USB charge port, and USB charging cable

It’s the only model in the CZ family of bolt action rifles that is chambered for the popular 7.62×39. This cartridge is a top pick for younger shooters for its low recoil and effectiveness on medium sized game such as deer or wild boar out to 200 yards. Both cartridges offered in the 527 Carbine model are economical to shoot given their service rifle heritage.

Built to CIP specifications, our 7.62×39 chambers are ideal for shooting steel-cased surplus ammo. Designed to shoot .311 bullets, some American brass ammo may not perform as well as the imported steel-cased variety because of SAAMI brass dimensions and varying bullet diameters.

In addition, I installed Talon grips (two of the mags has matching Talon grips trim on it, pictured). Talon grips are excellent as you know. This gun is absolutely brand new. Unfired by me, and I like it a lot. But I want a Yugo Zastava AK-47 pistol (had one but had to let it go, regretted ever since).
