These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail."

1941 Sako ""SOV""

First one is a 1941 Sako that was built into a PE/SOV style sniper rifle. The bore is minty, bluing is at about 98%. Note that bolt has been blued as well, IMHO whoever did it had a great idea not only because it's different, but it looks awesome. The person who bent the bolt also did quite a phenomenal job; no weld buildup or anything, all stamps are still visible on bolt body and the knob still has the original matching serial number. Original wartime stock, very clean. Had her out in a field a few weekends ago and shot 1.5"" groups @ about 110ish yards seated indian style, ammo was surplus Russian 147gr. I would have posted the targets, but something happened to them after 12 pounds of tannerite went off. Comes with scope caps, scope cover and sling (which looks like its possibly from a czech or yugo mauser?). The upper brass sling button is missing so I threw on 2 small zip ties just for functionality. 

1944 VKT ""PEM""

This is an M39 with a side-mount PEM scope setup! The base rifle is a '44 VKT with a minty bore and about 90% bluing. The stock was refinished but NOT sanded; just got a coat of stain and light poly. It looks shiny in the pics, but its not really at all, I used a satin finish poly. This rifle also has a blued cleaning rod too, looks to be original finish.The gunsmithing for the mount was done by our own resident sniper 'smith, Tigerman, who did a phenomenal job. The sights on the rifle are off a little to the right, so he lined the scope mount up with them instead of the bore-line. He explained to me that this was sometimes done by master gunsmiths to original 91/30 PEM's. You really can't notice it unless you really look hard at it, and it actually makes the rifle more comfortable to shoulder, since the slightly offset scope allows you to rest more of your cheek on to the comb for a rock solid cheek weld. The mount and scope are brand spankin' new from accumounts. The rifle has a bent bolt from Max Shepherd (outstanding job, I will be buying from him from now on for future projects). I do have the original matching bolt body too that is unmodified.

I have a Spikes Tactical Lightweight AR-15. Little bit about it, I've had it about 2 years now and put less that 300 rounds down range with it. It has a 14.5"" chrome lined barrel and chamber with a 1:7 twist and a YHM Phantom blind pinned to make it 16.2"" (LEGAL), carbine length (9"") Midwest Industries Gen2 free float handrail, Nickel Boron Black Rain Ordinance BCG (brand new haven't fired a shot with it), Spikes Tactical T2 (4.2oz) buffer, Rainier Arms Raptor Gen2 ambi charging handle, Troy ambi safety selector (1 short throw 1 standard length), and a Troy ambi mag release. All that and the gun only weight 6 lbs. unloaded. Included with the gun is 2 Gen2 P-Mags with windows, rear Magpul BUIS, Ergo foward grip, hard Pro-Max case, standard safety, charging handle, and mag release (if you dont like the ambi you can switch them back), and obviously the gun! I would like to make clear that this isnt a cheap or poorly made gun, Spikes Tactical is a very well known and reputable gun maker, and nothing that I have personally done to the gun will effect there work.... So please no junk or low ball offers. If you want anymore pictures or specific pictures feel free to ask. Thanks for looking! 
Side note: This is the SL15 is high shelf unlike the ST15 which is low shelf. Have had a couple people ask so figured I could save the time by putting it in the listing."

 One of the greatest self defense guns ever produced., Like new only fired a few times.

 Made for the very serious business of self-preservation the 605 is built to the Taurus Zero Tolerance standard in design, fabrication, fit and performance. Meaning there is simply no tolerance for parts that do not perform as if someone's life depends on them. Using the powerful .357 Magnum ammo this quick-draw revolver has plenty of muscle to back it up. Features include fixed sights, crisp single-double action trigger and a transfer bar for added safety.

Definite collector's item and most likely the only such scope in the US!!! 

This scope was imported in 1994 as a single dealer sample along with some other optics from the former USSR republic. Intended for long distance hunting/target shooting this scope is a fixed 12x magnification with large 50mm lens, providing vastly superior image compared to the variable power scopes. Purple-yellowish coating similar to the high end Schmidt & Bender and Zeiss scopes (Soviets used Zeiss/Jena coating and optical technology captured after the WWII). 1-click = 1/5 MOA. 1"" tube.

The scope is in used condition with minor scratches on the body (none on the glass). Both protective lens cover are included. No carry case, no scope rings. Do not miss the opportunity to own this rare scope with image quality comparable to scopes costing over $1000 for a fraction of price!

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. 
- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components 
- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm) 
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories (carry Handle NOT Included).
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- 1 magazine is standard.
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

I have just had knee surgery and am putting this out there mostly to pass time and maybe make a trade with someone Local or willing to come over this way. I am willing to include this ammo if i am trading for a different caliber gun with ammo, otherwise i will probably need to keep it and just do a gun trade. I'm not really looking for a hunting rifle or shotgun but if the trade is great i might be able to be persuaded? 
Thanks for taking a look all.
Take care

It includes the TA51 mount. Modifications to this Special Forces model include a back up iron sight configuration that includes an integral rear ghost ring aperture and a tritium glow-in-the-dark front sight(Yellow Center Illumination) for close-combat/back-up sighting, and includes Flat Top Adapter, Backup Iron Sights and Dust Cover. The Trijicon acog TA01NSN 4x32 Scope was designed specifically for the US Special Operations Command SOPMOD M4 Carbine. To meet their requirements, the reticle bullet drop compensator and range finding stadia lines are based on the trajectory of the 62 grain bullet from a 16 inch M4A1 barrel. The ACOG TA01NSN is a compact and ruggedly designed scope and a valuable addition to any rifle - comparable to optical sights issued to British and Canadian Armed Forces. The finest optical design, 100% U.S. made components and Mil-C-14806A multi-layer coated glass elements make the ACOG the ultimate telescopic sight. The black daytime reticle in the Trijicon Scope ACOG TA01NSN 4x32 glows red at night and in low light due to its tritium composition. Forged aircraft aluminum housings - the same material as the M16 receivers - are precision machined and hard anodized to match the finish of the M16. Unique to the Trijicon TA01NSN is its internal adjustment capability - only the prism housing moves - making this the most rugged scope available. The ACOG will withstand exposure to temperature extremes, salt spray, fog, fungus, humidity, sand, dust, shock vibration and a free fall drop onto a hard surface. Aerospace seals make the ACOG waterproof to depths greater than 500 feet. A hole through the M16 integral base permits use of the iron sights without removal of the scope. It can be attached to the carrying handle with one or two screws (2nd screw is optional). The user does not need to make any special adjustments between shots at different ranges. The ranging is already built into the reticle pattern (parallax free along its vertical axis). The width of the horizontal lines corresponds to the height of a 19 inch silhouette at that range."

It's not pristine on the outside but still a good shooter. The grips alone sell for over $300. Fits in your pants pocket, purse or?? Light weight and 6-round magazine. Known as the Model ‘N’ internally within Colt, the 1908 Vest Pocket is a diminutive 4.5 inches long, and sports a 2 inch barrel. Weighing a mere 13 ounces, it is fed by a six round single column magazine. The pistol’s fixed open iron sights were rather small and rudimentary, but typical for small hideout automatics of its era and adequate for the short range at which it was intended to be used. The Model 1908, has a standard slide-locking safety catch, as well as a grip safety.

A piece of American history to be had with a 5-digit serial number.Manufactured around end of 1910. Has two-toned magazine and crimped well. The bottom of the magazine has ""25 auto Colt"" on it. Make me an offer. I also have a few boxes of 25 ammo (150rounds). Be reasonable and don't insult me.

""BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
 In the world of Browning,  the name ""Medallion"" is not tossed around lightly. Medallion means beauty, strength and function. The A-Botl Medallion epitomizes this idea offering a beautiful rifle with high gloss Walnut and blueing in a package with a super strong and accurate action.


• STOCK ◦ The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
◦ A durable gloss finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.

• ACTION/BARREL ◦ Durable polished blued steel for a striking appearance.
◦ Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
◦ The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
◦ Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
◦ Glass bedding provides stable and precise fit for the action, eliminating accuracy degrading physical stress.
◦ Drilled and tapped for scope mounts - optic ready platform
◦ 60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
◦ Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld."" Browning."

The SIG SAUER® P230® is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P230 is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 19oz in the Blued version, the sleek single-stack P230 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today.
