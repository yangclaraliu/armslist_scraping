This last Christmas 12/13 I bought the promag stock for my round receiver 1939 mosin nagant 91/30. The rifle comes with max Shepard bent bolt with the safety key ring installed and it has the rock solid industries scope mount installed that was drilled and tapped by a professional gunsmith and tube promag stock comes with a 5 rounds detachable magazine .  I have removed the front sight and the rear sight because I use a scope when shooting this rifle no need for sights.  I fired about  30-40 rounds through it after the stock conversion.  Only reason I'm selling is because  I need to pay some bills. The rifle does NOT come with the bipod or scope pictured. Feel free to email me with any questions or if you want more pictures. I'm looking to get about 425$ or best offer please don't insult me thought it would cost more to build this gun with all the parts I have listed. Buyer pays all fees and I'll only deliver local.  Thanks for looking

The upper is a factory built Rock River Arms Predator Pursuit with a 16 inch heavy barreled Wylde chamber 1 in 8 twist. This will stabilize about the entire range of .223 bullet weights and chamber either .223 or 5.56 NATO. It has a picatinney rail on top of the gas block for mounting of a BUIS or light/laser etc and is currently protected by a rail ladder The bolt and carrier are chromed for reliability and ease of cleaning, the charge handle is a BCM extended catch for ease of charging with a scope. I had the free floated fore end ceramicoated in FDE to complete the two tone by HD Hydrographics in Redmond. Bi-pod is a Harris with the swivel and notched legs and enough extension to clear the ground when using a 30 round mag. Magazine is a 30 round Magpul PMAG in FDE with black Ranger Plate. The scope is a Vortex PST 2.5-10X32 with the EBR-1 (MRAD) reticle. It is a first focal plane and has 10 illumination settings. Graduated in MOA and very clear optics. Small front objective keeps your signature down, and power is low enough for rapid acquisition or medium to long range precision. Comes with the original box, paperwork, covers, scope cloth and all. It is mounted on a set of Warne Maxima steel rings with quick disconnects, also with original packaging. Package will come with the Soft-Armor tactical bag which has 5 STANAG magazine pouches and a large accessory pouch, nice reinforced carry strap, and heavy reliable padding and zipper. Also included is the 3.5 boxes of Hornady match ammo, 75 grain boat tail, perfect for this gun and the installed single point bungee sling. This gun is ridiculous accurate, I regularly shoot 12 GA. hulls off fence posts at 150 yards, it is nothing but the best of the best for an accuracy AR-15."

The Michael Morris Knife is hand made from an old file and comes with a leather sheath. Dated 6/17/10 This knife is very sharp and it stays sharp. It needs a bit more care than a normal knife because it will rust. At one point in my adventures the knife actually cut through the bottom of the sheath as visible in the picture. A little thread should fix this without a problem though.

The M1918 Trench knife replica is just a replica, blade seems a little flimsy to me and does not hold an edge. The handle is cast brass and has a fair heft to it. Its a good talking piece or paperweight.

Asking $140 for the Mike Morris Knife and $20 for the Trench Knife
$150 for both.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

You can find RIA double stacks with GI sights and grip safety, but no rail, or you can find their single stacks with all the goodies, but obviously with the limited capacity. You cannot find these on Gunbroker or Armslist (except for this one). Those closest thing you'll find is the Para USA Black Ops with the half rail for about $1100. This pistol has been 100% reliable and comes with a lifetime factory warranty should it need service. I don't want to say that this pistol is a one of a kind, but this model is definitely scarce. 

If you're out of state I'll ship on your dime, which should be under $20 unless you want insurance,plus a $10 FFL transfer. Respond to this ad with any questions."

I have an Alexander Arms 6.5 Grendel M4 carbine that has been test fired with 20 rounds of Hornady 123grn AMAX. The carbine has a 14.5 barrel (believed to be made by Sabre Defense) with a welded and pinned 1.5inch flash hider to bring this to the legal minimum limit of 16 inches.  Alexander Arms has discontinued the production of this type of upper and barrel length. The value of the carbine is $1499.00 approximately as they no longer offer this barrel length. The carbine comes with a silicon cleaning cloth, instruction manual, (1) ten round magazine, brand new rear Troy Back Up Iron Sight, and KNS anti-rotation pins. If you are concerned about ammo or magazines. I have two boxes of 123 grain Hornady AMAX and four Alexander Arms branded magazines that would be added to the offer. If you live in Colorado then I can only supply the ten round magazine. Same thing for those of you behind enemy lines in other draconian states (New York-Mass, Ect). The ammo is still in the case it was shipped in and is valued at $24.00 per box of twenty and the magazines are worth $20.00 each. If you decide that this offer is something you would like to move forward with then I will ship the carbines through my FFL to your FFL once payment has been made. I do have multiple photos to be emailed to you if you are interested.

These rifles are made with a forged receiver and chromed barrel. Early guns had issues with excessive bolt wear, so this lightly used rifle was machined and had an new LRB bolt installed by Warbird custom guns in Texas as soon as I purchased it to be proactive. This rifle is safe to shoot with .308.

Then I had the gas system unitized, and it comes equipped with a Sadlak TiN gas piston and spring guide, a GI walnut stock bedded and a match trigger job done on the commercial Springfield armory trigger pack with a Sadlak extended mag release. It has a low Bassett machine scope mount with a brand new Leatherwood 1.5x6 42mm scope.

Rifle comes with  1 25rd mag, 10 20rd mags, 1 5rd mag, A Springfield Armory scout mount and hand guard not attached, M14 cleaning tools and wrenches and a blank firing adapter NIW.

Clearing out some stuff...
Comes with 2 mags full of ammo and 2 boxes (100 Rds) 9mm ammo, extra set wood grips and original box and paper work.

The 639 is a super reliable and practically indestructable 9mm pistol. The stainless steel frame minimizes recoil. Full length 4"" barrel. Single stack is perfect for smaller hands. This is a 2nd Generation Smith with the BEST trigger I've ever experienced on a Smith. DA/SA with decocker and mag safety. Adjustable rear sight. Has a beautiful set of custom cocobolo grips on it, and comes with the original wood grips as well as Pachmyer rubber grips. Comes with 4 8-rd magazines total. I will even throw in my last 50rd box of Winchester Ranger T-series.

Looks great aside from a few small scratches next to the slide stop/takedown pin from the prior owner. I would call it Excellent condition overall. I fired 100 rounds of assorted HP at the range without a single issue. Good grouping at 30 feet. Very solid and reliable pistol. This is an early version with the rounded trigger guard.

The early version of the 639 is widely considered to be the best 9mm S&W ever made. It was manufactured only 2 years and they do not come up for sale very often. Later versions with the squared trigger guard and ambi decocker are of lesser quality. This is one of the best 9mm pistols you can own, and I will regret parting with it.

Comes with the original box with instructions as other papers. Comes with one six round mag, and one seven round mag, plus 7 rounds of Hornady Personal Protection Premium HP ammo which sells for over a dollar per round. 
The 1st round must be chambered by locking back slide, then inserting mag, then releasing slide lock. This is a common issue with PM9'S but don't let that fool you, The pm9 is still one of the best/most reliable carry 9mm you can get. I've never had a single round jam out of a few hundred. I just don't like carrying a firearm that doesn't have a safety, and required that I carry with a round chambered.

Gun is marked Germany on left side, indicating export sales, probably to the US market.  This pistol is in 30 Luger caliber, and is properly marked with the ""Crown N"" commercial proofs.  All numbers match,and the gun is absolutely original.  Includes a proper wood base magazine, with unnumbered base.  The gun has minor high point wear, but retains most of the original straw on trigger, extractor, takedown lever and magazine release.  Has unmarked chamber and DWM marked toggle.  Original wood grips are in very nice shape, with strong checkering and only very minimal smoothing. Bore is excellent, with strong, bright rifling.  The included magazine does not hold the magazine release open on the gun, but the gun functions perfectly with other magazines, so the issue is with the magazine spring, not with the gun.  An excellent 1920 DWM Commercial, completely original, and from a very old collection.  Please call us at REDACTED between 10-6 Monday-Saturday, or email us after hours!

8 shot 357 mag. If you are into competition shooting, this is a gun for you.  If you are looking for a good home defense gun, this is the ticket.  Don't worry about feeding issues with your semi-auto and the defense rounds, use something truly reliable.  This thing has such little recoil with the compensator, you'll hardly notice the recoil of the magnum loads. 
 This model holds the world record for fastest 6 shots out of a revolver onto target, fastest 8 shots out of a revolver onto a target (1 second), and fastest 6 shots-reload-6 shots onto target out of a revolver (2.99 seconds).

SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights.

The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

Fortunately, I didn't trade much for it.  Looking around, there seem to be a lot of fakes out there, and plenty of slimeballs selling them as real ones.  I was told by several folks that mine is the best looking fake clone they have seen, so be careful.  That being said, even being a fake, it's still pretty impressive.

I've had really good luck with folks on armslist, so hopefully I can provide some tips for spotting a fake.  Easiest is to go to youtube and search ""Benchmade Infidel - Fake Vs. Real.""  In summary:

1.  The clip was the only visual giveaway on mind.  The real ones have a butterfly on the bent clip at the tip, and mine does not.  The anodizing of the letters is also different.

2.  The fake ones are a lot heavier.  Of course, you can only tell this if you are buying face to face.  The real ones way about 5 ounces (per manufacturer).  My clone is 7.5 ounces...pretty significant.

3.  There are apparently some other finish differences, though I am told mine is a pretty darn good match.

Hope all this helps.  I am still willing to sell it, if nothing else, to keep this listing active and educate folks.  Do your homework!"

This Century International Arms imported WWII rifle is a Izhevsk made Russian M91/30 Mosin Nagant in 1943 with a great bore. All serial #'s match on the Bolt, Butt Plate, Trigger Guard, & Receiver. This rifle is in good condition by NRA standards and shoots just as it should, which is to say that it is extremely accurate shooting the Russian surplus ammo I purchased. I still have a bulk of that ammo available for purchase if you're looking to buy quality ammo at a reduced price. I meticulously removed cosmoline from every nook and cranny on this rifle-- which was laid on thick when I received it. Comes with a plastic case and everything pictured. 

These are very durable, reliable and accurate rifles. It also looks very impressive with the bayonet extended. The M91/30 rifle was developed after the Germans overran and killed thousands of Soviet soldiers equipped with the M38 carbine which had no provisions for a bayonet. The M91/30 was intended to be issued to all soldiers, replacing not only carbines but rifles as well. The M91/30 was used by many countries following the war, and was a favorite of the Israeli Haganah.

Excellent gun, I've put maybe 300 rounds through it and never had a single issue. I love the gun, but can't get used to carrying a full size 1911.

Here's the full description from Sig:

The 1911 STX from the SIG SAUER Custom Shop is a two-tone 1911 that’s loaded with features. This non-railed pistol features a Nitron® slide over a Natural Stainless frame and is accented by beautiful custom wood grips. The slide is further accented by polished cocking serrations and a Flat Top which enhances the two-tone aspect of this pistol. The slide is topped off with adjustable combat night sights while the frame is outfitted with a magwell for fast smooth reloads. The all stainless steel frame and slide of the STX are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance. The frame features 25-line per inch checkering on the front strap – while the mainspring housing has 20-line per inch checkering – and both the frame and slide are de-horned for comfortable full-size carry. Like all SIG SAUER products the 1911 STX pistol contains only premium internal parts including a match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. For safety the 1911 STX features a beavertail grip safety with speed bump, extended ambidextrous thumb safety, firing pin safety and hammer intercept notch and ships in a plastic gun case with cable lock.

The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."
