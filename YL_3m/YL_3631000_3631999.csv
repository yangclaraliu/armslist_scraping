The competition bug has bit me. I am looking to spend some money on some new gear and so this has to go.

I purchased this in early June of this year. I can't remember round count so let us just call it less than 500 rounds. 

This pistol is awesome and it is absolutely the best 9mm pistol I have ever owned. Fit and finish is second to none!

It includes everything it came with new and includes two 15 rounds magazines. (I have extra magazines that I will sell for $30 each)

Retail on these is $1295 but street price is right around $1000 for new. I am asking $850 FIRM. Email me for more info. All laws followed. Buyer required to provide positive ID, NC PPP or CHP and sign a bill of sale. We will both get copies of the BOS. Prefer a face to face meeting near Winston-Salem or I can ship on your dime to your FFL.

Check out the pictures. I will throw in 3 Ruger brand 25 round magazines, along with everything that comes stock with the rifle (10 round mag, manuals, some sort of lock thingy???, a cool bag to carry it all in, and a rail for mounting optics). The receiver is drilled for the rail (which I thought was nice) so you can use irons or throw on your favorite rim fire scope. The barrel quickly detaches from the receiver for easy and compact storage.

If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

The West may have been tamed and fenced long ago, but its unbridled spirit lives on in this line of traditional big-bore Henry rifles.

 All are SASS approved so Cowboy Action shooters who enjoy stepping back to that bygone era can use them in competition.

Don’t let the retro look fool you, these rifles are much more than shootin’ irons for today’s new breed of cowboy.

They’re also the unbeatable choice of big-game hunters who prefer the traditional look, feel, reliability and accuracy that comes from an authentic Henry rifle.

The traditional 20″ octagonal barrel is outfitted with a classic fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear sight with a reversible white diamond insert and a brass beaded front sight. The tubular magazine tops off at 10 rounds.

Both the straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted of select American walnut accented with a brass barrel band and Henry’s recognizable brass receiver. All have that crisp, smooth action that sets an authentic American-made Henry apart from other lever action rifles on the range and in the woods today.

Henry’s brass-framed Big Boy outshone Winchester’s Trail’s End nearly everywhere: accuracy, smoothness, and trigger function. 

Winner of Outdoor Life’s 2004 Best Rifles and Shotguns

“The Henry Big Boy received the highest score ever given to a centerfire lever action rifle in Outdoors Life’s Annual New Gun Test. “It’s slick, trouble free operation also helped earn it the best score ever given to a rifle of this type.
