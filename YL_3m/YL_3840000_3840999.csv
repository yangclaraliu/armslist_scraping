This is a totally new, unfired item, assuming you want to buy it.  I have dropped the price a bit, but this is it.  I have received a couple of angry emails about the listing, which certainly surprised me (so forgive the sarcastic tone here).  

For the crybabies out there who have been really wanting this gun, if you do not want to pay the listed price, please go complain to someone else (maybe your mother, as I assume you still live in the basement).  Yes, the gun is priced less on several retail websites, but try finding one in stock.  I am asking LESS than what I just paid for it, which is of course, more than the ""MSRP"".   For some reason this seems to upset some people. 

I am not interested in trades and my price is firm.  If this upsets you, I am sorry for hurting the feelings of your inner child.

I follow Illinois law on in-state handgun transfers.  If you tell me you want it, clock starts.  I'll need a copy of your FOID.  Thanks (at least to you all of you grown ups!) :-)"

I purchased this rail not to long ago with the intentions of putting it on my AR15. Turns out its longer than i wanted it to be so i would like to get rid of it to fund getting the shorter version. Never shot with it on my rifle. Only installed it and uninstalled it. All parts and original packaging included. No knicks, dings or scratches whatsoever. 


The Geissele Super Modular Rail MK4 (SMR) was designed as an ultra light weight rail system for the M4 Carbine and all mil-spec AR-15 variants. The SMR MK4 was designed to do a good job in meeting the ten design specifications for a good M4 weapon rail with an emphasis on weight reduction."

Title says it all. Impossible to find OD Green furniture. Choate no longer makes their Mark 5 stock and forend in OD but only in black and orange. The stock and forend are color injected through and through; and not painted or cerakoted. 

Why own a plain Jane shotgun that everyone else has when you can own a unique shotgun sure to make others green with envy? (pun intended)

Solid reliable zombie stopper.

The Colt patent markings on the side of the frame are done in a flowing banner style. The back shields of the frame have floral motif. Quite striking! Gun also features the typical 1 marking on the bottom of the frame and on the bottom of the grip strap indicating it is a specially produced gun intended for engraving. 42,XXX serial range with all matching numbers. Retains virtually all of the cylinder scene. Dlx grips are quite stunning with virtually all the high gloss piano finish lacquer remaining. There were a number of London model 1851 Navy revolvers in the 42000 serial range that were unsold at the time that the Civil War was developing in this country about 1860-1861. I believe this gun was returned to the US. The reason is because it appears to have some Civil War markings on the bottom of the grip such as ""Company D 1862"" and on the right heel is scratched "" J K 22 MI"". Beautifully cased in an English style case featuring the original cleaning rod, nipple tool, loading tool, Colt Navy flask by James Dickson as well as a percussion cap box. The case is lined with red velour and in near excellent condition. Showing only a minimal amount of handling. Gun retains a considerable amount of high gloss polished blue finish on the bbl as well as on the cylinder. The trigger guard is of iron which all the London Navy were made of and retains a considerable amount of silver plate. Traces of case colors on the frame and the engraving is fantastic. One of the fanciest Colts I think I have seen. Excellent plus inside and out. Hard to beat."

1) Zastava M70a Tokarev in 9mm

This is little warhorse is great a gun. Based off the battle-proven TT-33 of the Soviet Union, this gun just won't quit. Almost unchanged from WW2 except for it's 9x19 caliber, thumb safety and additional magazine capacity. I LOVE this gun but need something with just a little shorter barrel for CC. Could count how much I've shot it on one hand. 

2)Rossi ""Ranch Hand"" in .357 magnum/.38 special

Now THIS guy will turn heads at the range. The only time I took it to the range, 2 gentleman came up to me and commented how it looks like Woody Harrelson's character's gun in the movie ""Zombieland"". It just begs to be handled. It's a neat gun and I love the aesthetics but I don't live on a ranch and it's time to get something that will fill a role for me. Bought it at the gun show and have only shot it once!

Looking to get $250 for the Zastava and $400 for the ranch hand, or hit me with a trade! Worst I'll do is say no.

This is a military surplus gun so there is some holster wear but they are built very solid and it's in good working condition. It's a small pistol, similar to a PPK, but very heavy because it's all steel. I replaced the springs when I bought it because they are often worn out on surplus pistols and I've put less than 500 rounds through it so you won't have to worry about that. The trigger pull is heavy in double action but very light and easy in single action. 2 magazines are included.
Since this pistol was purchased using my FFL03 license I will require a copy of your Wisconsin drivers license for my records at the time of trade.

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

These rifles are hard to find with the ""Son"". Mr. Lamb had (2) sons and both eventually went into business with him but the W Lamb and Son was only stamped for a couple of years making this a scarce signature. The lock plate is signed Smith and Roberts.

This is a nice piece and the craftsmanship on this rifle is great. The condition is good for its age as well with some normal scratches, light rust and pitting, but the pictures never do justice to the actual piece. The rod looks original to the piece as it has the same amount of wear and is matched to this type of rifle but I am not sure. The overall length of the gun is a little over 55 inches with a 40 inch barrel. The barrel is marked W Lamb & Son and has IIII marked in the barrel as well.

I  will answer any type of questions you may have to the best of my knowledge.

This is an ANTIQUE gun and DOES NOT require and FFL. This gun SHOULD also be checked by a GUNSMITH before any attempt to fire it.
