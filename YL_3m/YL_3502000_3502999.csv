The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.



The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

They chamber the power of the .45 ACP and are fitted with custom features that make them an exceptional value. 

CDPs are some of the most successful pistols Kimber has ever produced, and certainly the most copied. Others have dressed up a basic 1911 to look like a CDP, suggesting it is as good as a Kimber and selling it for a lower price. They may be able to copy the look but no company can match Kimber quality and performance. There is also a certain irony in the suggestion that you should trust your life to the low bidder.

Each CDP has 30 lines-per-inch checkering on the front strap as well as under the trigger guard for a positive grip. A match grade Premium Aluminum Trigger is consistent from shot to shot. Stainless steel small parts like the slide release, magazine release and beavertail grip safety, plus hand-checkered double diamond rosewood grips compliment the two-tone matte finish.

The 1911 is proven to be the most dependable semi-automatic platform for a carry pistol, and Kimber makes the best 1911. Don’t trust your life to anything less than the best. Meprolight Tritium three dot night sights and an ambidextrous stainless steel thumb safety are standard CDP features.

The price is current, I believe you can expect to pay this amount if you buy one new online and have it shipped to you, or if you can find a new one in a store locally. If you don't agree, don't contact me about it, you will not get a reply, just go buy one elsewhere. Your getting an almost new rifle that has already been test fired and has shown no firing issues. I'll include one (as new) 30 round mag (might not be the one pictured) and the bayonet that came with it....The rifles in very nice shape, I'm not a dealer, just a private individual that's trying to thin the herd.... I've bought some more expensive AK's since and no longer need this one. It's had maybe 5 or 6 hundred rounds through it in all, the sights are straight... It was no problem to sight in, it accepts many different mags and drums, I've tried most of the mags you're likely to find both metal and poly with no problem, though I don't have any pmags. I would say all mags fit but there may be a strange one out there that doesn't fit well. The magwell is tight with no mag wobble issues... The finish is in great shape with no scratches other than the normal ones from the slides, no rust or other finish issues. Outfitted with small tapco flash suppressor, trigger, and stock that also has an extender pad. There's a scope mount. The rifle has a triangle with an arrow in it that is pointing up and 1966 both to the left of and separate from the rest of the serial number on the front trunnion. It looks like the Russian Izmash arsenal symbol, but why would a Russian trunnion be on a Romanian rifle? I believe the 1966 may be the original manufacture date of the trunnion???...If the ads up I've got it, can't answer email at work sorry, I will answer between 5 & 10 pm M-F and throughout the day on weekends....

I  have two AK 74's I'm listing. Click above on Other Listings to see the other. This one is a unfired Waffen Works that I bought from Classic Firearms about a month ago. It's new enough that it doesn't have the receiver issues they were having last year when they first started making their own receivers. I bought this one as a backup for the other and haven't got around to firing it yet.  A friend has finally decided to sell me his  Poly Tech so the 74's must go....They both have original plum poly furniture, not aftermarket.  They are both from the Circle 10 Arsenal, and they both are (all) matching numbers.They both have chrome lined barrels, this barrel is U.S. made exclusively for Classic Firearms, you can find out more about it on their website. The rifles listed on their site for $689. I payed almost $40 to have it shipped and another $20 for transfer. So I've got $750 in it and that's what I want for it.  Low ball offers will not be answered. In addition to the rifles I have a dozen Russian and Bulgarian mags that are barely used like new or new, still working on the prices for those probably $20 or $25 for most with a rifle purchase, may add $5 w/o I really have priced them lately.  One unnumbered mag will be included with each rifle. The other 10 are numbered circle 10,21,25, the Bakelite has a 29 and I have a 35 that looks to be Bakelite under black paint . I have a 3 mag pouch with two number 2's and a number 1 in it. All mags have metal lugs. I have 4 cans of ammo. One is Russian circa 1979. The other 3 are Bulgarian circa 1992. I'll probably sell the Russian for $200 with a rifle purchase and the Bulgarians for $250 with a rifle purchase. May add $50 w/o a rifle purchase, I don't really know what their going for, I haven't priced them since they were banned. I won't sell the mags or ammo b4 I sell the rifles but if you're interested in just those drop me a line and I'll hold onto your info. I check email in the evening only... So it may take a little while for me to reply...."

FAILZERO tactical weapon upgrade parts are treated with UCT Coatings' patented, military-proven EXO Technology.

I have about 100rds through the rifle with no issues. The bolt  knob did go flying off during the first couple of rounds but it was loose to start. I made a new bolt know and silver soldered. I drilled and tapped the night sights and added some screws with tritium I put together so it would have night sights. It comes with 6 magazines also reparked. 
 The barrel is a 1-12"" twist so doesn't shoot green tips well but eats all 55gr rounds with no issues. The bullet guide is alittle loose but it is not going anywhere and has not caused any problems.

It needs more love than I know how to give it, though I did get it up and running. There are new plugs, boots and wires; a full oil and coolant flush and fill; the clutch master cylinder has been rebuilt along with the clutch slave and push rod. The second gear is going to need some TLC (can be skipped over for now), and the body panels should probably be replaced. As is typical of this model, the studs on the back of the panels are wearing or broken. Also, someone hit the tank once upon a time, so there is a dent around the gas cap. If you're handy with such things it should be easily fixable. The engine runs great and goes FAST! Top speed for this cruiser when it was new was in excess of 190!! With a bit of love, and a lot of guts, I'm sure it can get there again soon. The magna still has a lot of power though, so don't let its age fool you. 

The saddle bags are part of the deal, and I cannot be convinced to let you take the bike without them. Sorry about that. I have a clean Colorado title for this bike so it's ready for you to take it to the DMV and get new plates and ride on. Beware though, as I said, this bike is FAST, and is a bit more than I'm willing to undertake right now. If you have the need for speed then this is your bike.  This bike is taking up more room in my garage than I can manage, and the wife never really wanted me to have it anyway."

I was going to mount it on my AR but decided to go a different route with my build. By far the brightest light I have ever owned and you can't look at it without totally blinding yourself. It was removed from the packaging and my wife threw it out before I realized I needed it. Absolutely new and mint condition.

The powerful and versatile SureFire X300 Ultra WeaponLight for handguns and long guns features a high-performance LED that generates 500 lumens of stunning white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The virtually indestructible and highly efficient LED generates tactical-level light—more than enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision—for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. 

Activating the X300 Ultra is done via ambidextrous switching located at the rear of body, providing one-finger control — press the switch on either side for momentary-on activation, flip up or down for constant-on activation. Optional DG grip switches (for pistols) and a pressure activated XT07 tape switch (for long guns) permit the X300 Ultra to be activated without altering your grip on your weapon. 

The X300 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock® system permits rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof."
