What I have for sale is a nice 08 Yamaha Raptor 700R. What comes with the quad is the following.
* Brand new sprockets (front and rear) and a Renthal DID chain with approx 1-2hours on them.
* Both sets of tires (holeshot HDs for trail/mud, and some slicks for like flat track racing) have approx 4-5 hours on each.
* Rims on the quad are T-9 Pro series lightweight rims. there is also a set of rear rims still on the flat track tires so you can switch back and forth in a matter of 10mins between tires.
* Power commander V
* Barkers true dual exhaust.

There is some stress marks on the plastic just from every day riding. there is just normal quad wear and tear like some scuff marks from riding boots on the lower part of the frame. The tail section has a plastic clip that holds the bottom half to the top half together broke when i picked up on the loading bar to load it in my truck so theres a half inch gap in between the plastics which doesnt affect anything. This quad isnt a garage queen its been rode like it was meant to therefore does have some small cosmetic blemishes but nothing that effects daily riding.

*Update* I did take it out for one last ride and the rear axle bearings went out. it isnt a huge fix (55$ for bearings (Link: https://www.rockymountainatvmc.com/p/911/571/All-Balls-Rear-Axle-Bearing-and-Seal-Kit?v=6744 ) and local shop quoted 1.5hours of labor at 60$/hr to fix it. so all in all 90$ for labor and 55$ for all the bearings and seals making it a 145$ fix. i dont have much time to get around to fixing it with my job so i knocked 250$ off the price.
Also no title, never recieved one with the four wheeler, but i have the bill of sale from original owner and will copy this if youd like a copy for filing for lost title. It isnt street legal so never needed a title for anything.

if you have questions feel free to text me (cell in the first line of listing).

What is the BOSS?
Browning's Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System (BOSS) is a patented breakthrough in rifle accuracy. When any rifle is fired, the barrel goes through a series of vibrations as the bullet leaves the muzzle. The variations of these vibrations greatly affect the accuracy of the rifle.

The guns specifically I am looking for are the Centure WASR 10 and AK63D AK type rifles in 7.62x39, the Rossi M92 lever action in .357 magnum, or a Remington 870 manufactured prior to 2007.

Prices are negotiable but I am well aware of the current market value and sale prices of these firearms so be reasonable with your prices. WASR 10s are currently going about $480-500 brand new, with AK63Ds being $650 new, M92s being $500 new, and 870s being $350 new. 

Other ideas include the Century PW87 shotgun, a used Saiga .308, a used PTR 91, other non-Yugo AKs, maybe a 590a1 or used but good semi-auto shotgun

I may consider other similar offers as well, those are just some of the things I could think of right now."

Looking local first before I order it offline. Not going to pay more for a used rifle than what I can buy new for. So Anyone offering a used Colt for 2K can keep it. 

Not looking for anything with all kinds of junk on it, unless the lights optics, or accessories are of top quality. In other words if you have a bunch of UTG, BSA, or similar junk on it I am not interested.

What is the BOSS?
Browning's Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System (BOSS) is a patented breakthrough in rifle accuracy. When any rifle is fired, the barrel goes through a series of vibrations as the bullet leaves the muzzle. The variations of these vibrations greatly affect the accuracy of the rifle. Controlling these vibrations will greatly control the accuracy of the rifle. Browning's BOSS allows you to control the vibrations of your barrel so you can shoot groups you didn't think possible."

This is a Gen I Glock 19 that has had the grip cut down to accept G26 mags for concealed carry. Includes one 11 rnd. G26 mag with a Pearce +1 extension and one 15 rnd. G19 mag with X-Grip. Trijicon night sights are dim, but serviceable.

A brand new custom holster from Big Rob’s Gun Leather ($75 value) is available to the buyer for an additional $50.

This custom Glock is an outstanding CCW pistol. Reliable, accurate, and easy to carry. The grip reduction work runs as much as $300 from nationally known gunsmiths. This is an outstanding bargain for someone seeking “Glock Perfection” in a very slick package.  

$425 cash FTF in PDX only. Buyers must be at least 21 years old and have valid OR ID/DL. Buyer must be willing to fill out a bill of sale. No trades, no prohibited persons, cash only.  Price is firm. Contact me if you’re ready to purchase.  

No tire kickers. If you aren't serious, don't waste my time with unsolicited commentary, lowball offers, or other nonsense. I'll talk to anyone who is serious about buying, but I do not have time to have pointless conversations about the merits of the modification.

PS for all you Glock fan boys out there who need to tell me it was a crime to cut this gun, re-read that last part again. I acquired this gun from a well known gunsmith who is also a Glock armorer, and I bought it on the appeal of the modification to me. It's as it was when I purchased it from the 'smith. You don't like it, fine, just move on. Glocktalk is the place for you."

It's chambered for the powerful 7.62x25 round.

It's one of the good ones that was imported some time ago then put away in it's original importers box. Unlike the ones coming in now with ""dark but shootable"" bores this one has a pristine, bright & shiny bore.

It was an issued pistol but obviously saw little use. It's in excellent overall condition and I rate it 95%+. There is some slight wear around the muzzle from being holstered and a few small handling marks, but you really have to look close to see them. Grips have no chips, cracks or noticeable wear. Mechanical function is 100%.

Pistol comes with 3 original magazines - all in excellent shape. A leather lanyard, cleaning rod and 1 sealed box of 72 rounds of real Romanian military 7.62x25 ammo.

The there is also an original Romainian military dark brown leather flap holster in great shape. Plus a rather unusual skeletoized holster in a light tan colored leather that holds the pistol and a spare mag. I've heard this style holster referred to as a ""Communist Minimalist"" holster. No matter what you call it - its in great shape too and is very cool and quite uncommon.

Price for the whole outfit is $375 FTT with pickup in the Brandon area by a Florida resident at least 21 years old.

I know you can buy a dark bore version of this pistol now for about. $239. Then add $20 for handpick and another $25 or $30 for shipping. Plus whatever your dealer will charge to transfer. So add it all up and I think you'll find my price fair and reasonable - especially with the third mag, ammo and the extra holster."

Doing transfer through Rapid Fire Bunker in Littleton.  You pay their 25 dollar transfer fee as well as the states 10 dollar background check.  So total out the door would be $685

In 1996 Colt said that the enhanced version was too expensive thus the XSE's were introduced.  You can still buy a Series 80 (see Colt’s website) but not the enhanced version.  You can Google “Colt MK IV Series 80 Enhanced” and read all you wish about it and its history."

Pocket pistols and handguns geared towards concealed carry typically lack the features of their larger, easier to shoot service pistol counterparts. That's all changed with the introduction of the Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380 Automatic.  With an actual set of full sized adjustable sights, a practical thumb safety, and a functional slide stop, you aren't giving up anything by switching to a smaller sidearm - except the hassles of carrying a large gun. Unlike most pocket pistols, the slide on the Bodyguard .380 stays open on the last shot. Takedown and maintenance are easy, thanks to the simple to use disassembly lever.  The Bodyguard is uniquely engineered to be the most state of the art, concealable and accurate personal protection handgun possible. Lightweight, simple to use, and reliable - nothing protects like a Bodyguard.  Specifications and Features: .380 ACP 2.75"" Barrel 6 Round capacity Manual thumb safety Double action High strength polymer frame Stainless steel barrel and slide, Melonite-coated Black finish Ergonomic grip Extended finger tab Stainless steel drift adjustable sights"

The pistol was developed in the late 1950s at the Institute for Artillery Research, which later became the Military Institute of Armament Technology. The P-64 is also known as the CZAK. ICN#1849, 1850, 1851 & 1852 The P-64 is a double-action blowback-operated pistol. It has a spring extractor mounted within the slide. The rotating slide catch, installed inside the pistol's frame, contains a protrusion which acts as an empty case ejector. The pistol's trigger mechanism includes a disconnector (which ensures semi-automatic-only fire); a double-action trigger (which allows the pistol to be both cocked and fired with one pull of the trigger); and an exposed hammer. The slide features a loaded chamber indicator (which, both visually and by feel, indicates the presence of a round in the chamber) and a manual safety lever that prevents the weapon from being accidentally discharged with the hammer either cocked or released. This feature also allows a round to be chambered with the safety engaged or toggled off. In the ""safe"" position, the firing pin is locked and the trigger bar is disconnected from the hammer notch. If the hammer is cocked and the safety is engaged, the safety will release the hammer. In the 1970s the trigger mechanism was slightly modified and the hammer spur was enlarged. The P-64 is fed from a 6-round single-stack box magazine. After the last round has been fired, the magazine follower lifts the slide catch, which locks the slide open. The slide can then be released by withdrawing the magazine a short distance and pulling the slide back. The pistol is equipped with a fixed front sight, and a dovetailed rear sight with a square notch. The sights are calibrated for firing at 50 m. The all-steel P-64 is manufactured mainly by machine cutting. It was originally issued with a spare magazine, a leather holster (not included), and a cleaning kit (not included). This pistol has a harsh recoil caused by its relatively small size coupled with the potent 9x18mm Makarov round. Despite its similarity to the Walther PP, the P-64 is an original design, holding a Polish patent, number 54822. The patent applies to the unique disconnecter (an elongated plate sliding vertically inside the pistol's frame) which provides an internal safety, decocks the hammer when the safety is engaged, interrupts the weapon's cycle after every shot fired, and allows the weapon to be reloaded with the safety on.**CLICK HERE TO PURCHASE**"

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
The Sig Sauer 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. Sig Sauer has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Scorpion features a Flat Dark Earth (FDE) Cerakote-coated stainless frame and slide, low-profile night sights, and an 8-round magazine. Hogue's innovative magwell grip set combines G10 grip plates and mainspring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment, and they come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's FDE Cerakote finish.

Product Information:

CCI is known for making some of the best rimfire ammunition on the market and the Quiet-22 ammunition is no exception. This quiet round produces a report that is 1/4 the perceived noise level compared to standard velocity 22 Long Rifle rounds; making this round perfect for backyard plinking, youth shooting, or shooting in areas where noise may be a concern. This round is ideal for shooters using bolt-actions or single shot rifles (but is perfectly safe in semi-automatics although it might not completely cycle the action). This subsonic ammunition is a perfect choice for shooting through your favorite rimfire suppressor. CCI Quiet ammunition is new production and non-corrosive.

This is a high quality factory upper built by Seekins Precision. The 16"" barrel is Black Nitride / melonite treated which is more accurate and lasts longer than chrome lining. The extremely lightweight 15"" MCSR V2 Keymod rail is over $200 alone and has a 1.8"" inside diameter to accommodate suppressors. The Seekins adjustable gas block is another $60 and offers you complete tuning capabilities (see below). 

This upper should shoot a 1 inch group if you can. Throw this on any lower with a decent trigger and have a competition level rifle built by one of the top quality manufacturers in the industry. $500 takes it. Might trade for a decent 1911, other quality pistol or revolver, Mossberg SPX, AK, Mini 14, or ?

For another $100 I will include a brand new $150 Seekins Precision Black Nitride full milspec M16 bolt carrier group and charging handle.  

From the manufacturer:

The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block lets you to fine tune your rifle's gas system for smoother cycling and operation. Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.
Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes.

The MCSR V2 rail is a comfortable, extremely light weight modular rail system that will work in any situation as well as comfortably fit a suppressor inside the rail. The MCSR V2 was designed to make using a quick mounted suppressor easy to install or remove while inside the rail.
The MCSR V2 rail is designed so that the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions will now accept all keymod accessories and have two anti-rotation QD positions per side (6total). the internal dimension of the MCSR V2 has increased to 1.8"" to accommodate most suppressors on the market."
