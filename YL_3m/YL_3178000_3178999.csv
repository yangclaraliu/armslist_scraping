Here are the spec's from Adams Arm's site

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 16"" Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

Here are the spec's from Adams Arm's site

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 16"" Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

The action itself is solid and in very good condition. The stock is polymer (I assume aftermarket, but I don't know much on the history of these) and has been painted and shows a reasonable amount of wear. The barrel has had a muzzle break drilled into it - it hasn't been reblued or anything, so it's a bit ugly, but it works. Bore is good, rifling is strong. Trigger is excellent, and breaks clean at maybe 4.5lbs, if I had to guess. Has one original magazine. Glass is a Burris Signature 2.5-10x.

I haven't put a price on it because, frankly, I'm not all that sure what these are worth - I checked all the gun classifieds and auction sites I know of, and every Colt Sauer in 300wbym is around $3000, but they're also all in flawless condition with gorgeous wood stocks. I'll entertain offers (but don't expect to get it for $250 or anything, I know enough not to accept that)

My FFL or yours, we can work out the fee if we get anywhere.
If you'd like more information or pictures, just ask."

From Springfield:
TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.

Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Features
Polymer three-piece design with an interchangeable finger shelf that allows for a flat ""A1-style"" surface or an ""A2-style"" finger nub
Mounts to MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny and NATO STANAG 4694 rails (min. of ~3"" recommended)

It hits much harder than the light ball that's currently available, and it penetrates like crazy.  
It also shoots a good deal more accurately in 

20 rounds East German M39 ammo.This ammo has an all black color 124 grain steel jacketed, steel core bullet. It was originally designed as practice ammo for their machine guns.The concept was that the lighter bullet would travel less far. It is however a full power round and will penetrate 1/4"" steel plate at 100 yards. Recoil is greatly reduced due to the lighter bullet making it perfect for anyone who is sensitive to recoil.   

20 rounds Bulgarian brass case with a 149 grain magnetic bullet. Ammo is from the mid 50's but looks like it was made yesterday. It's super clean ammo and I've always felt brass cased ammo operated more smoothly than the steel case stuff.

20 rounds Red Tracer loaded on 4 Mosin stripper clips. Trace lights around 100 yards and continues another 700 - 800 yards. Visible in daylight but spectacular in low light conditions.

20 rounds Green Tracer. Pretty much the same as the red above but trace is a bright green color. This ammo is also loaded on 4 Mosin clips.

$130 with pickup in the Brandon area. I can ship via UPS Ground at buyers expense.

Serial Number 21361 was produced BEFORE WW2 and was produced as a factory 20 inch barrel SHORT RIFLE in 1939. Caliber is 30 Govt'06 and there are NO Non-Factory holes or alterations. The rear bridge has NEVER been drilled and tapped. Original sights are present and the front sight is an integral part of the barrel so it is impossible to fake. Early features including the clover leaf tang and early style safety. Excellent bore and mechanics. Nearly all of the original blue remains and this short rifle has seen limited and careful use. Solid stock with strong original checkering and original butt plate. Perhaps a light coat of oil has been applied to the stock long ago. It looks great with excellent wood to metal fit. These factory short rifle model 70's are perhaps one of the most difficult variations to find especially with NO extra holes in the rear bridge as most were scoped up over the years. This is a great model 70 in collector condition sure to appreciate in value.

The holster appears to have been minimally used - it is still quite stiff, but marks can be seen on the inside from a firearm resting inside. This will likely work just fine for a Glock 20/21 as well, the firearm will likely just poke out a bit from the bottom.

I have a rare, full sized tan HK USP .40 that has approximately 300 rds through it for sale. It has been a safe queen (one owner-me, bought new) and has been very well taken care of (cleaned after any shooting and oiled regularly).  

The gun shoots flawlessly (not one jam in the 300 rds) with accuracy that embarrasses my other handguns.  

The gun is in great shape minus some paint coming off the extractor (common with HK's) and a little grip tape coming off the bottom right side of the grip ($40+- to repair both). You can see this in the pictures and im told HK will replace the extractor for free if you contact them. 

The handgun will come with 2-16 rd mags/clips, the rare tan HK carrying case made of soft upholstery (very nice carrying case), a FOBUS holster, and the plastic HK black carrying case. 

I do not want to get rid of this gun-but have to-so I want this sale to be short and quick. Im not shipping and I want to see a CCL or a permit to purchase. First to claim gets it."
