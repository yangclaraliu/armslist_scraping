The Buffalo Bore Heavy 10 mm ammo is the result of many years of customers requests that we produce several such loads for the 10 mm.

These loads bring out the full potential of the 10mm, but operate at standard pressures and as such, are safe to use in any standard 10mm pistol. Please don't phone us and ask if these loads are safe in your 10mm - THEY ARE--provided your 10mm is a normal operating pistol in good condition.

We are using flash-suppressed powders so your vision will not be materially affected should you be required to drop the hammer in low light.

If you are firing this 10mm ammo from an autoloader and experience high extreme spreads in velocity, it is not the ammo. Here is why and how to remedy the situation.

Full power 10mm ammo has always generated enough recoil and pressure to require a pretty stiff recoil spring in your handgun - this of course depends on several variables such as your slide weight, etc. When the cartridge fires, it generates enough pressure/recoil to prematurely open your breech face in some guns. When this happens, the opening breech face has an effect on the burn rate of the powder. This can result in some fairly high extreme spreads in velocity. If you are experiencing extreme velocity spreads of more than 50 fps, simply install a stiffer recoil spring. For example, I have an original Colt Delta Elite. This gun with the factory spring runs extreme spreads of about 35fps with both of these 10mm loads. I am happy with 35 fps, so I leave the Delta Elite as is. I also have a custom built Para Ordinance with a Nowlin barrel. It runs extreme spreads of about 70 fps with its original recoil spring. When I install a spring that is 4 lbs stiffer, the extreme spread drops to about 35 fps. The new GLOCK MODEL 20 comes with a recoil spring that allows the breech face to open too soon and my new Glock model 20 will get extreme spreads of about 100fps with the factory spring installed. When I go to a stiffer recoil spring, the extreme spreads drop to about 50 fps in my new Glock model 20. Of course none of this will be an issue in a revolver. None of this will be an issue in real life either, as these high extreme spreads don't hurt accuracy or function. However, I mention this because if you are like me and want things to be as correct as possible, I have outlined the problem and the solution. The industry fixed all these problems initially, by watering down the 10mm ammo over the last several years. The watered down 10mm ammo does not generate the pressure/recoil to open the breech face early. If you want the full powered 10mm ammo we make, you simply need to tweak your pistol. Or just realize that you are getting some fairly high extreme spreads and ignore it or live with it. It's not hurting any thing in reality.

Please understand that we get hundreds of emails per day. If we don't answer your email, it is not because we don't value your patronage, but it is because we simply don't have the manpower to answer so many emails. Thank you for your BUSINESS. Have fun and be safe.

The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT.  Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use. The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

CO2-powered 8-shot repeater looks like the Winchester 1894. Powerful, accurate, solid German engineering.Special Edition! Polished brass receiver with Western illustration.

The airgun version of the Winchester 1894 firearm! Walther's Lever Action rifle is so realistic, no one will be able to tell the difference between the airgun and the firearm!Powered by two 12-gram CO2 cartridges that slip into a compartment neatly concealed by the slide-out buttpad, this rifle will deliver lots of powerful shots from its 8-shot rotary clip.If looks were all that it took to make airgunners happy, this rifle would do the trick. The rich hardwood stock and forearm are combined with high-quality, blued steel components. But, its beauty isn't just skin deep! True to its German heritage, this rifle is a quality-made gun. Walther used metal in areas that other manufacturers would use plastic. They even included the metal saddle ring found on the 1894. Then, there's the super-accurate barrel. It delivers 10-shot groups of 5/8 (center-to-center) at 10 meters. The sights are adjustable, too. The front is adjustable for windage, and the rear is adjustable for elevation. You can even scope the Walther Lever Action with a special base.The weight, the feel, the size, the way it sits naturally in your hands while you work the lever just like Chuck Connors on The Rifleman...you're gonna kick yourself for not getting this gun sooner!

Handi-Rifle™

Mastering the art of one deadly accurate shot. If meat on the table were the sole object of the hunt, then a trip to the supermarket would suffice. We all know there’s much more involved. At its best, the hunt has always been the acid test of the hunter’s skills. For generations, the single shot rifle has been the choice of the accomplished and self-assured hunter that takes pride in his or her marksmanship. And for many years, Harr & Rich has honored that choice with an impeccable blend of simplicity, reliability and accuracy. Their center fire rifles will make that one shot count. For the varmint, small-game and big-game hunter, they offer a wide range of options in a variety of rifle
calibers up to 500 S&W.

Their Handi-Rifle® series brings together premium components, extremely tight production tolerances and an inherently smooth, accurate rifle platform to give you masterful command of every round.Handi-Rifle™

259,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3433259,For Sale:  (1) Thompson 'L' Drum - Crosby Repro - First Gen / Collectible and Rare!,"St. Paul area, Minnesota, United States",$ 350,"Listed On: Monday, September 15, 2014",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Need a fifty round drum for your Tommy Gun? Rare First-gen Crosby Repro NIB!!

I am downsizing and need to move out my excess stuff. Since I have two of these and only need one, one is available now (I had three but sold one last week!). 
And as there were only 200 of these made and many were modified (Gen 2), here's an offer you can't refuse!

These drums were originally made available through keepshooting.com and are very high quality reproductions which function flawlessly. I have burned many rounds through the one I use and it has never failed me. I have ran it in both my '28 and a friends '21 Thompson without problems.
As you can see, the originals are pretty faithful copies of the original Crosby drums, with all the right markings....BUT, they only made 200 of them to ""test"" the market.
That test resulted in a lawsuit by Kahr arms (owners of Auto-Ordnance) regarding the copyright of the word ""Thompson"" on the drum, and Keepshooting.com was told not to sell any more. (but the ones that were sold are okay to keep)
The ones that Keepshooting.com had left had to have the word ""Thompson"" milled off the hanger plate before they could sell them, and these are known as Gen-2 Crosby Reproduction drums.....both are rare and seldom seen for sale, especially brand-new in the box.

Now, you CAN still go to their website and order new Crosby Repros for $190 each BUT they do not say ""Thompson"" where that should be....in fact, that area has been left blank. These are known as Gen-3 Crosby Repro drums and are still made and sold by keepshooting.com here:
http://www.keepshooting.com/thompsonr-compatible-drum-magazine.html
So, if you want a good drum to feed your Tommygun, buy one or two of those.....they work great AND are a great deal.

BUT, if you collect Thompson Drums and such, there are less that 200 of these out there and they are very difficult to find now, especially new in the boxes....so consider mine, as it is a real, rare bargain!
This drum is brand-new in the box, still has the plastic bag but has been opened for these pictures. It has never been loaded or tested in a gun and as you can see is close to perfect in every way.

Check out my pics here: http://tinypic.com/a/36hc1/2

Collectible? with less than 200 out there, they sure are! AND my price is still less than a military drum.....just $350 and $15 shipping in a USPS Priority flat-rate box shipped to you CONUS. Seems like a lot just for the word ""Thompson"" but Hey! Where else are you going to find one like this to add to your collection??

Let me know quick, though....this will go fast!

Thanks for looking!"

Winchester Model 94 Trapper

The Trapper’s fast-handling personality is as ideally suited for today’s cowboy action shooting as it was in the hands of a frontier lawman. Just like a century ago, you’ll appreciate the quick 16"" barrel and the rifle’s overall carbine-style portability when hunting in heavy cover or carrying your Trapper on a backpack, horse or an ATV. The top-tang safety brings back the original look of the classic Model 94.  A saddle ring and hammer spur extension are included.

I have had no malfunctions with these rounds, but as I have stated, lead in ammunition may reduce life of the barrel of the weapon. But what good is a weapon if you don't have ammo to shoot through it? Do the research about what it does to a weapon and don't come to me with questions about the effects on your barrel. The internet is your friend--Google it. I will answer questions about where I got the ammo and any other information I know about it."

503,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3433503,For Sale:  1928 Thompson (Tommy-Gun) 80% receiver with options,"St. Paul area, Minnesota, United States",$ 415,"Listed On: Monday, September 15, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am downsizing so I am moving out some of my Thompson stuff that I have duplicates of or won't use...my loss is your gain so here's an offer you can't refuse!

I have an 80% (Dummy, Non-gun) receiver made by Philadelphia Ordnance in Oreland Pa. and am willing to let it go reasonably cheap.
These are NICE receivers....considered by many to be some of the finest available, made from 4140 ordnance steel, stress relieved and historically accurate. They also have a threaded nose for your barrel and will assemble easily. Some sell aluminum receivers (over $200!) where you push the barrel in with some loctite. These are threaded just like the real receivers, perfect for your military parts kit to complete a nice non-gun for your display! These Philadelphia Ordnance receivers both look and feel like a real Tommy gun, which is what you want anyway, right?

If you look at the website here:   http://www.philaord.com/Thompsons.html
you'll see a bunch of pics of their current receivers....slightly different finishing procedures than mine but with similar options and such....great pics. If you notice, their newer style carries over most of what you see on mine, but they changed a couple things (the Blanchard grinding pattern is a bit different) and added a couple options.

Look at my pics here: http://tinypic.com/a/36hc2/2

You can see that mine is in very nice shape, aside from a few small scratches here and there (most on the back end and a Grip Frame has been slid into place a few times....still looks near-perfect!) and mine is complete with the Bridgeport markings, the Thompson 1928 markings as well as the military blued finish, all costly extras.

Now look at Phila Ords. Pricing here: http://www.philaord.com/PriceList.html
The basic 1928 80% receiver is $345, the engraving is another $115 and the finishing is an additional $30....giving you a total on a new one JUST LIKE THIS of almost $500 bucks, and then some shipping.
You'll have to wait awhile too as they take some time to make....2-6 weeks.

Mine is all ready to ship, and I will let it go for $415 cash, and that will include Priority flat-rate shipping to you Conus.....a nice deal.
Of course, mine has a couple tiny scratches, etc. but anyone who has ever held a Thompson knows that not many are perfect anyway....you might as well save some money. 
These do NOT come with an actuator handle (nor does mine) but you can order one from Philadelphia Ordnance for the $50 you save, which makes mine a better deal AND you'll end up with a full receiver for less money...a win-win for sure!

Don't like that idea? Well, make ME an offer I can't refuse and I will consider it!
But $415 shipped is actually a steal of a deal and I don't expect  thiis to last too long.

Thanks for looking!"

Hey all,
I have for sale an old and pretty cool Sears and Roebuck (J.C. Higgins) bolt action 12 gauge shotgun. This is the model that has the adjustable/twist choke installed on the barrel. This is in pretty good condition for its age and would be an awesome beginner shotgun. Im located in Norman and would need to meet close to or in norman on it. I would also consider trades for other pistols (kel tec carry pistols, revolvers, nagant revolver, etc) or a cheap 12 gauge pump (so i can make it a “tactical” build). Would also trade it for 7.62x54r bulk ammo. Honestly, just shoot me a message and we can go from there. My cell is REDACTED so shoot me a text or a message on here and we can try and work it out. 
This is an older gun so has wear on it and scratches, but the previous owner said she shot great and was a heck of a dove gun."

Device was made by Special Ops Shop of Madisonville, TN circa 1997-1998. As for the gun itself, it's outward appearance is that of a stainless bull barrel 10/22. The outer barrel is actually a 1"" stainless sleeve expertly welded to the base of the factory barrel which has been turned down and shortened to 16"". From the end of the factory barrel to the end of the outer sleeve there is a series of internal baffles. These are removed for cleaning by using a 1/4"" hex key in the end cap of the outer sleeve. It will shoot CCI SGB 22LR into 1/2"" at 50 yards. With subsonic ammo, about all you hear is the bolt. It has a special bolt stop pin in the rear of the receiver that is a polymer coated steel pin which helps to muffle the sound of the bolt against the stop when fired. It also has aftermarket trigger parts and a trigger job that goes off at about 2#'s. There is an aftermarket extended magazine release. The scope is an older (meaning made in the US, not some 3rd world turdpile) Burris 3-9x32 with an AO mounted in Burris Z Rings on a Warne elevated Picatinny/Weaver base. Please pay attention to the following: For sale or trade only to a qualified NH resident because of governmental paperwork BS. Be prepared to file required paperwork and pay a Federal $200 Tax Stamp Fee (1 time only) and wait for a period of time while ATF  processes the request. If this is a cash sale, a deposit of 50% is required with balance due upon ATF approval of transfer. During that time, the device will remain in my possession until approval is granted. I have a Class III dealer who can advise/assist us with the paperwork. I will also consider trades for other guns and I could also use a decent ATV, 400CC or larger, in decent, well maintained shape."

Just about every gun stated above are ""New"" $389-475 so please take a hard look at what you are offering and make sure it is a reasonable deal for both of us.  Had some Shield offers for $400 and $425....which Semper Fi has them for $389 and with tax $416.  A Glock 26 for $525 which was used....like pushing 1k rds through it.   I understand you want top dollar for your gun and Tax is a benefit from private sale, but please if you have a used gun make me an offer at a used gun price.  15-20% off the MSRP is about par for the course when dealing with used handguns depending on aftermarket upgrades.  I have cash and want to purchase something so be generous in what you are offering and I will be as well.

Not looking to spend over 400 prefer about 350 and I'm not a tire kicker so if you email me with a gun stated above that matches my specifications we can meet and I will look at it and if in good shape I will buy it.  I have all required documents and most important of all cash."

Model 8400 rifles chambered for WSM cartridges feature free-floated 24-inch match grade barrels, chambers and triggers. Barreled actions are bedded on twin aluminum pillars permanently bonded into the stock, and recoil lugs are glass bedded for both strength and accuracy.  Montana models are hard-core mountain rifles with stainless steel barreled actions and Kevlar-carbon fiber stocks. Straight combs and Pachmayr® Decelerator® pads dramatically reduce felt recoil. Made entirely in the Kimber factory, the Model 8400 is the finest production sporting rifle available today."

923,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3433923,For Sale:  FN HIGH POWER 9MM WWII NAZI OCCUPATION OF BELGIUM WITH HOLSTER & EXTRA MAGAZINE,"Jacksonville, fl, Jacksonville, Florida","$ 1,200","Listed On: Wednesday, August 27, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"A WWII, Nazi-era, Belgium occupation FN High Power Semi-Automatic Pistol in 9MM with light brown leather flap holster and extra magazine. This 1940's vintage predecessor to the current Browning High Power has the following features: 4 3/4 inch round barrel, blued metal finish, rounded front blade sight, fixed-notch rear sight, serrated ring hammer, smooth trigger, and checkered plastic grips. Metal stampings include: left side of slide -- three line maker mark, address and Browning Patent reference on the left side of the slide -- FABRIQUE NATIONALE D'ARMES DE GUERRE (NATIONAL FACTORY OF ARMS FOR WAR) HERSTAL-BELGIQUE (HERSTAL, BELGIUM) BROWNING'S PATENT DEPOSE -- along with the Nazi Eagle over WaA 140 and the Nazi Eagle over a circled swastika; left side frame - the Nazi Eagle over WaA 140 and the Nazi Eagle over a circled swastika; right side of slide, frame and barrel -- the serial number 31955 f; front of slide beneath muzzle -- the Nazi Eagle over WaA 140; magazine rear wall -- the Nazi Eagle over WaA 140. Condition is original and very good with an estimated 90% of the blued finish on all metal surfaces. Scattered handling marks. Grips are very good with some scratches. Leather holster has a mild scuffs and surface cracks from age. Mechanically, this pistol is very good to excellent. Serial number: 31955f. A collectible pistol from WWII that demonstrates the Belgian manufacturing characteristics under Nazi Germany occupation and control.
The FN P35 “Hi-Power” had been in production since 1935. Designed by John Moses Browning, and completed by Dieudonne Saive, the pistol was chambered in 9mm and had a 13 round capacity thus called “High Power”, and was a desirable military firearm. For comparison, the German issued P.08 Luger and P.38 held 8 rounds of 9mm each. When the German forces invaded and occupied Belgium in 1940, they also took over the FN (Fabrique Nationale, in Herstal Belgium) plant.
The Hi-Power was immediately liked by the Germans, and reassigned the designation Pistole 640(b)

The pre-war inventories of parts at the FN were used to produce more of the Pistole 640(b), all bearing Nazi Waffenamts and the typical swastika-eagle stamps.
 When in early ’42 the pre-war inventories ran out, the German led war-production was started up, and most Hi-Powers after that had wooden grips, unlike the synthetic grips used on prior production guns.

This pistol has a WaA140 waffenamt in it, which indicates it was produced in Belgium between 1942 and 1944 and inspected by the Wehrmacht inspectors in Luttich, Belgium.
The Hi-Power was immediately liked by the Germans, and reassigned the designation Pistole 640(b)

The pre-war inventories of parts at the FN were used to produce more of the Pistole 640(b), all bearing Nazi Waffenamts and the typical swastika-eagle stamps.
That Hi-Power is known as the third (and final) sub-variation of the German occupation pistol designated the P.640b.
Those brown plastic resin grips are original to that gun as are the rather roughly machined and finished major parts. The blue finish on the b suffix pistols was thin to say the least.
The abbreviated serial numbers on the barrel and slide were common practice for Hi-Powers produced in that time frame.
2 Unmarked aluminum follower magazines are also correct for guns in this serial range.

Serials up to 63,000b in the b suffix when the Germans had to fall back to the East out of Belgium in September of 1944.
No fixed dates of manufacture are around that I am aware of. 

Good looking correct supple holster that does not look either over oiled or dried out. 
It is best for the finish of the gun to not store it in the holster where rust has a better chance to develop or gun oil that would stain the leather and stitching.

In my experience the plastic grip 3rds are more rare to encounter than the much more common wood gripped, fixed sight variation Hi-Powers. I say this as a result of my research of this gun and it’s history

The majority of WWII Hi-Powers, due in large part to their popularity with shooters, have been shot and handled to the point of large degrees of finish being lost.
This gun does not seem to have that apply as the front grip finish is the first thing to go on the Hi-Power and this one looks like the gun would rate in the high 90s for condition.

I believe this gun would definitely generate collector interest. Based on my research, this gun would sell for a few hundred dollars more"
