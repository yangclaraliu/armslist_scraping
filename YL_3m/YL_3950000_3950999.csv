She is a genuine ex-sniper Mosin Nagant PU Sniper dated to the end of WW2 era 1944 and will make a great addition to your collection ""as is"" or could very easily be converted back into an original PU Sniper Mosin with the addition of a SVT scope. This Mosin rifle has an Izhevsk marked Russian ""Hammer & Sickle"" high wall receiver (the only receiver type chosen as suitable for a true sniper). She has been refinished to very good condition and has a ""smoothed up"" crisp light trigger action and an absolutely beautiful wood grain stock. This PU Sniper Mosin HAS NOT been counter-bored and the bore shines with excellent clear and deep rifling. The original scope mount holes in the receiver have been arsenal filled but could be easily tapped out if one desired to convert her back into an original sniper PU rifle with SVT scope and base mount. The possibilities are limitless with this base genuine PU bent bolt ex-sniper Mosin Nagant rifle. I tried to take many close up pictures to accurately capture the fine craftsmanship found on this historic Russian PU Sniper. The wood stock is in excellent condition and you can clearly ""see"" the cutout and professional repair for where they had previously mounted a sniper scope to the receiver. This wood repair could easily be removed to facilitate another scope installation or makes for a fine conversation piece when sharing the history of this rifle with your friends. Again, many possibilities exist with this unique ex-sniper bent bolt combination. Feel free to ask any questions. I will ship to C&R holders or to your FFL if desired. As you may have noticed, the importation of all Mosin Nagants has dried up considerably and genuine Sniper PU Mosins are almost impossible to find anywhere anymore. As such this de-commissioned ex-Sniper Mosin will likely become a fine investment.

The sale includes the receiver and two interchangeable barrels. With either barrel mounted, the rifle is about 37"" long overall and weighs a little under 6 pounds. Changing between barrels only involves removing one screw, changing over the barrel and forearm, then reinstalling the screw.

The receiver has case-colored metal in general good condition.There is a ""thumb saver"" installed on the hammer to make it more reliable and comfortable to operate. The varnished medium wood stock has some scratches and scrapes, but it's solid and tight. There is a mount for a sling swivel installed. The Serial number is AZ412XXX, which indicates it was manufactured in 1983.

The .44 Magnum barrel is 22"" long. It has a removable ramped post front sight. The flip-up rear sight is adjustable for elevation and windage, and can be switched between a square notch and a V. The top of the barrel is tapped for scope mounts. It includes a varnished medium wood forearm that matches the buttstock. It has some scratches and scrapes, but it's solid and tight, and includes a mount for a sling swivel. The metal finish is in general good condition, and the bore and chamber are bright and shiny. Despite the ferocity of this powerful cartridge, it is comfortable to shoot and quite accurate within the limitations of the cartridge.

The heavyweight .223 Remington target barrel is 22"" long. It has a target crown, and no fixed sights, but has a top rail installed to mount optics of your choice. Its forarm is light wood with a mount for a sling swivel. The metal finish is in general good condition, and the bore and chamber are bright and shiny. This is an exceptionally accurate setup for this cartridge because of the long, heavy barrel with the sight mounted directly on it, the target crown and the break action, easily capable of 1/2"" MOA accuracy or better with good ammo and a capable shooter.

I prefer a face-to-face transaction for cash in the Northwest San Antonio / Helotes area, but I'm willing to consider trades or reasonable travel or reasonable offers."

Manufactured by the Czechoslovak firm Česká zbrojovka the vz. 82 replaced the 7.62x25mm Tokarev vz. 52 pistol in Czechoslovak military service in 1983. It is a compact, double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blowback action. This type of action allows the barrel to remain solidly fixed to the frame, resulting in improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like the U.S. M1911 series). The low bore axis of the vz. 82 provides for less muzzle rise and quicker follow-up shots. For added convenience, both the frame-mounted thumb safety and the magazine release are ambidextrous. The vz. 82 was the first service pistol to feature both these features. The bore is chrome plated, which gives it three advantages: longer barrel life, resistance to rust from the use of corrosive ammunition, and ease of cleaning. Another feature of this pistol is the use of polygonal rifling in the barrel bore. This replaces the traditional lands and grooves rifling design with a rounded, smooth polygonal pattern which has a more ""hills and valleys"" appearance. 

This pistol is in good shape and shoots great. I've had this pistol for 5 years and am just clearing out some of my guns. The gun includes many extras such as a Barsony #4 holster, a box of 9mm makarov bullets, 2 12 round magazines, the original instruction manual, and original leather gun holster and leather magazine holder.

Here's a little history of the gun: FÉGARMY Arms Factory of Hungary started producing Walther PP/PPK clones in the late 1940s starting with their Model 48 which differed from the Walther PP only in minor details. By the late 1950s FÉG began making broader changes resulting in the PA-63, which uses a 9x18mm Makarov round. It quickly became standard issue to both Hungarian military and police forces. The Military standard PA-63 version sports a two-tone polished aluminum frame with black slide, grips, trigger and hammer assembly. While unusual for military issue in that a reflective polish was used, it was chosen due to its relative cheapness as well as quicker build time. 

This gun is in great shape and shoots very well. I am just cleaning out some of my collection. You will get the original pistol box (not shown), a nylon holster, a 7 round magazine, and a box of 9mm makarov bullets.

 More technical specs:
Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. 
Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage."

This example has the original rust blue and straw finish, and all matching serial numbers, including the magazine.  The pistol has a hand-polished rust blued finish with the various small parts straw colored. The top of the chamber is dated 1914, and the toggle carries the beautiful ""DWM"" mark.  

The barrel is marked “Bo 26” to indicate Bohler steel.  Bohler is an old company known for manufacturing the finest tool steel in the world.  Early semiautomatic pistols were plagued with rapid barrel wear due to full metal jacket bullets.  DWM and others experimented with various steels to improve barrel life.   This example is fitted with an original Bohler steel barrel that is in perfect condition.   

It has the original WWI finish with checkered walnut grips.  It has a very low serial number of 935, indicating that it was among the first of the 1914 model Luger to be manufactured.   DWM was known as the factory producing the finest Lugers ever made.   Machining on this pistol is a work of art, done according to the standards of Georg Luger himself who was said to have supervised early production runs.

The Ebony Bullpup stock was made from Frogwood industries, I also have a left-handed Bolt carrier that comes with it, so if you're a lefty you can shoot the Bullpup as well. I'm not going to charge extra for it, I just don't use this gun enough to keep it around.  

Note that while the Bullpup stock is on the gun, it will NOT fit 30 round magazines. If you have any questions I'd be glad to answer them for you. 

I really knocked the price down a lot, so the asking price ($575) is the lowest price I will accept. I will accept trades/partial trades.

Currently in the market for a new stock for my R700 Varmint SF chambered in .223. 

I have been interested most in XLR's element chassis. Or possibly a McRee. I feel with the 26"" barrel of the SF, the closed tubing of other systems (say the XLR Evolution) might make it look a tad off. The McRee and Element both offered open top forearms at a reasonable pricepoint.

The CX4 is a semi-auto pistol-caliber carbine designed to give you the familiar controls of your favorite Beretta combat handgun. It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies across the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.

The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.

This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.

The CX4 just begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization.

The Range Officer® Compact brings the precision of a competition pistol in a small and straightforward configuration.

The Range Officer® Compact has the same quality forged national match frame and slide as the Trophy Match™ and TRP™ 1911s. It gets the same precision fit as these pistols, too. Add in the same national match stainless steel barrel, and you have a pistol that shoots well beyond its price tag. The Range Officer® Compact is topped with a fiber optic front sight and a low profile combat rear sight, so you have maximum visibility. The beavertail grip safety, extended lightweight trigger and flat mainspring housing allow the pistol to sit in your hand comfortably for long periods of time at the range. The single-sided thumb safety keeps things simple and functional. It all adds up to a pistol that will let you seriously compete in a variety of matches.

The Range Officer® Compact means that your favorite range pistol is now easier to carry. Are You Ready?™

LNIB with 200 rounds shot down the pipe.  This is a beautiful gun with an absolutely awesome trigger.  However, I've owned mostly 9MM's for my conceal carry and prefer the shooting recoil of the 9's over a .45, just personal preference.  This was my first 1911 frame and love the feel, but personally I prefer the striker fire models a little more.  Price is firm.  Cash required as well as showing CCL.  Text REDACTED

Then put it in the safe until now, and as you can see from the pix it still looks brand new.  Also please note that the short reset trigger is not a standard item, I had that installed after I got the pistol which cost over $100 with parts and labor, but worth every penny as it makes the pistol a lot easier to shoot accurately quickly. Cash only, no trades please. (unless you want to trade an FN SCAR, or something else worth $1500 or more!

The frame itself, with it’s unique and true 3D hand grip (and not just “millings” on a flat surface) comes today as the only service pistol with a full fledged IPSC standard magazine insert “miniskirt”, allowing Special Operation and SWAT teams to work as if they were using a competition pistol. The trigger system of the Strike One, again like no other before, operates mainly on the horizontal plain, without raisers with variable and long, rubbery trigger pull, but with a crisp and short firing pin release: this is the secret, along with a lighting fast locking mechanism, behind the unbelievable semiautomatic firing speed of our pistol. Finally, thanks to the in-line barrel operation, the Strike One allows the development of a number of extremely innovative accessories, which base the designing and operative criteria on the “carrying in-line barrel”, such as for instance the LRC (Long Range Conversion)."
