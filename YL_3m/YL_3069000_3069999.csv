And most of all you can walk in to Cablea's and buy 44 mag on the shelf. The performance ammo is just as good and heck of a lot cheaper. This is a brand new pistol list at 1500 after taxes I am selling it for 1250 or best offer. Also all of the barrels are interchangeable so if you have to have the 50 you could buy it for 400 bucks.

First come, first serve. I've already had several no-show buyers that have failed to come through. 

Shipping available for serious buyers. Checks preferred, I accept money orders as well. Payment clears before it goes out the door, no exceptions. I maintain contact with the buyer throughout the entire process.

Made entirely from Titanium and Stainless Steel, this suppressor weighs in at a little over 15 ounces with a recoil booster installed in it. This suppressor can be “dipped” ultrasonically, sand blasted, or soaked in harsh solvents without fear of damage to the unit.
Did I mention that is also full auto rated? Well it is!!!
mystic_with_ammo_on_table-570x432We also decided to make it adaptable to other makers mounting devices as well, like the Multimount adapters as well as TROS boosters too. We also make an adapter ring to mount the Triad three lug mount to the Mystic as well. These features make this the perfect transition suppressor for sealed aluminium suppressor owners. Since all the mounts will work with the Mystic, this saves the end-user considerable money when it comes to buying mounts.
Designed with Dual Arc Baffle technology, the Mystic is incredibly quiet for a centerfire monolithic core suppressor as well. But the real treat is that the Mystic can also withstand several other centerfire rifle and handgun calibers as well. The 300 / 221 Fireball and the 300 BLK are prime examples of this. Not only in subsonic, but also in supersonic speeds. Also, the 38 Special/ 357 Magnum family work as well. Being take-down, this suppressor will be a favorite for using cast lead bullets. We all know that lead buildup in the 9mm suppressor is a reality.
SONY DSCAnother point that was taken into consideration is that a lot of shooters that are looking into this type of suppressor are also shooting 22LR carbines and want to be able to use their 9mm suppressor on that platform as well. We tested the Mystic on 22LR and it sounds great in this application as well. Great sound combined with take-down clean-ability make this a winner here as well!!!"

If you were looking specifically for this gun, then you already know what it is and I don't have to talk it up. I bought this new in 2005 locally. In very good condition, with two slight marks from occasional carry. All stock from the factory, haven't changed a thing on it. Just a light cleaning and lube after a couple of range days. Estimated 400 rounds through it. 

Everything included that came from the factory. Includes the gun, tupperwear box, factory box, manual, lock, mag loader, and pick/tool. Also includes a total of 4 high cap mags (2 with pinky finger bit and 2 with flat metal baseplates). 

This gun has never given me a FTE or FTF on any type of ammo I've ever fed it. Completely reliable, incredibly easy to point, and very comfortable in the hand. These are hard to find and cheapest I can find locally (in stock) is $627+tax, which only includes 2 mags.

I can meet in the central Seattle to Bellevue area along the I-90 corridor. Will need to see ID and fill a bill of sale for my records. Lowballers will be ignored. 

Will consider trades, but not interested in anything in 9mm or .40.   I might be looking for a Savage Hog Hunter in .308,  a Ruger 77/357  or lever action in .357.   Let me know what ya got, worst I can say is no thanks. 


Thanks for looking!

The gun is a Maverick 88 Field w/28"" vent rib barrel, full stock as pictured. It is like new, I never fired it and whoever had it before me must not have fired it at all or at least very little. Got a soft case to transport the gun.

To make it a tactical shotgun I added a 24"" vent rib barrel with 3 chokes and the choke tool. Collapsible AR style stock with recoil pad and stock tool, needed for field stripping, as the pistol grip has to be removed, is pictured as well.

Break down of cost:
Shotgun w/28"" barrel = $225

24"" barrel = $100
Collapsible Stock w/recoil pad and tool = $85

Up for sale is my Sig Sauer P232 .380 ACP pistol. The frame and barrel are both marked made in Germany. I don't know where the slide is made, but it is probably German, too. Included are Hogue grips (will include original), two recently cleaned magazines, and a Plano carrying case. If you need ammo we can work out a deal. 

I've only taken this on three range trips and have shot 250 rounds through her. I've only fired reputable, non-steel cased FMJ ammo through it. I purchased this pistol in 2010 before I went overseas. I'm the original owner. It never saw any use until I returned in 2013 and started using it as my daily carry. It's mechanically in great shape, but has some slight scuffs on the slide (barely noticeable). There is some wear in the magazine well but no corrosion anywhere (see picture). The grip screws are a little rough too, but easily replaceable.

I never want to sell a gun, especially a Sig, but unfortunately I have to pay off my debt. This is a good deal: search Armslist nationwide and you won't see anybody selling their P232 anywhere close to what I'm offering it for.

I require cash payment, a peak at your CPL and driver's license, a bill of sale, and the transfer record here: http://www.beararms.com/pdf/ftup.pdf

I will NOT file any paperwork with our government. The paperwork is for my personal records, and you'll receive a copy of the bill of sale along with the transfer record."

This thumbscrew mount allows you to mount this light to any M1913 Picitinny rail.  The pressure switch can be velcrowed to any part or your rifle within 7 inches of the light so you can activate the light just by gripping.  I had the pressure switch mounted to a vertical foregrip so I could turn the light on by gripping the vertical foregrip.  I had the LED head on the light while mounted to my rifle but this kit allows you to switch between the LED and incandescent heads.  With the incandescent head attached, you can also add the IR filter.  I had this light mounted on my rifle for about 2 years but never fired the rifle with the light mounted.  The light and all accessories are in perfect condition.  I am open to trade offers but right now would prefer to sell.  If you have any trade offers or questions, just email me.

Military knife,"McCalla, Birmingham, Alabama",$ 290,"Listed On: Thursday, June 26, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Rare Camillus Cuda  ROBERT Terzuola design CQB serrated 6 in. Military knife.
The knife was beautifully crafted and the design is simply exceptional.  It's an ""all performance, all business"" kind of design.  The knife has a solid, sure feel in the hand and presents an aggressive profile.  The thick blade was crisply ground from 154CM (Post ATS-34) high speed steel and displays clean, sharp lines.  It has a soft, bead-blasted finish and the markings are bold.  The blade has a combo edge with the final 2"" being a deeply scalloped, wickedly sharp section of serrations.  This produces a highly efficient cutting action that's ideal for rope, cord, netting, etc.  The straight edge is probably the sharpest I've ever seen on a Camillus. The spine has a pronounced thumb ramp with deeply milled ridges on both sides.  There's also a long section of deep ridges on both the top and bottom of the handle.  The handle is of canvas micarta and offers excellent slip resistance.  The butt was drilled for a lanyard (by manufacturer) and the handle has an outstanding feel all the way around.
The sheath is the original Kydex, attachment that releases easily and is reversible / ambidextrous - right or left handed. It offers excellent versatility with at least six different carry configurations.  It can even be configured for jump-safe inverted carry, although this requires an additional safety strap for use when parachuting.
This knife is beautifully balanced, offering the feel and handling of a fine custom knife.  It's quick and agile with great blade response.
The blade is 5-3/4"" and the knife measures 10-3/4"" in overall length.
This model was designed by noted Knifemaker's Guild member Bob (Robert) Terzuola and it was designed to offer top-level performance and durability.
If you're a Camillus collector/enthusiast, this knife is one of the finest they offered.  It's also as nice as they come.
An awesome, premium-quality fighter from this American icon!! Will make great companion for any hunting or field work expedition.
Beautiful execution with elements suggesting hand made (or benchmade)

Description from SIG website:
 With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.
 With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.
 Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line a polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete this package.

It has a rare factory Savage maple stock.  I didn't like the bulky feel of the savage for arm so I sanded it down for a thinner more rounded feel.  In doing so removed the checkering and replaced it with an inlayed walnut diamond for some grip.  Came out great, stock was stripped and re-finished with tru-oil gun stock finish to bring out the tiger striping.  This gun was never abused, only shot targets with it.  Maybe 2 boxes of shells through the gun total, always cleaned.  I have to many bolt actions and need to thin out the ones I don't hunt with.  

The gun shoots great. Easily shoots under 1.5"" at 100 yards with cheap wall-mart Remington 180gr.  That is all I ever shot through it, shot good enough I never tried anything else.  I will include the Bushnell 3-9 scope, it's nothing special, but works good.   Gun is in great shape, no wear on metal or wood.  Pre-accutriger.

 Ok guys. Looking to make room in the safe. You wont see this on gunbroker or anywhere else.  A Valkyrie Arms reproduction Grease Gun in .45 cal. Valkyrie is known for making high grade reproduction WWII arms built to spec in limited productions. I am more or less the original owner (bought off a friend who bought two). Has only been shot once, by me, when I bought it around 2008, otherwise unfired, then put in my safe as part of my ever growing WWII collection. (What collection is complete without a Tommy gun and Grease Gun!!!!) It is basically new. Fixed stock. Not even fully broken in. About 50 rounds down the pipe with no issues. Comes with one 30 round stick mag. If you order it from Valkyrie it will cost you 1550.00 plus shipping transfer etc... That's what I paid. And you will have to wait 6-10 months, and then still a maybe. For any WWII enthusiast this is a must. These are very hard to find. You can find the mil surplus mags at most gun shows. 

$900.00 cash value.  Last drop before sent for consignment
 Will probably be letting go of some more unusual stuff in upcoming months so stay tuned.
