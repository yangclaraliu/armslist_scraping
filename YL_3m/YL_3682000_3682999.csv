Gun runs flawlessly. Looks great. Roughly 100 rounds through it. What you see is what you get. I wish I could keep it, but need to free up funds. I can swap furniture to a traditional wooden fixed stock configuration (if so requested by a buyer).  

My preference is to go through FFL transfer. However, face to face w/ KY residents is also Ok. We will fill out a bill of sale, and I'd require to see a proof of KY residence (drivers license or CCDW).

Greater Cincinnati residents from OH or IN are welcome. I'd be happy to meet you at FFL dealer of your choosing.  

Thanks for looking.

P.S. I also have a Polish barreled and headspaced AK parts side folding kit w/o receiver. I'd be happy to sell it locally or ship to any area where not prohibited by law."

The gun is slightly used - approximately 500 rounds through it. It does show very minor cosmetic wear on a gun itself and holster due to being carried a lot.

Recently switched to G26 as my primary carry, and need to free up funds. 

Given this handgun is primary designed to serve as a carry gun, I would feel much more comfortable doing FFL transfer regardless of your state of residence. Most of local FFLs are easy going folks and gladly do a transfer for $20-$25 bucks in less than 5 minutes. I priced the gun w/ accessories fairly low due to this slight inconvenience and small FFL fees.

Greater Cincinnati residents from OH or IN are welcome. I'd be happy to meet you at FFL dealer of your choosing. Please make sure your FFL is willing to take a gun from a private individual from a different state. Federal law allows for that - however, some FFLs are either not familiar w/ laws or overly cautious.

It is a great price/deal. Extra mag, holster and crimson laser sight add up to additional $250 on top of Kahr CW9 value.

Priced to move. If not sold by 11/23, I will keep it.

the Krebs Custom ""UFM Keymod System"" for AK rifles! This revolutionary system, which is light-years ahead of its competition, gives you unlimited possibilities for mounting slings and accessories. Designed to be light in weight, the 6061 T6 aluminum construction and ""Keymod"" mounting system allow for quick installation of rail sections wherever the shooter desires, while adding only 0.8 ounces to the total weight of your AK. The ultra-sturdy design allows for solid optic mounting on the 1913-style top rail.

highly sought after Saiga-762 rifle!  The auto-loader based on the famed Russian AK-47, built in the same factory as Russia’s military weapons.   Imported by RWC, this example does NOT have the old importer’s name dimpled out of the side of the receiver like a lot of these have;  if you’ve seen those it looks like a strip of Velcro on the right side above the trigger.  As you can see in the pictures, that ugly blemish is not present!  Factory fresh, dripping in Russian oil, 2013/2014 production.  This model has already been converted to true AK fashion with the pistol grip, 2-piece handguard, stock, new gas tube, and permanently attached bullet guide-- set-up to accept standard AK47 mags, it includes a 30-round magazine
Banned from further importation by presidential order/sanction as of 7-16-2014… If you’ve always wanted a true Russian AK, this might be your last chance.  This is a great investment, take a look at what happened to other banned rifles like the Dragunov.  Clinton banned their importation in 1993, now it’s hard to find one for less than $8,000.  Don’t hold your breath for these to be “un-banned”, maybe if Ted Nugent becomes president….
Information:
The Saiga auto-loading rifle is based on the rugged Kalashnikov design. In the Saiga line of rifles, this timeless design utilizes a proven gas piston system, rotary bolt, and very few internal parts that provide the reliability that Izhmash has delivered for over 60 years. A hammer forged, chrome lined barrel and chamber provide the ultimate in long life. Thedriftable post front sight with protective ears is adjustable for windage and elevation. The notched side catch with bar rear leaf sight is adjustable for elevation. The rear sight has presets for 109, 218, & 328 yards. The comfortable, ergonomic operating handle makes charging the firearm effortless. The spring loaded magazine release provides for quick magazine changes. The elongated selector handle allows for a smooth transition from safe to semi-auto. Includes one detachable magazine.

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

The rifle has matching numbers on barrel and receiver 6537W, an 'S' on the barrel with the stamping of a double headed eagle sandwiched between 'Wn 17'. The bolt handle has the numbers 384 stamped on it. There is a 'K' behind the rear tang screw and one located behind the front handguard screw. The stock and handguard are free from cracks, but the wood has numerous dings and gouges that are light and shallow. The stock has three sets of numbers stamped in the wood, most likely refitted with the barrel in 1917. There are NO import markings on this rifle. 

I received this rifle several years back, still packed in cosmoline. I stripped and cleaned the entire rifle well. The first range trip I fired groups of 3, cleaning the barrel after each group. My groups shrank from 6"" to 2"" with the iron sights at 100 yds. There is heavy frosting in the grooves but the rifling is sharp and deep, with bright lands. 

The rifle is in perfect working order, and feeds, fires and extracts with no issue. The extractor has little wear and the bolt head will remain in the extended position on its own, which is necessary for re-insertion of the bolt into the action. I have a couple of the carbines that require a dime placed in gap, wedging the bolt head open until its slid into its tracks. The rifle has a nice even patina on all the metalwork, with no areas of pitting or corrosion. I do not have a sling or bayonet for this rifle, however I can sell en-bloc clips and modern ammo (PPU 208gn SP) if needed or desired, with the rifle. 

I have many up close pictures of the rifle and will send as many as requested and answer any questions to the best of my knowledge. Thanks for looking at my ad and best of wishes in your searches."

Full functional RPB MAC 11 ( 380) in FULL AUTO ( have tax stamp) with 4 mags and factory two stage sound suppressor ( Open Bolt Design) .... $4,000 additional or BEST OFFER

Design .... The M-10 was built predominantly from steel stampings. A notched cocking handle protrudes from the top of the receiver, and by turning the handle 90° would lock the bolt, and act as an indicator that the weapon is unable to fire. The M-10 has a telescoping bolt, which wraps around the barrel. This allows a more compact weapon, and balances the weight of the weapon over the pistol grip where the magazine is located. The M-10 fires from an open bolt, and the light weight of the bolt results in a rapid rate of fire. In addition, this design incorporates a built in feed ramp as part of the trigger guard (a new concept at the time) and to save on cost the magazine was recycled from the M3 Grease Gun. The barrel is threaded to accept a suppressor, which worked by reducing the discharge's sound, without attempting to reduce the velocity of the bullet. At the suggestion of the United States Army, it also acted as a foregrip to inhibit muzzle rise when fired. Ingram added a small bracket with a small strap beneath the muzzle to aid in controlling recoil during fully automatic fire. The original rate of fire for the M-10 in .45 is approximately 1090 rpm. That of the M11/nine 9mm is approximately 1250 rpm, and that of the M11 .380 is 1380 rpm.[4]

Suppressor .... The primary reason for the original M-10 finding recognition was its revolutionary sound suppressor designed by Mitchell Werbell III of Sionics. This suppressor had a two-stage design, with the first stage being larger than the second. This uniquely shaped suppressor gave the MAC-10 a very distinctive look. It was also very quiet, to the point that the bolt could be heard cycling, along with the suppressed report of the weapon's discharge; however, only if subsonic rounds were used. The suppressor when used with a Nomex cover created a place to hold the firearm with the secondary hand, making it easier to control. During the 1970s the United States placed restrictions on the exportation of suppressors, and a number of countries canceled their orders of M-10s as the effectiveness of the MAC-10's suppressor was one of its main selling points. This was one factor that led to the bankruptcy of Military Armament Corporation, another being the company's failure to recognize the private market. The original Sionics suppressor is 11.44 inches in length, 2.13 inches in overall diameter, and weighs 1.20 pounds.[5]

Nomenclature ..... The term ""MAC-10"" is commonly used, but unofficial, parlance.[citation needed] Military Armament Corporation never used the nomenclature MAC-10 on any of its catalogs or sales literature, but because ""MAC-10"" became so frequently used by Title II dealers, gun writers, and collectors, it is became used more frequently than ""M10"" to identify the gun.[citation needed]





 US Marshall firing the suppressed Ingram MAC 10 Calibers and variants ..... While the original M-10 was available chambered for either .45 ACP or 9mm, the M-10 is part of a series of machine pistols, the others being: the MAC-11 / M-11A1 semi, which is a scaled down version of the M-10 chambered in .380 ACP; and the M-11/9, which is a modified version of the M-11 with a longer receiver chambered in 9mm, later made by SWD (Sylvia and Wayne Daniel), Leinad and Vulcan Armament.

In the United States, machine guns are National Firearms Act items. As Military Armament Corporation was in bankruptcy large number of incomplete sheet metal frame flats were given serial numbers then bought by a new company, RPB industries. Some of the previously completed guns (already stamped MAC), were stamped on the other side RPB, making a ""double stamp"" gun.

RPB Industries made many open-bolt semi-automatic and sub-machine guns before the ATF seized roughly 200 open bolt semi autos during the drug wars of 1981. ATF insisted that all future semiautomatic versions were to be manufactured with a closed-bolt design as the open-bolt semiautomatics were considered too easy to illegally convert to full automatic operation.[5]

Wayne Daniel, a former RPB machine operator, purchased much of their remaining inventory and formed SWD, designing a new weapon which was more balanced, available either fully or semi-automatic with his new ATF approved closed bolt design.[6]

There are several carbine versions of the M-11/9 and Cobray and SWD manufactured a smaller version chambered in .380 ACP as a semiautomatic pistol called the M-12.[7]"

The Concealed Carry Sling Bag provides you with a covert carry option that keeps your weapon ready without announcing to the world that you are carrying it. The low profile civilian styling uses the popular single strap design, padded and air-mesh lined for ultimate comfort. A reversible accessory pouch is included in the front pocket with elastic loops for magazines or other items and a zippered accessory pouch. The main compartment has enough room to carry your daily supplies and a discreet side zipper allows quick access to the universal holster. The pack is constructed from lightweight 500D cordura.

Measurements:
Concealed Carry Pocket: 7.5 X 15.5
Main Pocket: 8.5"" X 17"" X 4.5""
Front Pocket: 7"" X 12"" X 1.5""
Total Volume: 775 approximate cubic inches

There are some minor handling marks on this upper but otherwise it is pristine.  I have removed the AAC flash hider for use with a screw-on suppressor.

This sight can be purchased with the upper or separately for 350 dollars.  I have left it on so it retains zero in case the purchaser wants it.  ***SIGHT HAS BEEN SOLD***

This is a beautiful gun (the pictures don't do it justice) and a great shooter as well. The Glossy Blue (Model# 91103) color has been discontinued by CZ.

I ended up buying a polycoated 75B, so I don't have any need for this one anymore. It's not perfect; it has some nicks in the finish (additional pictures available.), but it is in very good shape. It's very accurate and feels great in your hand. This is the modern version with the firing pin block.

It comes with 2 16rnd magazines, warranty card, test fire sheet, factory cleaning rod and brush, factory plastic box and cardboard shell.

His action work costs right around $200 for what has been done to this rifle.  This one was made before they started installing the ugly safety on top of the rifle.  The bluing is great as shown in the pic with the reflection of my hand.  The front sight has had a large brass bead installed for fast sight aquisition.

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 17 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com)

The Ainsworth cartouche is on the grip but didn't show up well in my picture.

This is a Sauer und Sohn 38H early production model in 32 ACP with one Sauer original mag. Everything on this firearm is original and serials match. Early models variants go for ridiculous prices, and the bluing on this is excellent. Slide mounted safety, decocker/cocker (yes you read that right). The 38H had a shrouded hammer hidden in the slide that could be decocked and also cocked into single action mode by the same lever (a model which was later used when Sauer became Sig-Sauer) which was WAY ahead of its time and the trigger is great. These were used by the Nazi Wehrmacht and SS troops, and are highly collectible. Many use them for concealed carry to this day. Comes with a 50 round box of 32 ACP. Quality handgun offers ONLY. Trade value is $750-$800.

The Beretta 21A Bobcat is a small pocket-sized semi-automatic pistol designed by Beretta in Italy. Production began in late 1984, solely in the Beretta U.S.A. facility in Accokeek, Maryland. It is a further development of the Beretta Model 20, whose production ended in 1985.The Beretta 21A Bobcat is available chambered .25 ACP (6.35 mm) ammunition. It has a simple blowback operation, with a single and double action trigger mechanism, and exposed hammer. It has a magazine release button in the left side grip, located between the grip retaining screws. The frame is made out of aluminum alloy; the slide and barrel are either carbon steel or stainless steel, depending on the model.  Beretta claims that the pistol is intended for off duty police and pistol carry permit holders that seek a highly concealable, but reliable pistol. Thus in effect, the handgun is designed for self defense.

On the pictures I have blurred out the serial numbers. I have this thing about showing serial numbers in a picture for a weapon I am going to sell. Don't really think that it is anybody's business but mine is I own it. They have not been tampered with on the weapon itself. I do require a copy of a photo ID and cash money. I keep copies of all weapons I sell for proof later if required to show I no longer own handgun. No one sees these receipts but me. Don't really think you'll even be able to find one to compare it to. Not to say it is rare, but most of the ones I know about won't ever be for sale because it is such a stunning handgun to own and display. It will come with 2 magazines and original black grips."

Made right here in America
Comes in 5.56 (which means you can use .223)
The lower receiver is a fiberglass composite polymer which is immune to corrosion
There are steel inserts around the buffer tube and near the takedown pin which means your polymer lower will NOT fail
Quad rail will allow you to add any attachments in the future with ease
Super lightweight AR15

The Omni Hybrid Quad Rail AR15 is such a fantastic gun, and one of our very most favorite AR15s. This is a great looking AR15, is super light weight, reliable, and a fantastic shooting gun.


This AR15 comes with a 6 position stock, no sights, a 16"" Melonite coated M4 barrel, and is just 7lbs. It does come with one 30-round magazine which gives it a capacity of 30+1.

The lower on the Omni Hybrid is fantastic. It is a steel reinforced polymer lower receiver - which means it will be tough enough to stand up to the abuse of both the .223 round and the 5.56 round.

It also has an enhanced trigger guard which is designed to allow you to wear shooting or combat gloves with the maximum amount of comfort. We absolutely love this gun and recommend it as a fantastic firearm to any shooter!

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR15/M16 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock."

HEAVY 30-30 WINCHESTER AMMO - 190 GR. JFN @ 2100 FPS (1860 FT.LBS.) - 20 ROUND BOX


Buffalo Bore is introducing a truly Heavy 30-30 Winchester loading. This new load utilizes a 190gr. custom Hawk bullet and gives the venerable 30-30 here-to-for unrealized power and is designed so that the person who owns a 30-30 can now reliably kill elk or moose sized game. The 30-30 can now be carried as a defensive tool in grizzly country and will be much more effective in stopping a grizzly attack than any other 30-30 ammunition in the world. This heavy 30-30 load is not designed for deer, although it will kill deer and if you line them up right, it will kill three or four deer with one shot……….

The custom 190gr. hawk bullet is designed with a harder core and thicker than normal jacket, so the expansion is minimal, thus insuring very deep penetration which is needed to break large bones and destroy organs deep inside large game animals. This load generates an unreal 2100 fps from normal 20 inch carbines—this is the type of velocity that the ordinary 170gr. 30-30 loads generate, but again, we are using a 190gr. bullet. The product SKU# for this load is 28A/20
Check the below real world velocities from my personal stock, over-the-counter firearms—truly amazing.
2071 fps -- Marlin Model 336 20 inch saddle ring carbine circa 1950’s
2061 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2075 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1953
2116 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1963
2172 fps -- Marlin model 336A 24 inch carbine circa 1940’s
2146 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2020 fps -- Win. Model 94AE 16 inch Trapper carbine circa 1992
1983 fps -- Savage 99 26 inch rifle circa 1917 - Not a Typo
Note that the longest barrel gave the slowest velocity and even the short 16 inch Winchester trapper model gives faster speeds than the 26 inch Savage 99 rifle, which shows that barrel length is not always the sole indicator of velocities a firearm will generate.
Buffalo Bore always uses stock over-the-counter- firearms that give real world velocities. Other ammunition companies normally use laboratory test barrels which give much higher velocities than stock firearms. We at Buffalo Bore see this long established practice as misleading to the consumer.

This 30-30 loading (Item 28A/20) is safe to use in ANY/ALL 30-30 chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition—no exceptions, no need to “double check” with us."
