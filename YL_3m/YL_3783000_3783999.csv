NEW Adams Arms 5.56 AR15 14.5"" PISTON Operated 

Looking for a nice quality yet reasonably priced combat rifle with the accuracy of an AR15 but the reliability of an AK47? This particular AR15 was built with an Adams Arms (AA) complete upper, on top of a Stag Arms lower with AA/VDI internals/parts, and Magpul furniture. >>>ALL COMPONENTS ARE BRAND NEW/UNUSED<<< and the original packaging will be provided. The complete upper was built, inspected, and tested by AA -- inspection checklist is included -- and utilizes a gas piston for cooler and cleaner operation. Just add your preferred optic and/or iron sights and you're ready to rock!

UPPER RECEIVER - Adam Arms A4 AR flat-top, mil-spec
Chamber : 5.56x45 NATO / .223 Remington
Gas System : Mid-length short-stroke piston operation
Bolt Carrier : AA 1-piece with integral piston strike face and M4 feed ramps, charging handle
Barrel : AA 14.5"", 1:7 twist, 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel, QPQ Melonite/Black Nitrade finish
Muzzle : AA/VDI Manimal flash hider, pinned for ATF 16"" barrel length compliance
Handguard : Magpul MOE, mid-length

LOWER RECEIVER - Stag Arms STAG-15, 7075 T6 aluminum w/ type 3 hard coat anodizing, mil-spec
*Was registered as an ""other receiver"" for the option to convert to an AR pistol in the future
Lower Parts Kit : AA/VDI LPK with LifeCoat self-lubricating coating, mil-spec
Buffer : AA mil-spec buffer tube, carbine buffer, spring
Stock : Magpul MOE 6-position, collapsible
Pistol Grip : Magpul MOE with interior storage
Magazine : (1) Magpul MOE 30-round, unopened in wrapper

The traditional AR15 platform utilizes gases to cycle a firearm's action, known as Direct Impingement (DI). It can be considered the biggest concern with the AR15/M16. Because these gases are released into the receiver, a layer of carbon and burnt gases coat all the moving part of the firearm. This also leaves a lot of heat inside the receiver causing undo stress and wear on many critical parts. All of these issues give the AR15/M16 a reputation for being unreliable and having issue like failure to feed and failure to eject.

The Adams Arms Piston System keeps the hot burning gases from entering the receiver. This means the normal time and energy exerted on cleaning your AR15/M16 will be drastically reduced. To clean the system, simply wipe off the parts with a dry, clean towel.

ADDITIONAL ACCESSORIES
Please inquire about the following extra cost items if interested:
- Magpul MOE 30-round magazines (new in wrapper)
- Black Teflon-coated aluminum GI 30-round magazines (new/unused)

$799 FTF in Northern Virginia for a brand new piston AR-15. Trades not considered at this time.

Bill of Sale, VA driver's license, and one of the following secondary IDs required for purchase: CCW, Voter Registration Card, US Passport, US birth certificate, or Military ID with orders.

AK-74 built by Waffen Werks purchased last year and has 180 rounds through it.

From The Website:

These high quality AK-74 rifles are built from all matching Bulgarian AK-74 parts sets. Rifles are built to exacting standards on a new U.S. made Waffen Werks receiver. Each rifle features a brand new chrome lined U.S. made barrel properly chambered for the 5.45x39 round. They have been extremely accurate.

Rifle features a Tapco G-2 trigger set and a U.S. grip and is fully 922r compliant. Accepts all AK-74 mags regardless of country of origin. Rifles also incorporate a side rail for easy installation of scope rails or accessories.

New $619.

AK-74 Accessory package, 4 30rnd parts kits, mag pouch, bayonet and oil bottle. $169

2 Tapco 30rnd parts kits $24

900rnds 7n6 ""banned"" ammo. Full case $240 Since its a partial case I'll value it at $200

AK ergo grip, so you can actually hold the rifle. $20

Kvar O.D. green ""NATO"" length stock, A inch longer to fit us decadent capitalist pigs in the West. I have both the original stock and grip that will go with it. $47

""Venezuelan"" PK-A red dot. A excellent red dot that was built for the Venezuelan Army by the Russians. The great thing about this particular sight it that it uses a regular AA battery and it sits low enough to co-witness the stock AK sights. It also allows a proper cheek weld on the rifle a huge plus. $400

Total price if bought separate $1479

My price $1200. Non negotiable!

No Trades unless your looking to trade a M1A Loaded with a stainless barrel.

I will not break up the package it's all or nothing, sorry I just don't want to deal with all the hassle. I'm in no hurry to sell, I really have no need to sell just trying to diversify my collection so the price is the price. 

Don't bother contacting me saying ""I found all this stuff at the gun store for $30."" If you did, great, buy it. Don't bother telling me.

You line up the Dealer and cover the fees.

I wont travel out of the Denver Metro area so I hope your local or willing to travel.

I have kept it meticulously clean and protected, and its condition reflects this care.  See photos.  It has matching numbers on the receiver, bolt, stock, handguard, and trigger assembly (trigger assembly electropenciled).  The bore is bright and sharp.  Trigger pull is smooth with a crisp break. There is a discreet import mark on side of barrel for N.I. LLC W. HURLEY, NY. This carbine comes with the following original arsenal-provided accessories: cleaning rod, buttstock-storage cleaning kit (brush, gas port cleaner, steel container & closure). The grenade sight has been carefully removed and the removed parts are provided.

Selling it because I also have a full size m1a and i couldn't make up my mind at which one i wanted to keep but i decided on the full size m1a and that is final. So this one is up for sale. Comes with one 10 round magazine and the box it came in. All Illinois laws will be followed. Selling at a very fair price of $1450 cant go any lower, i paid way more for this a few days ago from gats.

 This was made at Novosibirsk Low-Voltage Equipment Plant. LVE has been producing ammo for over 60 years, including significant military contracts for 12.7mm and sniper ammunition, which may be the reason this is the last of the Wolf 200gr FMJ to come in. Apparently the Russian government has this classified this a sniper ammunition and is no longer approving export permits for ""sniper"" ammunition.

I have 2 magpul AR15 mags for it one still have 29 green tipped AP rounds, this gun has only ever had 121 round fired through it, still had the factory grease in it after I went to clean it and realized only the gas system needed a wipe down. has a 4 position rotary diopter sight that is mounted above the back up flip up sight built into the flat top. has a magpul angled hand grip on the quad rail. The folding stock on it is extremely sturdy in both the folded/non folded positions and locks in place very well. I have the original box and everything that came with it, fore-grip, flashlight holder, lock and both keys, and manual. If I hadn't fired the 121rds through it this would be a NIB listing but it looked like to much fun to not shoot it and trust me it was, completely smooth trigger, almost no recoil with the full length gas piston, definitely a point and click style gun. Not too sure if I want any trades. Pretty firm on price but WILL! negotiate. I should be getting a small reddot sight for it this weekend that will go with the sale. Will take more pictures of whatever you want just ask and answer any questions. NO Trades!!"

Up for sale is a LNIB Kel-Tec PMR 30 .22 WMR semi-auto pistol in OD Green.  Comes in the box with 2 - 30rd. mags, not sure where manual is right now, but easily obtained online.  I have another four mags, if buyer interested.  Only two mags through it and these pistols work with a variety of 22 Magnum ammo.  No hurry to get rid of this one as it looks like they are still almost impossible to find unless it's through the private market, I just don't use it right now and could use the cash to complete a few unfinished projects or maybe go towards a Tavor.  I also have different .22 Mag ammo I will sell to the buyer at $10 per 50rds., if interested.

Prefer cash, $560 firm with 2 mags or $660 firm if you want the other 4 new mags($30ea. new), not willing to go any less right now.  If offering some type of trade, let me know if you are wanting all 6 mags or not.  I don't mind keeping the other 4 new mags as I will likely pick-up another PMR later.

I will consider trades, if it's a good deal.  If offering a trade, please be specific on the details of what you want to do and what you are offering. 

Must be 21 and legally able to own a firearm.  Ftf from Rockwall to Mesquite or at Firewheel off 190 for anyone up North interested.

They are chambered in 38 Special, and have 5 1/2"" barrels and a flat black finish. They have beautiful custom, hand-fitted, one-piece, early SAA type walnut grips with sterling silver rattlesnake inlays.  These pistols are out of production and are HIGHLY sought after, of course if you have read this far, you probably already knew that.  I challenge you to find a consecutive SN# pair for sale for under $2000.  These are priced to sell.

Both guns show slight holster wear from being used in CAS competition, but are perfect otherwise. Many people will argue that the USFA clones are actually better than the Colts!  Google it and see for yourself.  These are FINE revolvers, especially with the customizations.  Having consecutive serial numbers is pretty cool too.

I have both original boxes, but they have a little bit of damage on the edges (external only).  All original papers are included and are in perfect condition.

If you want some better pics or more info, please shoot me an email.

May be willing to trade for a gun safe (would need help moving of course) or pre-ban AK.  May consider other high end firearms as well.  It won't hurt to make any reasonable offer.

For sale/trade is my 7ft. slate pool table with accessories.  The table has been used very little, so the condition of the table and felt is in excellent condition.  Included in the sale are the billiard balls, rack, 3 cues, bridge, cue stand, and 2 table brushes (see photos).  Again everything is in excellent condition.  You will have to disassemble the table yourself, I will help carry disassembled pieces as the slate is very heavy.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.  Reason for selling is we are doing remodeling and need the space.

Please refer to pictures for mod list.  This bad boy is ready for some precision work.  Very smooth trigger with definitive wall, crisp break and very audible and tactile reset.  This thing feels like an extension of your hand and the competition sights are VERY easy to pick up on, with the red fiber optic front sight and fully windage and elevation adjustable competition sight.  The extended mag release is the easiest I've ever used.   Stippling isn't too aggressive that it hurts, but is there enough to positively purchase the firearm.  The gun has been degreased and lubricated tastefully in the right spots with slip 2000 machine gun lube.  All the internal parts are smoothed and polished, almost chrome looking.  Comes with stupid looking ""flash hider"" and ""pistol bayonet"".  These were included with the gun and I obviously have no use for them so I'm passing them along.  TO BUILD A COMPARABLE GLOCK WOULD BE RIGHT AT $1000, EVEN AT INTERNET PRICES!
