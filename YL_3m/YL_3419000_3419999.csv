This is a GPI ""Dragon"" Lower (like Centerfire has for $80) with a number of nicer options. As usual, I won't tell you what these parts cost because: you have Google too - and you will see different prices at different times of the year/season/Obama/store/eBay/whatever.

Three accent pieces for your FDE rifle: A LaRue APEG Rough Grip, a CeraKoted FDE Selector, and the MagPul FDE Trigger Guard.

The Lower Parts Kit is from Palmetto and includes their standard Mil-Spec fire control group/trigger. I think their trigger is pretty good for the $30 or so. I have polished this one at contact points with a 6000 grit diamond belt for a smoother release. 

 ""Fancier"" parts are:

LMT SOPMOD stock and LMT buffer tube.

PSA Laser Etched Black buffer and buffer spring.

Troy Ambidexrious QD castle nut mount for your single point or rear two point sling connections.

A Seekins Precision Bolt release - looks good and very functional on my other rifles.

KNS Precision Enhanced Takedown pin. This pin can be completely removed with a ""QD style"" push button. Can also be secured with a split ring so no one tampers with your setup. Front pivot is PSA.

I'm willing to negotiate if you want a lesser configuration (I've got standard stocks, grips, bolt releases, pins, etc), or if you want me to keep the buffer tube altogether because you are building a pistol. Maybe you want it without the grip and the stock because you have your own preference. I'm game for that. I've got a parts graveyard like everyone else.

I believe the price is pretty close to right as the configuration sits. The lower has not been mounted to a particular lower and was transferred as other (as opposed to rifle)."

This is an awesome gun, very nice, soft shooter and very accurate. It features a 4.7 inch barrel, two 18 round mags, and night sights.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZs corrosion resistant black polycoat finish. The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect the shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The extreme is Sig's loaded version of the P220, there's nothing else you could do to this gun.  It includes SigLite night sights (still have lots of life as they're not even two years old), Hogue Extreme G-10 grips, front cocking serrations, short reach trigger, short reset trigger, and 2x 8 round magazines.  

Gun has less than 200 rounds through it (likely closer to $150) and has only been to the range twice.  It has never been holstered, carried, etc.  Cleaned and lubed before shooting the first time and in between range trips.  It's a flawless shooter with both FMJ and JHP ammunition.  Single stack frame with the Hogue G-10 grips is a pleasure to shoot.  Really is in outstanding condition and don't really want to get rid of it.    

A link to the model on Sig's website:

Sale will include all original items (pictured) including case, 2 magazines, lock, and paperwork.

The standard PPQ is already incredibly accurate, the extra inch of barrel length only adds to that. Coupled with possibly the best out of the box striker trigger and you have an amazing competition gun. The PPQ M2 is a true breakthrough in ergonomics for self-defense handguns. The sculpted grip meshes smoothly into the hand. The trigger is the finest ever on a polymer, striker-fired handgun. The styling is elegant and trim. What's more, PPQ M2 has been updated with a traditional reversible mag release button. The 'Quick Defense' trigger works in conjunction with a fully pre-loaded striker assembly. Because the firearm is in a constant cocked state, the striker does not protrude from the back of the slide. The PPQ M2 has a trigger travel of approximately 0.4"" with a relatively short trigger reset of 0.1"". The trigger pull of 5.6 lbs remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. The PPQ M2 has two drop safeties and a firing pin block for safe carry. The frame has interchangeable backstraps and a Picatinny Mil-Spec rail. It has low profile, 3-dot sights with a windage adjustable rear. We buy guns and layaway is available! Sorry, no trades and all state and local laws apply. We are an FFL dealer so you must be able to pass a background check. 3% credit card fee. We can also ship this gun to other FFLs if needed."

- Mossy Oak Break-Up Camouflage Dipped Synthetic Stock, 
- Ruger BX-25  25 Round Magazine, 
- Adjustable Rear Sight, 
- Includes Backpack-Style Case. Scope Base, Lock and Manuals

Takedown Rifle separates into two halves for convenient transport and storage options. Barrel and for end easily separates from the action and butt stock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown. Friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need adjustment after the first reassembly. Lockup is secure and repeatable ensuring an accurate return to zero - even when receiver mounted optics are used. 

Includes a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, including attached scope, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide extra storage. Padded, single-shoulder strap.

$370 cash for rifle.

I also have a Nikon Prostaff Rimfire 4X32 Scope (Nikoplex Reticle) that was purchased new in box, test mounted on a Ruger 10/22 but never fired with the scope attached.   If you  buy the rifle I will sell the scope for $60.  It normally retails new for over $105.

This is the only model that the upper only needs to be swapped out for a 223/5.56 upper and the lower needs no changes to it. This system also employs straight blowback design just like a pistol so reliability is that of a pistol and no has gas pressure issues to deal with. Comes with lots of Magpul upgrades, Magpul MOE adjustable stock, Magpul MOE handguard with Magpul  MOE foregrip, Magpul K2 pistol grip with butt grip storage. It will also come with original stock, pistol grip, and M4 carbine handguard.  It comes with 3 factory steel Sten mags that that Olympic Arms makes just for this model and they are $50 each. The 9mm upper alone sells for $750. They are online around $950-$1,100 with usually only 1 magazine and very basic furniture. I have $150 in upgrades on top of the cost of the rifle, so I have $1,300 in the rifle

Shoots straight as a laser. LDA action is incredible. Low round count. Pistol was purchased from a friend that got sick. It was originally intended as an IDPA competition pistol. Very nice, smooth action, great follow up shots. I would not sell this if I did not need to.

Face to face sale would be ideal, although I have done out of state deals and I'm not opposed to that, but so you know up front, I don't do paypal, I will only accept a money order, and it MUST wait until the money order has been cleared, and verified GOOD. Buyer to assume shipping fee."

Makes for an extremely soft shooting 10mm), tree bark stipple, 3 mags, box, papers, spent casing, range bag ect... 

Plus comes with 220rds of 10mm ammunition as follows:

150rds of Remington 180gr FMJ
50rds of PMC 170gr JHP
20rds of Cor-Bon 135gr JHP

Also comes with original factory slide stop, mag release, and factory guide rod. I have not had the time to install the TTI sights yet, however, in my opinion, they are the best competition sights on the market! Much better than Dawson! The DPM System is about the best guide rod you can buy on the market. It significantly reduces recoil, gives better control and accuracy, superior slide and frame protection, improved firing speed, elimination of jams and much more!  

If interested in buying (local only) here is how I have everything broken down:
Glock 20 gen4 with VTSS and VTMR: 620$
DPM System: 95$
TTI Sights: 85$ 
Ammunition: 120$
Range bag: 10$

920$ firm for everything pictured. Will not separate any items from listing. 

Would prefer to trade"

The only part that you will need to purchase is a rear sight.   If you throw a scope on it you could probably live without it.  

I’m not asking for trades and only cash.  If you appreciate performance rifles you’ll love this one.

Every component, from barrel to spring, add up to be just over $2,400. I’m asking $2,100 for it.  Why the discount? I’m eager to start my next build.  If you’re interested I also have a case that it fits into perfectly.  That case is $80.

Please read all the descriptions and posting before responding. I don't want to be rude, but it will save time, and not wasting my time and yours. Had some bad and crazy, and weird responses in the past. I'm easy to get along with. But I just don't want or need the dramas on here (got enough of them at home).

First, is a set of AK-47 internal/fire control springs (recoil spring, hammer, sear, disconnector) for a 7.62X39 cal type guns. All brand new, and still sealed in the plastic bag.

Second, is an original Yugo Zastava Krinkov style muzzle brake, and is threaded to fit your M92 or M85 pistol. It's as new. Only mounted it once on the gun to see how it looks and fit tested. The set comes with, detent spring, detent, and roll pin. It's threaded in 26x1.5mm LH to fit most PAP pistols and rifles.

Third, is a U.S. made copy of the well known Yugoslavian AK-47 RPK/M70 series rifle ""fat"" wood pistol grip. Kind of hard to find now. It's brand new, unstained. Not sure what kind/type of wood it is (looks hardwood?). This is a really nice wood pistol grip for your Yugo AK-47 rifle, or PAP M92/85 guns (or it will fit on most AK-47 type guns). Had one installed on my M92 with amber shellac finished (but I sold my M92, and regretted selling it), and it was really nice. But you can put or stain it whatever finish you like.  This grip is a really excellent copy of the original Yugo wood grip. Which is selling for $150 or more online if you can find one. Grip screw/bolt is included (not pictured). But no other extras or hardware included.

Last but not the least, is an Ace Ltd AK-47/74 hinge (mount/base not included) for a folding stock. It's used but not abused. It's in very good condition. Had to shave some part (as pictured) of it to fit right to the base. But it'll still function, and not damage or anything like that. Mounting screws/bolts are included (not pictured). But no other extras or hardware included.

$150 obo for all, or trade. Sell/trade the whole thing as package deal only. Will not separate the parts. Please don't ask. No shipping. Meet around Lexington only."

Its specifications are very similar to the M1938, with the unique addition of a permanently affixed, side-folding cruciform-spike bayonet. These rifles are inexpensive to shoot and have a horrendous muzzle blast. Shoot one at night and you'll see what I mean. See photo below. Due to ongoing tensions between the US and Russia, future availability of these rifles is uncertain at best.

It has Williams Gun Sight adjustable fiber optic sights. Even though the pistol has had only light range use I had everthing refit to max out the pistols performance. All springs have been replaced in pistol and magazines. Reduced hammer spring to lighten the DA trigger pull, increased recoil spring to tame the felt recoil and limit wear and tear on the frame. and a 5% increase for all the new magazine springs to insure proper feeding. Friction points and feed ramp have been lightly polished. It also has a Houge/Ruger wrap around grip. Only very light scuffing can be found on the fiberglass filled urethane frame, everything else is 100%.

This pistol is very accurate and reliable... While it's a bit bulky it beats out most 1911s that I own. Feeds anything very well, from 180 to 230 FMJ and HP, it seems to have no issues with even the widest mouth hollow points.  It has a very smooth DA trigger pull with no creep that runs about 8lbs, the SA trigger breaks at roughly 3.5lbs with very little pre travel. The adjustable Williams Gunsight Fire Sights (of Davidson Mi) fiber optic sights catch just the right amount of light indoors or outdoor.
