Ok, guys and gals. I just wanted to give some information about a solvent that was just released at the Shot Show 2014. This solvent is classified as MIL-PRF-680C TYII

It has been in the military and private business for quite a while and just became available to the civilian market the middle of January at Shot Show 2014

I am working very closely with the Distrubuter to provide information and demonstrations of this. Samples will be available around the end of July 2014 in 5ml sample bottles.

This stuff just cuts the crud. This is a pH neutral solvent that will not interact with you'r fine heirloom pieces furniture or metal.
Features Include an impressive list of abilities.


1. No HAPS
2 Cleans ALL Fouling... and I do mean all of it.
3 Is used by military and private sector so it has a proven track record, not just recent but in prior years. This just came available to the general public just this spring. The word is just getting out and i am here to help enable and assist that. 
4 It has virtually no odor and is clear
5 comes in 2 ounce and larger sizes for all your project needs
6 Is the only solvent you will ever need again. You can give or dispose of every other solvent you have used at any time. This is the ultimate solvent.
7 Is meant to be re-used again and again and never wears out. All you really need to do is if you use a larger quantity is have a base container to hold the drip and then use a coffee filter to clean out the particulates. I myself have never found a need to use a bunch. Just the spray bottle itself and qtips and a brush.
8 It is very easy on the body bit hard on the gunk. This is a pure petroleum distilled that has all the damaging parts removed from it unlike most solvents on the market
9 Since this just came out you can also be one of the first to reap the benefits of what really is the future of solvents that is here today.

10 last but not least. I have given and done and made more than a dozen demonstrations in person to the metro area local gun stores and private businesses along with numerous one on one show and tell and result with the persons own firearm. From a shotgun, to ar15, ak47, revolver, semi auto pistol, each and every person was amazed at the quality of the clean and the amazing quickness at which this solvent not only worked, but out performed their current solvent of choice.

11 Once the firearm is cleaned then your favorite lubricant should be used since this cleans every thing else off that was there prior.

Lastly, people have been constantly asking me why I am doing all of this work for. making appointments, driving for hours, doing in person demonstrations and telling everything plus more about this new solvent. The answer is quite simple. I want to make a difference in your firearms sporting experience by sharing forward designed information that can and will make a difference in the way you currently clean your firearms. The what I would call toys of the trade cost a small fortune so we need to protect that investment by using good products that come out at various times in the life cycle of our interest in these things.

Not only do they deserve to be treated and cleaned and lubricated by the best products, but you also deserve to have the knowledge and information to enable yourself to make a buying decision on products that you spend your hard earned money on.

Every single instance and demo that I have done and shown has only added to the rave reviews and accolades of this new solvent. From oohs and ahhs to pure disbelief. But after seeing the results, every person or group that I have showed this to has said where can i get my own. You will also want your own as well after getting the rest of the information about this stuff.

So be on the cutting edge. Be one of the first in the country to not only use something that is brand new on the market, but also a person that knows an excellent new item on the market and is open to change. This stuff works, and it works perfectly.

Once you learn of this almost space age solvent you will be telling every single person that you know in your circle of people about it. 


The word of mouth discussion and referral is most likely the best way to learn about stuff and the stuff is here and now today.

So email me right now after reading this and i will link you to the web page with the solvent information. 

This included the MSDS sheet, the TDS sheet, advertising information, the sizing and pricing and also everything else you need to know. There is even a link to insta gram showing before and after images.

I also have a youtube channel where I am currently producing videos for the solvent. If interested I can link you to some of them.

Image shown is my Ruger GP100 match Champion with the before and after solvent clean of two cylinder blast face areas. Round count was around 300 of mixed 38 special and 357 magnum in preparation of a full demo. The solvent was sprayed on and left a total of 3 minutes and then scrubbed off with a bronze brush. Just like new.
Thank you very much. I look forward to receiving an email from you asking for the link to the solvent."

I fixed it the correct way using 2 ton epoxy. I have no idea how it was cracked. There were no gouges or dings in the wood and zero marks in the bluing. Then I stripped the stock and forearm and did 15 coats of hand rubbed boiled linseed oil. It came out super nice and you can't really see the crack. I have shot a box of cheapo federal 38 specials through it and it groups pretty good and is a blast to shoot. Fun rifle that I just don't really have a use for. I would rate it at 98% due to the stock repair and a small scratch where the previous owner used a screw driver that was too big to remove the magazine tube end cap screw.

460,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3209460,For Sale:  Tactical Helmets for sale,"Northwest, San Antonio, Texas",$ 525,"Listed On: Monday, October 20, 2014",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Ok, so in case you're in the market, I build these helmets. Typical turn around is 3-4 weeks, depending on how fast it takes parts to get to me, since right now I don't build enough of them to justify losing the storage space by keeping stuff in bulk. Can be any color you want, I can even do multicam and 'snakeskin', but those will typically be a bit more expensive. (currently ""specialty"" Paint schemes are +$25, but I reserve the right to adjust that number depending on the difficulty of the request.)

Helmet shells are 1/2 inch thick Kevlar and have are rated as follows:
 Enhanced Kevlar Ballistic Ratings: V50: 2,150 fps (685 Mps) Minimum. These are NOT AirSoft replicas, but can be used for AirSoft if you wish

Price for each unit is $525 (includes shipping and insurance). ""Basic"" build comes with: helmet (painted single color), ACH style suspension (pads) and chinstrap, rails, NVG shroud and Velcro. Also pictured is an alternative suspension system (+$75) and IFF marker lights (+$20 for visible color, +$25 for IR, +$40 for both colors). Can add other accessories if you need them, but obviously that will change the price accordingly. 

I accept PayPal and cash in hand.

Please feel free to message me if you're interested, and feel free to show the pics to someone if you think they're interested/in the market for a helmet.

Thanks for looking."

Other minor things of note, has the 5th amendment dust cover and a ""don't tread on me"" laser engraved into the trigger guard. Even with the slightly raised reflex mount the backup sights are still clear through the optic and are dead on for shorter range. It has some character, so minor scratches here and there seeing how it's actually been used and not a safe queen. Comes with one full magpul magazine with green tip ammo.

Everything was installed with care and the gun itself has been well maintained. In extra parts alone your looking at around 700-800 dollars. Add in cost of the rifle, you're looking at 1300+ dollars. My asking price is 1000 for the lot, optic included but I'm willing to barter on prices. Trade wise I'm not too interested in pistols/shotguns unless you've got a VEPR 12. Rifle wise I'm looking at other battle rifles, CETME, FAL, PTR91, VEPR's in .308 or 54r, etc. But cash is preferred. Gotta fix up the bike because go figure as soon as the nice weather gets here, it breaks down.

Caliber is .243 Winchester.

Stock is French Walnut with Rosewood highlights. It has a rollover cheekpiece, and is hand checkered.

At the time this gun was made, it would have likely been one of the top end production rifles available. The only period ad I could find for the Premier Grade was from 1967, and retail price was $220, which would be $1567 today!

Overall gun is in very good shape. Some dents and dings in the stock as pictured, nothing major. Bluing on the barrel is immaculate, some slight wear on the receiver as pictured on the moving surfaces. The kind of wear you’d expect to see on a brand new rifle after a few days in the field. Bore is immaculate. I think you’d struggle to find one of these in better shape.

Factory installed rifle sights, and factory drilled and tapped for scope mounts or a peep sight.

Gun has been disassembled, parts ultrasonically cleaned (where possible, everything else was cleaned by hand), reoiled, and reassembled. This gun is ready to rock and roll.

If I’m reading the proofmarks on the barrel correctly, this gun was made in 1972.

I bought it thinking I wanted a larger caliber than the 22-250 I already had (which is also a left hand savage 110), but the more I thought about it, for 99% of what I’m ever going to do with a rifle, 22-250 is more than adequate, and 243 really is overkill for me."

The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged. KEY FEATURES: *Action design based on the venerable Model 870 – ultra-smooth and reliable *Rugged ArmorLokt coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces *SuperCell recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% *Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics *Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably *Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels *28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes *Sling swivel studs built-in *Includes Modified Rem Choke

If you're not familiar with these rifles, they are imported in sporter configuration and need to be converted back to AK configuration. It's essentially a Russian made AK with new factory chrome lined barrel and russian receiver. I installed a new trigger group, trigger guard, gas piston, gas tube, bullet guide, and new surplus romanian furniture. The rifle is 922r compliant and accepts 30 round standard magazines. I have less than 100 rounds down the tube. Just function checked it last week and it shoots great and groups well at 100 yards. I have too many AK's and really enjoy converting more than actually shooting. I'm open to trades depending on what you have, but mainly looking for cash. Questions?

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

A G - serial number prefix. A G was the first prefix used early in 1943. A also indicates the gun was assembled using

 I am technically the third owner, my father being the 2nd, he bout it while I was deployed with the agreement that I would buy it when I got to the states. First owner said he never even shot it, and the rifles appearance makes me belive him. The engraving on the floor plate makes we wonder if this was for a presentation of sorts. In short, I'm no longer physically able to hunt after my deployment, and it's become a safe queen. Someone should get enjoyment out of such a beautiful rifle.

 At the moment I'm not looking to trade, but offers are still welcome. I'm asking $650 o.b.o.

This is a solid rifle and it is a fair price, especially considering you will not be paying taxes on it like you would if you got it at a retail store.  Please don’t send low ball offers.  I am not desperate to get rid of this gun but I do want to thin my collection a bit.  I have only put 120 rounds through it (4 full mags).  That being said it is a good rifle and it is well into its “Break-In”.

If you are interested contact me and we can make some arrangements. I am not really interested in trades at this time as I want to use the cash for another build but if you have something interesting I will listen. I will strongly consider trading for a Kriss V Special Duty pistol or SBR (not the CRB) or even a Chiappa Rhino 50DS in .357."

This handgun has only 200 rounds through the barrel as recommended by the manufacturer for break in, and has spent most of the time in the box.  It is less than 2 years old.  Asking $325, and compared to prices in stores or on line shops it is a steal as you save tax.  I have all the paperwork and a concealed holster for the CW9

About the gun: The Kahr CW9 is a semi-automatic small-frame pistol chambered in 9mm. Kahr is one of the premier manufacturers of pistols and has lines for major calibers such as .45, .40, .380 and, of course, 9mm. The CW9 stand alone whereas others have a handful of sub-models. What makes it different is it’s larger than the other models.

Otherwise it has similar features including a locked-breech system where the backwards force is absorbed by the slide rather than the frame. The overall width is 0.90″ making it easier to conceal. It has a double-action only trigger that sets off the action with a longer pull. It doesn’t have a safety, but it’s less likely something other than a trigger finger will pull a double-action trigger all the way back. It also has a passive striker block, which is an internal safety that prevents the gun from accidentally discharging if dropped. And it comes with adjustable three-dot sights.  The frame is black, while the slide has a matte stainless finish.

The sights are the typical dot front, bar rear configuration found on other Kahr pistols.  The front sight is polymer and fixed onto the slide.  The rear slide is steel and dovetailed.  The rear steel sight allows the shooter to use the sight to rack the slide one handed when training for one hand reloads and malfunction clearing drills.

They are similar to the Czech vz. 24 rifle, featuring open sights, 8x57mm IS chambering, carbine-length barrels, hardwood stocks, and straight bolt handles. All M24 series weapons are designed to accept the M-24/48 pattern bayonet.

The first Mauser-pattern rifle produced in Yugoslavia was the M24. Its predecessor, the FN Model 1924 had been produced for the Yugoslav army by FN Herstal until the Ministry and FN signed a contract on the purchase of the license for production of rifles 7.9 mm M 24. Nearly all M24's were produced either before or during World War II, at the Kragujevac Arsenal plant. The M24 and Model 1924 are nearly identical.

M24 series rifles were used by the Royal Yugoslav Army and the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II. The final additions to the M24 family were the M24/47 and M24/52 rifles. Both were produced by reworking existing prewar Model 1924 rifles after World War II at the Zastava Arms (formally Kragujevac Arsenal) plant, which was at that time under the control of the postwar communist government. ""47"" and ""52"" indicate the beginning of the rebuild program for each respective model: 1947 for the M24/47 and 1952 for the M24/52. Minor cosmetic differences exist between the M24/47 and M24/52, but the rifles are nearly identical to one another and to their predecessors, the Model 1924 and M24.
