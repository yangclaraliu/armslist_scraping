This King Cobra has a heavy-duty barrel and as a first for Colt, a Cobra head was part of the barrel stamp breaking with the tradition of having only the name and caliber stamped on the barrel. It also has a full barrel length cylinder ejection rod protection shroud, and a thick solid rib on top of the barrel. The King Cobra's sighting system consists of a fixed iron red insert front sight and a fully adjustable iron white outline rear sight. This King Cobra was manufactured in 1989, two years after Colt first introduced the blue finish. Most of the King Cobra's you see today have a stainless steel finish, not this one. Unique to this revolver was that the King Cobra was a first in the gun business, in that it was the first time a new model of revolver was introduced in stainless steel before a blued version. The King Cobra is in very good condition. It has a mark that mirrors the top grip line however it is under the grip and two small blemished near the left trigger guard.  It also has a slight turn line. The finish is original as are all the components. Buyer pays $50.00 shipping and tranfer to a FFL required. Thanks for looking."

The CX4 is a semi-auto pistol-caliber carbine designed to give you the familiar controls of your favorite Beretta combat handgun. It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies across the US, while its versatility and accessory options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.

Barrel:  16"" chrome lined mil-spec chrome moly vanadium barrel, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine gas system.   M4 style profile is phosphate coated to mil-specs, and is High Pressure tested, and Magnetic Particle inspected, to ensure quality and dependability.   Barrel is finished off with a pinned F-marked Front sight base, MOE handguards and A2 Flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer, and are marked with the Palmetto State Armory logo on the left side, up front, just below the rail.  Upper is topped off with a PSA Carry handle rear sight.

Bolt: Bolt is made of Mil-spec Carpenter 158 steel, Shot peened, and MPI. Gas key is secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked per mil-spec. Bolt carrier is parkerized outside, chrome lined inside, and laser engraved with the Palmetto State Armory logo.

Lower:  These forged lowers are quality made using 7075-T6 aluminum and are marked ""MULTI"" for caliber.  Finish is Black Hardcoat Anodize per MIL-8625 Type 3 class 2.  Mil-spec sized buffer tube is forged of 7075 aluminum, is dry film lube coated on the inside, has 6 adjustment positions, is finished with a MOE stock and has a staked castle nut.  Standard carbine buffer is Black anodized and has the PSA logo on the face. The ALG ACT combat trigger uses advanced coatings to hard lube the contact points for a mil-spec trigger that is much smoother than possible with conventional finishes.  The result is a very smooth single stage trigger with a crisp break that is not lighter than the M4/M15 minimum specifications of 5.5lbs."

Double barrel flintlock shotguns are hard to find in any condition--this one is practically new. The 29 inch barrels are cylinder bored in 20 gauge or .62 caliber. All hand-forged steel furniture is in the white. The locks have been tuned to function reliably, and the frizzens spark like crazy. Lock time seems very quick. This black powder shotgun has been fired little and cleaned properly to keep the bores in excellent shape. A special feature of this double barrel is a custom $100 ramrod that looks like a standard wood version except this one has a steel core that makes it unbreakable. It has threads on booth ends to accept two different sizes of cleaning brushes and jags. Cleanup is easy with this double barrel flinter because of the hook breach. Located in Waco. Asking $659Check out the videos on YouTube - just search for double barrel flint shotgun. Will trade for Uberti 1875 single action revolver in stainless/nickel 45 Colt w/ 7.5"" barrel."

Up for sale is my Rossi R44102 44mag, blued, 2in barrel, made in 2013. At 31oz empty, this is a absolute cannon for its size. This is a Taurus Tracker essentially and backed by Taurus's lifetime warranty. No box or papers. Original grips not included. What is on there now is how I purchased it. The grips are much much smaller and are from a Taurus. Total round count is unknown. I have personally put 300rds through this. That included 100rds commercial, and 200rds of my reloads using various loads, as low as 17gr, and no higher than 19gr, of Alliant 2400. Gun in in great shape, with tight lockup. Has a super nice trigger as well. Makes nice for a cc piece, or like i originally planned, for packing up north. 

Here is what comes with the gun

I bought a pair of these 3 years ago to have as back up bird guns.  This one has only been factory shot.  Its been sitting in the safe since purchased.  Very hardy gun, great for beating around the swamps. Shoots when wet, dirty, icy, pretty much whatever you want to throw at it.  I do not have the choke tube/ gas wrench for this gun (they can be bought on the net for 8 bucks)  Comes with a IC Steel extended choke tube only.  These can also be bought cheaply on the internet.  Price is $400 OBO, no low balls please.  I will only sell to WI resident 21 years or older. CCW holders take priority.  Must provide ID for back ground check and sign sales receipt.

It is the Grade II with Ram head etched on one side and Bear head on the other with gold trigger and high gloss walnut.  Unique in that it has the gold trigger but Blued and 300 mag is very rare in this Caliber and condition made Pre 1972!!!

Has a 2x7x33 red-field and a leather safari sling 
Comes with 2 Boxes of .300 win mag Hornaday which is $40.00 per box
*** also it coms with a 5 round clip.  Additional clips can be purchased on about 3 websites I guess for an additional $150.00 per clip. Has to be a pre 1993.

I made the mistake of walking into the Cabelas library and comparing the beauty of a High powered Glossy Walnut collector in the glass case vs the ugly Synthetic New Bolt 300 win mag for $800.00 right outside the doors I was considering.   Needless to say I whipped out the credit card had them open the glass case and never looked back.

That said..This has been sitting in my safe since the hunt.. we all know what Hornady .300 win mag rounds cost and I am not a reloader so it sits.  I know what it is worth and what I paid for it.

I am very approachable and looking to let some one have a fantastic performing high value firearm for much less than it is worth..very open to Trades in fact hope thats how this goes..I am not looking to get what its valued at so someone is going to save a lot of money here if this is your desired Rifle..I am looking to get something I can use and want currently.

I have a CCW permit if it ends up being a multi gun or handguns. 

I will take cash if thats what you want to do or gun and cash combo 

Just let me know what your willing to trade.

The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The new Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever(installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a new sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.

I am selling my .22 caliber Benjamin Genesis nitro powered air rifle. Since its nitro powered its %70 more quiet and also can be kept cocked without losing power. It shoots the pellet from 800-1000 fps depending on the pellet, so its no joke. It also has an adjustable cheeck plate/pad on the buttstock. It is new and has less than 100 shots through it. It also has a decently nice custom scope that cost around $100, the scopes great up to x16 just not top name brand, but way better than stock and not cheap. It has quite a nice rail for attatchmentes, its a full sized rail, not the little one. It also comes with a couole hundred lead pellets. I am only selling it because I need the money, if interested or have questions please text me at REDACTED or call if you have to. Thanks!"

*RIGHT HAND STOCK*

AK-47 bumpski stock made from 100% billeted aluminum. This stock does it all. Fits the AK-47, AK-74, and the saiga shotguns.

The bumpski will have the ability to be attached to different firearms simply by purchasing a different attachment bar. That is right. You simply remove the bottom half of the bumpski, purchase a different attachment for your SKS, Mini-14, or AR-15 and you do not have to buy a new stock time after time.

Great way to make an affordable way to have a bump fire stock for several firearms without having to disassemble your firearm. Simply pull down on the selector pin, slip off the bottom half of your bumpski, slip back on to your attachment bar on a different firearm.

This innovative Weather Shield coating has been tested to be 50x more corrosion resistant than stainless steel.
 After 350 hours of exposure to the elements, stainless steel showed wear and rust while Weather Shield coating remained impervious. Applied to all critical metal parts (the exterior of the barrel and receiver), T/C’s Weather Shield provides tough-as-nails protection that keeps your Venture performing at its best on every hunt.
