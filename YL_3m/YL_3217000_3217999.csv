Crimson Trace® presents the MVF-515 Red; a revolutionary, patent-pending concept that combines three tactical tools for your AR style rifle into a single modular package. With a rock-solid 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum hard-anodized tang as the foundation of the foregrip, the unit also features a red laser sight and a 150/200 Lumen-LED light module. The laser and light are instinctively activated as you hold the weapon, and activation switches are ambidextrous. This allows operators to select the light or the laser individually or simultaneously. Both laser and light functions are programmable with three illumination modes to select from including: independent momentary, strobe or constant beam. A master on/off switch permits complete shutdown of either laser or light. Being a modular unit, users may separately purchase a green laser module for direct replacement. The MVF-515 Red won the 2010 Academy of Excellence Award for ""Self-Defense Product of the Year"".

I doubt a rifle that sold for $3,100 4 days ago is now being sold for $1,500.


Three easy ways to reduce the number of scams you come across (not a guarentee mind you):
1)  Google image search the included pictures.  Google can show you if they exist elsewhere on the internet.
2)  Google text serach the description.
3)  Ask for a photo of the item with random household items or a piece of paper with a specific word on it.

This just ensures the seller HAS the item not that they will ship it to you.  Consider asking them to ship it through a local FFL near them that YOU pick.  If you pick up the cost of the extra FFL getting involved there should be no hassle.  The FFL can hold it, and once they verify that they have it you can send payment.  

Good luck out there."

OUR BEGINNING GRADE OF WOOD STOCKED RIFLE IN THE UNITED STATES. BEAUTIFUL NEW RIFLES. ALL AUCTIONS SUBJECT TO IN STORE SALES. PICTURES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF WOOD ONLY. The detachable magazine was right at the top of the -optimisation list. Here we managed to find the perfect solution – ergonomically ideal and convenient to use. But we have also taken the fans of the integral magazine into account. Either way, it was important to us that our bolt action rifle remained the benchmark in compact design and usability. And we were able to do this without restriction. Nevertheless, the new magazine type is just one of a multitude of innovations that make the R8 so unique. The trigger as a crucial factor in precision and its safe functioning, even under extreme conditions, posed a very special constructional challenge, one that has been brilliantly mastered. In order to make shooting with the R8 as comfortable and safe as possible, we attached immense importance to optimizing the stock, reaching a new level of perfection here, too. We made all efforts to achieve maximum technical performance without compromising on superior style and design. Our passion for gun making is perfectly reflected in the dynamic but elegant contours of the R8. Unmistakable in its overall design, the R8 sets a new standard in 21st century firearm technology and aesthetics.

Never fired Sig P938 Blackwood with new Shepard's IWB holster, 2 Murphy OWB holsters, 50 rnds of 147 grain ammo, box, and factory stuff. I just prefer larger handguns. 

 With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. (The extended mag gives 7 plus one) The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size."

The rifle is in excellent condition and has been in my safe for many years.  I have never fired the rifle.  The rifle also comes with 2 boxes (40 rounds) of new Remington Core Lokt hunting ammo (currently $33.49 per box at Midway USA).  This is not a sport version but the full military configuration.  This rifle was given to me as a gift but I am not into antique firearms.  It is taking up space in my gun safe and I would like to trade for something modern and smaller.  The rifle has the markings below with the meaning in parentheses.  I am asking $350 cash or $400 trade value.  I would really prefer to trade.  I am also open to putting cash + gun toward the trade if you have something worth more.  I am open to offers as long as they are reasonable.  I would prefer to pick up a .45 ACP handgun.  Thanks for looking.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a brand new, factory fresh and hard to find Springfield Armory 1911 TRP Operator .45 acp pistol!  This beautiful  pistol features a 5″ barrel, Night Sights, Armory Kote finish, Tac Rail, G10 grips, and much more!

I only have one in stock, and have it priced to sell for just $1,429.00 (cash price).

Springfield PC9105LP 1911 TRP Operator, 45 ACP, 5 in, G10 Grips, Armory Kote Finish, Night Sights, Tac Rail, 7 Rd

The TRP standard line is designed around the same specifications as the FBI contract pistol, the TRP-PRO model. The Springfield TRP offers nearly the same performance and features as the TRP-PRO model at a fraction of the cost. From its fully checkered front strap and mainspring housing, to its durable Armory Kote Teflon or stainless steel finish, this gun can only be described as a knock out value.

The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.

From Nikon:

The new PROSTAFF 5 2.5-10x40 features several technology upgrades that will satisfy even the most demanding hunters. A bright new optical system, remarkable hand-turn reticle adjustments with Spring-Loaded Zero-Reset turrets, and a convenient quick-focus eyepiece with a 4x zoom ratio, make adjustments while in a shooting position a breeze. The PROSTAFF 5 2.5-10x40 outfitted with the BDC reticle is an ideal fit for a variety of hunting situations and can be used with Nikon Spot On Ballistic Match Technology to take the guesswork out of compensating for bullet drop. With enough power for the longest-range shots and a wide field of view to keep you on target even when shooting through thick brush and timber, this is one scope you can truly count on in any situation. In addition all PROSTAFF 5 riflescopes are built with fully multicoated optics for maximum light transmission, even in extreme low light environments.

Ruger 4192 Red Label Over/ Under 12 Gauge Shotgun, 30 Inch Barrels, 3 Inch Chamber, American Walnut Stock
Back and better than ever, the NEW Ruger® Red Label over-and-under shotgun represents American gunmaking at its finest. Known for years as a top choice of American hunters and clay shooters for its world-renowned rugged construction and handsome American styling – the Red Label returns. Newly redesigned, the shotgun now features refined inner workings, a new center of gravity and reduced recoil, making it lively in the hand and even more pleasurable to shoot. These improvements make the new Red Label shotgun the perfect choice for hunting upland game, waterfowling, sporting clays, skeet or even just informal clay target shooting with family. Built by American workers in American factories, the Ruger® Red Label shotgun is another 100% American-made product from Ruger.
Features:
*Automatic, two-position tang safety/barrel selector provides instant visibility and accessibility.
*Finely polished, stainless steel receiver is corrosion-resistant and has no exposed pins or screws.
*Reliable, single mechanical trigger that allows for firing the second barrel without recocking and features rebounding hammers for easy opening.
*Sleek, compact locking system is considered to be among the strongest ever built for over-and-under shotguns.
*Precision matched, blued alloy steel, cold hammer-forged barrels made of high-strength chrome-molybdenum steel feature 2″ forcing cones and maximum back boring for superior recoil reduction and more uniform patterns.
*1/4″ dovetailed, free-floating, ventilated rib with brass bead front sight is stress relieved, contour-grounded, precisely fitted and silver-brazed (not soft-soldered) to the finished monoblock.
*Beautifully crafted, cut-checkered American Walnut stock features a traditional pistol grip, tapered, slim forend and a stainless steel latch release. A soft Pachmayr® buttpad is mounted on the 14.5″ length of pull stock, which features a 1.5″ drop at the comb and a 2.5″ drop at the heel.
*Five steel-shot compatible, screw-in Briley® chokes and wrench included, featuring two skeet chokes and one full, one modified and one improved cylinder choke, plus a premium-quality Briley® choke tube wrench.
*Also includes: custom molded, semi-soft case; safety lock.
