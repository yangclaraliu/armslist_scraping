Also just had the center serving replaced by NC Hunter Supply ($10). This string is like new as it hasn't been shot much in the past year. I only had the serving replaced because I noticed a little wear to it where it latches when cocked. NCHS said it was fine but I insisted so new owner would be set to hunt for at least a year or more. So here it is ready to go at a great discounted price for what you'd have to spend to match it. This is a great bow for beginner or professional. I killed 2 does with it last year with no problem.

This gun was bought years ago as a gift for my father and has only been shot a couple of times. Other than that it has been kept in his safe. Anyone familiar with guns knows about the Colt Anaconda Edition. These revolvers only increase in value and I have seen this same revolver selling on other sites for 2400.00 and none of the ones I have seen can compare to the condition of this one. It has a 6.5"" barrel and in mint condition. I am asking 1900.00$ FIRM. The only reason I'm not asking more is because I lost the original box and I know that's important to some people. No low balling please! I know the value of this gun. Thank you. I can promise you you will not find a better deal out there for this highly sought after Colt..."

The pic is just an example, some of items shown have been sold and others obtained. 
I am located in Grays Harbor county but I travel to the Oly/Lacey area occasionally as well.  
Mostly looking to trade for firearm(s) but also would trade for dirty green paper as well. Prices will be more than that chinese made bullshit pedaling hellhole of a store that people shop at for some reason, but I have no limit and my items are in stock and unemployed sweat pant wearing obese idiots aren't standing in line at 7am here for ammo, but prices will be cheaper than a lot of hard core gouging online retailers as well. 

I am interested in anything that goes bang, and I don't already have.  Unusual, older, hard to find guns are more interesting to me.  I am probably good on cheap shotguns and hunting rifles but you never know.  Probably wont be able to do any trading once the worst law in history of America goes into effect.  If you did vote for that law, please do not contact me as I have a hard time dealing with sheep and morons. 
Just let me know what you are looking for and what you have. I check my email every evening, thanks."

Located in Bellingham WA - you'll probably have to come to me.

FOR SALE/TRADE:
Various AK-47 types and configurations
Bolt action Type-53 Mosin, standard spec but refinished wood. 
.44 Magnum Desert Eagle w/ Hogue finger grips, case, Eagle branded shoulder holster and 5 standard mags. Very accurate and doesn't jam with good ammo (I've heard that's the case with most of them, if they jam people are using garbage underpowered ammo.)
Taurus PT92 9mm with one standard mag, one 32rd mag, police style black fobus Safariland holster.
Bernardelli P-One 9mm, 1 mag. Very smooth and comfortable gun.
CZ-52 in one of my favorite calibers, 7.62x25, which is making a come-back with commercial ammo out and sure to come down in price to be more in line with 9mm soon. 2 mags and holster.
Bolt action 16ga holds 5+1 without block in it. I got it with a piece of wood that fits inside the spring and plugs it to 2+1. Can include that if someone wants it for hunting rather than home-D.
Full-size 1911 (Shooter's Arms Chief which is a non-standard frame style with a finger groove and squared trigger guard) with quick release paddle style holster, extended ambidextrous slide release, muzzle brake, 10rd extended mag and 2 8-rd mags, plastic under-grip mag-well attachment.
Mosin revolver with lots of gold accents.

All guns are black/black finish/black plastic with wood, silver or gold accents. Pics on specific gun request.
I have ammo for everything and could release some or all of it with each sale.

WILL TRADE FOR:
Anything interesting, specifically mid to high caliber Semi-auto rifles and pistols.
I'm not a huge fan of bolt-actions, collectibles or most shotguns. I am big on military, police or government / agent surplus.
Pistols:
I want a Jericho / Uzi Eagle / Baby Eagle pistol in any caliber. Steel frame only, I don't like the new polymer versions.
I wouldn't mind a .40 or .45 CZ / Witness / Tanfoglio / EAA / TZ or an odd off-brands from Turkey or anywhere else so long as they're nice looking, working and high-cap.
9mm or .22 Sig / Beretta or other pistols with threaded muzzles.
I also want something with some extra power for fun. .50 AE DE (or barrel/mag combo or trade a .50 for my .44) or maybe a .357 snub-nose revolver or a .44 midsize revolver. I like the EAA Windicator - a similar style would be nice.

Rifles:
Maybe a FAL / L1A1 / IMBEL .308 type of semi-auto.
I like the old French MAS style guns and if someone has one they don't want to keep long-term I might be interested in one of those also. 
I want a long-barreled (pref. hex receiver) Mosin rifle as well but it must have a nice bore.

Possibly a 12ga shotgun... I'd just have to see it to know if I like it."

Very good condition with box and instruction manual.
And 107 rounds of  ammo.
(The ammo alone would cost you about $50 at the store after tax.)
I'm basically selling the pistol for $110, and the ammo for $40 if you buy the gun.
I also have several holster options available for sell if you get the pistol.
  I don't have any pics, but there is one just like it listed on this site with a pic for sale in Birmingham, Al. , except my box is in excellent condition.
  This gun is for a responsible adult seeking a small self defense tool used in a legal manor. I reserve the right to refuse the sale to anyone who appears to be the opposite."

Went and checked out a Beretta 92 with a posting of NEW-Unfired, ran the serial and its from 1991 and has blowback and brass flakes to prove it... Guy said he bought it second hand but ""assured"" me it wasnt fired, until I broke it down and pulled crud and flakes out of it.

Just look at your ""father's"" revolver and you will notice, if he was smart enough and lucky enough to have purchased the original Presentation grips as my father was, that they look just as great today as when they were first purchased back in the early 60's. Furthermore, they will continue to look great for years to come, and with their steel insert, they are both very comfortable, and practically indestructible.)

I am relisting due to someone backing out of a trade. A Galil such as this only comes around every once in awhile. Most Galils you see are cheap Century Arms guns or expensive pre bans. Ohio Rapid Fire made a few high quality Galil builds and this is one of them. In 2009, however, the owner of ORF died and the company went out of business. This is a gun for someone who wants a quality Galil but doesn't want to pay thousands for a pre ban. My cash price is $1200. That is the price they started out at and less than what I paid for it. That is no post scare price either. I have seen the same rifle sale for much more than that. Some links are below.

Long Rifle,"Coachella Valley, East Riverside County, Inland Empire, California",$ 299,"Listed On: Saturday, February 28, 2015",Handguns,Ruger                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Update (see new photos): I just finished completely rebuilding this Ruger MK II .22 caliber handgun once again, including a new trigger assembly, a new casing extractor, extractor plunger, and plunger spring, along with a new mainspring, firing pin, and firing pin recoil spring. The entire unit has been rebuilt, recalibrated, and retested, including sighting it in. It is now more accurate and smoother in its action and working than ever, along with essentially no recoil whatsoever.

It now works so well that it is better than almost any entries, new or old, in the same class, that I have seen or tried myself. It is extremely well balanced when empty, but even better when it has a magazine loaded. I have tried many of the newer offers in the same class at local, and/or out-of-state ranges, but I must say that I prefer this weapon over all of the others. Once you have seen the accuracy for yourself, you will agree. Even when firing this weapon cold, it was easier to handle, felt better balanced, and was far more accurate--which is what you would want in an emergency situation, as with an intruder--than any other model that I have recently fired. If I did not need the money, I would never sell this weapon. However, I do need the money, and so here it is.

Anyhow, more about the update on this weapon. There are other new or reconditioned parts that I installed or rebuilt (or re-milled) on this model, but suffice it to say that essentially this is a brand new weapon as far as the insides go, how well it works, and for how long it will last with all of the new heat-forged parts installed, instead of the stamped parts that the manufacturer puts in at the factory, or that were subsequently installed during the life of this model by the revious owner. It is an absolutely beautiful range weapon, with target groupings that are better than some long rifles that I have used. If you know how to shoot with a handgun, then the accuracy is unquestionsble, as you will be able to see for yourself once you get it to a range.

Speaking of which, not only is it accurate as hell, but it does an enormous amount of damage for a small caliber weapon with the included CCI Mini Mag hollow-point 36 Gr. rounds. These rounds, with their high velocity and hollow points, actually do more damage than many larger rounds in higher caliber weapons that I have used. Additionally, the ammunition is inexpensive. Because of all of the rebuilding, as well as all of the new parts, I am now asking $325 for this model. It is worth every penny in my opinion.
 **END UPDATE**

This handgun is, as noted on the barrel, a Sturm, Ruger, & Co., Inc., Southport, Conn. U.S.A., Ruger MK II .22 Cal. Long Rifle semi-automatic pistol. This handgun comes with three factory-made, 10-round, Ruger magazines, with the Ruger emblem located on the base of each, to match the Ruger emblem located on the original, factory grips. The serial number is: 212-58XXX, meaning that this pistol was manufactured in 1986 (see below). I also have the original owner's manual in PDF form for emailing to a prospective buyer, or to the person who actually purchases this handgun.

When I first purchased this pistol off of the previous owner, I completely overhauled it. The parts now all fit nice and tight, and the barrel and action were completely disassembled, cleaned, reconditioned, and put back together with loving care. This pistol has the best groupings on the range of any of my other handguns, so it indeed has retained (and regained, as I felt when testing the fully restored weapon) its accuracy. It has had around 200 rounds put down the barrel since I finished the restoration, so it is in great shape still. The bluing is a little worn in a few spots, mostly due to the Rip-Stop Nylon holster in which it was stored. The holster was a bit abrasive right over the serial number/breech area of this pistol, but otherwise, the bluing is intact and looks decent. There are a few minor scratches from wear and tear, including a small one where the automatic breech lock safety rubbed a bit against the frame. I have since straightened out the safety, so the scratch will not worsen.

So overall, this is a very nice handgun to add to one's collection, or a great target or range pistol if accuracy is important to you. It shoots straight, it shoots great, and it is shiny and clean, and the parts are tight in all the right places. All in all, this is a very nice handgun, including the three, 10-round magazines, and a 100-round box of new, hollow point, CCI Mini Mags. The box in the pictures looks a bit worn, but that is from being stored in my range bag. 

However, I treat my ammunition as I do my weapons: that is, I clean and polish every round by hand. So rest assured that the ammunition inside of the box is in top notch condition. The cleaner the ammunition, the cleaner your weapon will stay, and the less wear and tear will be accrued over the lifetime of said weapon: the less gunk and oxidization that come into contact with the weapon's parts via dirty rounds or even slightly oxidized casings, the less overall wear and tear and the fewer chemical reactions there are to degrade the weapon. That is my philosophy, and it has proved true over the years. My weapons are cleaner, and last longer, than many other models of the same age and with the same usage.

I, on the other hand, have just got into target shooting and did not know the difference.

My point is:
Walmart wont take returns on Ammo, so I'm stuck with this. I also don't know anyone to go and shoot this. Here I have 200 rounds of 12 Gauge Fed Ammo and I would like to sell or trade for 9mm  ammo.

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

I am looking to trade for a Glock 17 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me.

The quality of pictures are severely reduced when uploaded to armslist so it can make some textures look strange (like on the extended mags.) If you'd like the full size pictures, I can email them to you."

A successor to the top-selling Ruger Mark II, the Mark III is a .22 semi auto pistol that's excellent for sport shooting and hunting due to its proven design and reliability. Also, its rugged frame and tapered bolt ears allow for easy handling in almost any environment and exceptional accuracy.

This pistol is the target edition of Ruger's Mark III, it has the blued finish, all metal frame (not the cheap new polymer frame), scope mounting rail/frame, checkered metal grips, a loaded-chamber indicator, and many more features. Some specs include a 5.5 inch barrel, bull barrel, adjustable rear sights, etc (if interested in more details, specs sheets are readily available online). This gun in particular is used but in excellent condition. If I were to rate it from 1-10 in terms of condition (10 being brand new) this gun would easily rate at 9!(and only because its not brand new!) Does not have a scratch on it! It has seen less than 50 rounds. I'm only selling it because I don't give it the use it deserves. The gun includes two 10 round magazines, a plastic case, user manual, and a custom made wooden grip for the dedicated target shooter. The suggested retail price for this gun, brand new, is up-most of $460! Here you have the opportunity to own a legendary pistol, of excellent quality, in excellent condition, at an excellent price!"
