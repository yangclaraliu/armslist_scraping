The Arsenal SAM7UF utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, the underfolding stock locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it.

SAM7UF model 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14x1mm muzzle left hand threads, muzzle nut, bayonet and accessory lugs, reinforced underfolding buttstock, black polymer pistol grip and handguards, stainless steel head shield, ambidextrous safety lever, sectional cleaning rod, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver

Each SAM7UF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequaled strength, precision and durability

Features of the Arsenal SAM7UF-85: 100% new-production parts and components Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber Removable muzzle brake with 14x1mm left hand threads. Cleaning rod, sling, bayonet lug, one 10-round magazine, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. Reinforced Underfolder buttstock 922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines. Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies. 1-year limited manufacturer's warranty

Now for the history lesson:

 Like many other armed forces, the U.S. Army searched for a new rifle in the early 1890s to replace their old Springfield Model 1873 ""trapdoor"" single-shot rifles. A competition was held in 1892, comparing rifle designs from Lee, Krag-Jørgensen, Mannlicher, Mauser, Schmidt-Rubin, and about 40 other military and civilian designs. The trials were held at Governors Island, New York. Despite protests from domestic inventors and arms manufacturers — two designers, Russell and Livermore, even sued the U.S. government over the choice — the Krag-Jørgensen design was chosen by the board of officers. Approximately 500,000 'Krags' were produced at the Springfield Armory in Massachusetts from 1894 to 1904. It was the U.S. Army's primary rifle from 1894 to 1903 (when it was replaced by the M1903 Springfield rifle with its ballistically similar .30-03 cartridge), and found use in the Spanish-American War and the Philippine-American War. 

 According to contemporary, perhaps sensationalized accounts, the Krag's complex design was outclassed by the Spanish Mauser during the Spanish American War, and proved ill-suited for use in tropical locales such as Cuba and the Philippines. American soldiers found themselves unable to match the volume of fire displayed by the Spanish 1893 Mauser rifle, with its box magazine that could be fully reloaded with clips, and a high-velocity, flat-shooting 7mm cartridge which was quickly dubbed the 'Spanish Hornet'. During the American assault on the strategic Cuban city of Santiago, a small force of 750 Spanish troops armed with Model 1893 Mauser rifles defended positions on San Juan and Kettle hills. The attacking force consisted of approximately 6,600 American soldiers, most of them regulars, armed with the then-new smokeless-powder Krag-Jorgensen rifle and supported by artillery and Gatling gun fire. Though the assault was successful, the Americans soon realized that they had suffered more than 1,400 casualties in the assault. With the Krag's replacement with the Mauser-derived M1903, the rifle is tied for the shortest service life of any standard-issue firearm in US military history (1892–1903). The Krag was completely phased out of service in the Regular Army by 1907, as M1903 Springfields became available, however, the Krag was issued for many more years with the National Guard and the Army Reserve, including service in World War I with rear-echelon U.S. troops in France.

 This is the rifle that soldiers under the leadership of former President Theodore Roosevelt and General Leonard Wood would have used in the Spanish-American wars. Unfortunately, the side loading design was not suited to the jungle conditions of San Juan and Santiago.

 The rifle I am selling is very good ++++ condition for a rifle that is 111 years old. I believe the pictures speak for themselves. I do not believe that this rifle is ALL original - I believe that the hand guard and bolt are not original to the gun.

If you're interested, I believe I have 20 - 40 rounds of factory ammo for the buyer.

As I have a C&R License I will need to obtain some information."

It's the RB22 model with a steel bisley grip, fluted cylinder, and drift adjustable rear sight.  Only 2,000 to 3,000 of these were ever produced.  It's a great shooter.  The target is a 10-shot group at 25 yards with cheap bulk ammo.  Shoots just as well with every kind of bulk ammo I've shot in it.  The ejector spring housing is the factory aluminum part and it has been polished to give it a two-tone look.  It looked really good when I had a SS grip frame on it form my 44 super blackhawk.  You can switch this bisley grip frame with a regular grip frame from any other blackhawk or super blackhawk.  I used the bislay grip frame on the 44 for a while and it really tamed the recoil on the 44.  If you switch grip frames, I include a regular ruger single six hammer to complete the conversion on this gun.  Comes with 300 rounds of quality .22 LR ammo and a leather holster.

QUICK OVERVIEW
The Springfield Armory® operator pistol was the first pistol offered by a major 1911 manufacturer having a light-mounting rail forged directly into the frame. While others have followed Springfield Armory's lead, they still offer the most comprehensive line of 1911 light-rail guns available.
The Standard Picatinny mounting platform readily accepts the most popular whitelight and laser illumination devices used by military spec-ops and law enforcement tactical teams. These fully-capable extreme-duty firearms are truly the best of the best.

This upper is slightly used.  Less than 500 rounds through it.  I ended up putting a 14.5"" upper on it and no longer want/need the 24"".  Price is negotiable, within reason.  Same upper MSRP new is $833.00 plus tax.  Upper also comes with a bipod and muzzle break attached.
Info from Bushmaster website:

""This Assembly - from our very accurate Varminter - features a 24"" Fluted Extra Heavy Barrel in 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber with 11 degree competition crown; heavyweight 1"" diameter under the handguard; custom match hybrid chamber with a tighter SAAMI Spec headspace from the shoulder of the chamber to the bolt face, and longer chamber throat or ""Leade"". This accommodates 5.56mm ammunition without developing higher pressures encountered when firing 5.56mm ammo in a .223 chamber with shorter ""Leade"" (both calibers can be used safely). Rifling is 1 in 9"" twist for optimum performance with most lighter bullet weight varmint cartridges, and the barrel is fluted to increase cooling and reduce weight. The Varminter Upper's shell ejection path has been modified to drop all your brass in the same place as a convenience for the reloader. A vented forend with bipod/sling stud installed, free-floats the barrel from the barrel nut forward and B.M.A.S. Mini-Risers add 1/2"" to scope height for correct sight picture and comfortable cheek weld. This Upper is sold complete with Bolt, Bolt Carrier and Charging Handle to ensure positive lockup between bolt and barrel extension."""

So I've got this black bear frequenting my property late at night right now. 
It's been demolishing my dumpsters where we keep the trash, as well as getting intimately familiar with the doors and windows of my house, not to mention leaving a significant dent in the hood of my car when smelling the lingering odors of my lunch from the day before.

Although I'm not too nervous of having a violent encounter with a black bear, as they tend to be big giant cowardly babies, I do now realize that should this bear come back a 4th time, and choose to enter the house in search of more food, I do not possess a caliber gun that I would feel confident using in a defensive black bear situation. So I ask you, do you have a 12 guage shotgun for me to purchase? Pumps seem more reliable, but if you have a semi, we could talk about that as well.

While I have no intention on killing the bear if I see it again, the fact remains that it could still choose to enter my home when my family is sleeping -- and that is a very real possibility if our home has been marked within his mental map as a ""Food Source"" -- I would just feel better knowing were protected. Please let me know if you can help, and the sooner the better. Thank you all for reading! I'm looking for the following: Mossberg 500 and up, Remington 870 and up, Benelli Supernova and up. I have trades available for a KSG or Saiga 12. (Glock 30, S&W M69 44 Mag)"

I've been carrying it for awhile but its in good shape with no issues. Exceptionally light and easy to carry, which is very nice with summer in full force, you can slip it into your pocket and forget about it. +P rated, tight lockup and good timing, and has a shrouded hammer that keeps it snag free but still allows you to cock it for single action fire. Its had a trigger job to lighten the trigger up a bit and aftermarket scalloped grips for easier use of speedloaders. Comes with its case, keys, and paperwork and I'll include 15 rounds of .38 special along with 2 HKS 36 speedloaders. 

I'm picked up a different revolver so I'd like to trade this for a subcompact or pocket sized handgun in 9mm or .40. Primarily interested in a Ruger SR40c or sr9c, newer model Beretta Nano, Glock 26 or 27 or similar. No Tauruses or calibers aside from 9mm or .40 please. 

Prefer to trade, but I'll sell it for $380 if wanting to buy.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with offers or questions, texts preferred.

Features a X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger and all Type 416 stainless steel barreled action with Black TriNyte® PVD coating, providing a diamond-hard layer of defense against the elements. It comes with the new stock design. Inside, it's a true performance-enhancer, with a dual-pillar bedding platform that free-floats the barrel for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. The black synthetic stock contains a high nylon fiber content which gives the stock superior strength and rigidity in the harshest of conditions. Also helping is a full-length aluminum bedding block, tactical beaver-tail fore-end and a recessed thumb-hook feature for optimum off the bench shooting performance. Nice 40-X externally adjustable trigger. The barrel features wide tactical-style barrel fluting for rapid cooling. Caliber: .223/NATO 5.56 Remington. Barrel Length: 26 "" Heavy Fluted. Capacity: 5 + 1. Trigger: Single Stage. Safety: Trigger guard safety. Length: 45 3/4"". Weight: 8.5 lbs. Stock:  Finish: Black Steel. Twist: 1:9"". It also comes with Harris Bi-pod and Remington Shooters Edge 4-4x12 fix mounted scope plus hard-shell molded plastic Gun Guard protective case. I have included a few boxes of AR and Federal .223 rounds.

Don’t be fooled, the .223 is a laser of a round. The round won't drop. You will never need a big heavy expensive round when you can literally shoot the eyes out of every target.  And or just target shoot all day at distance without breaking the bank. . . . Not only utilized by the US military, but this is commonly the weapon of choice with law enforcement agencies using a .223 on swat teams and hostage situations all over the world. . Most wouldn't use a 308. . . . . . 

This TLR is in excellent condition with low round count. Trigger has just been polished and striker pin rounded.

Have boxes and everything for the rifle and the scope including Ruger stainless rings. This gun has been fired right around 140 times if memory serves correct. 1/8 twist chrome-lined barrel. The gun as stated in the instructions and on the gun only shoots .223 ammo. I've read about people using NATO, but Ruger doesn't recommend it. This is a very nice gun and gets compliments from everyone who has seen it.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

Introducing the SIG556xi, rewriting the standard for modularity, reliability, and performance for the modern rifle platform. 

Based on the legendary SG 550, the SIG556xi will change the way military, law enforcement, and responsible citizens look at adaptable rifles. Utilizing the time-tested rotating bolt and adjustable gas piston operating system, the SIG556xi allows operators a choice of caliber, barrel length, handguard/stock configurations and lower receivers. 

A removable barrel allows the operator to select the necessary length for a given mission. Adding the appropriate bolt, the SIG556xi can be changed to any of three calibers, 5.56x45mm NATO, 300 Blackout, and 7.62x39mm NATO. Users can also quickly change out the non-serialized lower receiver, allowing the use of either AR-style STANAG magazines or rock-and-lock AK-style magazines. The SIG556xi upper receiver is the serialized part, making the lower an easy to purchase part. 

Polymer handguards accept all Magpul® light and rail kits, while the aluminum and carbon fiber handguards accept 2”, 4”, and 6” M1913 rails. Barrels are available in 10”, 14.5”, and 16”. Truly ambidextrous, the SIG556xi features an ambi safety selector, magazine release and user swappable charging handle (right- or left-handed). Optional receiver end plates allow for the use of either AR receiver extension tubes and buttstocks or M1913 compatible stocks"

I operate NOCO Hydrographics here in Fort Collins. If you're looking to get a firearm hydrodipped, I offer both the best prices as well as the best quality materials. I know how important quality is when it comes to any firearm work, and that's why I strive to be the best in the business. When you bring me one of your firearms, you can rest assured that the job will be done right, and come out looking great. After the pattern is applied, the part is coated with a high-strength clear coat with an internal flex agent. This means that the clear will flex without cracking when the gun is fired, and will last through many years of use.

Go to our website at: www.nocohydrographics.jimdo.com to see our pricing list as well as a complete gallery of patterns.

I have over 700 patterns available in categories such as:
Camouflage
Carbon Fiber
Wood Grain

and Designer


Special pricing is available for FFL shops

If you're interested in having something done, give me a call or email me at the contact info below. I can apply a hydrographic pattern to any wood, metal, or plastic surface, so if you're interested in having a non-firearm piece done, I can give you a quote.

At the same time he decided he also wanted 28 and 410 ga bbls to go with the set so he had original Perazzi barrels custom fit to this reciever and the barrels are re-serial numbered to this gun thus the extra set of stamped serial numbers on the barrels.The 410 barrels are choked Skeet and IC and the 28 ga bbls were Briley choked to add hunting versitility to the 28ga,five tubes come with the 28ga bbls AND THE 28ga BARRELS ARE MID-VENT STYLE.The 12 and 20 ga bbls are choked IC and Imp.Mod I believe, the Perazzi choke code is 4 circles on bottom barrels and 2 circles on top barrels.The condition of all the barrels is excellent,i would rate the barrels at 99% and all lock up to the reciever very tight. My friend who was the original owner hunted with the gun very little and he is not a skeet shooter so the gun has been shot very seldom,and has spent most of the time in hs gun room.I would rate this gun overall at 98%on the wood and 99% on the barrels.The stock and forearms on this gun are outstanding wood and match very well,the stock and forearms do have a few scratches but nothing major no cracks or splits anywhere and nothing that really detracts from the overall look of the gun.The stock also has a very nicely fit old english pad."

At the same time he decided he also wanted 28 and 410 ga bbls to go with the set so he had original Perazzi barrels custom fit to this reciever and the barrels are re-serial numbered to this gun thus the extra set of stamped serial numbers on the barrels.The 410 barrels are choked Skeet and IC and the 28 ga bbls were Briley choked to add hunting versitility to the 28ga,five tubes come with the 28ga bbls AND THE 28ga BARRELS ARE MID-VENT STYLE.The 12 and 20 ga bbls are choked IC and Imp.Mod I believe, the Perazzi choke code is 4 circles on bottom barrels and 2 circles on top barrels.The condition of all the barrels is excellent,i would rate the barrels at 99% and all lock up to the reciever very tight. My friend who was the original owner hunted with the gun very little and he is not a skeet shooter so the gun has been shot very seldom,and has spent most of the time in hs gun room.I would rate this gun overall at 98%on the wood and 99% on the barrels.The stock and forearms on this gun are outstanding wood and match very well,the stock and forearms do have a few scratches but nothing major no cracks or splits anywhere and nothing that really detracts from the overall look of the gun.The stock also has a very nicely fit old english pad."
