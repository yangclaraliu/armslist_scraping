If you reload .223 or .300 blackout every time you want to reload don't go through the trouble of doing all that tedious case prep before you can load your shells. Now all you have to do is trade it in with a few bucks for new brass ready to go. Brass for trade in cannot be badly damaged. 
Here's the list of services we offer:
- Case Trimming - specify the length you would like your cases trimmed to and we will trim them to the specified length, also includes chamfering and deburring price is 3 cents per shell

- Resizing and Depriming - We will run the shells through a sizing die and then punch the primer out for you too. price is 2 cents per shell

- Case Polishing - We will tumble the brass through an abrasive nut shell media first and then switch to corncob media with polisher in it to make your shells have a shiny yellow polish to them. Free if you have the other two options done as well. otherwise 2 cents per shell

Will trade for an AR of similar value - prefer if it has sights on it and adjustable stock. FINAL PRICE DROP!! Cash price is $675, trade value $750."

Sure, you can get one for maybe $20 cheaper after shipping and FFL fees, but you also won't be getting one that was hand-picked for it's condition compared to others.

Utilizing our proven long stroke piston system, the MK1 series greatly reduces fouling in the action of the weapon making it as reliable as the AK47 that it was designed after. 

The MK1 series has been used in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has gained wide popularity with security personnel, law enforcement and civilians alike. 

The origins of the MK1 series began with the fascination in the simplicity and reliability of the AK47 combined with a deep-rooted appreciation for the ergonomics of the M4/M16 platform. Having a significant understanding of the deficiencies in the direct gas impingement operating system found on conventional M4/M16-style weapons, PWS developed the MK1 series with the professional in mind. 

Significant improvements have been made over both the direct gas impingement operating system and previous offerings of piston-driven operating systems. The product improvements made by PWS have addressed reliability and performance issues as well as reduced carrier tilt, cam pin wear and carrier bounce. In addition, we have one of the lightest systems on the market today! 

An innovative hand guard system utilizes a proprietary non-free float system that allows the end user or unit armorer to replace individual rails as needed without removing the barrel, barrel nut or even other rails. This system allows the user to attach numerous Picatinny rail-mounted devices such as sights, lights, and laser aiming devices. 

The PWS proprietary operating system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating head piston that is attached to the operating rod. The MK1 series is built to be a true combat carbine. With no unnecessary gas adjustments and only one moving assembly, this is the most rugged, simple and versatile piston operating system available. 


The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2” sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER™ charging handle, and the PWS enhanced buffer tuber."

Purchased in 2009 from Smyrna Police Supply and has been my personal daily carry gun since that time.  I now have a Gen 4 and that is why I am looking to sell this.  

There is normal finish wear on the exterior of the barrel, but otherwise the firearms is pretty much as new condition. I would estimate that less than 1000 rounds have been fired.  I don't keep meticulous records on round count, but this weapon has many, many useable years left in it's life. There is no case for the gun.  What you get is the gun, the magazines and the paperwork that comes from Glock.

The price is firm on this weapon.  The value is there considering the condition of the gun and the addition of the night sights.

Terms of sale are as follows: Cash is King.  Gold is a Prince.  I'm not looking to trade, but I'm not hardheaded enough to say no without hearing your offer. Understand my goal is not to trade so it would have to be a pretty good trade.

You must provide proof that you are eligible to possess a firearm in Georgia.  That means I will need a copy of your CCW and Drivers License if we make the sale.  I will give you copies of mine as well so you know with whom you are dealing. I will keep this in my possession and will NEVER share it with any other person or government entity unless a crime is being investigated where the firearm is proven to be part of a legitimate investigation. I am not about arming those in my community for which it is illegal for them to own a gun, so please don't ask."

Lower Recoil .44 Magnum Ammo - 255 gr. Keith - G.C. (1,350 fps/M.E. 1,032 ft.lbs.) - 20 Round Box



There have been several requests for a full power 44 mag. Load that recoils substantially less than our other Heavy 44 mag. Loads, but will still penetrate deeply and be deadly on game animals.

When S&W introduced their model 329PD, we noticed that some of those scandium revolvers would experience sticky extraction with our Heavy loads and the recoil in the light weight scandium 329PD guns was horrendous, to say the least. This recoil would some times cause bullets to ""jump crimp"" thus tying up the revolver. 

In order to alleviate the recoil, crimp jump and sticky extraction, we have developed this load. It is still full power, but uses a lighter weight, super hard cast, gas checked bullet and will still penetrate very deeply in big game despite its lighter weight. This load is ideal for those of you who carry the S&W model 329PD. This load will not lead your barrel.

This load falls well under SAAMI pressure specs and is safe to use IN ANY 44mag. While we love to hear from our customers, please do not phone/email us and ask if this load is safe in your particular 44 mag. - it is - providing your gun is in normal working condition.

Now there exists a serious full power 44 mag. load that will penetrate big bones (including a bears skull) and drive deeply into living organs and tissues, that has minimum recoil.

See the below ballistics fired out of my personal revolvers.

S&W 329PD (4 inch)---1264 fps

Ruger Red Hawk (5.5 inch)---1357 fps"

686,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3790686,"For Sale:  16"" CMMG 300 Blackout Barrel for Sale","SE Valley, Phoenix, Arizona",$ 100,"Listed On: Sunday, December 14, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The barrel was manufactured by CMMG and has 14 rounds through it.  It is 16” in an M300 profile and WASP treated chrome-moly steel (see below).  It has a 1:7” twist and is threaded for a 5/8-24 muzzle device. The bird cage pictured is included.  It takes a 0.75” diameter gas block which is at the carbine position.

One unique thing about this barrel is it is machined to accept a 0.936” gas block at the pistol position.  This provides some flexibility in the set-up of the rifle. The gas port at the carbine position could be blocked and a new port drilled at the pistol position.  This opens up a whole lot of options for running both subsonic and supersonic rounds suppressed or unsuppressed.

CMMG’s “W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel (Weapon Armament Surface Protection) treatment is a salt bath ferritic notrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding.  The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out.  Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating.  Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up.  CMMG pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.”

The barrel retails for around $180.  Asking $100 or make a reasonable offer."

This is a nice JC Higgins 51-L .30-06 action by Husqvarna. Looks great for a gun built in the 1960's.  Comes with the scope base.  It is not in perfect showroom quality but shows some character. The most notable is a place on the stock that looks like it rubbed on someone's hip.  Some bluing missing at muzzle.  Might be a great gift for someone who always wanted a gun like their dad's or grand dad's. I am not the original owner and have no idea how many shots have been fired through it.

This sale is for the SIRT Pro Training Pistol which retails for $439.  This is the model with the metal slide and red/green laser combo.  This is a phenomenal training tool which mimics the Glock 17.  It's weight and size is identical so its very practical for dry fire training.  Since this is the pro model with red and green lasers it can be used inside or out.  Its green laser is extremely powerful and can easily be seen in the mid day sun.  I once did 25 yard bill drills with this on a standard brown USPSA target and easily saw my shot placement at 1PM in the day.  Unfortunately for me I have not had much time to train or dry fire so this bad boy has been sitting in my range bag for months without usage.  I would like it to go to someone that will put it through its paces and get the most out of it.  It's in great condition.  It was handled with care and never abused.  I was its only operator and if wasn't in my hand or on my hip it was in my range bag.

Note- This sale is for the Training Pistol ( batteries included ) with a weighted dummy magazine.  The manual and training videos can all be viewed for FREE on the companies website.

Buy with confidence.  I have a 100% rating.  I process my shipping fast and secure!



Safe, effective, and innovative, the Shot Indicating Resetting Trigger (SIRT) Training Pistol was developed by shooters for shooters, to complement, not replace, live fire training.

The SIRT Training Pistol brings together a host of patent pending technologies critical to improving shooting accuracy while addressing issues of cost and liability.

Fully Functional Rail: Mount your tac light or other devices directly onto our SIRT Training Pistol rail,just as you would on your live fire pistol.

Ergonomic Frame: Built to the highest standards of strength and durability, the SIRT frame has all the functional grip features of the Glock 17/22, and when fully assembled is designed to match the weight of your live fire pistol.

Adjustable Resetting Trigger: TheSIRT’s Adjustable Auto-resetting Trigger allows for multiple strings of fire during training without racking the slide, encouraging more repetitions per training session.

Weighted Training Magazine: The mags have a rubberized base plate for durability in training.

Dual Indicator Lasers: A red Trigger Prep Indicating laser gives you immediate feedback on your trigger mechanics while you prep your trigger. A green Shot Indicating laser gives you shot indication feedback on your follow-through.

Laser Take-Up Toggle Switch: The Laser Take-Up Toggle Switch allows you to shut off the Take-Up Indicating Laser, and just train with the Shot Indicating Laser. The Red and Green (Pro Model) Lasers may also be reversed with an internal switch."

It comes with two sets of barrels. They are NOT matching serial numbers, but do mate up to the gun perfectly. The barrels that came with the gun are choked full and modified. The second barrel set is modified and improved cylinder.
The frame has been blued nicely and the swamp scenes are visible. The stocks have a nice finish and the butt plate is correct for the model. 
The barrels retain a lot of bluing, have a few very small nicks and freckling (no dents). The bores are shiny and clean. The gun shoots.
There is a small chip out of the left front of the butt stock. This will not affect the shootability.
Overall this would make a great piece to take out and have fun with, to say nothing about impressing your friends.
