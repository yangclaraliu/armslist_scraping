Here's my problem.. I get bored easily and my firearm collection is constantly changing! I'm not sure what the perfect collection would be, or if there even is one. Ha. I love subcompacts and compacts, but have a few full-sized that I love. It's time to trade this for something else!

This is a Savage Cub Single Shot .22lr Youth Rifle with very nice real wood and a 16"" barrel.  Note that this is not the smaller, more cheaply made Savage Rascal, but the now-discontinued Cub, which was based on their full-sized rimfire line.  The iron sights have been removed.  No iron sights.  I'm sure you can order them from Numrich or somewhere though if you want them.  This rifle shoots great.  It is NOT an accu-trigger model.

On top are Weaver brand rings (steel tops; alum bases), holding a like-new-with original box & papers Hawke MAP 3x32 Crossbow Scope with BDC.  This scope is currently $90 plus tax at www.swfa.com .  It's a nice, KISS-principle scope.  It is currently sighted in.

Note that this rig as currently set up works fine for me as an adult (5' 8"").  The scope is far enough forward that it's very usable.  I've killed several grackles and a squirrel with Aguila Super Colibris in the short time I've had it.  But kids can use it too of course.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVZPWLMCVCA

http://swfa.com/Hawke-3x32-XB-Crossbow-Scope-P41174.aspx

Price WITH scope and rings is $210.
Price withOUT scope (but I will throw in some all-steel Millett rimfire rings) is $128.

Those are FTF prices - Add $20 for shipping to your FFL.

It's mainly been in my safe since I bought it, and I just don't use it enough to have it sitting in there.
It's in amazing condition, because it's practically new.  Having said that, there ARE small blemishes from being in the safe and from the range.  They're barely noticeable.  You have to look for 'em.
Comes with on 5 round magazine and one 20 round magazine, a Burris 3.5X - 10X Fullfield II scope, and a bipod.
I have the hard carry case for it, but didn't use it because it doesn't fit in it with the scope attached.  Didn't want to have to detach and reattach it every time.
I also have 325 rounds worth of .308 ammo, and if you buy the rifle I'll give you a good deal on the ammo: $150.  If you check around you'll see that's a damn good price for .308. 
I'm not selling the ammo unless I sell the rifle, though.
So here's the thing.  I want to sell this to buy a motorcycle.  I'm NOT looking for trades, and the price is firm.  With that scope (about a $300 scope) $1200 is more than fair. 
If I don't sell it at that price, it goes back in the safe. 
I'd rather wait on the motorcycle than take any more of a hit on this beautiful rifle.

I can send if your truly interested. Price is $1250.00 for gun and ammo and 25 clips,(ammo along would sale for around$400.00)  or gun only for $1050.00 email me or call REDACTED up til midnight or later. 
I may interested in trading for a AR-10 ARMALITE, one of the target models with 1:10 or better 1:11.25 twist (most any AR10 I'll take a look at) or Remington R 25, or AR 15 ,and certain Mini 14. I will add cash to some trades or ask for cash on others. I check with Buds gun shop on the price of new guns,so I can get the feel of what a used gun would sale for so keep the offers reasonable. I still consider trade value on the Garand, 500rds ammo, 25 clips around $1500.
     Thanks, Don"

ESS High Adrenaline Crossbow Suppressor 2x Kit Sunglasses (Clear & Hi-Def Copper)
Crossbow™ — The Eyeshield Re-invented™
The ESS Crossbow Suppressor is the first spectacle frame designed for use with ear cup hearing protection and communications devices. Featuring Z-Bend Geometry, the frame's ultra-thin temple arms help keep noise out by minimizing the effect on the padded seal of ear cups. The slim temples eliminate the hot spots and pressure points that commonly occur when normal eyewear is worn under ear cups. 

The Suppressor frame is compatible with all Crossbow lenses. These 2.4mm Polycarbonate lenses feature distortion-free ESSOPTICS and ClearZone FlowCoat technology to combat fogging on the inside and scratches on the outside. The frame's DedBolt Lens Lock provides quick lens interchange and rock-solid retention under impact. 

Crossbow Suppressor 2X Kits include two fully-assembled eyeshields: one with ultra-thin Crossbow Suppressor frames (for use with ear cups) and one with standard Crossbow Tri-Tech Fit frames (for normal use without ear cups). Both frame options provide a universal fit.

XPS2-RF Brand New never used in original packaging. $320.00

Expanding on an already great product line, EOTech has created a holographic sight specifically for the rimfire rifle. Ideal for small game hunting, high speed target shooting and family or youth plinking, this HWS makes rimfire shooting even more fun. The XPS2-RF is lighter and more streamlined than the traditional HWS and the integrated base mounts to the standard 3/8"" dovetail rails on the market...$320.00


MAGPUL Enhanced Trigger Guard $20.00

The Enhanced Trigger Guard is a black anodized aluminum drop in replacement for the AR15/M16 weapons platform. It features a shallow ""V"" shape for better use of gloves in tactical shooting or cold weather operations. The Enhanced Trigger Guard is non-folding, has rounded edges, and fills the annoying ""gap"" at the rear of the standard trigger guard. All mounting hardware included. $20.00


MAKO Vertical Grip Magazine Holder $29.00

Enables carry of spare magazine, ready to use, on the weapon, while serving as ergonomic foregrip. Quick release with backup locking screw. Button similar to the AR-15/M16 magazine release quickly releases spare magazine. Works as foregrip with or without magazine inserted. As a fore-grip it is solid and reliable. It is more comfortable to use than a standard one because you aren't using energy maintaining a full fist grip, yet still affords all of the maneuverability. 

As a quick change magazine holder it is good, but has one major problem. The magazine release button is inconveniently placed at the TOP left side (notice the left side is not shown in the promotional material). This prevents you from realistically using anything larger than a 20 round magazine. Others will fit just fine, but you won't be able to operate the release while maintaining control of the magazine. 

The magazines are held in place very solidly. I felt as if the one in the mag well were less secure than the one on the grip by comparison. 

With a little practice I have found that I can make the switch even faster than the demo video. Repositioning your hand to hit the high magazine release button is the ONLY reason this isn't quicker. $29.00

Will be around the Phoenix International Airport area Saturday (10 May) at noon if anyone is interested. Serious offers only, NO TRADES!"

Firearm is in excellent shape and appears to have been shot very little. (I personally have only ran 2 boxes through it in my life). It's magazine is dated to 1985, judging by the serial number I would say that is the year of the pistols manufacture. Included with the pistol is a specially made Mikes Sidekick Holster with the Magnum Research trademark. It is a really nice shoulder holster for this gun.

Would be interested in some trades. I like military surplus and have a special knack for Com Bloc things that are unique, (no your Wasr covered in Crapco aftermarket parts will not interest me sorry but I like things in their original state). Would trade for 2 Wasr-10's, they are $499 from Center Fire right now. . . .

Would also be interested in a small car trailer large enough to haul my GPW around on.

It's Used, not new. I don't have the box. It's just the pistol, one mag, & the holster. 

I'm not from here only visiting from OK. So, only available tonight plus Sat & Sun morning. 
I won't travel far and am staying in Gardner so you would need to meet locally. 

I take cash. I like cash. I also take gold, it's pretty, but only in bar form, I'm not into the used jewelry exchange. I suppose silver would work too. If you have some and the deal is good enough over cash I would do it. 
Other than that - as a last resort- I can take credit cards, but I hate them, so I would up the price by 5% to actually run one. 

Other listings will show pic of my two other weapons.

I am open minded on trades, but don't offer car electronics, home electronics, or really anything electronic unless it's badass, which I doubt is even possible. 
If I trade it would most likely be for guns, ammo, or reloading supplies. Ask and I will let ya know, include what you think it's worth too, I will be using the Blue Book of Gun Values to determine average prices before looking over and deciding if a trade is worth it for me.

The butt stock is adjustable for length of pull and all spacers are included. Sling swivel is adjustable to the shooter. Sights are at 1/5 MOA per click. Trigger is factory set for 3.5 lbs but is fully adjustable. Incredibly precise click adjust rear and front iron sights are mounted on 18mm rails; I dropped a scope on it (not included).  Includes target sights with 8 drop-in reticles, original certificate of authenticity from CMP, manual, box.

US Gov't ordered 20,000 of these precision target rifles for training back in the 80s. Many sat in a warehouse for 25+ years before they were sold through the Civilian Marksmanship Program, where I bought mine 18 months ago. 

The pictures in ad are not mine, I grabbed them from the internet, but they show both the included target iron sights and what it would look like if you scope it.

The finish and stock are in excellent condition, it looks brand new. I took it out of the original box, gave it a complete disassembly, cleaned it thoroughly and fired it at the Redmond Gun Club range where it was much admired, but I discovered I am not a steady enough shooter at my age for bench shooting. It has less than 500 rounds through it. 

If you are looking to get into smallbore bench shooting, this is simply the least expensive way to get in without dumping 1400 bucks into the lower-end anschutz rifles. Absolutely no rust, excellent condition, very accurate.  Face-to-face in Bend/Redmond area, no shipping, Oregon ID and bill of sale required.  

I also have several bricks (500 rounds) of Golden Eagle Eley Prime target ammo that I will offer to the purchaser for $50 each.  The 82G shoots well with this round."

795,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3043795,"For Sale:   3 Piece Combo-Warne 30mm RAMP Mount, 45 Degree Side Mount and 1inch AR Skel Mount.","Quantico, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 300,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 24, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a 3 piece combo. R.A.M.P. 1Inch SKEL Mount and the 45 degree mount.
The all new WARNE Rapid Acquisition Multi-Sight Platform, or RAMP, is a cantilever style scope mounting platform that allows proper scope installation on the popular AR-15 rifle. By design, the AR platform was intended for fixed iron sights and did not offer an acceptable mounting surface for optics. As the weapon system evolved from the military designate M16A1 to the M16A3 and M4, Picatinny mounting systems became standard equipment, however, the rail system found on the A3 and M4 weapon systems still did not allow a variable power optic to be mounted far enough forward with conventional scope mounts.

The new Warne RAMP modular mounting system positions the front ring forward of the upper receiver by 1 3/4” allowing the optics to be mounted farther forward allowing the shooter to position their head in the proper position whether upright or prone and not sacrifice their shooting position due to improper optic positioning.

The new Warne RAMP also offers unique 45 degree mounting rails on one or both sides of the optic. As you know, variable power optics are great for distance but not CQB scenarios. Additionally, CQB sights are great for close quarters and entry scenarios but not for distance shots or target ID. So which one do you choose? Why not have both? The R.A.M.P provides exactly that. The primary sight can be as small as a 1-4 or as large as an 8.5-25 or larger variable power optic. With a mini red dot on one or both sides of the ocular, a shooter can transition from scope to dot or dot to scope in less than a second by rotating the weapon 45 degrees left or right. While the technique is not new, the position of the red dot is. By placing the sight under the ocular of the scope, we have provided a wider field of view thru the mini red dot and make acquiring the dot in the sight faster than you can imagine. And once again, you won’t have to sacrifice your shooting position when transitioning from sight to sight.

FEATURES:
•6000 Series Aluminum
•#8 Torx style fasteners with steel threaded inserts
•Cantilever design for proper eye relief
•Dual 45 degree mounting rails (with the option to remove one or both) for quick transition between scope and red dot
•1/2″ tactical nut attachment, 65 in/lb of torque is recommended

The 1inch SKEL Mount is a one piece mount.
 45 Degree Mount. Machined 6061 aluminum with a durable anodized matte black. For use with a Flat Top AR-15 and other tactical firearms. Provides a 45° accessory mounting platform that attaches to a Picatinny rail for use of flashlights, lasers, slings or open sights without obstructing your sight line.

Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

Gibbs ""Pig Buster"" in .30-06. It's a Reactivated M1903A3 action with a new bolt and 18 inch barrel. Barrel has a No5 Lee Enfield flash hider/bayonet lug and front sight. The stock is a Dark green synthetic ""scant stock"" from a drill rifle. I put a slip on recoil pad on it, recoil is pretty heavy because the gun is fairly light for a .30-06. Would make a great Brush/Deer/Truck rifle. It's the model with irons, but if you want to mount a scope there are a few options out there.
Fired 10 rounds through it. Surprisingly accurate gun. Comes with a box of .30-06 FGMM. Asking 550.

It has VERY strong rifling and a bore like a mirror. The gas system looks factory new, which is rare for 72 year old rifle that shot corrosive ammo during the war. The stock is a Naval/marine stock as it has a sling loop integrated into the buttstock much like a Mosin. The fact that it is a naval rifle may account for how good a shape the internals are. Naval infantry and the marines did fight the Germans on land, however it was to a much lesser extent than the Red Army itself. The serial number stamped into the stock matches that of the rifle. The stock is a deep Russian red, as it was during the war. The wood does show signs of its age with various scratches attained over time, but such is to be expected of a surplus rifle. There are NO cracks what so ever. The metal pieces are in great shape with its finish still intact with hardly any wear. The bolt is a plum color due to the cleaning solvents the Russians used, but this is common and does not affect the function. The muzzle brake is that of the Early period, as it has several line ports rather than two big ports like that on the AVT40. 

You will never find an SVT in this shape that isn't in a museum. In fact, you won't see any new ones imported unless you're in Canada, as Clinton put an end to that in the 90s. The rifle does have some electric penciling of serial numbers in spots as the Russians tended to force match these after the war. If it was not, I would be asking much more. The one that isn't is the one I'm keeping! 


You can have a piece of history, and the honor to say you own a rifle that is extremely rare, and sought after.

As far as price goes, if I get what I ask, I will be willing to travel, any lower and I'm not leaving Columbus.  It is more than a fair price, Gunbroker and other SVTs on Armslist will show you that. 

One mag included, maybe some ammo if the deal is right.  Must be legally able to own this, will ask for ID. No trades at this time, please. Do your research before offering me, ""500 BUCKS MEET TODAY"""
