It is a 5.56  FDE 16'' barrel bull-pup .It is made in the good old USA -assembled from U.S.and Israeli manufactured parts .It takes standard AR15 mags . It is only 26'' overall length so very good for close brush maneuvering or other close quarters encounters. 
The Tavor uses a bullpup configuration, which places the magazine and action to the rear of the weapon, resulting in a short overall length, compared to a standard rifle configuration when both have equal-length barrels. The Tavor has a chrome-lined sixteen and one-half inch barrel, yet is shorter overall than most short-barreled rifle (SBR) configured AR-15 style weapons.
My price is $1750 . It will come as shipped - box, 1 mag, manual, etc .
That price is pretty firm . ( optic not included)

I would consider trades but I would limit it to a partial deal where I still walk away with at least $800 cash for another project I am looking at - I will consider 9mm and 45 acp handguns,  5.56 AR15  rifles, or carbines in handgun caliber. 
If you offer other calibers I will probably not respond.

Designed and manufactured in the USA, the new U22 Neos is a single-action .22 LR caliber plinking semiauto pistol. Although designed with the entry-level pistol shooter in mind, it is also ideal for training and can be adapted to the needs of experienced users. Its modular construction makes it easy to modify with a variety of options and accessories, while still being affordable both as a base pistol and as a fully-accessorized system.


Cool, Futuristic Design

Even while designing a plinking pistol to be used for informal shooting, Beretta did not cut corners. The lines of the Neos bear the unmistakable flavor of renown Italian designer Giugiaro--the same mind behind several of our most attractive offerings. The result is a sleek and ergonomic rimfire pistol that feels as good in the hands as it pleases the eyes.


Fully-Modular Construction

The Neos is constructed of five modular parts that may be easily disassembled and reassembled without any tools. The ergonomic grips are constructed of super-durable fiberglass-reinforced technopolymer with non-slip inserts for a comfortable and warm hold. The barrel is available either in the classic Beretta blue finish, or in stainless steel (""Inox""), to satisfy the tastes of every shooter. Most of these elements may be replaced with the rich assortment of accessories that is available for this fun .22 semiauto.


High Performance

Reliable, durable, easy to maintain and remarkably accurate, the Neos features an integral rail that accepts Weaver-style scope mounts as well as a fully-adjustable target rear sight. The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack, 10-round stainless-steel magazine features an easy-grip knob that allows you to compress the spring from outside, thereby making loading extremely quick and easy. The ambidextrous manual safety can be engaged with the firing pin cocked or uncocked. If you are in the market for a superbly-engineered plinking or practice pistol, give the Neos a close look--it won't fail to surpass your expectations."

This gun has only been fired to zero the scope (about 30 rounds), then cleaned and not used since.  It’s in excellent condition without scratches or wear marks of any kind whatsoever.

One press of a button and the Vortex Strikefire scope easily switches between a red dot and a green dot with 10 levels of brightness to adjust to varying lighting conditions.  It also accommodates a night-vision device if you choose to add one.  

I haven’t attached any other accessories to the gun (like bipods, lasers, tac-lights, boomerangs, grenade launchers, nuclear devices or bubble-blowers, etc.).  I like to stick to the basics...excellent optics firmly mounted on an excellent gun, and I’ve priced this gun low enough to reflect those simple needs.  This gives you a superb starting point with the option to either leave it as it is or add exactly what YOU wish so you can make it meet your needs.  Why pay extra for someone else’s choice of doo-dads?

Includes the original DPMS hard case (sorry, I forgot to include that in a photo).  There's also a padded Blackhawk carrying case allowing transport with optics mounted and pockets for mags and ammo, two metal 30-round mags, 80 rounds of ammo to get you started and the Operator’s Manuals for the gun and the scope.

I prefer a face-to-face sale in east Tennessee without having to deal with shipping.  If you live outside of east Tennessee, I might meet you half-way as long as you’re in TN.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with valid TN driver’s license or carry permit.

Sorry, but I’m not looking for trades on this one.  Please, no low-balls either.

Thanks for your interest and I think you’d enjoy owning this fine firearm!"

The ultimate trigger kit for the EAA Witness - Tanfoglio pistols includes EGW's Hammer and Sear that has been prepped by EGW, HENNING X-Long Firing Pin, 13lb and 14lb Wolff Hammer Spring. The hammer is made from barstock. The hard sear is hardened to Rockwell 55, reset leg been cut back and sear face polished. It will give you a consistent trigger pull for a long time. The 13lb Wolff Hammer Spring reduces your new nice trigger pull considerably and the X-Long Firing Pin gives you 100% consistent ignition. The Trigger Kit can be expanded by including the new hardened hammer and sear pins. They are oversized so a reamer must be used to install. The hardened sear pin keeps the sear tight in the sear housing which helps control the trigger part. The hardened hammer pin holds the hammer in the frame tightly. The 2 different hammer springs allows you to adjust the force which the hammer hits the primers and also affects trigger pull weight.Brand new $140 ship fits EAA Witness Limited .Witness elte Gold Team ,stock 1,2,3"

Well, that’s not true, I couldn’t decide which route to take for ONE all-purpose rifle so I flipped a coin and the M1A lost.
This M1A is a mix of US GI parts with the only commercial part being the Springfield receiver. Based upon the serial number and what SA told me the receiver is a 1994 build. 
As far as I can tell everything else is USGI.
TRW bolt
Winchester barrel dated 2-61
SA USGI trigger housing
HRA safety
Winchester hammer
HRA op rod
The flash hider assembly is obviously commercial.
This rifle is a real dream to shoot and very accurate for what amounts to a battle rifle. Will come with both a Boyds walnut stock and a USGI fiberglass stock with the black crinkle finish. As you can see in the pics it does have the scout rail mounted. This would really be an ideal rifle for any of you looking for an M1A. 
Please don’t message me saying how you can go and buy an M1A at XXX gunshop for less than that. No you can’t, not like this one. The only thing not mil-spec on this is the receiver. If you’re going to run an M1A this is what you want.
I will also throw in a SA Gen 4 scope mount.
Included also is a GI cleaning kit in the Boyds stock and two 20 round magazines ( USGI).
I have 5 extra magazines available for $25 each if you buy the rifle as well as up to 1,400 rounds of M80 ball ammo for .65/round. It’s a mix of surplus Lake City and CBC.

It has been mounted only to verify zero and tracking. There are some ring marks as well as a hairline scratch/crack on the reticle glass. Thankfully it does NOT affect tracking NOR reliability of zero. I know because that's exactly why I mounted it in the first place. Because of this I'm willing to sell it for $800 shipped OBO. It's a $1300 scope new, and I realize there are much better options out there, but this would be great for a budget hunting build. Tritium glows very brightly.

I'm sure Trijicon would take it back and fix it as well, I just don't really want to bother at this point.

Total value of gun,ammo and holster is just over 370.00, but I will take 250.00 for it all, BUT the price is firm so don't ask if I will take less because I will not."

Swiss Straight-Pull Bolt Action Schmidt Rubin 1896/11 Antique Receivered Rifle 7.5x55 

Fires the modern GP11 round, this is not black powder. 
Excellent bolt face and barrel has a mirror like shine. 
No cracks in the wood, metal blueing is around 70+% condition except for 
the butt plate having some surface rust that I could never bring my self to 
take a scratch pad too. Whole rifle is maintained with Ballistoil.

This family of guns has been been mentioned by survivalblog.com as it is well know for its accuracy but does not fall under traditional firearm laws being an antique. 

Make me an offer, remember these are scarce!! I have some re-loadable Hornady soft point and available as well for it.

This is a solid rifle and it is a fair price, especially considering you will not be paying taxes on it like you would if you got it at a retail store.  Please don’t send low ball offers.  I am not desperate to get rid of this gun but I do want to thin my collection a bit.  I have only put 120 rounds through it (4 full mags).  That being said it is a good rifle and it is well into its “Break-In”.

If you are interested contact me and we can make some arrangements. I am not really interested in trades at this time as I want to use the cash for another build but if you have something interesting I will listen. I will strongly consider trading for a Kriss V Special Duty pistol or SBR (not the CRB) or even a Chiappa Rhino 50DS in .357."

All parts are new, unfired outside of the factory.  The fit is very tight between the two, with no play.  The color match between upper and lower is pretty good -- with a coat of synthetic motor oil, CLP, or froglube, they will probably match even better.  The price is $500, and I'm not interested in trades.

Upper:

PTAC 16"" M4 profile, forged upper receiver
1:7 twist barrel
.750"" gas block diameter
M4 feedramps
M16 profile Bolt Carrier Group

Lower:

Range Tool manufactured - Cosmetic blemish model.  One small blemish across the front of the magwell, which is barely visible.  Any blemish marks will not affect function.
7075-T6 aluminum forging (mil-spec)
Mil-spec hardcoat black anodized
Caliber marked ""Multi""
No roll marks -- perfect for custom engraving, or for someone who doesn't want obnoxious logos all over their receiver

Lower Parts:  PSA Enhanced lower build kit parts -- this means mill spec buffer tube and six position stock.  Trigger is standard mil-spec, and subjectively feels between 5 and 7lbs pull.  Very little grit in the pull, but I'm not an expert on AR triggers.

This thing has been shot, but has a low rd count, it times perfectly and I would rate it at 90-95%....it is a beauty.

From a Colt collectors book:
Colt had had very successful sales of the Mark III series and in 1982 issued an upgraded version of it as the new ""V"" frame Mark V series.

The major changes from the Mark III were:

Changed the sintered steel hammer and trigger to cast steel.

Changed the hammer and trigger to Colt's first short action. This gave a shorter hammer fall.

Changed the mainspring, the mainspring guide and location of the mainspring seat to a longer spring and longer guide. The new hammer and trigger, the new longer mainspring and the relocated mainspring seat were intended to improve the trigger pull.

Changed the full profile square butt frame to a new rounded profile grip frame.

Grips were changed to a full wrap-around design with a covered back strap.
They take the same grips as King Cobra and Anaconda, which are easier to find than most other Colts.

Changed the barrel to include Python-like vents in the rib.

In 85', Colt decided to simplify production and go with the King Cobra ONLY (also a Mk V action), and discontinue the Trooper, Lawman, Boa, peacekeeper and Whitetailer.

My pics don't do it justice...I keep it in a heavy coat of oil and didn't wipe it or the gun-rug fibers off very well...and the deep blue of these Colts don't photograph well when you suck at taking pics.

These are so hard to come by that pricing them is difficult....ALL Colts are climbing at stupid rates...I see run of the mill, used MK III's going for $700 now.
I got into it by cycling the action and was hooked....I had only seen a MK V once before in my life, so had to have it. And gave way to much.
Well, I have decided on removing the safe queens.

$850
I am entertaining trades on this....but be real. A Glock and $50 won't get it.

Must be a legal buyer, and show AZ ID...I'll show my AZ ID &CCW"

I have a Windham Weapondry SRC rifle for sale. Added to the base rifle, it has a TRS-25 Red Dot sight mounted and Troy Diamondhead backup iron sights. I've also added a rubber butt plate to the stock, a GI M1 style sling, BAD lever, a railed handguard, an MOE angled foregrip, and swapped out the pistol grip for a Magpul grip. I will include 3 30-round magazines if your state allows (although I'd prefer to sell it locally if possible).

The rifle has had approximately 210-240 rounds fired through it, and cleaned well before and after each range trip. It cycles flawlessly and has proven to be extremely accurate. I'm selling it because I have 2 essentially identical carbine AR15's and I really only need one. It has a transferable lifetime warranty, which I have activated, so you would also have a lifetime warranty.

I paid $820 brand new for the bare rifle in 2013 (the MSRP has gone up to $1000 since then); I'd like to sell it for $850 given that it's used but has several big upgrades (like the Troy flip-ups in addition to the TRS-25 red dot and all new furniture). This price is pretty firm, as it's an excellent rifle in perfect condition and I have no pressing need to sell it (other than to buy ammo for my other rifles...)."

Not sure who made it, maybe Stevens or Crescent Arms.  It is chambered for 2-3/4"" shells.  My guess is this one was made in the 40's right after WWII.  I took it with me to the range recently and fired 3 rounds thru it.  Kicks like a 12ga.  The gun is very long but is not all that heavy.  Shot well, and everything is tight as a drum on it.  Rust speckling on the barrel and receiver.  A little pitting inside the barrel, but not bad.

You can safely use 32S&W Long or 32S&W in this revolver. It's great for collectors or for someone wanting a great carry revolver without much recoil for $350. 

I have several other guns for sale as well. 

I have a very nice LMT MRP DEFENDER with quick change 6.8SPC 16"" barrel and quick change 14.5"" 5.56mm barrel. This gun is guaranteed .5MOA and has the monolithic rail which means the upper and rail were machined out of one solid piece of aluminum. Comes with one high cap mag for each caliber and the factory BCG for each caliber. The optics are NOT INCLUDED. $1800.

I also have a ROCK RIVER ARMS COYOTE CARBINE 6.8SPC that is guaranteed to shoot .75MOA. It comes in the factory hard case with all paperwork, RRA match two-stage trigger, and factory 10rd mag. $950 

I also have a COLT M4 build. It has a Colt 5.56mm 14.5"" 1/7 twist barrel with pinned and welded Phantom flash hider, early 1990's Colt A3 upper, KAC RAS quad rail, and a very hard to find 1977 Colt ""Slab-side"" lower with a rare Bushmaster Aluminum collapsible stock, Badger Ordnance Tactical latch, high end rear back up iron sight, and one 30rd Colt magazine. $1200 (This is a great gun especially for the price)

ROSSI M971 971 357MAG COMPENSATED 2.5"" STAINLESS ADJ. SIGHTS CUSTOM GRIPS. This is the best shooting Rossi I've ever shot. It's a great carry gun or woods gun with very manageable recoil and good accuracy. You see a lot of 971's but not to many with the factory extended recoil compensator. This gun has been fitted with a pair of Pachmayr Hybrid grips which has a soft rubber for your fingers but wood on the areas of the grip that could come in contact with clothing so the grips won't catch on clothing when being drawn from concealment. You must have either a NC CCH or a permit to purchase. $350

Buffalo Arms Model 1 357Mag/38SPL. This is a really cool little gun that only 10.000 where produced by Buffalo Arms, which is a company that normally made barrels and parts for military machine guns. These normally sell for $400 online when you can find them but I'm only asking $250 for mine. 

STAR MODEL S 380ACP STAINLESS. 
This is a great little gun for carry or fun at the range and is one of the most comfortable 380's I've ever held. It comes in the factory box and has all the original paperwork. It is an Interarms Star Model S 380ACP in stainless. $300

I'll be listing other guns also. I'm open to some trades for other guns in 308, 7.62X39, 45ACP, 357mag, most ammo, etc. so let me know what you have."
