A perfect lighter carry and concealed size 12+1 round 45Cal 1911,"Southside, Jacksonville, Florida",$ 625,"Listed On: Friday, September 12, 2014",Handguns,American Tactical Imports                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I have a NIB ATI 45 caliber Fatboy. Will hold 12 rounds plus 1. Called a fatboy because of the double stacked magazine, but really no wider than a single stack 1911. This 1911 is perfect for carry as it is much smaller and much lighter than a regular full size 1911. Be over 21,have a FL drivers License and I will fill out a bill of sale.

Overall length under seven inches, 5.5 inches high and only 1.33 inches at its widest point, the FX45 is easy to conceal even under light clothing. But it’s a true 1911 and has all of the excellent features John Moses Browning designed into his original pistol: single-action trigger, excellent ergonomics and well-placed controls that are easy to operate. 
The machined steel slide has dual sets of grasping grooves, and the ejection port has been lowered and flared to ensure that spent cases get out of the way surely and quickly.
But the most modern feature is that it uses a bushing-less barrel with a flared muzzle section. Another departure from the original is a telescoping, dual-spring recoil system on a full-length guide rod. Both of these features ensure tight and consistent barrel/slide lockup for improved accuracy and functioning. It also greatly simplifies disassemble.
The low-profile rear sight has a large, easy-to-acquire square notch and is angled to prevent it from hanging up on clothing on the draw, and its rear face is serrated to reduce glare. The front is a square blade with a white dot insert.
The alloy frame pares the Fatboy LW’s unloaded weight to a mere 22 ounces, and the frame is undercut at the trigger guard to permit a high grip on the gun.
The ambidextrous thumb safety levers are smaller than normally seen on a 1911 but can still be operated positively. An extended beavertail grip safety with a palm swell provides superior handling while ameliorating recoil—a nice feature on a .45 pistol weighing so little. Aggressively checkered, polymer grip panels allow a secure grip."

It is basically 2 sized guns in one. Using the regular mag, it makes for a nice concealed carry weapon. Also comes with an extended mag to make it full size. Be legal and I will do a bill of sale.
The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.
The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber.
Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

Overview:
If you wanted some “wow” factor for young ladies, the 20-gauge Model 870™ Express® Compact in Mossy Oak® Pink Camo is for you.

Young shooters are more likely to become stewards of the shooting sports if they start with a gun that fits properly. that's exactly why Remington crafted their standard, premium-grade stocks with a shorter length of pull, then fit them to some of their finest firearms. for 2009, all compact firearms are equipped with their new Adjustable Length of Pull System. So, fit can be customized to youngsters as they grow, and adults requiring a shorter length of pull can tailor compact firearms to their specific needs.

I know when I went to a gunstore to buy a handgun, I took one I thought I might trade. The gunstore hurt my feelings with the low trade offer. I knew I could sell it for more cash than what I was being offered in trade. Maybe these sellers on Armslist should go to their local gunstore to get more of an idea how trade values work.

CALL OR TEXT NUMBER BELOW ONLY...NO EMAILS ANSWERED!

This is a great handgun for concealed carry and has surprising power! This weapon is absolutely perfect for someone who wants to carry a weapon at all times comfortably and have the element of surprise in their corner! 

LOOK AT MY DEAL...If you bought this weapon new it retails WITHOUT the Crimson Trace laser for $340 to $389.00 plus tax. The Crimson Trace Laser would be an additional $179.00 accessory plus tax. I'm INCLUDING IT in my entire selling price of $400.00!!!! But that's not all as you'll see down below!

UNLIKE OTHER LASERS the Crimson Trace laser is activated when the gun is gripped...and wherever the red dot is...that's where the bullet is going! No more worrying about hitting your target! There are cheaper manual on-off switch lasers like LaserMax and LaserLyte out there for around $100-$150, but they are not even close to the product quality of Crimson Trace. 

I'm also including an Elite ""inside the pocket"" holster which makes the weapon completely unnoticeable while carrying it in your pocket and so comfortable you can actually forget that you have a weapon in your pocket. If you went out and purchased an Elite pocket holster it retails for $27 plus tax. Again...I'M INCLUDING IT!

And finally...the Golden Saber +P ammo is a personal favorite ammo choice of mine for the shear ballistic power. It's an additional $25 if you went out and purchased it...but I'M INCLUDING IT free of charge in the deal! 

Weapon comes in the original box with a Ruger logo nylon zipper pouch.

That makes MY entire package valued at nearly $600 when adding everything up. 

BUT I'M SELLING IT ALL TO THE FIRST $400 FIRM! THAT'S RIGHT...$400 FIRM!!! 

Do your own research then you'll know that this is A STEAL OF A DEAL!! But you better hurry because this deal won't last long before somebody grabs it quick!

$400.00 FIRM! 
DON'T ASK FOR A LOWER PRICE because the answer is NO!

From the factory: The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. Longer barrel lengths of 24"", 26"" and 32"" will be available in the future. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets.Folding Bayonet, and many more.

You've been asking for a couple +P 45 AUTO RIM loads for a long time, so by popular demand, here they are. Both loads are using high quality Starline brass. We've also incorporated a flash suppressed powder so you can shoot in the dark without blinding yourself and this is important because over 95% of all civilian shootings in the USA occur in low light when the criminal element is at work. Both of these loads are the equivalent of +P+ 45 ACP ammo or as it is also known, 45 Super. These are very stout loads, but will not harm modern 45 ACP revolvers, nor will these loads harm any post war 45 ACP revolvers. Feel free to safely shoot these loads in any post war 45 ACP revolver that is in normal good operating condition.

Check out the below velocities fired from personal real world revolvers, NOT test barrels. You'll notice that the new S&W 4 inch Mt. Gun gives speeds almost as fast as the older S&W revolvers with 5.5 and 6.5 inch barrels. This is NOT a typo. It simply shows that the new S&W revolvers are made to much tighter tolerances than the older S&W revolvers and therefore give higher velocities per inch of barrel. Also, we are aware that the 1937 manufactured model 1917 we used as a test gun, (see below velocity chart) is not post war.

Item # 32A - 255gr. hard cast flat nose bullet
S&W Mountain Gun, 4 inch bbl = 1031 FPS
S&W Model 325 (scandium) 2.5 inch bbl = 945 FPS
S&W model 1917 (1937 Production) 5.5 inch bbl = 1043 FPS
S&W 1955 Target (25-2) 6.5 inch bbl = 1070 FPS

Item # 32A - was designed for deep penetration with no bullet expansion. It will shoot right through stick frame and drywall construction walls and through both doors on a 2003 Dodge Ram or through a black bears skull, etc. It was designed for, among other things, outdoor use including black bear protection. Expect around 30 inches of penetration on live flesh and bone."
