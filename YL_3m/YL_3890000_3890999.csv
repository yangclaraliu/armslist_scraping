As with all firearms and especially with children, you must be very, very vigilant. My neighbor’s child was shooting a 22 training rifle.  This rifle is a one shot 22 lr cal. The boy enjoys shooting 22‘s as they have very little kick and are not very loud.  This was the second time he went shooting.  As a side note, he enjoyed shooting so much, he behaved and listened much more attentively than at other times.  First time out shooting he behaved for over 3 ½ hours, this past time we were out 2 ½ plus hours. At ten years old, I require the boy to read gun safety pamphlets and other similar materials.  I quiz him when he now walks with me and my pit bull.  He was frightened of dogs, but has been overcoming this fear.  Shooting can be a great bonding and educational tool for young teens and children.  Again, much care and caution should be taken. 100 percent attention when all the time a child is with a rifle and more so when a child handles a hand gun.   Even though I cannot shoot as much as I would like, I enjoy the experience of shooting with the child.  (Of Course I get permission from the boys MOM!)

I shot 2 Hi Point 40 S&W’s  which at 10 to 12 yards shot about 3’ to the right of center. All new Hi Points have an adjustable rear sight for even better sight adjustments.  I have not bothered to adjust the rear sight on my 40’s. The up down pattern was less than an inch off a straight line.   These are great inexpensive (affordable) fun hand guns to shoot.  The Hi Point 380 and 9C hand guns are about the same size and feel as Cobra Freedom Series 380’s, which again are great fun and affordable hand guns.

If you are looking for a new or used firearm, I am happy to help you find a weapon that you will LOVE to shot and make part of your firearm family.  Even if I do not sell you a firearm, I would enjoy answering any firearm questions or receiving your firearm purchased elsewhere.  I will be happy to transfer anyones firearms, the Cost is $15.00 and tax.

For $25 I will remove your old sights and install new night sights, target sights or whatever you provide (or I can source some for you at an additional cost). I can give discounts for multiple guns from same customer.

Most gunsmiths or factories charge $50-$100+ for this service plus the cost of the sights (which they may or may not up charge) and they keep your gun for days or weeks or you have to mail it in and pay shipping/insurance.

You can just bring me your bare slide or I can gladly remove your slide. I can perform this job with a very fast turn around. Usually same day and as fast as a couple of hours.

I perform this service using custom made tooling so the resulting product is clean and properly installed. No punches or hammers involved and I can do it on even the hardest of factory sights like the springfield XD series.

Email or text for questions, advice or to request service. I can provide photos of the work I've done to my own and others' guns. Satisfaction guaranteed.

This is a government sized frame and slide and are both made out of carbon. It is for .45acp but uses a .38 firing pins due to caspian choosing to go the route. All caspian slides are drilled for .38 firing pins. THIS NEEDS TO BE BUILT!

Frame:
It is made out of Carbon for tighter fitment. It has a integrated mag well and a built in rail and front strap has a 20 or 25 lpi checkering. I don't remember exactly what I ordered for checkering. It also has a integrated plunger tube. The mainspring housing is flat but not checkered. It is special to the race ready recon frame and therefore cannot be swapped out with any other mainspring housings.

Slide:
A full 5"" government slide made out of carbon, again for tighter fitment and has Novak style cuts for sights front and rear. Has rear standard cocking serrations and the recon radius up front. If you know how to machine, you could do a bunch of custom stuff to the slide like add your own front cocking serrations and flat top it and etc. 

All I have done to this is meticulously hand fit the slide and frame to ensure maximum frame and slide fitment. Other than that, I have not been able to build the gun yet due to me spending money on other things. Everything else still needs to be fitted and bought pretty much lol. I have a whole list of parts I was going to buy but never got around to. Yes the slide and frame need to be finished as in coated or you could just leave it raw. I highly recommend you put some sort of coating on them though. I really want to finish this off but I don't think ill be able to anytime soon. Please research on your own and this is not for the faint of heart and needs to be built. 

I had to get a shop to bring this in for me and had to pay ffl fees and shipping and etc. Cost of the package was $650 and after taxes and everything else over $700. This is straight from Caspian. The wait time was a big pain in the butt.

I want $625.00. You save money from not having to order it from caspian, pay ffl shipping and tax and having to wait forever so please keep this in mind. Please no lowball offers.

- A VLTOR gas block with integrated flip-up front sight; this can fold down to create a Picatinny rail on the gas block
- VLTOR flash-hider ($60)
- An ERGO contoured pistol grip ($45)
- Mag-Pul CTR stock ($45)
- The rear sight is a Yankee Hill (about $90)
- ADE laser light combo ($75)
- FAB Defense mag foregrip ($49)
- FAB Defense angled foregrip ($49)
- Tru Glo Red Dot sight (green and red) ($135)
- 800 Rounds of .223 ($500+)
- 3 30 round PMAGS ($65) 

Even with all of these improvements, it is surprisingly light – and dead-on accurate. 

I'm asking $1600 OBO for everything, which is a steal for rifle and ammo.

Now, with a Fast Action trigger mechanism for the shooting enthusiast who prefers a quick short trigger pull with a drop free magazine, or the extra safe action inspired by a Double Action Only configuration with a mag-out safety, FMK Firearms has you covered either way.  This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol.  The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger.  Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.

Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.

The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands.  The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American."

We have milled new pins to the exact specs of the original hinge pin. We have added a hole for a steel cable to attach to your trigger guard or your barrel if you don't have the guard. Our steel pins are blued to better match the rifle and protect it from the weather. The cables are stainless steel with plastic coating to protect your rifle from scratching.

If you are going with the barrel cable, it will require a tug of the threaded end through  the center of the barrels. A layer of electrical tape and oil will pop it right through without damage to the barrels or the cable end. The excess cable can be shortened by doubling it over the end of the barrels.

The 5/16"" length needed for the hole still provides a low profile unlike the bulky push pins that seem to have been the only option available for years.

Your survival rifle is only as strong as its weakest point. Lose your pin in the field and your done for the day. Don't wait until you lose yours to get your backup. We only ran 100 and will not be running any more due  to cost overruns. We're listing 50 here and 50 on Ebay.

Buyer pays $9.99shipping and handling. We will combine shipping on multiple orders. Please specify trigger or barrel length cable.

ALL OTHER CALIBERS IN STOCK. Cocking the R8 iC activates the illuminated dot of the ZEISS rifle scope. The hunter is immediately ready to shoot. He gains time, remains calm and therefore is able to shoot safely. WITH CASE. Focused repeating In-line repeating in the correct shooting position allows for a relaxed posture in situations that require a quick succession of shots. The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy. Blaser Saddle Mount Only with a perfect scope mount, rifle and rifle scope become one accurate unit. Four inconspicuous notches which are aligend with the chamber hold the one-piece mounting base without causing tension. Thus, the barrel can float freely and keeps its point of impact even with the heat generated by a quick succession of shots. By just a few turns, the rifle scope can be detached and reattached within a split second – all without needing to re-zero your optics. Blaser Radial Locking System Extremely strong consentric locking directly to the barrel without rotary motion. Besides barrel bedding and quality, the Blaser radial locking system contributes decisively to unsurpassed accuracy. Success Factor: The stock Different from some traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. Due to the increased muzzle stability the felt recoil is substantially reduced. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Short and huntable The unique design of the R8 magazine above the trigger allows the overall lenght of the rifle to be 9 cm (3?½“) shorter than conventional bolt action rifles. This innovative feature proves to be a distinct advantage in all terrain. Perfectly balanced The combination of overall length, total weight and balance sets a new standard for bolt action rifles. The balanced weight distribution allows for fast handling and quick target acquisition. Safely stored, ready in a split second In situations when hunters have to walk long distances, it is more comfortable to carry the rifle stripped down in a backpack. If required, the rifle can be reassembled in a split second, without influencing the point of impact. When traveling, the R8 can be transported stripped down in a rifle case. In contrast to very long conventional rifle cases, passers-by do not recognize the R8’s inconspicuous rifle case. Locked Magazine The double release buttons protect the magazine against unintentional drop out. Our innovation does not stop there. We also incorporated a locking device for the hunter who prefers a non-detachable magazine. When the magazine is locked in place, and with an open bolt, the rifle can be loaded from the top. Protected All metal parts of the R8 are either made of rustproof material or otherwise protected against corrosion. The closed construction of the R8 action prevents contaminants from entering the rifle. Every magazine comes with a protective cover (1) preventing dirt from entering the rifle when the magazine is stored outside of it. When taking out the magazine, the magazine chamber can be closed with a magazine chamber cover (2) which is included in the scope of delivery. Desmodromic Trigger Mechanism The critical link between shooter and rifle is the trigger. The R8 offers the next leap in technology. Upon cycling the action, the trigger is reset mechanically. This innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing. This important design feature offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Hunting around the world There is no better advantage to a hunter than the ability to use one rifle anywhere in the world. With calibers ranging from .222 Rem to .416 Rem. Mag. there are no limitations for your Blaser. Several rifle scopes on one barrel Every barrel is prepared for the Original Blaser Saddle Mount. This allows for several rifle scopes to be used with one barrel. ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE CALL or TEXT ME. Dimpie Hathcock  (952) 373-1518"

I'm also adding 260 rounds of 7.62x39mm ammo along with what i believe is 23 tracers. I'm willing to work out a deal if your interested. If you would like more pictures, just send me an email requesting them. I also have the original box the rifle came in."

I still have the factory trigger and recoil spring if you don't like the feel of the reduced trigger pull kit.  They are drop in and very easy to install yourself.  The gun has had @ 300 rounds down the pipe and is in excellent condition, as I take very good care of my guns.  I'll throw in a kydex holster as well.  Can provide photos upon request."

My MVP will come with box and 25rd magazine - No 10rd Mag. I may also have an el chepo scope to go with it but WILL NOT have rings. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the MVP series it will accept all traditional AR15 Magazines. My rifle has a threaded bull barrel ready for a silencer or muzzle attachment of our choice.

I bought this rifle as a project and I'm having some trouble locating a correct stock for it. It is not a numbers matching gun but a few parts do have the ""R in a circle"" on them. Over all it seems to be in pretty good condition. I have 2 stocks for it one is cracked and fixed with a dowl rod and has been stripped down it is a M91 stock however it is not original to the gun. The other stock I have is a M91/30 it is the one that is pictured it has had a few shoddy repairs and a quick schelac job done. The stock is good for a shooter and looks really good from 15ft away... I have all the mis. Stock pieces barrel bands ect. For the m91 stock (no handgaurd tho) I am looking to possibly TRADE the rifle is NOT FOR SALE. I may also be interested in a good M91 stock and would pay top dollar for one in american black walnut. Just testing the waters to see what is out there"

It's hard to find one that fits both and nice when you have both weapons. It also will fit Kahr 9/40 models along with Bersa/Firestorm .380's. The mag pouch will fit single stack 1911 10 mags. Also fits staggered mags in 9/40, I don't have a staggered 45 to test, there is a tension screw that is adjustable. The harness is a Bianchi Scorpion (Large 44""-46"") that uses two wide elastic straps that go across your back instead of the normal crisscross that puts a lot of pressure on your neck. I checked fit with a Para 1911 with staggered mags and a Springfield Champion Operator (railed) with 10 round mags in the pouch. It's nice to have a system that works for more than one weapon. $150 firm, If interested and you're to far to travel I can ship it, I also can take paypal. REDACTED call or text Todd."
