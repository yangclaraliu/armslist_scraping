M. Davis Gun Museum in Claremore for their new tactical police/military section, but just found out I need 2 Grand to fix my truck. Ted Williams Mod. 200/Winchester Mod. 1200 12 Ga. 2 3/4"" Tactical Police/Military weapon with VERY LOW felt recoil. 22"" ported barrel with a skeleton stock, 1"" recoil pad permanently mounted and a 5-shell holder. Mag tube holds 5+1 shells. Fore-grip, stock grip and receiver all have permanent rubber coating which is very grippy, wet or dry. Also included is a new Outer's Shotgun Cleaning Kit. Just the gunsmithing, grip coating, and cleaning kit cost more than $200 for me.

Tactical gear includes: Quad rail up front with a zoomable 600 Lm Ultra-Fire tac light that focuses down to ""Shot Pattern"" on your target, cantilevered rail over the receiver, steel hand guard, match grade iron sights, Combat Carry 3-point sling, all for only $425 total for everything you see in the pictures, except the case which is gone.  By the way, using the match grade iron sights, I put a slug within 1 inch of the bullseye from 75 ft.  That might mess up the low-information-voter who's breaking in your front door!

I have an Aimpoint 1x32 Reflex optic (bought for $129 last month) that I could use on my other shotgun, a bird gun, but I'll let it go with this one for $75.  Gives great 2-eyed acquisition and target leading for skeet, birds, or attacking scumbags!

Inc.  It was completely made in Poland so it features a Polish receiver and a Polish cold-hammer forged and chrome lined barrel.  I gave this gun to a professional gunsmith and added a Polish Tantal stock which is very similar to the stock that came with it but is much stronger and has a sling attachment on it. I will include the original side folding stock as well.  I then added a new muzzle brake by CNC Warrior since the I.O. brakes are very brittle and I do not really like the slant muzzle brakes.  The gun was refinished in a semi-gloss molyresin finish which is extremely durable and beautiful.  All this work was done by Meridian Ordnance which is an extremely competent and professional gunsmith company here in Kentucky. The owner does superb work on Ak and Ar-15 platforms as well as other gun platforms. I would recommend Meridian for any of your gunsmithing needs. I did not have any work done to the gun that changed the operation of the firearm. It is brand new and unfired. I bought the rifle at Centerfire Systems for $499.99 before taxes. The Tantal stock cost me $50.00. The work and refinishing of the gun cost $150 and the muzzle brake cost me $35.  I have five brand new Croatian metal magazines which have a bolt hold open feature like the Yugo mags and they cost me $18 a piece at Centerfire. I also have four Magpul mags that cost me $15 a piece and I have the original two American made polymer mags that come with it as well, so I have a total of 11 mags that come with the gun.  Six of the mags are fully loaded with Tula FMJ ammo and one of the mags has 20 rounds, so 200 rounds total come with the gun.  The rifle also has a Magpul pistol grip which cost me $20.  In the total package I have over $1000.00.  I am asking $900 obo for the total AK package. I am not looking for trades and lowball offers will be ignored. I know how much the gun is worth and the work I had done to it is worth as well.  If you are looking for a quality made, military grade AK package then send me your offer. Thanks and text me at REDACTED if interested. $850 or best offer."

I have had this 25-06 for a few years now and absolutely love the gun. It shoots great but I would like to buy another lightweight stainless carry rifle. I have hunted with it a little so it does have a few normal minor marks but it is a very nice rifle otherwise. The stock is bedded and the lop is 13"". It has a 26"" Medium contour target grade/crown barrel, NOT the bull barrel. This thing really shoots with virtually no recoil.

The trades I would consider would be:
257 Roberts
257 Weatherby with ammo and reloading dies
260
280
6.5x55
6.5 Creedmoor 
35 Whelen
Possibly a HK VP9
G33
340 PD or Ruger 357 (DOA)
Walther PPS
Would also consider NICE optics

I'm open to most with the exception of Remington. I would also prefer to have ammo/brass/dies with most of the odd ball calibers for obvious reasons.

Preference would be for a Stainless Sako, Tikka, Browning or Steyr ProHunter or Scout. I also like CZ's as well but still prefer another SS rifle. Might also consider a SS 260 or Savage lightweight hunter in 6.5 Creedmoor or 260. I can add cash if needed to make it fair. 

3 - Different Options to purchase:
1. $550 Cash gets the gun only 
2. $625 Cash gets the combo (6-18x50AO Bushnell scope/Ruger factory rings/gun). 
3. Trade for options listed above (I can Add cash if needed to make it fair).

Price is firm and certainly fair. These are NOT cheap (Mine is the Target Grade model) so please be respectful and skip the lowball stuff . Sorry but I don't have a lot of time with work and family so the deal needs to be close by unless you are willing to do more driving on your end. Bill of sale will be completed as well. Thanks for the interest!"

Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 16+1 rounds of 9mm (12+1 of .40SW.) You’ll find everything on the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®.

If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD® 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range.

I hate to part with this pistol, but I just never got around to shooting bullseye matches.

This Trailside comes with one 10-round magazine, a rail conversion (dovetail to Weaver), and an open red-dot sight with four reticles. I don't remember the brand of the sight (it may be marked underneath, but I have the sight zeroed in and don't want to remove it), but it functions great. It is an off-brand I paid less than $100 for. It also comes with the original box and instructions, plus the 5-round test target. No trades, please. Thank you for looking."

Comes with the original case, paperwork (unopened), manufacturers first fire casing (also unopened), accessories included with case, extra 15 round mag, and Crimson Trace laser.

The whole reason I purchased a gun was for concealed carry; after spending all the money to receive my CHL. This Glock is a superior handgun and I love it! However, if it sits in the safe all day, it doesn't serve it's purpose. The gun is just too heavy to carry daily in my purse. I need to downgrade to smaller frame 9 mm gun or maybe a .380. 

Anyone interested in purchasing, will need to meet me at a FFL dealer in Portland area and must pay for the legal paperwork to be done. I will pay the fee for any full priced offer. I will NOT ship this gun!!!! 

 ----- NOT interested in trades or low ball offers. Serious inquiries only. If you truly appreciate and prefer a Glock, you will know after viewing this handgun, that it is worth this price.

I figure I don't need to take them with me back up north, as such I am selling them on arms list.  Per many people I spoke with it seems the price per brick is a bit outrageous, as I was told I could sell a brick at nearly 20-22 cents a round. 

I has to ship this in via my 1000+ mile drive from WA/idaho and we have intermittent supply up there, It's not cheap, but we have some.  However since I rather get a decent deal on my remaining bricks I will ask for offers and go with the best offer. If the offers are ridiculously low I will just keep my ammo and drive it back up north to spokane.    If things change I will post / pull ad so you know it sold.

As I am near several bases, I maybe interested in some ammo cans as trade (40mm, 20mm, fat 50s, 50s, 30s) etc.  Or a combo of cans and cash.

Shoot me an email I will look at it and go from there"

Product Description Reliability, versatility, and value make the Model 2000 the ideal semi-auto shotgun. Inside the Stoeger Model 2000 semi-auto shotgun is the Inertia Driven operating system, the heart of the world's most prestigious and reliable autoloaders. The Inertia Driven system has only three moving parts in the bolt, the inertia spring, the bolt body, and the rotating locking head, for more reliable operation. The operating system is mostly contained in the receiver, giving the Model 2000 a trimmer forend with better balance. The Stoeger Model 2000 fires everything from 1-1/8 ounce field and target loads to the heaviest 3"" waterfowl loads without adjustments. Plus, with no propellant gas venting into the operating system, the Model 2000 stays cleaner. The bolt assembly includes an inertia spring and a rotating locking head and a cavity is designed into the butt stock of the Model 2000 to allow installation of an optional, mercury-filled recoil reducer. A red bar front sight helps you pick up the target even in low-light hunting situations. Five choke tubes ranging from cylinder to extra-full turkey come standard."

This is not a CMP build 308.  This gun was assembled by myself.

The rifle is all USGI parts, most of the later 65 or 77 series parts, with the exception of the barrel.  The barrel is a Criterion M1 Garand contour barrel with a 1:10 twist which should allow you to shoot any ammo from surplus to match with excellent accuracy.  It is NOT chrome lined.  I have been able to consistently paper 1 ¼ in groups and I am quite sure it is capable of shooting better than I can.

All USGI parts were hand selected and are either new old stock or newer parts well within acceptable tolerance.  The stock is in excellent shape, again a USGI item with a nice DAS stamp.  The rifle has fired for me without a single problem.

It has National Match front and rear sights and is an excellent shooting rifle.  The trigger group has been tuned and polished to National Match standards by Master Gunsmith Jeff Shapiro.  It also features an adjustable gas plug which will allow you to adjust gas blow back for any round you may be shooting.  The receiver and op rod have been nicely laser engraved with the words “NATO 7.62 mm”

I am in Marysville and would prefer a face to face and I am willing to split driving if in a reasonable distance.  If you adopt to do it by mail I will need a money order or bank check plus an FFL to send to.  It is C&R eligible.  SHIPPING COST WOULD NEED TO BE DETERMINED.

The Bushmaster 16"" M4 A3 Gas Piston Carbine is designed for situations requiring a lightweight, rugged firearm. With Gas Piston reliability eliminating excess heat, carbon build up, and gas leaks.
The Hard Chrome Plated ""Gas Trap"" Piston is easily cleaned by removing it through a plug at the front of the Gas Block. The 16"" Barrel makes it legal without permanently attaching the flash suppressor or brake. The 1 in 9"" twist barrel is chrome lined for maximum longevity and accuracy, as well as ease of maintenance. For muzzle flash suppression, a ""bird cage"" style suppressor is fitted. A six-position, telescoping butt stock offers light weight and ease of carrying.
The A3 Type Removable Carry Handle has a 1/2 M. O. A., dual aperture, M16 A2 rear sight system. The front sight is a flip up sight (made by YHM and comes with the  Bushmaster from the factory ) that allows for an unobstructed view if the carry handle is removed and optics are chosen to be mounted. With the handle removed, you can mount a variety of scopes, optics, or night vision devices to the Pica-tinny type rail base of the ""flat-top"" Upper Receiver.
The light weight, forged, 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are finished in a non-reflective mil. spec. hard anodize for durability, and incorporate all M16 A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, last round bolt hold-open and raised ridges for magazine release button protection. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures complete protection against corrosion or rust on barrel and other exposed steel parts of the weapon.

A selective-fire model was manufactured for militaries all over the world, and today there are several companies producing semi-automatics for civilian markets. During the Cold War it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, with the notable exception of the United States. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries. ""The FAL was predominantly chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO round, and because of its prevalence and widespread use among the armed forces of many NATO countries during the Cold War it was nicknamed ""The right arm of the Free World"".

The .22lr AK-47 manufactured by GSG represents much more than a small caliber “knock-off” of a famous rifle. The GSG-AK47 is a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, and the look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection.
