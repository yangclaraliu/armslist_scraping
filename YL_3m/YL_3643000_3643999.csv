Both are listed separately, but if you're interested in buying both, I'll make a special deal for you - less than the individual listings, and less than I'll take individually - since you'll save me the trouble of multiple sales.

Here are the individual listings so you can read the details on each:

http://www.armslist.com/posts/3639446/portland-oregon-shotguns-for-sale--remington-870-home-defense---20-gauge

Price for both together: $650 and is firm.

This deal is only available if you buy both at the same time, to the same buyer. Buying both saves me some time, so I'm willing to bring the price down a bit more that I would on the individual items. That's only $325 for a 10/22 with laminated stock and Volquartsen trigger kit plus a brick of ammo AND $325 for a Remington 870 Home Defense in 20 gauge with some ammo. Good deals for both!

Sale will be FTF in Milwaukie, Oak Grove, Gladstone or O.C. Current Oregon DL is required, current Oregon CHL is preferred and will be given preferential status if more than one person wants this. Meeting will be around my work schedule. We'll do a simply BOS for my records only."

Awesome lower retails for $364 new
 copied from san tans page
 We designed this lower receiver out of necessity and a desire to have a true ambidextrous AR-15 \ M4 platform. Allowing it to accommodate any and all shooters without the need to add countless costly add-ons. Whether you are a right or left handed shooter, or forced to shoot with your off hand, the STT-15 has you covered! STT-15 is designed specifically for situations in which there's no room for error and you must use your rifle to take that shot!

We machine the STT-15 directly from a billet of 7075-T651 aerospace grade American aluminum on our brand new Haas CNC machinery. This allows us to hold ultra-tight tolerances and make sure that the final product is exactly as designed. The finished receiver is then finished in Mil-Spec, MIL-A-8625 Type III hard anodizing.

Even though this is a tool to some it is a show stopper to others! The final finish is every bit as important as the features and materials the lower consist of! The STT-15 is everything you have come to expect from a San Tan Tactical, and then some. The STT-15 is your final answer in the AR \ M4 firearms platform!"

The action also features a one-piece trigger guard for added strength. The stock has been customized with the addition of an ebony forend tip and red rubber recoil pad. The thick pad yields a long of pull measuring 14-1/8"". The barreled action features dual recoil lugs and these have been professionally glass bedded to the stock and the barrel is free floating.

The checkered walnut stock was refinished and is in very good condition...free of cracks, chips, or gouges...but does show a few light handling marks.

Second is my Remington 870, not quite sure the exact model, bought it out of box at Surplus Ammo in Tacoma, shoots great, has the two shot extension to make it 6+1, magpul forend with rails for flashlight/grips or whatever you want (I was bored and had the spare parts) has the magpul forward sling mount as well, and lastly it includes a tac star side shot shell carrier with it (holds 6 rounds). Only qualm I have with this is that the receiver is not per-drilled and tapped so has no rear sight, and only the standard bead front sight. Only has about 65 rounds through it.

If cash, looking at around $425 ea. individually or $800 for both combined, will take  trades of equal value per each gun or for both and or cash on my end depending on what you have to offer."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

This gun is like new fired once and priced at $750. Comes with 2 mags and factory case with papers. Interested in 1911's and 9mm handguns only. No rifles or other caliber handguns please.

The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy.
The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate.
Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting.
The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired.
The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters.
When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged.
Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel.

Average Dried Weight: 54 lbs/ft3 (855 kg/m3)

Specific Gravity (Basic, 12% MC): .76, .86

Janka Hardness: 2,760 lbf (12,280 N)

*Estimated crushing strength from data of green wood at: 5,810 lbf/in2 (40.1 MPa)

Shrinkage: Volumetric: 9.1%

Color/Appearance: Heartwood is golden to bright yellow, which inevitably ages to a darker medium brown with time: primarily due to exposure to ultraviolet light. See the article Preventing Color Changes in Exotic Woods for more details.

Grain/Texture: Grain is straight, with a fine to medium texture. High natural luster.

Endgrain: Ring-porous; large earlywood pores 2-3 pores wide, small latewood pores in clusters and tangential bands; tyloses extremely abundant; growth rings distinct; rays visible without lens; parenchyma vasicentric, aliform, and confluent.

Rot Resistance: Osage Orange is extremely durable and is considered to be one of the most decay resistant woods in North America.

Workability: Working this Osage Orange can be difficult due to its hardness and density, though it is reported to have little dulling effect on cutting edges. It turns well, and also takes stains, glues and finishes well.

Pricing/Availability: Having typically small, crooked, and knotty trunks, Osage Orange isn't usually harvested for lumber, but can occasionally be found for sale in either board or small turning block form. Due to its domesticity and adequate supply, the price should be moderate, though likely to be higher than most other native lumbers on account of its ""specialty"" status.

Sustainability: This wood species is not listed in the CITES Appendices or on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Common Uses: Fence posts, dye, archery bows, musical instruments, turnings, and other small specialty wood items."

""If you’re looking for a versatile carry pistol that is packed with features, has amazing capacity, and performs flawlessly, look no farther than the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact.

And you’ll be amazed at how fun it is to shoot.

When combined with the versatility of XD(M) Gear® X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazines, the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is ready for daily carry or a day on the range. Put in an X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazine, and you have a 19 round full-sized 9mm pistol. Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact.
