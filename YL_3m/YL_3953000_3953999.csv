The SIG SAUER P232 is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 Stainless is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 23oz in the stainless version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today.

Rare valuable collector’s piece: Handmade Indian knife with handmade buckskin leather sheath.  I got this knife approximately 20 years ago from a local Indian guy while working out on the Quileute Reservation in La Push. I am sure he was local to the West end of the Olympic Peninsula and think he was either Quileute or Makah. The man who sold it to me was in desperate need of money and it broke his heart to sell it. He told me he was given the knife by his father who got it from his father who he thought made it. It is clearly a hand forged steel knife with bone handle. Knife measures 15” overall. This knife comes with a hand made buckskin leather cross shoulder sheath with a dried hide insert. Bottom of knife handle engraved with knife makers initial PJK. I had this appraised on line several years ago at $600.00. It has been hanging collecting dust ever since. Should be with someone who will use and enjoy it. Asking $300.00"

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol. It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The Glock also had some custom work done to it, the original springs were changed out turning it from roughly 7lbs of trigger to 3.5lbs of trigger force. I chose the Ghost trigger for this change.  it also comes with the original that is in perfect workiing order, i simply prefer a softer trigger pull.  It is in great shape as I said before and I don't need to sell it, but want a change.  I have other sidearms, so I can afford to be fairly picky.

Description

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

Hey all,
	I have up for trade/sale a used but good condition Ipad Air 1st gen 16GB with Verizon 4G LTE  Data service. It is in good shape with normal wear a dent or two on the back. Nothing that makes it “too ugly” just what you would normally see after using one for a while. This would be a perfect way to replace your old broken one or simply get into the market for less than retail. This also will come with a factory wall charger, factory cable, and a set of unused EarPods. Also included is the original box and a red Smart Cover as well. 
	As far as trades are concerned, I would entertain certain offers on firearms, “maybe” partial trades of car audio set ups, and thats probably about it. Mainly looking for cash on this one. Need to be able to meet up around norman due to my schedule. Please shoot any questions or offers to REDACTED and we can go from there. 

Thanks for your time and have a good one!

The Buck Mark Standard URX is sleek. It might be ""standard"" for a Browning, but don't be fooled - it has more than enough features to separate it from the competition. the abmidextrous overmolded Ultragrip RX grips have finger grooves and a texture that will make sure you have a positive grip and excellent trigger control. The Pro-Target adjustable sights offer excellent accuracy. The slab sided barrel design with polished flats doesn't really accentuate the accuracy of the pistol - it just looks REALLY good.

It was ordered with the following upgrades.
Grade 3 wood instead of the grade two that came standard on Super Grades.
Winchester Custom Shop Island Express Safari Sights.
KICKEEZ recoil pad.
The wood has fantastic figure and color. Has very few minor handling marks. The bluing is mint except for one tiny rub on the floor plate. I know for a fact the rifle has been fired less than 50 times. The rifle comes with the dealer hanging tag as well as the owner manual.
Also with the rifle is a Browning model 1915 hand fitted safari case with both keys Browning instruction manual as well as the care card. The case was purchased from the same dealer in the early 70s. I have seen the cases for sale before but not one that is mint with both keys and literature that came with it when it was new. Also comes with a hand tooled Torel Cape Buffalo sling that was purchased at the same place along with the case. Also comes with one box of vintage Winchester Western ammo and one box of empty's. This is the nicest transition Super Grade you will ever see and the most complete one. Cash price is 1700 FIRM! Trade value is higher. Will only trade for items listed below.

The Millennium Pro pistols offer many improvements over the standard models, but were introduced as enhancements to the originals, not to supplant them. Pro counterparts have now been released for nearly all of the original models. Some features of the Pro line include optional increased magazine capacities, larger and easier to operate controls, a single-action/double-action trigger mechanism on some models with reduced trigger travel and an improved smoother and lighter trigger pull, an enhanced frame, and an improved more ergonometric grip design. Other Pro improvements include the contrast enhanced Heinie ‘Straight-8’ sighting system, as well as optional night sights, a loaded chamber indicator which can be felt as well as seen, and a feature labeled 'posi-traction' which consists of an alteration to the number and layout of the slide serrations resulting in an improved gripping surface.

Features a lightweight polymer frame, the Millennium Pro weighs in at only 22 ounces. The thin profile makes it easy to carry every day, and the ramped 3.2"" barrel is capable of great accuracy. The newly designed Millennium Pro may be the ideal concealed carry handgun. The Millennium Pro also showcases high-profile sight and an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges provide added comfort and easy concealment.

The Millennium Pro also features many intuitive safety devices. Complete with a loaded chamber indicator, manual safety, Taurus Internal Security System, and an automatic trigger safety.

Offered in .45 ACP only, the R200 has a stainless finish and comes standard with Hogue® rubber grips. The slide is manufactured from CNC machined bar stock with a low-cut ejection port, the frame is steel investment cast, and the barrel is hammer forged stainless steel—all manufactured to ISO 9001 and NATO AQAP 120 quality standards.

I was lucky enough to be able to procure a number of these guns which I will be listing for sale here and other sites, with a new one being featured as each one is sold.  There is a very limited number available, and the prices are very reasonable for custom built guns, and once they are gone, there will be no more. All of these Guns were graded at an A+ grade based on functionality, performance, durability, and fit & finish.  All of these guns have been test fired by the senior instructor for grading purposes (none of the guns have had more than 20 rounds through them). These guns will fire any type of ammo from the cheapest to the best quality, and they do not stall out no matter how fast you pull the trigger. I was amazed at the speed in which these guns fire being semi-auto's. As they were hand built. The triggers vary in pull weight (most around the 5 lb range), and all of them have very clean crisp let off with little to no creep. You must use caution when firing these weapons, because the triggers are so highly polished and set, they fire as soon as you touch the triggers, something most of us are not accustomed to. When I say no creep I really mean no creep.  

This listing is for a basic configuration camouflage AR-15 in 5.56 caliber (which allows you to also shoot the cheaper .223 rounds if you choose to).  Here is the list of parts utilized in building this gun by section. The upper is put together with a DPMS 7075-T6 Billet Upper, FN SS 1:7 Twist Barrel, Midwest Industries SSG12G2 Full Length Free Float Upper, Standard A2 Style Muzzle Brake, Ares 5.56 NiB Bolt, and BCM Stock Charging Handle. The Lower is put together with a Viper Open Trigger Guard 7075-T6 billet lower, and CMMG LPK, the pistol grip is a standard GI Pistol Grip. The Stock is assembled from a 6 position Blackhawk Parts Kit with a Heavy Duty Rubber Recoil Pad, the Fore Grip is a CAA FVG Folding 5 position lockable grip with storage, and the sights are flip-up machined aluminum style sights.  The additional pieces include the following: 1 QD Sling attachments with a Medium Duty Sling, 2 forward rails for these extras to be mounted on, 1 CAA Polymer 30 round magazine, and the gun is finished in Camouflage DuroCoat with a Matte Gloss UV Clear Coat Finish. This Gun comes fully assembled and packed nicely in a single gun case. 


You can purchase this prized AR-15 for the very reasonable price of $1639.54. The comparables of this gun are all well into the $1800.00 - $2000.00 range.  I am passing on my good fortune to you, but this price is firm, and I will not take trades.  This is a cash only private party sale (no checks, money orders or credit cards accepted).  This sale does not require and FFL. I may be willing to warranty parts for 90 days from date of purchase if you specify this as part of the sale, but will require the broken part (un-cleaned, as-is) to ensure no abuse which would void warranty (using low grade ammo or using .223 ammo also voids parts warranty) you will have to provide proof of caliber, type, lot# and manufacturer of ammo (plus one unused round) to invoke parts warranty.  I will perform powder analysis to ensure ammo stated is true.  All sales are final."

A few nicks and dings, nothing major. I have pictures of ""the worst"" of it: a small 1.5"" dent on the tank and a spot where a cover or bag melted on a lower part of the lower exhaust. Never laid down. In 2008 I purchased it used from a Honda dealership in Southern California, with around 2000 miles. I drove it approximately 9000 miles the two years following, and only a few thousand or so the last few years. I moved back to Wisconsin over a year ago. My commute is significantly shorter and I just don't drive it enough to justify keeping it. It works well for a single rider up to freeway speeds. With a passenger, it drives acceptably on highways, but is better for local rides.

If you're trading, I will accept multiple firearms. However, I won't add any cash, and I won't take less than $500 in addition to your trade. Keep in mind what this books at and what they sell for. I guess I have to spell it out in plain English too: I won't give you full MSRP value for your run of the mill firearm. I'm already below book on a plain bike with higher miles and no add-ons.

AR500 Armor® Urban Go Plate Carrier Package with Level III Body Armor - MSRP- $300.00 http://www.ar500armor.com/urban-go-plate-carrier-w-armor-and-pouches-black.html#.VLHHpVqtYZM The Urban Go Plate Carrier is the most cost effective complete and ready to go plate carrier package on the market that offers rifle threat protection. Our Urban Go package includes (2) AR500 Armor® Level III patent pending Advanced Shooters Cut 10” x 12” body armor plates. We put our survivalist mentality to work and came up with the essentials required for scenarios that require quick rifle threat protection, creating an armor system that is ready to go at a moment's notice. The Urban Go Carrier Package is ideal for home protection and emergency situations where rifle threat protection may be necessary. The open side design with a quick release buckles unfastened allows the Urban Go Plate Carrier to be quickly tossed over a single shoulder and worn over any existing gear or body armor. Front access shoulder mounted quick release buckles allow rapid removal compared to plate carriers that utilize a cummerbund. Fast into action, fast out of action. Due to a cummerbund-less design the Urban Go Carrier is not intended to be used with side body armor plates. We think everyone should be able to afford body armor and took that into consideration when building this package. In addition to being functional and effective, we aimed for high value and our Urban Go Plate Carrier package delivers.

With improved checkering of the synthetic stock and the new LC6 trigger, Ruger M77 Hawkeye rifles will surprise shooters with their performance improving features. In addition, these bolt action rifles contain a positive floor plate latch, integral scope mounts, a three position safety and hammer forged barrels. The Ruger M77 Hawkeye All Weather bolt action rifle features the LC6 trigger with a smooth, crisp performance right out-of-the-box for increased accuracy on the range or in the field. A non-rotating, Mauser type controlled round feed extractor is the most positive case extraction system ever invented, and features a fixed blade-type ejector that positively ejects the empty cases as the bolt is moved fully rearward.

A hinged solid steel floorplate for easy unloading without having to chamber each cartridge features an engraved Ruger logo and patented latch that is flush with the trigger guard to avoid accidental dumping of cartridges.

Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field
