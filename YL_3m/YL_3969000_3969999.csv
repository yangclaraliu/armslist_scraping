Face to face sale in Hampton Roads area.  Holster NOT included.

Some of the features include:

* Smoothed and rounded edges on the slide which helps with reholstering and defends against snagging.

* A loaded chamber indicator which shows you that there's a round in the chamber. 

* A fully adjustable for windage and elevation 3 dot sight system.

* A Glock like tigger Safe Action trigger safety.

* A manual thumb safety.

* An accessory rail (should you choose to add a flashlight and/or laser).

* An aggressively textured grips that aid in keeping the pistol in your hand.

* Restrike capability which allows you to pull the trigger a second time without the slide needed to be racked. This gives to option to attempt to fire a bullet for a second time if there was a light primer strike. 

* Has restrike capability. It normally operates as a conventional Single Action system e.g. every time the slide cycles it pre-cocks the firing pin. If an ammunition failure occurs and a misfire happens, the system automatically goes to a double action condition allowing you to fire again by pulling the trigger (double action), with no need to cycle the slide manually.

* Disassembly/reassembly is also extremely quick, easy, and does not require any tools or elbow grease. 

* 12 + 1 round capacity in a compact light 22 once frame. The PT111 G2 is a double stack magazine that's similar in sight and weighs only 3 more ounces than the M&P Shield, but gives you 4-5 extra rounds compared to the Shield. IMHO, excellent ergonomics are also excellent.

* Comes standard with magazine pinky extension which gives you a full 3 finger grip.

* Comes with a lifetime factory warranty.

The gun is 90% clean, lots of steel and wood. It's just made the old fashioned way. Lots of durable steel parts that feel solid and reliable.

Incredible design. John Moses Browning really outdid himself when he designed the Model 94. The mechanism is smooth and precise. The ergonomics are practically perfect. The action is strong and simply not prone to wearing out.

Solid lockup. The John Browning design was created to handle the newest type of ammunition in the world at the time: smokeless powder loads. And it is still handling them. The Model 94 has been chambered in some of the meanest calibers ever developed for fast action in brushy conditions.

It's a lifetime gun. Some rifles come and go, but a Model 94 just builds a lifetime of memories. It is one gun that your family will appreciate long after you are gone. It's a gun your great grandson will learn to shoot with. Timeless. That is why I have two of them!

Today's great barrels mean the 94 is more accurate than ever. And there are more bullet choices too. And factory ammo is a lot more affordable than some other calibers, making it something you can afford to shoot.

It has a very similar look and feel compared to the Sig P226 and also has the DA/SA action with decocker but comes with half the price tag of a P226.  This gun does lack some of the fine fit and finish you get with the sig but has proven to be 100 percent reliable and a great shooter. This pistol is in great shape and the frame has been stripped down and DuraCoated to give it a better looking more wear resistant finish. The form and function of this gun is hard to beat for the price. This gun is worth the 450 I am asking for and if you search Zastava EZ9 on YouTube you will see it is a great value.

Our introduction of +P 9X18 Makarov ammunition is the result of numerous customer requests. With no high quality +P ammunition available for the millions of Makarov pistols that are now in America, the American 9X18 pistol owner has no viable/effective self defense ammo for use in these high quality pistols, until now.
I am not a fan of using expanding bullets for self defense in smaller less powerful cartridges like the 9X18 or the 380 auto, as the expansion of these light weight smaller bullets often limits the penetration required to incapacitate the threat, but there are circumstances where the use of expanding ammo is an advantage. For more information on this subject, please read our ""technical article"" on ""The Use of Expanding Bullets in Small Defensive Cartridges"" posted under the ""Technical Articles"" category on our home page.
This new 95gr. JHP+P, 9X18 Mak loading, (Item # 34A) is roughly 200 fps faster than normal ball 95gr. Makarov ammo. This new +P load also features flash suppressed powder as roughly 95% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light, when the criminal element is active. This ammunition will not blind the shooter in low light situations, which is an important tactical advantage.
This ammo was reliable and quite accurate in our test guns. We noted no accelerated wear from the use of +P loads in our test pistols, although common sense suggests that any +P ammo will wear any pistol at a faster rate than weaker ammo. Please note the below real world velocities from our stock over-the-counter test guns

2.       1192 fps—CZ 82, 4 inch barrel"

No Height Added to EOTECH when mounted

Having a primary optic with the capability to be quickly attached and detached from a weapon system, while still maintaining ""on target"" repeatability, provides a degree of tactical flexibility highly valued in urban combat. The rugged EOTech holographic sights are excellent choices for a ""red dot"" optic. However up until now, adding some type of quick detach mechanism meant mounting the sight on some other mounting platform that raised the EOTech at least another 1/2"" above the bore. Besides adversely affecting cheek weld, mounting the EOTech in this manner no longer allowed the shooter to co-witness the EOTech sight with the back up iron sights of the weapon system.

The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome linedusing techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

These rifles are currently banned from import and becoming very scarce. Prices are likely to go nowhere but up. I am only asking what I have in it. The gun is unfired and like new in the box.

I've looked around and there are not many of these around at all. It takes down just like a 1911 and it has both a grip safety and thumb safety the gun will not fire if the mag is not in which is another safety feature. There is also railing/ribs on top of the slide. The barell is threaded so it can accept attachments and so forth. Sights are adjustable. It comes with 1 mag that holds 8.  The grips are made of a hard brown plastic with black streaks going through it, they look quite nice so I didnt have them replaced. Bluing is 95% and it was made in 1972 imported by stoeger. This gun is made of high quality pieces and guns made by Llama in the '60s-'70s were considered to be the best of Llama.  This would make a great carry pistol or a nice piece to a Spanish collection. It comes with 300 rounds of Remington Viper. Due to the fact these are hard to find the price is firm."

You can track blood and even see recent footprints from their heat signature.
I used this optic in Afghanistan as a tank commander two years ago with many effective results. However, I am selling some items that remind me of the war and this is included.
The optic uses four AA batteries, can fit inside a coat pocket, and is extremely effective when used in night shooting/hunting applications.

EOTech Model 557 AR223 BDC(300~600yds) Holographic Weapon Sight

The Holographic Weapon Sight is a revolutionary technology. These sights maximize the operator's peripheral vision, which guarantees faster target acquisition and gives the operator greater control in the engagement zone. The features built into EOTech holographic weapon sights provide a number of advantages:

- Maximum situational awareness from true heads-up display two eyes open shooting
- Variety of reticle patterns to meet your shooting needs with the smallest, most precise dot in the industry
- Rugged reliability and undetectable operation in any environment
- Reticle brightness adjustability to any environment and situation

The 557.AR223 reflex sight is a lightweight, non-magnifying, optical sight designed for
Close Quarter Battle. It allows very fast target acquisition and engagement at short range while providing aiming capability out to 300 meters equal to or better than iron sights. The sight can, however, be used in conjunction with an L-3 Eotech Optical Magnifier. When an Optical Magnifier is used, the effective range is extended to 600 meters.

Originally a French military percussion muzzleloading rifle-musket, M1857, converted to breechloading rifle in 1867 with the ""Tabatiere"" system (similar to Snider) then bore reamed out to smoothbore and halfstocked and sold surplus on the African trade. Weapon has an overall length of 42"" and barrel length 24""

These were sold mainly to natives in East Africa in order to harass the British. The French conversion closely resembled the Snider action. This particular gun is in Fair to Good condition with a light brown patina and one chip in front stock. Action works but the return firing pin spring is broken so you will have to manually pull it back to open the action. Antique.

I am not interested in any other models like the 770, 783, etc.  I am willing to pay a fair cash price given the condition and features of the rifle.  I do not waste anyone's time with low-balling or fishing for a deal.  Traveling anywhere near Tallahassee is no problem, and work takes me to the Jax and Orlando areas pretty regularly.  I have a FL driver's license and concealed weapons permit, and ask that the seller show a FL driver's license at the time of the sale.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

We bought this revolver new a few months back from Bass Pro in Grapevine. Originally purchased as a Concealed Carry option for my girlfriend, but she just isnt comfortable with the recoil. Bit too lite, and a bit too powerful. Its a fantastic little carry piece though. No exposed hammer and the sights are milled into the top of the frame... absolutly NOTHING to catch on clothes or purse as you draw. Its super smooth to go in and out of pockets. 

 It has had about 50 rounds through it, and all of them were the low recoil variety of 38 (the trigger is super smooth and the wheel locks up well). No scratches, no scuffs, cleaned oiled and put in the safe. Looking to cear up some room.

This rifle is bolt action and is chambered in .30-06. Part of the barrel is bare metal due to the original metal stock sleeve being removed for the purpose of sporterizing the firearm and making it lighter. This rifle has good bore grooves and the crown has a few pit marks from rust damage so accuracy may be an issue while firing this rifle. The stock is original it was just shortened for the sport configuration and has been engraved with an outline of an elk or dear jumping over branches on the ground through the forest. Under the butt stock Agate stone has been attached to the rear sling mount cut out and a piece of aluminum has been attached to the underside of the pistol grip. The trigger has a nice pull and is smooth and precise. This is an excellent addition to any gun collection. This is a high number rifle with the partial serial number of 3172xxx. This is a previously owned firearm, we are not the original owner(s) and we do not know the full history of this firearm.

Will add 100 rounds of CCI ammo if bought at price listed.

This rifle is bolt action and is chambered in .30-06. Part of the barrel is bare metal due to the original metal stock sleeve being removed for the purpose of sporterizing the firearm and making it lighter. This rifle has good bore grooves and the crown has a few pit marks from rust damage so accuracy may be an issue while firing this rifle. The stock is original it was just shortened for the sport configuration and has been engraved with an outline of an elk or dear jumping over branches on the ground through the forest. Under the butt stock Agate stone has been attached to the rear sling mount cut out and a piece of aluminum has been attached to the underside of the pistol grip. The trigger has a nice pull and is smooth and precise. This is an excellent addition to any gun collection. This is a high number rifle with the partial serial number of 3172xxx. This is a previously owned firearm, we are not the original owner(s) and we do not know the full history of this firearm.

Pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. Feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. Lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. Cross bolt style safety. Pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. Includes an under Picatinny rail and top Picatinny sight rail. Sling loops are built in and a basic sling is included. Soft rubber butt pad. Weighs 6.9 pounds with a 26.1 inch overall length. This bullpup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition. The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG.

This rifle could possibly be what is considered a ""Last Ditch"" rifle. The bore is scribed lightly and has a higher twist rate than the normal 1 in 9.75"" that regular Arisakas rifles have. This leads me to believe that this particular rifle is a true last ditch rifle that was made from the smooth bore training rifles. THIS FIREARM COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS TO FIRE AND SHOULD BE INSPECTED BY A CERTIFIED GUNSMITH BEFORE IT IS USED. The Stock is in great condition and comes with a rubber butt-pad. The barrel has almost worn off bluing and the crown had a really bad hack job done to it. There are no Japanese markings on this rifle. This rifle also comes with a valor 25x32 scope and mounts. This is a previously owned firearm, we are not the original owner(s) and we do not know the full history of this firearm.

-Titanium
-15.9oz 
-9” long
-Muzzle Brake Mount
-Precision/Long Range Rifle Use
-Includes Muzzle Brake
-Lifetime Warranty

""The model 30BA is the brake-attached version of our flagship long-range precision rifle suppressor. It offers best-in-class sound suppression levels in a very light weight format, and is built with accuracy as its first priority. The 30BA is designed to mount over our muzzle brake. It is particularly suited to applications where the rifle will be shot suppressed and unsuppressed, and a brake is desired when shooting without the suppressor.

We developed the 30BA and 338BA to meet the requirement that some customers have for a suppressor that mounts over a muzzle device. We haven't found a ""quick mount"" on the market that meets our accuracy and repeatability requirements, so we developed the BA series to mount over our brake and provide the same repeatability as our direct thread attach suppressors, like the 30P-1. The 30BA features a conical shoulder for rock solid POI repeatability and to make sure it never comes loose.

The 30BA was designed around .308 for maximum flexibility and is rated up to .300 Winchester Magnum, but it's the ideal suppressor for the most competitive mid-sized cartridges for long-range shooting such as .243 Winchester .260 Remington, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5x47 Lapua, 6.5-284 Norma, and 7mm Remington Magnum & WSM.

The 30BA uses the baffle stack of the 30P-1, which has racked up impressive results at long-range field shooting events in the Rocky Mountain region, including the Blue Steel Ranch Steel Safari and the NRA Whittington Center Sporting Rifle Match. Many long-range shooters prefer shooting suppressed because the muzzle blast and concussion is eliminated, while the recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed out over time. The net result is that the rifle is easier to shoot and it's easier to make hits. Communication with your spotter is easier because the need for hearing protection is reduced.

The 30BA is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded baffle core. This material and construction provides a great strength to weight ratio. It can take whatever your precision rifle can dish out.

The 30BA brake will accept the 338BA suppressor, so with a .30 caliber brake on your .308 and a .338 brake on your .338 Lapua Magnum, you can use a single 338BA suppressor on both. The 30BA suppressor will not fit on a 338BA brake.

The 30BA is ideal for: long-range practical competition shooters; varminters; predator hunters; precision tactical shooters.
