I have a Burgo .22 revolver, it fires .22 short. It has a timing issue, which means that the cylinder doesn't always rotate. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. It seems to cycle better on single-action, but it functions as both.

Equipped with the GripZone™, the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone™: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone™, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone™ doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone™ advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact.

This comes with the attached folding bayonet. This specimen is in fantastic condition and I would guess it was unissued. The bluing is deep and rich, all metal is perfect, and the bore is bright and mirror shiny. The crown is excellent and still retains all bluing. Obviously, it is not counter-bored. The numbers on the butt plate, barrel, magazine, and bolt are all matching. 

The wood stock is in perfect condition, no dents, bumps, scrapes, cracks, or gouges. I DID refinish the wood myself, however. The original lacquer job was in such poor condition, it was flaking off everywhere and getting into the action. If the stock shows minor flaking, I generally don't touch it, but in the condition it was in, it could have compromised the function of the gun. It is beautifully refinished in a warm honey walnut and looks amazing.

The rifle alone is $275...$300 includes the accessories noted below:
An original tool kit (with small canvas tool kit pouch), authentic WWII era ammo pouch and sling.

I acquired the pistol in a trade and i am looking to help fund a new rifle for next hunting season. Pistol is in great condition,it appears to have a very low round count from the original owner and no holster wear at all. I myself have put a box of rounds through it and it preformed flawlessly, the ported barrel makes it very controllable.

Will trade for a decent hunting rifle in .308, .270 or 30-06 willing to add some cash on my end, or S&W Shield 9mm for my wife.

Pistol also comes with the original non-ported barrel and steel guide rod.

The bore is excellent with no import mark on the barrel and the stock has not been cut. Still has most of the finish except for the butt plate.

The Alaskan combines tradition with modern technology creating one of the fastest handling 1892 Lever Action Rifles designed specifically for the hunting market. A take-down rifle chambered in caliber .44RM or .357 Mag, and featuring the time-proven 1892 action, the Alaskan delivers serious knock-down power when using Hornady Lever evolution ammunition which the action is specifically tuned for. The sights are Skinner Express style while the barrel is drilled and tapped for ""Scout Mount"" optics and Weaver scope mounts like 416M. The stock and forend are made of wood with overmolded rubber ""soft touch"" finish, the comfortable butt stock is made of anti-shock rubber. Distributed exclusively by Taylor's Tactical.

This rifle has seen a decent amount of (non-military) use and a number of rail sections/corners have had their black worn down to metal (especially the scope), and there are of course scratches here or there, but it functions wonderfully (never had a misfire or other failure, regardless of ammo and/or other conditions) and is fully broken in. See below for details on the rifle build.

Since Armslist only gives me 3 pics, here's a link to a Flickr album that contains a bunch of different ones covering all aspects of this rifle. (Sorry that my phone's camera sucks, but I don't even know anyone who owns a real camera anymore...)

Album: https://www.flickr.com/photos/90749279@N05/sets/REDACTED3666115/

Here's the primary parts/accessories the rifle comes with:

* POF-USA P415 .223/5.56mm upper with a POF-12SX rail system (older style; circular with horizontal cooling vents, and the rear half is covered in a textured coating that works well with gloves. Although it probably didn't need it, I also polished the bore.)
* Aero Precision Lower with DPMS LPK (personally hand-built; I picked out the best-looking pieces from 3 different parts kits for the internals. Billet aluminum in mil-spec tolerances, trigger is single-stage and standard weight but crisp and works great with the Slidefire stock)
* Slidefire SSAR-15 bump-fire stock (it took me all of 1 mag to gain full control of this, thanks to the slightly extra felt-recoil of the POF piston system. Very controllable and fun as hell to use.)
* Leupold Mark 4 CQ/T 1x-3x illuminated scope with A.R.M.S. throw-lever rail mount and Leupold scope covers (As noted above the scope's rails are pretty worn, but the optic itself holds its zero, functions flawlessly and is currently sighted in to provide the best ""averaged"" zero for a variety of different loads.)
* Troy Industries Folding Battle Sights (front and back, M4 style)
* MagPul B.A.D. Lever
* Grip Pod (Military style, with the metal leg inserts. Comes complete with some dirt from the Middle East.)
* Mil-spec buffer tube with H2 buffer (I'm pretty sure I used a H2, although I'm not 100% positive) and left-side single point sling attachment

Unless you don't want them for some reason, I'm also throwing in 2 C-Products military-spec 30-round mags for free, plus 135 hand-loaded, mil-spec 75-grain HPBT bullets loaded in Lake City Brass with other quality components (including Bench Rest primers), specifically pressure-tested, head-spaced and blah-blah hand-loading-jargon specifically for this rifle.

Although the $3100 price is pretty firm, I'm looking to put together an AR pistol with the proceeds so I've got a list of items that I'd be willing to for trade value (see below). I'm willing to do FtF, ship to your FFL, payment via various methods, etc. It's a big investment so I'll work with you to make the transaction as easy as possible for you."

First off, this is O.B.O. And I have more photos per request.

I'd like to sell my Beretta 92a1. Apparently I've been needing something that fits my hand a bit better. Sorry people, local sale only...I'm not interested in shipping it. Also be prepared to show I.D. and sign two copies of a private bill of sale, one for my records one for yours. 

I've taken great care of this thing without neglect, however some minor nicks and scratches are a likely to happen during daily carry.

I've got a few things that will go with it as a kind of 'package deal' because they are mostly make/model specific and I would have no use for them without the host firearm to compliment.

The list:
-Kydex holster with snap release made locally by Mike from Accelerated Solutions (tan)
-Kydex inner waist belt double mag pouch also made locally by Mike (blk painted O.D.)
-The original grips (Hogue finger groove grip currently installed)
-Safariland universal flex drop adapter (tan)
-Safariland single leg strap leg shroud (tan)
-Three (3) factory magazines (17 rnd)
-A Walther handgun case (because the one that came with it is shit)
-And I'll even throw in all three mags full of Rem. UMC.

Also includes a Limbsaver recoil absorber and swivel bipod. 
Sighted in dead on at 200 yards and ready to hunt. 
Prefer local pickup, but will ship in the continental US for $40, and $65 to Alaska or Hawaii."

******************BUSHMASTER Patrolman AR15 Rifle Specifics:*********************

Patrolman AR15 M4 Carbine, .223/5.56 16"" W/Detachable Carry Handle, Telescoping Stock, Black Finish 30 Round Mag
Chrome lined barrel and chamber. Features A2 bird cage style suppressor. A3 type removable carry handle features 1 MOA elevation and 1/2 MOA windage adjustments. Picatinny type rail base. Flat-top upper receiver. Non-reflective mil spec hard anodized aluminum receiver. Six-position telestock. Shipped with 30 round magazine, carrying sling, chamber flag and operator's manual.

One of our ALL TIME BEST Carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive Military Barrel Profile and Six Position Telestock – great for 3 Gun Match Shooting, Home Defense and Law Enforcement use.

The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel).

The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. 

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling. 

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. 

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs. 

You must be of legal age and a Washington resident. I will only meet locally here in the Lacey area for transaction and you must have $1,100 cash only.

Thank you and have a wonderful day !!!"

The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 3.8” Full Size is the perfect pistol for those who want full-size performance in a slightly shorter package.

The XD(M)® 3.8″ Full Size mates a 3.8″ barrel with a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and capacity you’d expect from a standard sized pistol, but with a shorter top end for easier carry. The XD(M)® is packed with features. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision.

Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. See what you’re missing and pick up an XD(M)® 3.8” Full-size. It redefines what a polymer pistol can be.
