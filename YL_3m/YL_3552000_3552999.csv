It is not a safe queen but a honest late 1970's gun. Bore is excellent and action is tight and right. The action is very smooth in fact it greatly resembles the 1911 but it runs smoother than any 1911 I've ever fired.  There is some honest carry wear and some light pitting on the slide but not bad. Please see the pictures. Grips are in excellent shape and all markings are clear. The pictures don't do justice to this pistol it really looks better in person. Included is a nice leather shoulder holster with double mag holder ($50 at least). Gun comes with one 9 round mag. The gun is almost identical to the 1911 except for the lack of a grip safety but it does have a magazine safety and halfcock safety. One other feature that is really nice is it has a take down lever on the right side which makes it much easier to field strip the gun. I used this for my work truck glove box gun for a while but I'm not really a 9mm guy I prefer a .45 so Have bought a 1911 and now am selling this one. I live in Waukesha and am not interested in traveling to meet. I require to see a ccw permit and picture ID."

Beyond being an absolute tack driver, this particular rifle is a piece of American history.  It was manufactured in 1966 - the same year the USMC adopted the Model 700 as the M40 sniper rifle.  The accuracy of this rifle impressed the Marines; it will not disappoint you!

Like the original M40, this rifle is equipped with Weaver rings and a Redfield ""Golden Five Star"" 3-9x variable scope.   I purchased this rifle with the scope from the original owner.  I do not know if he was trying to duplicate the Marine rifle or if he simply purchased the best available on the market at the time.  The scope and the rifle are both old, but the years have not diminished their quality one bit.  It is an excellent optic on top of an excellent rifle.

Included in the sale is a slip-on LimbSaver recoil pad (the original metal buttplate gets punishing after a few rounds at the range), a Remington sling strap, a padded rifle case and about 150 rounds of .243 WIN ammunition - mostly 100gr. with 2 boxes of 80gr. too.

I am willing to travel to central Illinois or Wisconsin in order to complete the sale.  Illinois residents must supply an FOID prior to the exchange. CASH ONLY, no checks.  Exchanges will only be made in a public place, no residences."

382,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3552382,"For Sale:  Remington 870 Express Parkerized 18.5"" HD Barrel - now with pics -SOLD","Greene County, Dayton, Ohio",$ 100,"Listed On: Monday, September 29, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"18.5"" HD Barrel for Remington 870 Express.  

UPDATE - I learned how to get decent pics, at least of the external of the barrel.  The picture of the inside of the barrel is a bit fuzzy but the light reflection is a pretty accurate reflection of how clean & shiny (very) it is inside.

Very lightly used (from what I recall the use consists of being put on the gun).  I bought the shotgun, tested it out, then bought the HD barrel a year or two later and put it on the shotgun, then put it in a safe place.  To my recollection there have been zero rounds through this barrel - all of the testing rounds went through the 28"" barrel that came with the shotgun.  The barrel is a fixed cylinder.  

The price is fair; bought new this barrel would be about $110 at Bud's plus shipping (about $10) and tax (if you pay use tax in your state).  Further, I'm in no situation that requires me to unduly discount this item.  If you are aware of a similar barrel in this condition for a lower price please do feel free to purchase that one.

I am willing to meet if it is somewhere in my normal transit about the Greene County or Dayton area.  

I will ship if pre-paid via US Postal Money Order for an amount including the purchase price and shipping price.  

Not interested in trades.  

Thanks much for your interest and have a great day."

Beyond being an absolute tack driver, this particular rifle is a piece of American history. It was manufactured in 1966 - the same year the USMC adopted the Model 700 as the M40 sniper rifle. The accuracy of this rifle impressed the Marines; it will not disappoint you!

Like the original M40, this rifle is equipped with Weaver rings and a Redfield ""Golden Five Star"" 3-9x variable scope. I purchased this rifle with the scope from the original owner. I do not know if he was trying to duplicate the Marine rifle or if he simply purchased the best available on the market at the time. The scope and the rifle are both old, but the years have not diminished their quality one bit. It is an excellent optic on top of an excellent rifle.

Included in the sale is a slip-on LimbSaver recoil pad (the original metal buttplate gets punishing after a few rounds at the range), a Remington sling strap, a padded rifle case and about 150 rounds of .243 WIN ammunition - mostly 100gr. with 2 boxes of 80gr. too.

I am willing to travel to central Illinois or Wisconsin in order to complete the sale. Illinois residents must supply an FOID prior to the exchange. CASH ONLY, no checks. Exchanges will only be made in a public place, no residences."

Are you looking to build an SBR? Maybe you're purchasing your first suppressor? A gun trust offers you a great deal of convenience when you own these items.

Hanna Law, P.C. is a different kind of law firm, specializing in firearms trusts. We do not operate on a normal business week schedule, but can accommodate your needs on your schedule. We are available during the day and in the evening as well as weekends.

We understand that buying an NFA item can be a lengthy process, so we strive to offer great service with a short turnaround.

We offer two levels of trust:
Basic Gun Trust $225 - fast and easy, convenient for those who do not wish to speak at great lengths with the attorney. If you e-mail your info and give us a call, everything can be handled in person very quickly. Notary services provided at time of delivery.

Comprehensive Gun Trust $500 - Also fast, however, the attorney will meet with you and discuss all the provisions of the trust. If you do not like specific provisions, need clarification on certain provisions, or would like to add or remove provisions, this is the level for you. Generally it takes 1.5-2 hours of face time with the attorney to go over the entire document. Notary services provided during meeting. This is a good option for those who are unfamiliar with firearms trusts, and demand extensive clarification. Some people are a bit nervous when starting their NFA item collection, and face-time with an informed attorney can put some of these concerns to rest.

For various reasons, you may wish to also put your Title I (regular) firearms into your trust as well. We also offer this service.

We wish you the best on your journey into the land of SBR's, AOW's, SBS's, and suppressors. They can be great home defense weapons, and sure are a whole lot of fun to shoot at the range. We hope to hear from you soon. Feel free to call at 720-568-0564. Leave us a voicemail with your number and a good time to return your call, and we will get back to you promptly. You can also e-mail us at info@hannalawpc.com."

Scope is bright, clear, mil dots look sharp, its clear all the way up to 16 power and the focus ring makes the image crisp. Its a great scope but its a little too much scope for my gun and its a touch on the heavy side. On some guns that doesn't matter but wanted a lighter carbine optic... I went with a red dot instead. Cosmetically perfect, illumination works great, standard red and green. This scope gets great marks and usually sells for $80-$100 online. Asking $60 for all and that includes the $15 rings that don't come with the scope so all in all its a pretty great deal if you're looking for a mid range optic for your rifle.

Are you looking to build an SBR?  Maybe you're purchasing your first suppressor?  A gun trust offers you a great deal of convenience when you own these items.

Hanna Law, P.C. is a different kind of law firm, specializing in firearms trusts.  We do not operate on a normal business week schedule, but can accommodate your needs on your schedule.  We are available during the day and in the evening as well as weekends.

We understand that buying an NFA item can be a lengthy process, so we strive to offer great service with a short turnaround.

We offer two levels of trust:
Basic Gun Trust $225 - fast and easy, convenient for those who do not wish to speak at great lengths with the attorney.  If you e-mail your info and give us a call, everything can be handled in person very quickly.  Notary services provided at time of delivery.

Comprehensive Gun Trust $500 - Also fast, however, the attorney will meet with you and discuss all the provisions of the trust.  If you do not like specific provisions, need clarification on certain provisions, or would like to add or remove provisions, this is the level for you.  Generally it takes 1.5-2 hours of face time with the attorney to go over the entire document.  Notary services provided during meeting.  This is a good option for those who are unfamiliar with firearms trusts, and demand extensive clarification.  Some people are a bit nervous when starting their NFA item collection, and face-time with an informed attorney can put some of these concerns to rest.

For various reasons, you may wish to also put your Title I (regular) firearms into your trust as well.  We also offer this service.

We wish you the best on your journey into the land of SBR's, AOW's, SBS's, and suppressors.  They can be great home defense weapons, and sure are a whole lot of fun to shoot at the range.  We hope to hear from you soon.  Feel free to call at 720-568-0564.  Leave us a voicemail with your number and a good time to return your call, and we will get back to you promptly.

Manufacturer: Dan Wesson (CZ-USA)
Model: 715
Caliber: .357 Magnum/.38 Special
Capacity: 6 Round Cylinder
Barrel: 6"" Heavy with Ventilated Rib
These are NEW for 2014 limited run, Pre-Production 715 revolvers from Dan Wesson

Returning to regular production late summer 2014, the 715 is as it was before -- designed and built to be the most accurate, rugged and versatile revolver on the market. Shipped with a 6"" barrel, the new shroud is designated the HV6, a heavy vent shroud profile that tames the .357's recoil very well.
The double action trigger is short and relatively light, while the single action is light and crisp. The target-like SA trigger pull made the Dan Wesson revolver a favorite among competitors and hunters, and the tradition continues in the 715.
Barrel assemblies and grips are easily swapped by the shooter, and the 715 accepts grips and barrel/shroud assemblies from 15-2 model and newer revolvers. Ready To Ship."

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...). You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. Taurus also makes a small caliber tip barrel design, but has a much heavier trigger (due to being double action). The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $165 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven."

The biggest difference between the Halo 5 series and the previous models is the size. At almost 11"" the Halo V is a big knife with a big blade. In addition to being long, the blade is thick and sturdy. To ensure the best blade/handle ratio the tips on these knives come right up to the top of the handle, so don't drag your finger across the blade's exit point! The action on these is fast, they hit hard, and the lock-up is excellent.

This Halo V knife has a DLC black finished Elmax steel tanto blade with a plain edge. The 6061-T6 aluminum frame and charging handle are black anodized and the hardware is bead blasted. Includes a molded black sheath with belt attachment system."

Great old commie gun. #matching, and 1954 vintage. Bore looks new. I've had this gun for years. 99% of the rounds are surplus, with a few S&B thrown in. I will include 32 additional questionable rounds for free. The questionable rounds were accidentally left in the garage for a few years, and include stripper clips. The 370 rounds have been stored well. It shoots great. Very accurate and powerful gun. A Real bushwhacker. Rounds give deeper penetration than a 357 Magnum. Penetrates some older model armored vests. I'm not sure if I have the cleaning rod. I always used a bore-snake, and religiously cleaned immediately after shooting. The ammo box isn't included. Reduced to $290.00 for the gun and $170 for the ammo. Take the whole package for $450.00. Private sale which must take place at my Palm Harbor office.
