DANIEL DEFENSE AIMPOINT MICRO SIGHT MOUNT LOWER 1/3 PICATINNY-STYLE
The Daniel Defense Aimpoint Micro Mount is designed to work in conjunction with Aimpoint's popular Micro R-1, H-1, or T-1 optics. This mount is designed to attach directly to your flattop upper receiver. Its lightweight, essentials only design offers a snag-free, low-profile, reversible mounting option for shooters that do not require or desire a quick attach/detach mount. The mount features a recoil lug that minimizes sheer forces on the factory mounting screws. The Aimpoint Micro Mount features the Rock & Lock Clamp attachment system and secures to any MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny Rail with two slotted machine screws. These fasteners thread into stainless steel self-locking threaded inserts that resist vibration and loosening. Offering a lower 1/3rd co-witness with your back up iron sights, this mount is ideal for shooters who are looking for the lightest mount to accent their Aimpoint Micro while still maintaing the ability to utilize fixed or folding backup iron sights through the optic. This mount is constructed from 6061 aircraft grade aluminum and Military Specification Hard Coat Anodized."

Take off the stock and the true ""mini"" is in incredible shape. The last two pics show the internal front and back of the chamber and I couldn't get my camera to take a decent pic of the inside of the barrel but it is bright, shiny and the rifling is great. The gun shoots perfectly. The action is smooth and crisp. The magazine go in tight and crisp and snaps right into place, where I've had other minis that you fought with the darn thing to get it in there.

The barrel and top of the gun are very very clean and the only blemishes on the thing are a couple nicks on the suppressor and the stock has use marks.

This would be a perfect gun to throw an optic on and use as it is or to take off the stock and rails, sell them, and build whatever you want. I'd put a tactical folding stock on it from tapco or some other brand and just use a regular scope mount with a 3-9x30 myself. Or one could just put a nice red dot on the upper rail of this setup and go.

Anyhow, I hope this better explains the gun. I wish I had the original stock for it, but I don't. The nice thing about these mini's is that there are hundreds of cheap things that can be done to customize them on ebay, amazon and all over. Or if someone wanted a cheap really light mini, take off the rails in about 5 minutes and use the peep sights and go spray some lead at the coyotes.

$500 and thanks for looking.

It is an L framed 6-shot revolver with the full lug. This is a rare 6"" Nickel model. Gun is beautiful as the pictures show. Fired very little and had been a safe queen for quite some time. Barely noticable turn-line and it looks as good or better in person as it does in the pictures. I'm including two other sets of grips: hogue monogrip rubber and some jordan pachmayer's that are cracked and can be thrown away or used for whatever.

I forgot, also has a very nice Galco leather holster with the soft suede lining so as not to scratch nickel or blued guns.

Perfect lockup, trigger action and timing. This model was made in 1987 according to the serial numbers. SandW ceased production of nickel 586's in 1991.  I have a brand new 629 Classic that doesn't have as smooth as butter feel in the hand and action as this gun.

Sorry no box. The only flaw I could find was a nick smaller than a childs pinky fingernail clipping right where the yolk closes.  Right on the edge and so difficult to see that I never did until my son noticed it. Nickel is bright and perfect with no stress cracks or fading. 

Text/call (515) six64-5978 with questions or for more detailed pics of the cylinder, chamber, etc, as I have plenty.

Thanks.

The mark on the pic of the right side close to the grip is just a glare/shadow. Not a flaw."

It is an L framed 6-shot revolver with the full lug. This is a rare 6"" Nickel model. Gun is beautiful as the pictures show. Fired very little and had been a safe queen for quite some time. Barely noticable turn-line and it looks as good or better in person as it does in the pictures.

Comes with nice Galco holster that has the soft suede inside so as not to scuff the revolver if one should choose to use it. Of course, shoots .38 Specials as well.

Perfect lockup, trigger action and timing. This model was made in 1987 according to the serial numbers. SandW ceased production of nickel 586's in 1991.

 $800/reasonable offers considered. I searched all over the net for a Nickel 586 6"" and could find one decent one for sale, a couple sold in the past, and a few 4"" 586's.

The Improved Rain Suit (IRS) is a parka and trousers set that form a waterproof outer shell, worn over other clothing and gear. It is patterned to match camouflaged field uniforms, similar to ECWCS or APECS, but is lighter in weight. IRS functions strictly as a rain barrier, offering little protection from cold even with its button-in liner. In rain, it holds up better than Gore-tex according to Soldier's feedback.

Parka/Jacket of the Improved Rain Suit has a roll-up hood with a visor and drawstring closure. There are armpit zippers for ventilation, a heavy duty full-length zipper in front covered by a storm flap that closes with snaps. The pockets are pass throughs to inner garments. The elbows are reinforced and Velcro closures at the cuffs make a tight fit.
Trousers have a draw-string at the waist, a center zipper, pass through pockets, Velcro closures at the ankles, and long leg zippers for easy on-off. The seat and knees are reinforced.

The Parka, Improved Rain Suit replaces the Parka, Wet Weather, Lightweight and the Trousers, Improved Rainsuit replace the Trousers, Wet Weather, Lightweight. The Improved Rainsuit is less bulky and better fitting than the parka/trousers it replaces.

This ""Stretch-to-fit"" Grip Glove is custom molded for the Ruger SR9/SR40. This makes them ideal for the popular polymer frame handguns which have no replacement grips available. In addition, Pachmayr Decelerator material delivers proven recoil reduction and enhanced control that no other slip-on can match. They also have the right shape and flexibility to make installation ""a snap"" - no trimming, tearing or hard work - just a perfect fit. Finally, the distinctive ventilated side panels and finger grooves provide more instinctive gun orientation, enhanced control and they look more professional than the old, one-size-fits-all rubber band models. Tactical Grip Gloves are the only ones that ""fit like a glove""."

200-250 rounds fired - Made reliable for Carry by Bersa gunsmith

This firearm has been inspected and modified by one of the top Bersa authorized gunsmiths in the country.  Thunders can develop a problem where the gun will not shoot -- not something to have happen if your using this firearm as a conceal weapon.  This gun has been worked on by the Bersa gunsmith in Colorado and I would not have any problem carrying it as a primary conceal or backup gun.

Review on Youtube: http://youtu.be/vtD5MPAVan4

I am the original owner of this pistol and used it for two years as my small option conceal carry. There are not a lot of rounds through this firearm (maybe 200-400max), however it has minor wear due to being carried.  It comes with one extra Bersa magazine a OWB Houston paddle holster which shows internal wear from the gun going in and out each day when it was carried.  The gun went to Bersa for service and checkup earlier this year and a spring was replaced, so it is good to go. 

I am selling it (and several other items) for cash funds in order to fund an other build. 

Price is firm, no trades. Thanks.

The P220 Combat with threaded barrel is designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards. The P220 Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the threaded barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Outfitted with a true M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights.

It is in excellent condition and functions perfectly.  There is no wear anywhere on the pistol or any blemishes that I can find.  The night sights do glow but are not as bright as new, of course.  I managed to accumulate seven magazines for this rare pistol which will be included unless we agree otherwise.  I personally have fired about ten magazines through this pistol and it is easy to shoot, as 10mm goes.  It is an all steel, full size pistol and can absorb the recoil of the powerful 10mm with no problem.  

The gun will come with a standard Flambeau hard case (not original to the gun) and seven magazines.  It will also come with the stock plastic grips in addition to the Hogue grips shown in the pictures.  I do not have the original box or paperwork as I am the second owner and the original owner could not locate the box. 

The 1006, especially in this condition, is a fairly rare pistol so please do your homework before making offers as if it is any run of the mill Glock or XD.  I would prefer just cash, $1,100 which would include all magazines.  We could trade for a combination of cash and firearms but only if the combination you offer is in my list of wants and is fair."

This gun is in excellent condition and comes in the original box with papers. The cleaning rod is still unopened. This is a .22 caliber double action and holds 5 rounds in the magazine. It was made around 1969. Robert De Niro used one of these guns in the movie Taxi Driver. He made a slide attachement that was in his sleeve to conceal it. I was told these were also used by the Navy Seals as a back up gun. The bluing is near mint except for one small spot near the barrel tip ( looks like it was dropped) but could be touched up easily. It looks like this gun fired very little if at all. This is a great concealment pocket gun or just a rare collectable. I do not ship so this is for local pick up in the Mckinney area.
