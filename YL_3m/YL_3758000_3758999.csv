The barrel is a nitride barrel, which allow for maximum accuracy out of your barrel while keeping your barrel safe from corrosion. These things run great with any ammo, because you can adjust the gas pressure depending on what ammo you are using. great for adding a suppressor. I will throw in a Primary Arms optic and a magpul AFG and pistol grip. The pistol grip matches the color of the upper. $1200

I'm sure your questions will be answered if you read through, if not, by all means drop me a line.


For sale I have a complete AK-74 package.

Rifle shoots excellent and functions flawlessly (as AK's are known to do) The only reason I'm selling is I'm looking to get a M1A and I already have a Couple of AR's that will fill the same role as this rifle.

Breakdown of whats included.

AK-74 built by Waffen Werks purchased last year and has 180 rounds through it. 

These high quality AK-74 rifles are built from all matching Bulgarian AK-74 parts sets. Rifles are built to exacting standards on a new U.S. made Waffen Werks receiver. Each rifle features a brand new chrome lined U.S. made barrel properly chambered for the 5.45x39 round. They have been extremely accurate.

Rifle features a Tapco G-2 trigger set and a U.S. grip and is fully 922r compliant with all AK-74 mags regardless of country of origin. Rifles also incorporate a side rail for easy installation of scope rails or accessories. 

New $619. 

AK-74 Accessory package, 4 30rnd parts kits, mag pouch, bayonet and oil bottle. $169

2 Tapco 30rnd parts kits $24

900rnds 7n6 ""banned"" ammo. Full case $240 Since its a partial case I'll value it at $200

AK ergo grip, so you can actually hold the rifle. $20

Kvar O.D. green ""NATO"" length stock, A inch longer to fit us decadent capitalist pigs in the West. I have both the original stock and grip that will go with it. $47

""Venezuelan"" PK-A red dot. A excellent red dot that was built for the Venuzualian Army by the Russians. The great thing about this particular sight it that it uses a regular AA battery and it sits low enough to co-witness the stock AK sights. It also allows a proper cheek weld on the rifle a huge plus. $400

Total price if bought separate $1479

My price $1300. Non negotiable! No Trades unless your looking to trade a M1A Loaded with a stainless barrel.

I will not break up the package it's all or nothing, sorry I just don't want to deal with all the hassle. I'm in no hurry to sell, I really have no need to sell just trying to diversify my collection so the price is the price. Don't bother contacting me saying ""I found all this stuff at the gun store for $30."" If you did, great, buy it. Don't bother telling me.

You want to do the Dealer thing you line it up and you cover the fees. 

I wont travel out of the Denver Metro area so I hope your local or willing to travel.

Came on a rifle I just rec'd today. Only reason I'm selling is I'd like something with a little higher power, and the 50mm objective doesn't really flow with the lines of the gun.

Adjustable objective, which adjusts down to 10yd (would make a GREAT .22 scope)

From what I can tell, last MSRP on this was over $700. Cheapest price I can find for someone who still has them in stock is $550.

The PPS features three safeties (trigger safety, internal firing pin safety and QuickSafe feature) of which the external integrated trigger safety inner lever mechanism contained within the trigger serves as an additional passive drop safety.

This ammo is loaded in clean brass cases and has a FMJ bullet. The bullet jacket is a two part deal with a thicker steel inner jacket covered by a thin copper outer jacket. The bullet does attract a magnet because of the heavy steel inner jacket. Ammo is 100% surefire. It is corrosive primed so simply clean your gun after shooting and you will never have any issues.

I have not opened the 8 boxes that are for sale here, but similar ammo from open boxes had more recent production dates that were in the late 70's and early 80's while most of the other surplus 7.62 TOK ammo on the market today is from the 50's and 60's. 

This listing is for the 8 sealed 72 round boxes pictured. The loose rounds are from an open box and are not included in this listing.

Price is $200 which works out to just less than $.35 a round. SPORTSMAN GUIDE has this same exact ammo for sale as we speak for $569.00 a 1224 round can which works out to just over $.46 a round. So grab this quick as it's all I have left.

Local sale with pickup in the Brandon area, or I can ship for the actual UPS ground charges which will vary with the ""ship to"" address. I will pass on whatever the real cost is.

Unfortunately I won't ship to: AK, CA, CT, Chicago, DC, HI, MA, NJ, or NY. IL must provide copy of FOID card. You must be at least 21 to purchase this ammo and ID is required.

160,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3758160,For Sale:  7.62x25 Ammo - 1050 Rounds Brass Case Polish Military,"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 350,"Listed On: Saturday, November 29, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"With over 38 years of collecting old military firearms behind me I've had more CZ52's and TOK pistols than you can shake a stick at. Plus I've had a couple of PPSH's as well. So I've shot up a ton of 7.62x25 ammo over the years and my personal favorite by has always been the Polish surplus stuff that I have listed here.   

It's brass case with a Full Metal Jacket bullet. The jacket material is actually a two part deal with a thick steel inner jacket covered by a thinner copper outer jacket, and that's why this ammo attracts a magnet. It's probably also a part of why this stuff penetrates like crazy. The truth is that this round's penetration ability comes from a combination of very high velocity coupled with a small diameter bullet that has a thick steel inner jacket. There really isn't anything quite like the 7.62x25 in our American pistol cartridge lineup.    

This Polish ammo also always seemed to shoot a little cleaner than other surplus and it's sure to fire. Make no mistake it is corrosive primed so cleaning your firearm is a must and you'll have no problems if you simply clean your gun after shooting this ammo or any other corrosive surplus.   

Then the last thing is that this ammo is noticeably hotter than any other surplus or commercial ammo I've tried. This may be due to the fact that much of this ammo was used by the Poles for their sub-machine guns. If you shoot it side by side with anything else I think you'll notice the difference too. I've shot this same ammo in a number of CZ52's and various TOK pistols without issue, however all of my firearms were in tip top condition. So you must be sure your firearms are in top shape too before firing this ammo or any other military grade ammo in them. When in doubt seek the advice of a professional gunsmith.

This is a great ""first gun"" for a person that wants a low cost dependable gun around the house for protection as well as an inexpensive first gun to become familiar with handling, cleaning, and range gun. Some like to keep a gun like this as a ""truck gun"" which is an inexpensive reliable gun that can stay in the truck in a glove box or in a case under the backseat. Just something to have easily available but did not cost a lot.

What is great about the Hi Point guns is they come with a Lifetime Warranty!! If a person ever has ANY problems down the road with a Hi Point gun they will fix it for free or, if they can't fix it, will REPLACE IT!! You can always count on Hi Point and, for the money, you can't beat it!!

I live in East Orlando (near the Waterford Lakes shopping center) and would be a great place to meet for the person who desires to purchase this gun. I will require a Bill of Sale (which I will bring) and you must be a resident of Florida with a Florida ID so I can complete the Bill of Sale.

GSG is currently the only company in the entire world licensed by Mr. Kalashnikov to manufacture real, functioning firearms, and they have not taken this opportunity lightly.

The Russians and the Chinese did the same thing just a little different. The Yugos usually had a electric pencil serial number that they used to scribe in the serial number when all the parts were put back together during refurbishing. It is what it is called forced matched. The Russians xxxxx out The original number and put the new one during this process. This was done 40 or 50 years ago by the arsenal not me you idiot. I'm glad you did not buy this gun because you are too stupid to own a gun and might hurt somebody or yourself. 
I have sold quite a few guns and you are the only one that his come up with this ridiculous theory of counterfeiting or stealing SKS parts.I have owned well over 100 SKS's in the past 25 years and still have quite a few. I have been collecting for a long time.I sold a Izzy Russian SKS for $1000 and the guy that bought it was completely aware that it was a refurbished gun. The numbers were xxxx out with the newer numbers just below it. If you are looking for a non-refurbished SKS with all matching serial numbers you will be paying much more. I have one Russian that is like that. All the rest of my SKS'S are probably refurbished just like the one that you are bitching about.
Like I said I have sold quite a few guns. I have a few guys that have bought up to 4 SKS'S off of me and are very happy. They were bought legal sold legal and were not altered by me like you claim. Do some research next time before you look and sound like a complete idiot on this subject.
I was wearing a sweatshirt with a hood that day that you met me because it was about 32° and windy not because I am ""shady. We did not meet in the middle of nowhere either it was about 100 feet from interstate five at a gas station. This would not even be an issue if you did not start texting me threatening me and making false accusations.
The 2nd pic is of the actual gun in question and is a perfect example. See the serial numbers and compare with the pics he put up.
The 3rd pic is an example of a Russian sks and also not done by me.
The 1rst picture is an example of another subject that he knows nothing about but was done by me. LOL"

It is a shoulder-fired semi-automatic rifle with a tilting-bolt locking mechanism powered by an annular short-stroke gas piston system. The bolt is locked by two lugs that recess into slots machined into the receiver. However, unlike most vertically-locking breech mechanism, the rifle's bolt has the unusual feature of tipping the bolt frontally to lock the mechanism, whereas other tipping bolt designs tip the bolt to the rear.[1] The piston is actuated by residual gases from the bore, vented into a sleeve surrounding the barrel to overcome the inertia of the bolt carrier, bolt and the resistance of the return spring in order to unlock the chamber, eject the empty cartridge casing and then introduce a new round into the chamber upon return to battery.

The barrel is press-fit and pinned into the receiver. The manual safety switch is placed inside of the trigger guard and is manipulated by the shooter's index finger. The trigger mechanism closely resembles that used in the American M1 Garand semi-automatic rifle. The cocking handle is integrated into the bolt carrier and is located on the right side of the rifle; this arrangement enables the shooter to reload the rifle without disturbing his aim.

The rifle is equipped with open-type iron sights with a hooded front post and V-notch rear sight placed on a sliding tangent, adjustable for elevation between 100–950 m. The rifle can also accept day and night-time optics that interface with an optional, receiver-mounted side rail. The one-piece pistol grip stock is carved from either walnut or beech and stained a yellowish-brown color; the stock has a hollowed butt which is used as a storage compartment for a cleaning rod, oil bottle and accessories. The rifle has an integral blade bayonet which folds into a recess carved into the stock on the right side.

The vz. 52 feeds from a detachable box magazine with a 10-round cartridge capacity but could also be rapidly recharged from stripper clips with the bolt retracted. For this purpose, a stripper clip guide is milled into the front face of the bolt carrier, aligning with the magazine when the bolt is locked in the open position. This is the primary method of reloading the rifle as infantrymen were only issued 2 magazines per rifle. It ejects cartridge cases vigorously forward and to the left."

The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

The accessories available for the PLR-16 include forend with Picatinny rail on the bottom, scope rings, dynamic deflecting operating handle, single point sling, and a muzzle brake specifically design for the 9.2"" barrel of the PLR-16.

Has the desirable German made frame, and was purchased by me last month as a Sig Sauer Certified Pre-Owned. As such, it is in impeccable condition and only shows light wear around the outside of the barrel from normal use. I have the red box and band to prove it. Comes with box, manual, and two magazines. I will also include a partial box of .40 S&W defense HP rounds.
This pistol shoots any kind of ammo problem free and has a great trigger- that being said, I am just more interested in the 1911 platform.
As such, I would like to make a trade for a mid-range 1911. The main one I would be interested in would be a Springfield Armory Mil-Spec. Otherwise would be interested in anything comparable, like models from Para-Ordanance, Ruger, Remington, etc. Mainly interested in a commander size, but will consider full and officer size models as well. Might consider basic models like Rock Islands but will expect some cash on top. Conversely, can add a little cash for something more higher end.
I would also be interested in a like new Beretta M9/92, used Sig P226, or other high-cap metal frame 9mm pistols. 
Otherwise I will sell for $600 OBO.

It was apart of the TACPAC, so it does have night sights. Feel free to call/text me at REDACTED.

Cabela's offered $960 for it and they told me they only pay 60% of their value. That gives this a value of $1600 - which they would probably put for sale at $1700+. A quick search online shows nice condition ones sell for$1600-$2200.  I don't have a license to ship so I wanted to sell to someone locally private party.  

This was manufactured in 1942 so it's right in the heart of WWII - very rare in this condition. Barrel has perfect rifling, and shows almost zero wear around the muzzle. Careful when comparing to others as in 80% or less they are only worth about $500-$600.

All metal has nearly perfect bluing, all wood is in beautiful condition. Original Winchester bakelite buttplate.

This is collector quality - check out this one at Cabelas for $1399 and its not nearly as nice as the one I have listed!

I purchased this rifle from Bud's Gun Shop in Lexington, Kentucky in November of 2013 and have not had much time to enjoy firing it at a range.  The 3-4 times that I was able to bring it to the range, I had my brother-in-law who is an ex-marine zero the scope in at 100 yards.  The rifle was thoroughly cleaned with complete bolt disassembled each time I brought it home from the range. Other than that, I have cleaned it twice per month as I do with all of my firearms even without firing it that month.  This rifle was purchased for $730 when I picked it up.  I still have the box that it came with.  Feel free to email/text/call me for photos of the rifle and am more than willing to meet any potential buyers so that you may get a handle of it before making a decision.

I carried my M&P for a couple of months last winter in these holsters but I no longer own the firearm as of last spring. If these holsters were dirty or well worn I wouldn't sell them. These hybrids offer the most in concealability/function and offer alot of adjustment by raising or lowering the belt clips. You can adjust ride height and grip angle this way. Both holsters provide a good combat grip, by that I mean they do not obstruct your grip during draw. I purchased the Galco first, then learned about the Foxx which is made in Warren, Michigan. I lived most my life in Southeast Michigan and I choose to support small and local business so I bought one. I recommend the Foxx to anyone, you can't beat it for the price. The Galco coming in $20 more isn't a whole lot better. You're looking at $100 in lightly worn gun leather. Price is for both
