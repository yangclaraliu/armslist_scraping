Taurus model 44SS6. This revolver features a 6.5 inch vent ribbed and ported barrel, 6 shot cylinder, all stainless steel construction, and a fully adjustable rear sight. The action on this revolver is very smooth, and the single action trigger has been tuned to a crisp 3lb pull. 

Along with the revolver, you'll also receive some extras. A B-Squared optic mount designed specifically for Taurus revolvers. It attaches securely to the vent ribs on the barrel, and is designed so the shooter can still use the iron sights through the mount. Any weaver or 1913 style accessory/optic will attach to this mount. I'm also including 78 rounds of ammunition. Ammo is a mix of jacketed soft point, semi jacketed hollow point, and Hornady lever evolution. There is no box. These came from the factory in a cardboard box that I no longer have.

This shotgun is in like new condition with only four shells through it. If you are not familiar with this shotgun it is made in Turkey by the same factories that make the Canik CZ75 clones and TP9, Winchester SXP, and many other quality firearms. This is a 5+1 pump action that will chamber 3 inch shells. Has a built in recoil pad and pistol grip, as well as a nice set of fiber optic ghost ring sights, a receiver mounted picatinny rail, a removable breacher choke, and is VERY lightweight. This is a Benelli pattern shotgun and will accept extended benelli magazine tubes. Very similar to a Benelli M3 (sans the semi auto functionality) for a fraction of the cost.

Im interested in several things in trade. Ive had a few shotguns with pistol grips and ring sights and Ive found that I prefer a straight stock with a bead sight. This shotgun retails for $299, Id like to trade it for a similalrly priced 12 gauge shotgun with a straight stock, bead sight, and 18-20 inch cylinder bore barrel, such as a Remington 870, Mossberg 500/maverick 88, winchester sxp, or similar. Only looking for combat/hd style shotguns, absolutely not interested in field guns, sorry.
Might also be interested in a Taurus M85 or similar snub .38 special revolver, or a Polish P-64, or similar PPK style pistol in .32 acp, .380, or 9x18mm. Maybe a Ruger LCP or LC9, Taurus 709 or 740.
Would also be interested in gear/accessories for my AR.  Particularly looking for magazines, tactical vests for mags and gear, or would like a case of 5.56 ammo.  Im wanting a Vortex Strikefire red dot and magnifier as well.
Im also looking for a progressive reloading press, my turret is just too slow for the volume I reload.
Might consider other firearms but no .22's or household junk.  Looking for a trade value of $300-350, will consider partial trades plus cash.

If not interested in trading I will sell for $200 firm. I also have a decent amount of buckshot I can include for $50 extra. Will check and see exactly how much when I get a chance, but should be around 100 at least.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

You can also purchase separately ""X-change kits"" that allow you to drop the trigger assembly from this gun into a wide variety of other kits with different calibers and sizes (9mm, .45, sub-compact, compact, and full size). I am only selling because I had some unexpected expenses come up for my dog a little while ago, however I am not in a big rush to sell, please keep offers reasonable.

I will require that anyone looking to purchase have a valid NCDL and either a valid CCW or Pistol Permit. I also ask that we do a bill of sale. No exceptions.

Asking $499 OBO with one factory magazine, or $545 OBO with three factory magazines. You can email me through Armslist or TEXT me (I will not answer calls at work) at REDACTED.

I'm phasing out some of my older kit. This has been used for teaching/training for several years but I've been running others the last few years and I don't need this many setups. Its all Tactical Tailor nylon, no rips or tears. I did dust it with some tan & brown krylon a few years ago. It's a great basic setup designed for just plates (not soft armor compatible) and lots of mobility. Nothing on the sides (just a 2"" strap & buckle) to block transition to secondary weapon or breaching weapon, although you can hang an IFAK off the sides easily. Its been worn, taped up, painted, and used but not abused. Anyone looking for a basic kit for training/HD/SHTF then this is ready to go. If you need better pictures, feel free to PM me."

The gun has had the black paint sanded off for a cool custom look. The marker comes with the standard hopper and barrel in addition to the upgrades,(cost $150 new) The upgraded barrel is a Dye Ultralite Boomstick (originally cost me $100), it dramatically increases accuracy; once you use it you will never go back to the stock barrel. The marker also comes with a sanded tank. However, the tank is passed the test date so in order to safely use the tank you will need to pay a few bucks to have it hydrotested. This is a great set and I would rather it go to a dedicated player who will get some appreciation out of it, I don’t have enough free time nowadays.

This pistol has Novak carry Night Sights front and rear, a skeletonized trigger and hammer, adjustable trigger and typical Sig quality.  Slide to frame fit is fantastic.  This was an early version with black Sig Sauer grips, nice checkering front and back.  The GSR was their first 1911 design called the Granite State Rail.  (No equipment rail on this model though).  This pistol shoots great!  I only have approximately 200 rounds through it, mostly sat in the safe.  Comes with original case, manual, 8 round Sig magazine, trigger lock etc.  No wear from holster etc.  This pistol contains NO MIMS parts!  The newer models from Sig are MIMS parts guns, and the basic target models don't measure up to the quality on these earlier guns.  The only addition made to this pistol was a recoil buffer.

Small, light, accurate, powerful: all accurately describe the GLOCK 27. With its comfortable dimensions and the proven advantages of the GLOCK pistol family, the G27 is popular with police, both on and off duty. That's why so many law enforcement agencies issue this subcompact pistol, in .40 caliber, as their official backup pistol.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

The Firestar pistols, also known as models M-43, M40 and M-45, were designed and are still being manufactured by the Spanish company Star Bonifacio Echeverria SA. These pistols were announced early in 1990s and are sold worldwide for civilian market.
All Firestars are compact, steel-framed semi-automatic pistols. Firestar pistols are recoil operated, with Browning cam locking and short barrel recoil. Barrel muzzle is externally cone-shaped to achieve the best fit into the slide for improved accuracy.

Firestar pistols are claimed to be ones of the smallest guns in their respective calibers, but, obviously not the lightest ones. The solid steel construction makes these guns extremely sturdy and reliable, and additional weight greatly improves recoil control and makes the shooting quite comfortable, despite the powerful ammunition and small size of the guns.

I have an M11-A1 by Sig Sauer. Great little conceal carry. Firearm comes with a threaded barrel, non threaded barrel, three magazines, box and manual, as well as four very quality holsters (2 Masters leather, 1 Bravo Company, and another Kydex). I have shot no more than 300 rounds through the threaded barrel and roughly 200 through the non threaded one. 
Comes with very bright siglite night sights and a great SRT (Short Reset Trigger). I have never shot a tighter group with any other pistol than I do with this bad boy.
Looking for a quality 1911 with around the same USED price as what I have in this package. Please be realistic with offers, I will not take a RIA or Ruger SR1911. Bobtail 1911's are a major plus as far as trading goes. I will say this, if you have a kimber raptor, that moves you to the front of the pack."
