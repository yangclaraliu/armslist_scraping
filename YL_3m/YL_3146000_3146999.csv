I am fine with a seller asking what ever they want for an item. It is up to them on what it will take to part with it. For the buyers part, ""Dont Be Stupid""

Seeing an add for the trade of an SKS for an AR, is code for where are the stupid people. Seeing an SKS for 450.00 is beyond reality. That would make it the best investment in history. Up 400% in an instant? Take them for what they are, the cheapest rifle ever made.
Sorry for all you Savage owners but, please....

The pricing is currently ""out there"" and all the people who should not have owned a gun in the first place are now trying to get rid of the no name manufactured  lowers and the ""Rare"" SKS's. There just happen to be a million SKS's on the market.
I have one and paid 125.00 for it 2 years ago and its still a piece of crap. 
I am tired of people offering to trade me an SKS for a Kimber.

If you want to ask 650.00 for your ""Rare SKS"" then enjoy owning it or shake hands with the dumbest guy on the buyers list ever.

MORE PICTURES at our website. www.standardfirearms.com. This rifle is in overall excellent condition, ready for the serious collector or hunter who wants a great proven rifle to shoot. This rifle was manufactured in West Germany sometime between 1959-1973 since it has a ""P"" serial number. The serial number is P7286. The stock on this gun is nearly perfect with only one small area with chip in the finish. You can see the very minor chip in the pictures. This chip on the at the butt is really the only imperfections, as even handling marks are very, very faint. I would rate the stock at 95%+. The bluing looks like it did the day it left West Germany! The bluing looks perfect since I can’t see any imperfections at all. Even the butt pad is original and in like new condition. This rifle comes with one piece scope mounts and 1"" rings. The scope mount looks like Leupold and late model since they are in a matt finish and don’t match the rifle. The length of pull measures about 13.5"". The trigger pull (3 pull average) is 4.05lbs. The barrel measures 25.5"". I scoped the barrel using a Hawkeye bore scope and the barrel looks like new with very sharp rifling, no rust, pitting or corrosion. There is some dust from being stored and a very minor build up of copper. The barrel looks like it has only been shot a few times! If you are looking for a German made Weatherby this is your chance at a very nice rifle."

It comes with a hard case, one lock, factory test fire casing, instruction manual, one 9 round magazine, one 17 round magazine with sleeve, and one flat magazine base plate. he SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in brushed stainless. Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

I have my eye on something else and don't shoot them enough. The flintlock is a Pedersoli Brown Bess (2nd Model if I'm not mistaken) and the revolver is a Traditions 1858 Remington. For the Bess I have some .715 roundballs (the barrel mic'd out at .747 at the muzzle so with a patch they shoot great) extra flints and 2fg powder and a sling and a slip over gun case. The Remington has some .454 roundballs, wonder wads, civil war style nipple pick, upgraded stainless steel nipples, a US stamped Civil War style holster, Goex and Pyrodex 3fg powder, and a tin of caps. I'm also including a capper, powder measure, powder horn, nipple remover tool, homemade ball starter for the Bess, and a nice leather possibles bag. The round balls are in a little deer hide bag. Neither gun has even 100 rounds put through them and they were always cleaned immediately after shooting and babied and the Bess never had any loads over 85 grains and 35 in the Remington. I don't want to seperate them or any of the accessories and think my asking price is more than reasonable. Everything is there to just go out and shoot. You don't have to buy anything."

I purchased this rifle in 1995 to use the lower receiver for a personal build. I estimate that the lower receiver has had about 500 rounds fired with it before the Clinton ban expired and I put all the original parts back on. I have never fired a single round down the upper, but can only speak for the last 18+ years. Chrome lined 20"" barrel. No forward assist. Birdcage flash suppressor. I will include 2 Colt 20 round magazines. As near as I can find out, this rifle was manufactured in 1980 with serial number SP12XXXX. Similar rifles have been selling online in the $1800 range The rifle is in outstanding condition I can only find a couple of small scuffs that likely happened while spending its life in the safe. The moving internal parts(bolt, carrier, hammer) are only beginning to show use. The price is $1450 cash OBO - may consider partial trades but I'm pretty picky these days and will only consider other firearms. Can be inspected/purchased in Ponca City by appointment.

This rifle is a good option for those that have local laws forbidding pistol grips and high capacity magazines. I will ship to all States that this rifle and the magazines are legal. FFL only. This is a RARE ""Hunter"" model that has a longer barrel and milled receiver. The bipod works well with long magazines - I did not lock it out in the photo, that is why the long mag touches the ground. The bipod will keep it above the surface. I like that the covers can be switched to attach a scope when you wish. This AK Hunter deserves a scope! I purchased the Japanese made Bushnell Scope overseas and you will not see many like it. I find Japanese scopes to be an excellent value, but also just plain excellent."

The only issues the rifle has is the disconnect. Not sure what exactly is causing it, something to do with the Timney.  Basically you have to pop the trigger forward or cycle the safety to get it to reset. Might be an easy fix though.  I will include the original trigger.  $1300 with scope.  I will include all of my ammo at $.50 per round.

Easily sub MOA rifle if the shooter does their job.  Prefers heavier rounds.

I might consider leaving on the scope, depending on what I'm looking for when I make the sale.  But it will be at extra cost, and I have (estimated) 100 rounds of .308 I may consider adding in at extra cost as well.

INFORMATION:
For sale is a Springfield XD9 Subcompact in excellent condition. Comes with everything including the original case, paperwork, locks, double magazine pouch, and gun holster. I have had it for about a year and love the feel and weight of it. Unfortunately, I really don’t go to the range often (I’ve only gone twice), and would like to pass this beauty on to someone who would appreciate it more. 

The Springfield XD9 Subcompact has a lot of safety features including the trigger safety, grip safety, striker indicator, and a loaded chamber indicator. It feeds reliably and is very simple to field strip and clean. Being the shortest concealed-carry polymer pistol, it would be an excellent choice for a concealed carry.

Brand/Model: Springfield Armory XD 3” Subcompact Pistol
PRICE: $450 (retail for $519.99 without extras)
Condition: Excellent
Service: Recently cleaned and tuned up by Cabelas

EXTRAS:
-2x Normal magazines (holds 10 rounds)
-2x Extended magazines (holds 16 rounds)
-XD Cable Lock
-Master Trigger Lock 
-Case Lock 


INFORMATION:
For sale is a Springfield XD9 Subcompact in excellent condition. Comes with everything including the original case, paperwork, locks, double magazine pouch, and gun holster. I have had it for about a year and love the feel and weight of it. Unfortunately, I really don’t go to the range often (I’ve only gone twice), and would like to pass this beauty on to someone who would appreciate it more. 

The Springfield XD9 Subcompact has a lot of safety features including the trigger safety, grip safety, striker indicator, and a loaded chamber indicator. It feeds reliably and is very simple to field strip and clean. Being the shortest concealed-carry polymer pistol, it would be an excellent choice for a concealed carry.

CONTACT:
Thanks for viewing guys, please email me at josephn5833@sbcglobal.net if you are interested or have any questions! I will respond within 12 hours.

Sincerely,
