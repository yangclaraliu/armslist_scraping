Local FFL, Cash Only, Not Negotiable, All Original, Amazing Price!

The Kobra Carry is essentially the Kobra modified for carry. It's the solution for those who prefer a smaller model 1911, but insist on complete reliability. The slide has been reduced to the minimum possible (4.25"") without significantly impairing the legendary reliability of the 5"" slide. The frame has been modified with the innovative Ed Brown Bobtail housing which reduces the projecting butt of the mainspring housing without sacrificing the full size frame and magazine capacity. The Bobtail minimizes the print under your jacket when carrying and reduces weight. Officer's frames reduce magazine capacity and limit grip, while keeping the projecting, sharp butt. Slides shorter than 4.25"" are notorious for reduced reliability. These problems are eliminated with the Ed Brown Commander Bobtail configuration, which reflects the genius of John Browning with an innovative modern flair. The functional simplicity has yet to be matched. Unique with the Kobra series pistols is the innovative snakeskin treatment. It is a directional pattern, meaning it is smooth to slide your hand up, but bites in for a snug grip the other way where you need it. It's easier on the hands than checkering, and our female customers in particular can't stop bragging about it. Not to mention it just looks cool! The Kobra Carry is an innovative masterpiece, and a serious tool for those who want something a little different. We are sure you'll be charmed by the Kobra Carry!

The Kobra Carry features the following:
 ■4.25"" Commander model slide, single stack commander Bobtail frame. The John Browning traditional design innovatively modified for concealed carry, without significantly detracting from reliability or accuracy.
 ■Weight: approximately 35 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted.
 ■Exclusive snakeskin treatment on forestrap, Bobtail® housing. A beautiful, unique, and snag free gripping surface.
 ■Matte finished slide for low glare, with snakeskin on rear of slide only.
 ■Fixed dovetail 3-dot night sights with high visibility white outlines."

Here is a few ways to Identify Chinese Cans because they forgot to put the made in china label on them.They look almost exactly the same as USGI cans

- Price! A few dollars cheaper (Harbor Freight V.S. Snap-on)
- They are sold as new without yellow stencil on the side
- If Stenciled the Yellow Stencil on the side is almost perfect
- Hinges are weak
- Seal is very hard made with cheaper material

Pros & Cons

Here are the CONs posted comments about Chinese cans:
- They smell funny
- Hinges are cheap and bending already
- I didn't realize I was buying Chinese cans looked exactly the same
- Buckle Clasp ears bend very easy.

The OPAP's are much harder to find and much more desirable than the commonly found NPAP variant. This gun still appears as new finish wise. It does have Yugoslav military furniture. The handguards are M70, the buttstock is from an M76 sniper. The straight comb of the M76 stock eliminates the so called ""cheak slap"" that is common on the M70 and NPAP variants and positions your head properly on the sights. Not only that, it looks nicer (IMO). This rifle comes with one Yugo bolt hold open 30 round mag (I have many others listed seperately). It also comes with a cleaning rod, original Yugo sling, and 2 muzzle brakes - borth a slant brake and a birdcage brake (both Tapco). This gun is 922r compliant, as it was made for Century at the Zastava arsenal in Yugoslavia (with the exception of the M76 stock which was added). It is matching - except for the M76 buttstock of course.

Offered for your consideration is one (1) gorgeous Mossberg 352KB .22 caliber carbine with the black fold down fore end. When the 352 carbine was first introduced in 1957, it was touted as the “first clip-type automatic to handle all three cartridge lengths – short, long, and long rifle”. 
Following the 352, 352K, 352KA, the 352KB was the last in the 352 series to be produced having been manufactured from 1960 until 1971. Since it does not have a serial number, this would indicate that it was more than likely manufactured prior to the 1964 Gun Control Act. As the pictures will attest, the condition of this example is outstanding. It will make an excellent shooter as well as a very nice enhancement to a collection of Mossberg .22 caliber rifles. Additional pictures upon request.

Just got it last week and have only put 80 rounds through it. This is the new version that came out this year without the laser. Has real usable sights unlike msot handguns of this type and a slide stop, totally reliable even with steel cased ammo. Smooth trigger, easily pocket carriable but its a bit too small for my hands, so I'd like to trade it for something a bit bigger. Comes with its box and everything it came with, two 6 round magazines, and for the right trade I can include the remainder of the .380 I have left, around 150 rounds.

Primarily looking for a Ruger SR9c or LC9, or a S&W J Frame, particularly a 638,  M&P Shield, but I'm open to similar guns. Prefer 9mm but might consider .40 as well. Willing to add some cash depending on what you have. No Kel Tecs please, or rifles or shotguns.

The hand guard comes from Midwest Industries, is light weight and comes with 3 additional 2.5 inch rail sections.  Last but not least, this rifle is finished off with a Magpul ACS FDE 6 position stock.

The rifle has had exactly 105 rounds of various .223 ammo put through it without a single malfunction. These are famously reliable firearms so this was no surprise. The wood stock, bore, bluing, etc. are perfect. It could be sold as new, but since I have had it out to shoot once, I can not claim that. This gun is extremely accurate.

So why am I selling this? I am a bolt-action/lever-action rifle guy and wanted to try a semi-auto. While this rifle performed flawlessly, I found I just don't have the love for semi-autos as I do my more traditional long-guns. So it's a chemistry thing. It's as simple as that.

I am offering a great package at a great price. You will get:
-  Ruger Mini-14 Ranch Rifle
- Two steel Ruger manufacture 5-round magazines
- Two steel Ruger manufacture 20-round magazines
- Two Tapco (new, improved version) 30-round magazines
- Ruger rifle case (will fit scoped rifles)
- Several dozen rounds of factory .223 ammo, various manufacture 

I will only sell locally, face-to-face and will not ship. Cash only. $750 OBO

Thanks for reading this ad and I know you'll enjoy this beautiful, American made firearm."

Bloomberg Group Gives Another Million Dollars to Gun Control Initiative

For the second time in as many months, Michael Bloomberg-funded Everytown for Gun Safety has given $1 million to the campaign for Initiative 594 in Washington state. On August 29, Breitbart News reported that Everytown gave its first million to the one-percenters' campaign for gun control. Breitbart News also reported that I-594 would treat all gun sales like retail sales--requiring a background check for both, thus ending private sales. It would, therefore, require the creation of a database of handgun owners (i.e., registration)."

For the second time in as many months, Michael Bloomberg-funded Everytown for Gun Safety has given $1 million to the campaign for Initiative 594 in Washington state. On August 29, Breitbart News reported that Everytown gave its first million to the one-percenters' campaign for gun control. Breitbart News also reported that I-594 would treat all gun sales like retail sales--requiring a background check for both, thus ending private sales. It would, therefore, require the creation of a database of handgun owners (i.e., registration)."

This is a factory built firearm, assembled from all new/matching parts. It is an oversized AK47 type, very similar to the Romanian PSL and filling the same role on the battlefield as the famous Russian SVD 'Dragunov.' This M77PS comes with 2 magazines and Zastava owner's manual and original hand rails. The PAP M77PS is a semi-auto version of the Serbian military M77B1 AK DMR, which itself is a modernized version of the classic Zastava M76 DMR. The M77PS features an AK47 type operating system; scaled up to fire the larger 7.62x51mm cartridge. It has a 20"" long Cold Hammer Fordged barrel, with 14mm threaded muzzle. The receiver accepts double stack magazines and is made from reinforced 1.5mm thick stamped steel. Other features include an adjustable gas system, adjustable front and rear sights, standard full-length side scope rail, bolt hold open notched safety, milspec polymer furniture with sling studs, rubber recoil pad, and a smooth and crisp double hook type trigger group. All of the internal parts are made from milled/forged steel, and are not cast or contain any polymer. All parts were made in Serbia at the Zastava Arms factory, and all are 100% new and not military surplus. This rifle does not require 922(r) parts, as like with the Romanian PSL, the ATF considers it to be a 'Sporting' rifle. Rifle comes complete with 2 - 10 round Zastava magazine made from steel. It will accept preban Mitchell type mags too. It also has a factory owner's manual and 1 year importer's warranty. As i said, it comes with polymer furniture, but it can accept wood sets intended for the M76, so you may customize it. This really is a very high quality rifle, especially for the money. It has been on the market for half a year now, and most every review agrees that it is well built, accurate, and above all; very reliable and durable. If you have any questions at all, please feel free to contact me anytime. Thanks so much for your time and interest."

THEN DO I HAVE A STATEMENT FOR YOU!?!

Over the past 2 years I have received 8 emails from you.. Every time you send it from your daughters or wifes email with JUST your number saying ""call me"".
You need to STOP hiding from the government using your wifes email address, become a big boy and get your own so that people who dont want to just ""call me"" can email you instead.. Do you not understand how annoying it is to have to call someone and find out they just plan to yammer and ramble on about the government, obama and how you just thought youd check if they want to trade?

If someone posts ""FOR SALE"" it means FOR SALE. Not leaving your number and then keeping them on the phone for an hour only to get to your point of ""well I got this crappy AKs here nobody wants I'd trade you"".

Stop being a weirdo mike! You always seem like a nice guy but frankly I am tired of getting emails from you with just ""Im mike, call me at 919 *** ****""

Pull up your big boy pants, get your own darn email address. And realize that just because someone posted something up, does not mean you should see if they want to trade.

Really mike.. How many times has it worked? How many times has someone actually said ""Sure lets trade"".
It couldnt possibly be worth the annoyance you provide to the rest of us with your constant emails and bait and switch on the phone.

Heck you annoyed me so much I finally replied to your wife's email ""F OFF I AM TIRED OF THIS"" after the 3rd email in a row on the cetme..

May be willing to take a partial trade for older AK47, semi auto hand gun (glock, S&W, est), hunting rifle, hunting shotgun.  If you have a trade you must email me pictures, a full description, and the price you think the gun is valued at (price off my gun).  Just like trading a car you do not get as much for trade as selling it outright.  If this does not sit well with you then sell you gun on your own and put that cash towards mine.  Otherwise I’m taking your trade as not exactly what I’m looking for as a way to help you and an therefore going to be getting a slightly good deal on it.
