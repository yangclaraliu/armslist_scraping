Up for sale is my AK-74 (not AK-47) chambered in 5.45 x 39 (not 7.62x39). It is a Bulgarian M74. Read reviews about this rifle...everyone who owns one, loves it.

This weapon is dream to shoot and a head-turner at any range. I have made multiple upgrades to this weapon and am including 2,400 rounds of ammunition. Less than 300 rounds of military surplus ammo put through the weapon. Very accurate; I was shooting apple-sized groups at 100 yards with surplus ammo. Thoroughly cleaned after each trip to the range. The mags fit snugly into the magazine well and the iron sights are spot-on.

If I can find the original furniture (stock, pistol grip, and forend), I will include those as well.

It's chambered for 2 3/4"" to 3"" shells. Skeet, trap, upland bird hunting this is it. Automatic and it appears like a 391's gas system. Beretta's automatics are known for reliability and the ability to function with minimal maintenance.

This comes with the choke wrench and two chokes. It has a three year warranty, if you register it with the manufacturer. The gun has never been assembled and the protective wrappings are in place. The sight is a bead. If it runs like a 391 recoil is easily manageable. The gun arrived four weeks ago and reason for sale it's not a 20. 

Today the big box retailer sells this for $799. The price is $625 and it will go for that. Take a look around at automatics these days and it's well worth the price. 
Happy hunting and thanks for looking."

The SP1 is in really nice shape. It does have some wear, but not a lot. I'd say 90% condition at least. It has been shot twice now. The SP1 includes the fixed stock set, 2 position metal collapsible stock set, a Laser from Laser max that mounts as a pistol grip and secures to the carry handle and still allows the use of the top carry handle rail mount. The Colt has a 20 round mag, original pistol grip and forearm set, commando barrel (commando model rifle), and the original parts it included as new.... ( no new trigger groups or other add-ons). I think the rifle is of around 80-81 year of manufacturer. It is hard to pinpoint on the colt info site, which makes it more desirable from what I have been told from collectors. I do not have the manual or box. The $1,250 is my cash price....My trade price would be higher. To be honest, I like the rifle...my woman is just asking me to thin the herd a bit. 
You may offer a trade, but I don't have many items I am interested in at the moment. 
Thank you!

has 20 inch barrel with all original hardware from colt, 
also has upgraded trigger group from colt trigger pull breaks like glass very impressive.  This is a collectors rifle that is battle ready comes from a time when the AR was built better then the 1960's-70s a transition to a true work of art as its accuracy is amazing and its function is very tough military grade for the time of 1983.  Much better than any colt of today, is right up their with quality of fine hardware such as Voltor, Novesky, Spikes, Daniel Defense, or any quality AR of today, they did it the same way most quality manufactures still do it today.  
This AR is a untouched piece of history has sat in a safe and continues to sit in a safe, if your looking for a old colt to beat down this one can be it for the price but this rifle is a true piece of history and it sits in my locker as I have many other AR's to run.  I have had large offers but this Colt Preban Blue label Goes for $2500.  
No matter how the political agendas change this rifle was made before any political decisions which means you can put anything on it from a m203 to a shot gun mounted on it.  No future governmental changes will affect this rifle that is what pre ban means it comes before currant political views making it exempt from most of them, you still have to pay a price for a 203 grenade launcher or a suppressor but on this rifle its history comes before any political agendas.  
It is art at its fullest political, functional, and American."

I have a S&W 18-2 chambered in 22lr that I am looking to sell or trade. The S&W is in used condition and does not come with the original box or manual.  If you are not familiar with the S&W Model 18-2 it was the trainer for the Combat Masterpiece chambered in 38 Special.  This gun locks up tight and works the way it should. The S&W does have wear spots on it from the holster and use but is a solid revolver especially for the age of the 18-2 series. The cylinder is a 6 shot that cycles and locks up great.

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

For possible sale or trade consideration is a 1971 HK model 4, chambered in .380. (traditional SA/DA) These were the first handguns manufactured by HK and were imported by Harrington & Richardson (H&R) from 1967 through the mid 1970's. Besides it being an HK-4 which is a hard to find pistol in itself today, this one is particularly special being one of the H&R 100th anniversary HK-4's. 

This particular example is in excellent shape and has lived an easy life; staying clean and lubed. It includes one original magazine, box and manual. You'll be hard pressed to find another similar package. 

Feel free to email me and I'll respond promptly. For a private transaction, you must be a Wisconsin resident and willing to sign a bill of sale. I have a Wisconsin CCL that I'm happy to show you for your peace of mind. Thanks!"

The command post is what we used to camp in for the last couple years.  I'm not sure what the exact dimensions are, but it is big.  The rain fly and canvas have some small holes and rips in them, but could easily be patched.  We've used it in several storms without any leaks.  There were some rips/burns in the screens, but those have been patched. 

The crew shelter is the shorter one.  It's hardly been used (my wife preffered the command post because you could stand up in it).  The canvas, rain fly and screens are in perfect shape. 

There are enough hubs/lugs for one tent or the other.  The plastic lugs have been reinforced by drilling through them and adding a roll pin.  There are also has several aluminum lugs.  The 5 point hubs are the weak point in the system.  More can be purchased on Ebay, just search for Mobiflex and the auction will be in the results.  I will include all my spare parts(pins, bolts, extra lugs, extra 3 point hubs, etc.)

These tents are truely 4 season and will keep you warm and dry in any weather.  Either one will set up in minutes.  I'm moving to a small camper, so I no longer need either tent.  I pulled the photos off the internet to show what each looks like set up.

I'd take $550 for the Command Post, $300 for the Crew Shelter(without hubs), or $800 for both.

Downsizing my collection of toys and stuff. 
I bought this used and have taken good care of it.
Tires and trailer in road-ready condition: just pay and play.
I’ll clean it up a bit so chances are it will look even better when you come to look at it.

The trailer was built as a motorcycle carrier so has a loading ramp, making it very versatile, and has been great for cargo loading and unloading. 

Since you might not know that there are differences between Car-Mate and the other brands, Car-Mate:

1.	uses a one-piece aluminum roof so leaks are unheard of
2.	uses thicker aluminum panels
3.	uses Dexter axles, which are sturdier
4.	uses stronger steel in their frames and sub-structures
5.	uses top grade fasteners inside and out
6.	has better resale value

General dimensions:

1.	Length @ 10’
2.	Width @ 5’
3.	Interior height @ 70”

Has clean & clear Virginia Title in seller’s name in hand: no stories or excuses.

Price is $3,000 cash or certified funds, but I might consider trade for a 14-18’ box truck in NO-ISSUES mechanical condition.

The M3 has a run time of over two (2) hours and the M3  mounts easily onto Glock style rails without tools by utilizing the Insight Technology patented Slide-Lock® interface. Simply slide the unit onto the firearm rail and lock it into place with the spring loaded latch bar. The L-3 Insight Technology slide lock interface is designed to fit rails similar to those found on the Glock pistol. 

The ambidextrous rocker switch located on the removable backplate allows the M3  to be activated in either a momentary or constant On mode. The rocker backplate on the M3 is interchangeable with other backplates designed for either M3 or M6 models. Optional long gun and shotgun backplates with integrated remotes are available from L3 EOTech to provide greater versatility in the application of your tactical illuminator."

Hard to price the action job and trigger job as its roughly 6 hours combines of buffing and polishing small parts. Very tedeous job but improves action and trigger pull 200%. I will say gunsmiths charge around $80 per hour or flat rate fees for trigger jobs and action jobs so id guesstamate it would cost you at least, at least, $150-$200 for the job to be done. 

Everything on this rifle is in brand new shape with the following brand new:
AKARS-Bushnell-Midwest-Case-Ammo

Stock Wasrs are going for $700-$800 used with just a mag!!! The SAR-1 is steps well above the Wasr so id hope it would go for well above that amount due to the $1000+ in upgrades.
