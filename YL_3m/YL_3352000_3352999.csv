WILL DO ISP REQUIRED CHECK

For sale I have a pair of Ruger P95 pistols.  they come with 10 total mecGar 17 round magazines (as opposed to the factory 15 rounders. the mecgar magazines are better than the factory ones were), 2 low profile under barrel lasers.  these are lightly used, low round count, very clean and well maintained.  I really only want to sell these as the pair for $900 ($450 each, which is reasonable considering all the magazines and upgraded mags involved, plus the lasers).  Manufacture date on P95s is 2008 and 2012.  Ill also throw in 50 rounds of Remington 9mm JHP

If interested, text at REDACTED or email

if you check, these are going for $350+ in worse condition with less mags and extras here on armslist.  Since they stopped making them, theyve been pretty popular from what ive seen

Would do $950 for the P95s and the additional 8 lasers I have for sale"

Rather than hurting my po ole fingers describing it, here's link to amazon with everything you need to know:

Their price? $170.00. It's all there and was never used. The bore guide is a bit dinged up (Came that way) but could be smoothed out with steel wool. 

If the link to amazon ever fails, use the title to google this kit. I'm not an AR buff and would rather recoup some of my cash by selling this kit, I'll never use it! 

I have had this listed now for awhile for a higher price, if I can't at least get what I'm asking for  on this final offer, I'll just keep it.

P.S. I've already gotten emails from people trying to beat me down on this price of $100.00. People complain about sellers charging ridiculous prices, but when a seller offers goods at more than a fair price, they try to beat em down even further. I meant what I said, I will just keep it if I can't get my asking price. I would just assume donate it or throw it away before giving into low ballers. I have done this in the past."

Kind of a spur of the moment type of thing. I have a Honda Shadow Spirit 750cc with 21,xxx miles and a collection of higher end pistols that I would like to trade for a nicer cruiser with more power. 

Have lots more pictures of the bike on hand. Has a windshield, upgraded $500 mustang seat, Vance Hines pipes, and nice locking saddle bags. I literally just got done putting brand new tires on, brand new stainless chain, and a fresh oil change. It's ready to be ridden and has been my daily driver for a long time.

The pistols I have up for grabs are a Kimber Warrior with lots of extras and a Sig P226 Tacops with 4-5 mags. Both pistols are like new and are some of the best pistols I've owned. Both come with original box + papers.

Could trade any combination of these items to make the deal fair. Also have other guns I can include if your value is higher."

Their price? $170.00. It's all there and was never used. The bore guide is a bit dinged up (Came that way) but could be smoothed out with steel wool. 

If the link to amazon ever fails, use the title to google this kit. I'm not an AR buff and would rather recoup some of my cash by selling this kit, I'll never use it! 

I have had this listed now for awhile for a higher price, if I can't at least get what I'm asking for  on this final offer, I'll just keep it.

P.S. I've already gotten emails from people trying to beat me down on this price of $100.00. People complain about sellers charging ridiculous prices, but when a seller offers goods at more than a fair price, they try to beat em down even further. I meant what I said, I will just keep it if I can't get my asking price. I would just assume donate it or throw it away before giving into low ballers. I have done this in the past."

This rifle has an MSRP of about $1,640, you can commonly find them elsewhere on the net for about $1,390 plus shipping and transfer fees, the local gun stores have them for about $1,500 plus tax, and the big store are around $1,600 plus tax.  I'm looking to get $1,285 for it, cash only.  Buyer needs a MN Permit to Purchase or Permit to Carry with valid Minnesota ID,  I am not interested in shipping. I'd like to sell this but I am not desperate.  My price is more than fair and if you're from out of state I will require an FFL to transfer this rifle.  I will go into Hudson WI to transfer through an FFL there if there is a WI buyer for it, buyer pays the transfer fee.  Thanks for your interest."

All of my other semi auto pistols are either 9mm or .45acp, so I'm looking to stay with those two calibers. Unless it's 10mm. I want one for a woods gun.

Included is the pistol, flush fit 5 round magazine, extended 6 round magazine with pinky rest, box, all manuals and literature, and the lock. This PM40 also has a Talon Grip installed. It is the rubberized texture. Also included will be a Blackhawk right hand IWB holster in tan leather, and a Desantis M44 Superfly pocket holster. The Blackhawk is unused, and the Desantis was used very little.

Last but not least, I have 90 rounds of Speer Gold Dot 180gr jhp and 50 rounds of Fiocchi 165gr jhp. This ammo was purchased in the last 3 months.

I put around 300 rounds through this pistol without any issues. It is a great concealed carry gun. I purchased it for $650 + tax, the ammo was $100, the Blackhawk holster was $70, the Desantis holster was $30, and the Talon Grip was $19. Total was $869. Looking to get $650 trade out of it.

I am looking for the following- Kahr PM9, P9, MK9, K9, Springfield XDs 9mm, Walther PPS 9mm, Walther PPQ 9mm, Springfield XDm 3.8 Compact 9mm or .45, a nice S&W .357 revolver, or a Glock 20 or 29 10mm. Let me know what you've got.

I know what guns are worth, so please do not tell me your used gun is worth MSRP or more in trade if it's bone stock, no accessories. My PM40 is in excellent condition and I knocked $200 off of the price because it is a used gun.

Lastly, if I end up trading this for another Kahr, I will keep the two holsters I have. Also, if your gun is worth less, you can make up the difference in cash or just trade for the gun only. I'm fair and easy to deal with. Thanks.

Manufactured by International Harvester in late 1955/early 1956, this is an uncommon variation referred to as the ""Gap Letter"" due to the wide spacing of the model designation on the rear of the receiver. The receiver itself was actually manufactured by Springfield Armory for IHC as indicated by the SA drawing number revision/heat lot marking on the right receiver leg. This rifle is was made close to the end of IHC production and falls well within the 5-million serial range, just a couple thousand guns from the last. This rifle is in excellent condition and is a ""Correct Restoration"" built with all the proper components for a 5-million range IHC. The barrel is a correct LMR, dated 5-55. Overall condition is excellent and the rifle retains 97-98% finish (the receiver has been reparkerized). There is no rust or any pitting. The stock is also correct and in excellent overall condition with some normal handling wear and scuffs but no cracks or repairs. The correct 1/2"" DAS cartouche is present on the left side and there is a single circle-P firing proof on the wrist. No rebuild markings, nor any import markings are present. Mechanically excellent with a bright, sharp bore that shows very good throat erosion (1.6) and muzzle erosion (1.2) readings. This rifle was purchased from noted IHC researcher G. Wayne Bradford in 2009 and his data sheet will be included with the rifle. The data sheet lists all the component parts in this rifle"

SureFire M961XM07 Millenium Universal WeaponLight
The M961XM07 Millennium® Universal WeaponLight is a 9-volt (three-battery) WeaponLight that attaches by means of an integral dual thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. The shock-isolated high-output incandescent lamp and mid-size reflector produce a beam with excellent reach and significant peripheral light.

Crimson Trace Fore grip Brand new in box comes with all paperwork in sealed plastic

Crimson Trace MVF-515 Vertical Foregrip For AR-15 Rifles takes the hassle out of weapon lights. For years, attaching a gun light to a Picatinny rail equipped rifle has involved clamping a rather large flashlight to the rails, and attachingimage an activation pad to the rifle foregrip via an external wire. Enter the MVF-515 Modular Vertical Foregrip. With its compact and rugged design and totally instinctive activation system, the Crimson Trace MVF-515 allows the shooter to activate all combinations of gunlight & laser sight, instinctively, while maintaining a natural shooting grip. And there are no external wires or loosely attached activation pads.

Comes with two Sig Pro 9mm 15-rd magazines that I purchased locally for $46+tax each. Considering that I paid $500 for the SP2022 and another $90+ for the magazines and it is barely used, I think that $500 is a fair price for the handgun. I am willing to accept a reasonable offer so please feel free to make one.

I am also willing to trade for high quality bolt action .22LR rifles, especially CZ rifles or a Ruger 77/22 in particular. Will add cash if it is a nice rifle with decent optics. 

I live in the Tuckasegee area (near Cullowhee, Sylva, somewhat near Cashiers) but I drive to Asheville weekly so I would consider meeting somewhere out there. If you are in my area and will meet me in the 28723 or 28783 zip code I will throw in all of the bullets pictured (2 mags of Winchester WB and 1 mag of Hornady Critical Defence HPs).

Its in great shape with minimal wear. These have 4.25in commander length barrels and has a lightweight alloy frame making it much easier to carry as a cc pistol. Also has cocobolo hardwood checkered grips, flat mainspring housing, extended beavertail safety, 3 dot sights, skeletonized adjustable trigger, extended safety lever, and ring hammer; basically all of the features that most people want on a 1911.
 Comes with two factory mec gar magazines, case, barrel bushing wrench, fobus paddle holster, and all factory paperwork and accessories.

Its a great gun but I've had a few 1911's and I'm just finding that I'm not a big fan of the platform. I'd like to trade for a different semi auto handgun of some sort in 9mm, .40, or .45. Would be interested in Glock's or XD's + a little cash. Would particularly be interested in a Beretta 92 compact, CZ75, SIG P226 or P229, or Stoeger Cougar in any of those calibers + cash as well. Would be interested in a .38/.357 revolver as well, particularly a Ruger GP100 with a 4 inch barrel. Pretty open though so let me know what you have, No tauruses or kel tecs though, and I'm not interested in rifles or shotguns. My ONE exception would be a .357 magnum lever action rifle.

If not interested in trading I will sell for $600.

I spent 1200 for the rifle , it was 1089 plus tax and I spent 200 (173 plus tax) on the stock plus 20 bucks per 20 rounds of ammo . ( one box of ammo is open ) the rifle includes : rifle , hard case , one mag , retractable stock , original papers , proof I purchased it new , and roughly 40 rounds of surplus .308
 the rifle was test fired at the factory , purchased new by me ( I have receipt ) and stuck in the safe till I ordered all the parts . I only got around to ordering the retractable stock.
 stock is in ok condition , I think the magazine said grade 2 or something. its got some scratches and marks but fully functional.

I bought this recently because I wanted it for home defense, after trial running through my house, I have decided I don't want a shotgun for that purpose.  As such, I'm selling this.  It has never been fired, nothing has been done to it since I received it and opened the box.  I did purchase two, and I'm thinking I will likely sell both, so don't be surprised to see another one on after I sell this one, I will entertain offers for both if someone is interested.
