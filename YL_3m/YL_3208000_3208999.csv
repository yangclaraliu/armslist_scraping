Sig Sauer E26R40BSS P226 DA/SA 40S&W 4.4"" 12+1 NS Black Ergo Grip Blk SS
The Sig Sauer P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other
combat handguns are measured. The easy-to-handle full-size P226 is used by
the U.S. Navy SEALs, federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies
across the country. The P226 features exceptional ergonomics and balance,
an integral accessory rail, and a 4-point safety system (decocking lever,
patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and
trigger bar disconnector). The longer barrel yields better ballistic
performance and accuracy. The frame is black hard anodized and the slide
has a protective black Nitron finish.

Sig P250 subcompact 9mm

This is the fully modular model that Sig has. I am selling it with the small subcompact frame that it came with, as well as a medium subcompact frame that I purchased. The medium frame is a little thicker in the grip, and also has a rail. 

I am including two 12-round magazines (considered high capacity), and one 15-round mag with the x-grip. The 15-round mag is actually for the compact model, but the x-grip is basically a grip extender that slides over the magazine. 

I also have a N82 Tactical IWB holster, and a Versacarry IWB holster that I can include if you are interested. Because this is primarly a conceal and carry gun, I will either require sale at an FFL, or I will require both a Drivers license and Carry permit. I will provide the same."

Utilizing a high-efficiency LED that's virtually immune to failure, the 6PX Defender provides simplicity of operation and brilliant light focused by a micro-textured reflector that creates a wide 320-lumen beam with generous peripheral illumination. The 6PX Defender's high-strength aerospace aluminum body is smoothly sculpted for a comfortable, secure grip and is hard anodized to military specifications for extreme resistance to abrasion and corrosion. SureFire makes four other flashlights similar to the 6PX Defender that do not have a Strike Bezel. The first two are the previously mentioned aluminum-body 6PX Tactical and a polymer-body version of this light, the G2X Tactical, which both have tactical switching instead of the click switch. The second two are the dual-output 6PX Pro and a polymer-body version of this light, the G2X Pro, which both have click-type switching."

I boughtthis from Academy Sports on 6/18/14 as a birthday present for my father, but 3 days later he bought one himself. The rifle has never been fired, I've never even chambered a round. Still has the tag attached. Comes with a Beretta case and 20 round magazine.
MSRP on this rifle is $595, I am selling it for my cost of $375. I will include receipt so you can register warranty in your name with Beretta. This gives you exactly the same benefit as if you bought it at Academy Sports, since they don't accept returns or handle warranty issues.

Call Bryan at: REDACTED

Here's the description from Beretta's website:

  ""  ARX160: A .22 Tactical Rifle with Full-Size Performance


    Finally, a .22 LR tactical training rifle that looks, feels and handles like its full-size counterpart. The ARX160 is a rimfire version of the ARX100, Beretta’s celebrated .223 Rem tactical rifle. But aside from the caliber, this .22 LR rifle is virtually identical to the centerfire version as far as operations, controls, accessorization and customization options. A training rifle that will never let you down, the ARX160 is an extra-durable piece of gear that will satisfy even the most demanding tactical shooter.

    Ambidextrous Controls

    A serious training rifle should always mirror the “real thing” in the way its controls work. This is why the ARX160 features ambidextrous two-position safety, magazine release and cocking handle. With this rifle, you can easily train and shoot with either hand dominant and improve your skills without breaking the bank.

    Limitless Accessorization, Customization Options

    This training rifle is a great base for building the tactical system of your dreams. It comes out of the box with four Picatinny rails: on top, a full rail enables you to easily attach your favorite sighting or optics system, while on either side and on the bottom of the fore-end additional rails let you add other accessories such as tactical lighting. Other customization options include the telescopic folding stock: you can adjust the length of pull at the touch of a button, while the stock can be folded partially or all the way to accommodate most firing situations.
    Durable, Easy to Shoot and Maintain

    The ARX160 is built to be durable and super-tough, being constructed of superior steel and technopolymer. Its flip-up sights are just like those on the full-caliber rifle—super-light but rugged, and featuring a rear diopter for quick and accurate target acquisition. Maintenance is easy thanks to the simple way in which it comes apart and is reassembled without any tools. Whether you use it on its own as a rimfire tactical rifle, or as a training tool to improve your handling of the full-power counterpart, the ARX160 will always turn heads at the range and will never let you down.

Well now is your chance to lose that feeling. You have now found your next addition to your hopefully extremely manly firearms collection. I have a very nice Beretta 96 Elite II that i am looking to trade. For those of you that are unfamiliar with the Elite II variant, of the 92/96 series pistols, you have no idea what you are missing out on. Let me give you a brief rundown of why this pistol is better than a standard 92/96 and every Glock ever made. 

Cosmetics: The biggest thing is the Two Tone finish. This make the bad guys look at your gun, and realize that a man that has such a pretty gun must know what he is doing, and they better go find an Obama supporter to harass instead. The front .2 inches of the barrel have been shaved off, not only making it better balanced, but also making it not look retarded. If you have to make up with some other short comings with MASSIVE barrel length, I apologize, but i promise you will still love this pistol. The grips are factory Hogue grips. Thats right. Beretta decided they loved the Elite II customers so much that they would save them the trouble and headache of having to replace those crappy uncomfortable hard plastic Beretta grips, by doing it for you. How thoughtful, right?? The hammer is a factory skeletonized commander hammer. You know, for when things need commanding.

Parts: Ever fired a Beretta, and thought to yourself, this weapon feels like it was forged by Zeus in the bowels of Haites, but this double action trigger is heavy. and long, and not very awesome. Well Beretta decided to fix this also. A ""D"" spring has been installed from the DA only Beretta to lighten the pull. Ahhhh, much better. One of the biggest upgrades are the sights. Considering Beretta is the oldest gun manufacturer in the world, you would think that they would understand the benefit of night sights. Well the French got something right with the ""G"" variant slide (which is what is on the Elite II) and made both the front and rear sights replaceable. Good job Beretta!!! Oh did i mention that with these weapons, you also do not have to mess with that pesky, at times hard to reach, manual slide mounted safety?? Decocker only baby!! 

Magazines: I have two of them. Too bad they are the boring, lackluster 10 rounders. Beretta decided that this is what ALL Elite II models shipped with. Although you can buy 11 rounders, and then the all so intimidating 13 round extended mags. 

Holsters: I have several of them. If you like being tacticool, I have a Safariland ALS Drop Leg holster. (Don't judge me, i use it for work). but due to the ""fatter"" slide of the ""G"" slide, it doesnt really like kydex holsters, such as Blackhawk Serpa holsters. But I prefer leather anyways.

Overall: This is a great shooting, amazing looking, rare pistols. I have had extremely anti-Beretta shoot this, and gotten nothing but compliments. I love this pistol, but have a touch of firearm ADD, and get bored very easily."

Hey everyone, 
	I have a pretty rare and pretty neat pistol for sale. This is a Grendel P30 pistol. I bought this to have as a high capacity and potent little pocket gun, but another project has come up and I need to sell or trade this one off. This is a absolute blast to shoot and I wish I didnt have to get rid of her, but it is what it is! This is  22mag semi auto with the 30 round magazine. This was the predecessor for the PMR30 before Grendel went under and subsequently became Kel-Tec. I took this to the range today and it shot fantastic (a little low for my eyes, but that could be managed). It didn’t seem to like Maxi-Mag ammo but absolutely loved the Armscor JHP stuff. I didn’t have one single issue with the Armscor, and the Maxi-mag just like to FTE a little. This is a blast to shoot and actually blows a bit of a fireball out when you shoot it. This has a mid 4 digit serial number and doesn’t show any “heavy” wear on it. About the only thing wrong is that the safety on the right side of the gun has been “filed” down. It was common on these to rub your hand on that side so it looks like the previous owner did that. Either way the safety still functions fine. 
	These are pretty rare to find nowadays and are rather collectible but still are fantastic everyday shooters. Would be awesome for a girl as a carry as you could load it up and have plenty of firepower without much recoil. I also have TONS of armscor mag ammo available at additional cost or to balance out the trade."

The cold hammer forging process work hardens the steel around a rifled mandrel, which creates the lands and grooves. These barrels are chambered in 5.56mm NATO. The barrel is then chrome lined to the spec for a M249 Machine Gun barrel, which is about twice as thick as that of an M4 barrel. The end result is a rifle that can be run hard day after day. Having been part of many excellent training opportunities, I have seen how a barrel may experience serious trauma from high rates of fire and sustained high temperatures.

It comes with clip on padded holster with strap to hold the pistol in the holster with an extra pouch for backup 7 round magazine, it also comes with a third 7 round magazine
This package includes 50 rounds of long rifle ammunition.

You really don't need a holster for this pistol, it is the perfect size for pocket or purse and it is user friendly, I do have a pocket holster, you can have it as well as the padded holster.  

It has a 2.38"" tip-up barrel, it had an overall length of 4.5"". Since the gun is fired from a cocked hammer, the tip-up barrel made absolute sense from a safety perspective.

Rather than use an extractor, the gun could pop spent casings strait up with the barrel tip lever, it can also be checked for a live cartage in the barrel for safety before and after use.

I have had this pistol for 3 years and had only used it 4 times at the range, ran seven magazines though it without any issues, very accurate for its size.  

Call REDACTED or reply by email for more information.

We are located on 64th ave, in north Denver, we live in the county, so test firing it is legal on my property. Interested buyers only, no free shooting without a bill of sale."

100% Legal to own and use!

Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Fire Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to bump fire more safely, offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! You can now safely and accurately bump-fire your AR-15 at an incredible rate. Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the firearm. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward."

Text Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five
**((SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY PLEASE**

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

The gun was acquired from our accountant, who we've known for years.  There is a small ""case"" mark on the right side of the stock, otherwise the gun is in perfect condition.  Did we mention this gun has NEVER BEEN FIRED!  We checked the serial number and this gun was manufactured in 1997.  Additional pictures are available.  Item G-37871-1.

 Owning a Browning Citori over and under is a lifetime dream for many of us. And this Citori Grade VI is exactly what we many of us were dreaming about. With its extended sideplates and exquisite Grade VI stock and forearm it is a fine example of everything the Citori represents. As a part of the Browning High Grade Program it has all the characteristics you want -- plus, did I mention, the receiver and sideplates, and other metal hardware, are beautifully case colored. This brings out the elegance and interest of the Engraving and gold highlights in a unique way that is hard to find anywhere else.

As if this is not enough, the Citori Grad VI has all the strength you expect like a full width locking lug that wears in over time, instead of wearing out. And the proven Invector Plus choke system (with back bored barrels) that  has long been recognized as one of the most reliable, clean and consistently performing of all choke tube designs ever. Every Citori has an exceptional amount of hand fitting before they are ready to be sent to your dealer. And this Citori has even more. You can actually see it.  This is not a cheap gun. It is expensive and absolutely worth it if you love the legacy of the the finest Browning over and unders.

The top import grade of all Mosin Nagant rifles available. NOT the worn out stuff that Cabela's and Gander sell. Each rifle is a best out of 1000 or more. These are keepers and shooters. All are non-countered and have deep and bright bores. The stocks have no bad gouges or marks. The 1931 Xcode Tula is particularly spectacular.  I got a bunch of 1926 ex-dragoons as duplicates. I normally don't have that many duplicate ex-dragoons from the '20s in this kinda off condition. However, I already have 4 from the years below and would like to fund/trade for other toys. That is why I'm not charging a ton for these. Reasonable pricing for top quality = fast sale You can see the original import code tags on the Xcode and V code laminate. All in from the crate/arsenal condition. I paid extra originally for +bores & +stocks to get these. The actions are perfect and smooth, they come with full kits, just need cleaning and go shooting! Interested in other Rooskie pistols/rifles/ammo in trades. As always I can do a show'n tell on how to clean/shoot these. Any would make a fantastic keeper or gift. Only 2 gorgeous Mosin ex-dragoons left.   Looking for S&W Bodyguard and/or Shield(9mm) in trades. I will add in cash with each Mosin or trade both hexes for either a Bodyguard or Shield pistol.   That dealer cost or less on these with added hand select and shipping.  Would take a couple of spam cans of 7.62x54r ammo and $100 for the Tula.  Or 2 crates for an even trade.
Only the '31 Tula hex is left.  And it may be the best of the bunch stock and metal condition wise.

**((SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY PLEASE**

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

It came in three WWII cans.  I checked the top bunch of cases in each can upon purchase and yes all were Greek ammo from the 70's.  As I was cleaning them and loading them to En blocks, I found over a third of them are actually US spec ammo from 1945.  This means they are corrosive and while shootable, one needs to be aware what you are putting down the pipe in your beloved Garand.  Not cool!  Seller said he would check all the balance of ammo he has to sell, but I'd be cautious and dump the cans out to see what was on the bottom.  The bottom held the vast majority of the Circa 1945 Rnds.    BTW - He never said I will swap out the 1945 for the Greek ammo you paid for!!    UPDATE - Seller offered to buy back corrosive ammo at 30 cents rnds, about half what I paid him for it. NICE!  Best advise, PASS and buy from reputable people.

--Trying to sell a gun with out-of-focus pics or no photo at all.
--Do you REALLY not notice that your photo is upside down?
--Is your 1911 a Series 70 or Series 80?
--Just because your AR-15 has optics and an after-market grip does not make it a ""custom"" rifle.
--Most of us know one Generation of Glock from another, but as a courtesy go ahead and provide that info.
--Oh, BTW--Gen 4 Glock pistols come with THREE mags--why are you holding out?
--Most buyers need and want more than just ""Winchester 30-30"" in the description. Is it an XTR, Ranger, Commemorative? Year of manufacture?
--Why are you asking more for your gun that what I can buy a new one for?
--A Llama 45ACP is not worth $450 no matter what you think.
--Know your AR-15 chambers. Is it .223 Rem, 5.56 NATO, or .223 Wylde?
--A 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 year old gun is not ""new"" whether it's been fired or not.
--Just because you built it does not make it worth more.
--Of course we've got pro- and anti-union users of this site, so I'm sure I'll ruffle some feathers with this next one. I'm going to peg on Colt...
Colt has a union represented by UAW (WFT?) and for about the past 35 years has done nothing but manufacture over-priced sub-standard firearms. (Do just a little research and learn how they screwed around and lost the M16A2 contract.) At one time the Rampant Colt truly deserved its premium price and prestige--but those days are long gone. If you want to dish out over a grand for a run of the mill 1911 that has the Colt name on it, go ahead, it's your money.

1987 MERCEDES BENZ 300D TURBO DIESEL, CLEAN TITLE IN HAND, TAGS GOOD TILL MAY, 2015.

4-door sedan. A/T, P/S, P/B. Power seats. Power windows. Power door locks. Alpine AM-FM-CD (mp3-compatible) stereo. Spacious trunk. 29 MPG highway! I drove this car to work and back every day for four years without a problem. I just don't need it anymore.

THE GOODS: Engine was replaced around 150k miles (373k on car = 223k on engine.) Transmission was maintained regularly by MBI Motors in Portland. Radiator, hoses, belts, and starter: all replaced in 2010. Good rubber.

THE BADS: A/C not cooling. Sunroof & rear windows stuck closed. Passenger side mirror cracked. Driver's door panel is loose, probably easy fixes.  I just don't have time right now to work on it.

BIO-DIESEL CAR: This is an ideal candidate for running 100% biodiesel.  I run 5% - 20% biodiesel in it all the time, and it runs fine.  Mercedes makes the toughest car diesel engines. This is a dependable daily driver. I wouldn't hesitate to drive it to L.A. tomorrow. 

I'll meet the prospective buyer with the title in Vancouver or NE Portland.  I just need a day's advance notice."
