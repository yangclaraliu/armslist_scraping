I've put a lot of Wilson Combat, and STI parts on this including, extended mag release, main spring housing with better stippling, match grade trigger (Wilson Combat in it and STI extra), hammer and sear, extended palm grip safety, long guide rod, recoil spring kit, magwell bevel, front stippling piece(removable), and I have an Ed Brown match grade ""drop in"" barrel that I never had fitted for the gun (needs minimal fitting). It also comes with 3 pairs of grips, the rose wood and black ones that came with the gun and a pair of VZ grips.

51,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3283051,For Sale:  Awesome MI SSK12 - Comes Loaded with Optic & Every Upgrade You Could Want,"Bellevue, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,550","Listed On: Tuesday, July 15, 2014",Rifles,no type,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is easily the nicest rifle you'll find on here for the money, and likely almost anywhere else one may look. For those not familiar with the MI SSK12 Minute Man rifle, it is an AR-15 that comes with a great and very nice looking billet receiver set made by MI. Though a great rifle out of the box, I made many upgrades to better accommodate my needs for competition shooting. With the upgrades that have been made, you're buying a rifle that you would be hard pressed to further improve upon at a price less than that of the stock rifle, not to mention the $1000+ (far more with sales tax included) I have invested in the rifle through improvements and upgrades after purchasing the rifle new in October 2013

Among these upgrades are a brand new 16"" 1:7 twist DRD hammer forged chrome lined barrel that I had installed in place of the original barrel in early June (poor timing on my part but at the time I had no plans to move abroad). The rifle has been taken to the range twice since installing this new barrel with roughly 100-200 rounds having been fired. The reason for switching barrels was to improve accuracy as the DRD uses polygonal rifling as well as being cold hammer forged. The accuracy with this new barrel is easily sub-MOA, quite possibly closer to 1/2 MOA. Other upgrades include the Magpul UBR Stock, Magpul Pro Sights, a Fortis compensator/muzzle brake, and a Geissele Super Dynamic Enhanced Flat two-stage trigger with a smooth 2 lb. first stage and a crisp 1.5 lb. second stage (Note that the Geissele trigger is not pictured as it was just installed and the trigger shown in the pictures is a Timney). The rifle originally came with a shorter 13"" rail, but I had this replaced with a new MI Gen 2 quad rail when the new barrel was recently installed. A Weaver 1-5x tactical scope with offset mount and a Sight Docter mini red-dot sight is also included. Another nice feature is the upgraded BCG which is a Titanium Boron (TiN) Bolt Carrier Group. You can see the gold coloring of this BCG in the photos and in addition to improving the look, this bcg is very tough due to this coating, quite easy to clean and maintain, and functions flawlessly. 

As I'm preparing to move abroad where I will not have any use for my weapons, I'm selling two rifles, including this one, and one 1911 handgun. This rifle had originally sold for just over $1600 when I purchased it last fall and the value of the aforementioned upgrades has been well over $1,000. When you factor in the sales tax, this price is quite a bargain. The listing price of $1,550 includes the optic but I am willing to sell the rifle without the scope and with a JP single stage trigger for $1,450. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!

123,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3283123,For Sale:  Ultra Compact Adjustable Stock (UCAS) - MP5 style stock similar to NEA PDW or M231 stock,"Bellevue, Seattle, Washington",$ 350,"Listed On: Wednesday, August 20, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a number of these very short MP5 style stocks for sale.  I'd been looking for something like this for some time but was unable to find anything close that also functioned well.  You can see how this stock looks in the pic of my new SBR below.  
Included with purchase is the stock, castle nut, receiver end plate, two different sized shoulder rests, and the custom buffer spring system that enables your rifle to function with just a 3.5 inch buffer.  This buffer spring system is compatible with any mil-spec bcg.  With respect to the two shoulder rests that may be attached to the stock, one is larger one and one is just over half that size small (very similar in size to that of the NEA).  The larger one is pictured on my SBR while the smaller one may be pictured in other pics or I’m happy to provide additional photos.  In my opinion this smaller rest wasn't as comfortable and didn't provide enough shoulder support but to each their own.
Please contact me if you're interested.  I'm happy to ship within the U.S. as well for a cost of $25 for priority shipping, though clearly willing to negotiate for larger orders.  Also happy to accommodate bulk or mini-bulk orders at significant discounts.  At this point I’m simply testing the waters to gauge interest, market size, and  conservative growth expectations to determine whether this is in fact a viable opportunity worth a more meaningful investment.  I had these stocks created after searching and searching for a similar stock and while I found a few used M231 stocks, used NEA stocks, and a few others but the asking prices were $500+ with many including no extra buffer systems required to use the stock, thus creating an additional cost of $100 to $300 depending on the system.                                
Coincidentally, after I’d been on the NEA waitlist for 6-8 months and had lost faith that they were in fact going to continue with production, I received an email earlier today that NEA is again taking orders.  Thankfully the price has come down a bit and hopefully they will have ironed out previous capacity constraints that seemed to hinder production. Further information is provided through the following link:  http://www.theammosource.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=2177                
Though I have not had personal experience with the new LWRC Stock found on their new PDW: IC PSD, I find few of their products to be subpar.  Unfortunately this stock will not be sold individually, or this isn’t in the cards in the foreseeable future.  I also wish they would use this stock on more than just the 6.8.  You can see some images and a little info through the following link:  http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2012/11/27/new-pdw-from-lwrc-ic-psd/  
Having been discouraged in my search, I approached a local plastics and aerospace manufacturer who in turn made several introductions to factories willing to accommodate my needs of building a functional, minimalist stock that can stand up to abuse, and have an attractive look. After an initial prototype, we made a few changes and came up with the product pictured.  Should you purchase a stock, I would greatly appreciate any thoughts on ways to further improve the stock in any way.
Discounted rates begin with orders as small as 5 stocks and pricing information for larger orders is outlined below.  I’m also open to unique arrangements that may be mutually beneficial so if you have an ideas or proposals, just let me know and I will do my best to accommodate.  Thanks.
Orders of:
	1 - 4 Units @ $350/unit
	5 - 10 Units @ $335/unit
	11 - 25 Units @ $315/unit
	26 - 50 Units @ $300/unit
	51+ Units Negotiable but will not exceed $275/unit
Again, each unit ordered includes the stock, castle nut, end plate, and custom short buffer system compatible with any mil-spec standard bcg (I'm happy to provide additional info on the buffer system upon request)."

It is a MAB Model D. MAB is an acronym for a French company that translates to Manufacture of Arms of Bayonne. The MAB Model D is modeled after the FN/Browning Model 1922. MAB made very good quality pistols. This is a milsurp pistol manufactured between 1945 and 1953, I believe. This gun has the ""palm tree"" mark on the trigger guard to indicate it was a military or police pistol in Morocco. The palm tree makes this a collector's item. It has a 9+1 capacity and comes with one magazine. There are three safeties. The first is the thumb lever on the left side of the slide forward of the grip. The second is the grip safety on the back of the frame. The third is the magazine safety. It has target grips and a target rear sight, for import I believe. If the grips and the sight are replaced with the original type this becomes a very slim pistol. As it is this pistol would be excellent for training a new shooter with its good grip, sight picture, and light recoil. All numbered parts match the gun. I am asking $225 cash."

This is one of the best AR's on the market due to the custom fitting of the upper and the lower at the factory, this creates one of the smoothest and tightest lockups you find in an AR15 platform.
Matched up with a ESS 16"" Nitrided barrel, 1/9 twist and you'll shoot accurate and never worry about rust or corrosion.
In addtion to this we have a low profile gas block with picatinney rail for iron sight and a Bushnell Banner 4x12x40 with BDC.
Next we have Magpull hand guard and a really cool Ace skeleton stock.

This is the very hard to find pre safety model with the golden trigger. I have owned this for several years and it has always been stored in my warm air circulate safe. It has only been fired a handful of times and is in almost mint condition. The metal is perfect but there are two very light scratches on the stock from rubbing on another gun in the safe. Very light but they are there. Otherwise, this gun looks as new. It is a very nice gun with the JM stamp and manufactured in 1979 which was the first year this .357 was produced. Will also include a nice brand new $35 soft case. I would rate this rifle at 97-98%.

I have for sale an ATI PX2 Pump-Action Shotgun. Brand New. I'm selling because I can't afford to keep them, I'm switching careers into real estate and need the cash to help get me through starting out. If you send me a low-ball offer, I'm just going to laugh at you. This is new in box. If you want to buy a used gun, feel free to look at the used items around the site and find something that's still higher priced. I'm taking a loss on this, but close enough to breaking even that it'll enable me to start my new career with my mind at ease.

I'll be throwing in a 5 loose Winchester Super Speed 1 oz Game Loads with the shotgun.

No Tax. I will sell face to face, in a public place like a Wal-Mart or Academy parking lot with a bill of sale. I am willing to meet somewhere near me (NE SA) or somewhere halfway between us. You must be able to purchase a firearm and show either a TX Driver's License or TX CHL. I will provide two copies of the bill of sale for us to fill out. 

$200. The MSRP on these is $300, and at most retailers sell for $200 to $225 + $15 tax or up to $35 shipping + $20+ FFL fee. Locally that's going to be $250 from what I could find. No tax, FFL fee or background check required as I am not a dealer. This is a great deal, and ready to go for a great home defense solution with the ammo tossed in.

Non-stock photos available upon request.

I have 14 of them and love each and every one. I recently got my Uncle's GP100 .357 4 inch model that looks like it has been shot very little if at all. I already have a 4 inch GP100 so I would like to trade for a 6 inch GP100 .357. This one is stainless as I would want the 6 inch to be stainless as well. I am willing to add $50 cash for gas or so you can buy the more modern Hogue Monogrips. The old School Ruger panel grips sell on ebay between $60 and $80 a pair by the way. Anyways If you have a stainless 6 inch Gp100 and would like $50 cash and a stainless 4 inch GP100 let me know. Thanks! I'm in Summerville and a CWP holder. If you are interesting in buying these are on average around $550 plus tax. I can't take any less than $400 for it. That is what I paid for it.

With so many myths surrounding the subject and the complexity of the laws as they pertain to concealed carry, there is little wonder why otherwise law-abiding citizens find themselves being prosecuted for actions they believed were both prudent and legally justified. Laws by their very nature are ambiguous, confusing, and often left to the interpretation of those who do not practice law and who may not even understand the law. To ensure you possess a comprehensive understanding of the law you could hire an attorney and pay hundreds of dollars for the consultation. If you are ever in a situation where you have no alternative but to use deadly force, a good criminal defense attorney's retainer fee can start at $30,000. Fortunately, the professional instructors at Patriot Training and Consulting can provide you with information that may not only save your life, but could help you to avoid criminal prosecution. The information is presented in an educated, yet easy to understand format which students of all levels appreciate. In comparison, the cost of attending either your initial Concealed Carry Handgun training or Legal Issues Refresher training through PatriotTAC is a small investment to help avoid finding yourself on the wrong side of the courtroom. On Saturday, January 31st, PatriotTAC will host a Concealed Carry Handgun Course in Holly Ridge. Don't miss this opportunity to save money and to attend Eastern North Carolina's Number One Class. Register now as seats are limited. If you don't think you can learn a lot from a concealed carry course, this IS the course for you! For more information and to register, go to www.PatriotTAC.com"

Update: 7/19/2014 (Took a little trip to a specialty shop, good trip as it turns out) - ""The IAI MXXX were 1911 pistols that were originally built in Israel. The frame and slide were both forged there, as well as the small parts. They early models (marked with the Star of David) were all built in Israel, while later models were essentially parts kits sourced from the Philippines. From what I've read the early models are pretty desirable (if you're looking for an Israeli 1911) as there weren't that many that made it to America. There isn't a whole lot of information out there about them."""

This is a Winchester model 100 in .308 caliber in used but excellent condition. It includes one 4 round removable magazine. The bluing is in great shape with some minor wear at the usual carrying points - the bottom of the mag and side of barrel at caliber marking. Bore is great as is the wood. There are no cracks, gouges or dings in the wood and butt plate and pistol grip cap are nice without cracks or chips. Wood is a nice dark walnut with an oil finish. There is a Red field Tracker 3-9 scope mounted on a Weaver tip off base. All are in great condition and as a bonus the recall for firing pin breakage has been performed. This is a real nice example of a well cared for rifle. Flat $30 shipping fee to lower 55"

934,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3283934,For Sale:  Mako FAB Defense MWG Magwell Grip with SERIAL NUMBER WINDOW,"Aurora, Denver, Colorado",$ 20,"Listed On: Monday, September 15, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"NEW MWG FAB Defense Black Magazine Well Grip  $20







This accessory acts as a comfortable forward vertical grip and a magazine well funnel for quick magazine changes. Manufactured from reinforced polymer composite, it is lightweight and extremely durable. Unlike some ugly aftermarket magwell funnels, the MWG looks good on any rifle.  NEW CONDITION, But may not be in original packaging.







This is the model with the serial number window.







The MWG is designed in two halves that are placed around the magazine well. Three hex screws hold the two halves together. It extends below the magazine well to form an effective funnel to speed reloads. The front is finger-grooved and textured for a comfortable, secure hold, and the additional width give a more comfortable grip than the bare receiver. For those who worry that hand pressure on a magazine could cause malfunctions (I have never seen this happen), the MWG keeps the hand off of the magazine.

Because there are slight variations in civilian lower receivers between manufacturers in the US, the MWG may require slight fitting for some lowers. The most common differences are in the size of the lip at the magwell opening and the radius below the pivot pin. We have found it to be a drop-in fit on some receivers, while others need a bit of dremel work on the grove that fits the bottom of the magazine well, or a bit of file work on the part of the MWG that fits under the pivot pin. We have even seen variations between receivers from the same manufacturers, with the MWG fitting some of their lowers but needing adjustment for others.  Rifles with recievers that are radically different in shape from the milspec pattern may require extensive fitting or may not work with the MWG.

Not compatible with Beta-C Twin Drum Mags or Magpul 10 round magazines."

The rifle normal sells from $900 to $1000 used. I am selling mine for $600 because the bolt was lost during a move. It cost $300 to get a new one and I figured I will sell at a loss. You will not find a rifle this accurate ever in your life for this price. It would cost you more to fix up a rem 700 or a savage 110. this rifle will out preform both rem and savage out of the box.
