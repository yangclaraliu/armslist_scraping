BELOW ARE THE SPECS FROM SIG'S WEBSITE:

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer. MSRP: $466.00

Please do your research on this rifle. MSRP is $1793. This configuration is hard to find. MI sights are almost $200 on their own. Call some local gun stores, this rifle is $1100 to 1200 all day long plus tax and without the brand new sights which are the best on the market. If you can find a better deal on a piston driven battle rifle then buy it."

I have been trying not to get political in my ads as I don't want to fan the fires of paranoia, conspiracy etc. etc.
But if anyone is paying attention to the hillary campaign and she gets in we are screwed.
Every time I hear something it gets worse. We will be begging for the clinton 1994 assault weapons ban which by the way was just going to be a starting point for them.
I really believe the fix is in and the money/power people have decided and the [my] vote doesn't count and she is all but in.
Look at the direction commiefornia is heading. I couldn't live there. Look what happened in Washington [I-594] Look what's happening in Oregon.
If you don't believe in the NRA find some other organization to support in the fight for our rights. To do nothing is going to be to lose.
Support this forum so we can communicate with each other or all we will be doing on here is talking about what is the best 2 round magazine we can use to not shoot our gun.
Stock up now before you can't get it.
I really don't care if you get mine or get it somewhere else because in the grand scheme of things I don't care if I sell any of these or not, I have a day job and I will have mine no matter what. Sell them or shoot them, I win. On top of I'm definately not getting rich off doing this.
I do luv to ""wheel and deal"" a little and I do feel ""richer"" for all the fellow members this has given me a chance to meet and all the information and knowledge I have gained from this interaction.
Part of my motovation for saying all this is remembering all the people I had to turn down during the last shortage. Oh, you mean the one we are still going through. Don't think it's still happening. Try to find 22LR? Try to find powder in the brand and quantity when you want it. It may be better but better than horrible is still crappy. I do not deal in high volumes and back in the end of 2012 into 2013 there sure were a lot of people wishing I did because my little supply got wiped out in a weekend and I sure had to dissapoint a lot of people.
Don't get lulled into a false sense of security thinking things are OK.
Get ready for an assault on our rights like we have never seen.

The Gun is 100% Brand New and came straight home from the store to my Gun Safe and is still BRAND NEW, I have thoroughly cleaned and Lubricated it Properly Several Times as Directed by the Owner's Manual. It comes with 3 Factory Glock Magazines,.All Paperwork & Owner's Manual, a Cleaning Kit, Speed Loader, Safety Lock, Several Extra Backstraps to Customize Grip.Size, & Factory Fired Test Cartridge- All Sealed in.Factory Glock Packaging. One Fact worth noting is that this gun is exactly the same size as the Glock Model 26 9mm & Glock Model 27 .40 S&W Pistols and this Gun, the Glock Model 33 shares all of the same dimensions both inside & outside as the Glock 27 & they even share the same exact magazines. This means that for $100 you can simply buy a Glock Model 27 .40 S&W Barrel and its a direct Drop-In Replacement for the Glock 33's .357 Sig Barrel and you have a Glock 33 & Glock 27 Pistol and there is no need to buy any extra magazines unless you just want to because Glock .357 Sig/40 S&W Magazines are 100% Identical & Interchangeable so you can always use a .357/.40 S&W Ammo in the Glock 33 & 27 Magazines, the same as the Full Size Glock 22 .40/Glock 31.357 Sig, the Mid Size ""Compact"" Glock 23 .40 Caliber & Glock 32 Pistols, their magazines are fully  interchangeable and reliably hold & feed Ammo of both sizes. THE EXTRAS INCLUDED WITH THE GLOCK Model 33 Gen4 PISTOL ARE: (1) BRAND NEW FOBUS PADDLE HOLSTER, (2) BOXES OF SPEER GOLD DOT 125 GRAIN JHP AMMO, (2) X-GRIP MAGAZINE ADAPTERS THAT ALLOW THE USE OF FULL SIZE GLOCK MAGAZINES IN SUBCOMPACT PISTOLS AND IN THIS CASE THE Glock 31 .357 Sig or Glock 22 Full Size Pistol Magazines in the Subcompact Glock Model 33 Pistol increasing the Capacity from 9+1 in Stock Form. to 15+1, THE X-GRIP MAGAZINE ADAPTER MAKES THE LARGER MAGAZINE LOOK LIKE IT WAS MADE TO FIT THE SMALLER PISTOL, GIVES YOU 16.K PLUS IT ALLOWS YOU TO GET A FULL 2 HANDED GRIP ON THE PISTOL For much increased accuracy and overall control, it's like converting to a full size grip whenever you want yet still easily and totally Concealable.I'LL ALSO.INCLUDE (1) NEW BOX OF 50 .40 S&W 154 Grain FMJ Ammo made by FEDERAL BECAUSE 90% OF OWNERS WILL SPEND THE EXTRA $100 TO BUY THE .40.S&W BARREL, IT'S CRAZY NOT TO BUY IT AND HAVE 2 Guns iN ONE PACKAGE WITH SIMPLY CHANGING A BARRELL, AND MOST PEOPLE WILL FIND THE .40 S&W Ammo More Economical to Practice with if you're going to shoot a lot, the .357 Sig Ammo is a little more expensive but not really a big deal and if you reload your own Ammo or Buy it Online in Bulk it's surprisingly inexpensive and no more than other high caliber handgun.ammo like .40 S&W or .45 ACP. 
YOU ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER WHAT YOU'RE GETTING WHEN YOU BUY .357 SIG AMMO., IT'S ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AND ACCURATE SHOOTING CARTRIDGES AVAILABLE AND JUST THE NORMAL FMJ AMMO HAS MAGNUM PERFORMANCE, THE DEFENSE TYPE HOLLOW POINT CARTRIDGES HAVE EVEN HIGHER PERFORMANCE BUT EITHER TYPE HAS HAS MORE ACCURACY AND KNOCKDOWN POWER THAN BASICALLY ANY SEMI-AUTOMATIC HANDGUN- THE .357 Sig Ammo MOVES AT 1500-1700+ FEET PER SECOND AND HITS IT'S TARGET WITH A DEVASTATING 675-800 Ft./Lbs. OF ENERGY/KNOCKDOWN POWER AND THAT'S CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN 9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP and just as Powerful or More than 10mm, 460 Rowland, .400 Cor Bon & Other Specialty High Performance CALIBERS. IF YOU DON'T ALREADY LOVE THE .357 Sig IT'S JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GAVE IT A CHANCE, IT'LL BE YOUR NEW FAVORITE CARTRIDGE BECAUSE OF ITS IMPRESSIVE POWER, ACCURACY, AND EASILY CONTROLLABLE RECOIL, WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE YOU CAN HIT TARGETS  AT LONG DISTANCES AND I WOULDN'T BE SELLING THIS PISTOL UNLESS I HAD ANOTHER ONE, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A .45 TYPE OF GUY AND AS SOON AS I GOT MY FIRST.357 Sig Pistol that changed, I would rather carry the more powerful and more compact weapon with increased range, accuracy, ammo capacity. with much moreKnockdown Power and.Much Easier & Controllable Recoil. If you give it a try, this very likely be your new favorite. These Gen4 .357 Sig Pistols are even better performing than previous Glock Models and.other Pistols due to the Upgraded Dual Recoil Spring Assembly, Adjustable Grip Sizing to make the Gun and Your Hand Fit Together Better & more comfortable. plus the Gun has a more aggressive grip surface and Extended Magazine Release that makes Magazine Changes Faster & Easier plus is EASILY moved to the Opposite Side to Accommodate Left Handed Shooters. All of these Little Changes Add Up to Increased Control, Accuracy, and Increased Recoil Control for more Accurate Shooting and Follow Up. Shots.

302,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3343302,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES UNLEADED 380 Auto +P Ammo - 80 gr.

This load is the direct result of customers wanting the deep penetration of the expanding Barnes X style bullet in a 380 auto+P load. See the below real world velocities from my stock real world pistols. We always use over-the-counter firearms to establish our velocities as using extra long laboratory test barrels gives false high velocity readings and is misleading to the customer who will be firing the ammunition in the real world, not a lab.

1231 — fps - Browning Double Action-3.75 inch barrel
1235 — fps - Walther PPK-3.5 inch barrel - (faster than longer barrel above, no typo)
1130 — fps - Kel Tec PA3T-2.75 inch barrel
1136 — fps - Kahr P380-2.75 inch barrel
The all copper, long-for-weight, Barnes bullet is so long that when seated to an OAL of .940 to .950 inch, the base of the bullet will make a slight bulge in the case, but this DOES NOT affect feeding or chambering as the bulge is not pronounced enough to cause any problems, but in order to avoid endless emails, I’m mentioning it here. In fact, that bulge provides enough resistance to the bullet base, to stop the bullet from being battered deeper into the case upon feeding, which is a very good thing. If we load to a longer cartridge OAL, to eliminate the bulge, the cartridge will be too long to fit some magazines. Feeding was 100% in our over-the-counter test guns.

We are using a flash suppressed powder so the shooter will not be blinded if dropping the hammer in low light, which is when almost all civilian shootings occur in America."

Each of the pistols listed above will come with the Glock plastic case and misc cleaning rod, 2 hi-cap mags, etc.... If you want more hi-cap mags we can work out a deal on these as I have MANY including 33rd mags both Glock OEM and generic after-market.

I'm looking to sell these outright.

I've decided I don't want/can't afford to add .308 to my list of calibers so it's up for sale. It's a nice gun that shares a close parts compatibility with standard AR-15's except for the bolt, charging handle, and a couple other proprietary parts. DPMS has a chart online to show what fits and what doesn't. This gun is also really light for a .308. It doesn't feel much heavier than a regular AR-15 when you pick it up.  I kind of hate to get rid of it.  They're hard to find right now. But I'm more into AK's at the moment and don't really want to keep it around as a dust collector. As you can also see, I've duracoated some of the furniture as well as changed a lot of what DPMS originally supplies with the gun. More pics available.

We will do a Single Shot exemption (SSE) on these at the price listed. Please do your homework on this process first before asking questions if this gun can be purchased by you. We would appreciate it very much as we are very busy and get a lot of questions that can be answered ahead of time by doing a little research first. Thanks for understanding.

 ARAK-21 Upper by Faxon ARMS Adjustable Gas In Other features include:
 These sell for 1200 This has never bee fired except factory.
•The upper receiver is fully machined from an aircraft grade 6061-T6 aluminum billet in a one piece design that incorporates a full length picatinny rail (Mil-STD-1913) on the top and three additional rails on the muzzle end of the receiver, making it a full M4 style quad rail upper. The top picatinny rail is laser engraved for optic placement. There are also half-length picatinny rails available.
•12 ½” length BAU is available in 5.56, heavy profile. 16” and 20” length BAU’s are available in both the 5.56 and 300 BLK. There are two profiles to choose from, medium and heavy. BAU’s can be interchanged in less than 3 minutes by removing the (6) captive allen screws on the bottom rail using the enclosed allen wrench.
•Long stroke variable setting gas piston system. There are three options for gas flow, and one for no gas flow. This allows for single shot operation. There is also a clean out port for the gas block between the gas cylinder, and the barrel.
•Charging handle is ambidextrous, non-reciprocating, foldable, spring returned and is easily relocated from left to right side without tools by the operator.

•Model “39” Eight (8) lug bolt design with involute profile for both right and left hand versions. The extractor is positioned at 3 o’clock. This allows for a left hand version to use the same bolt by simply removing the cam pin and rotating 180 degrees and reinstalling the cam pin.

•Self-contained firing pin retention system enclosed in a rectangular bolt carrier that no longer requires a cotter pin.

•Bolted in hardened steel rail system for the bolt carrier to ride on. This allows a metal on metal wear surface for better wear characteristics and a much smoother operation.
•The ARAK-21® system allows for a folding stock to be added, as our recoil system does not extend beyond the upper receiver to fully operate. This eliminates the noise and feel of the buffer tube cycling back and forth.

 It will fit on any AR-15 Lower shown on Rock River.
 Scope, Forward Grip, Sling not included. I have seen these operate in real time and they are awesome read reviews and check out their links.

I am looking to sell my Ruger SR9 pistol. I purchased this gun brand new about a year ago, and have put about 400 rounds through it. The gun is in great shape as you can tell from my pictures. The gun was not used as a carry gun, so there is not any holster wear, and it was cleaned after most trips to the range. I have owned this gun for a while and thoroughly enjoyed my time with it. I am just looking to try something different, and cannot afford to hold more than one at a time. Included are:

I just received an ancient backorder I placed nearly a year ago. Since then I have found alternate powders to do the loading I was going to do with the BL-C(2). This powder is known as THE 308win powder and is commonly loaded in 223rem as well. For those familiar with it, it is also known as the milsurp powder WC846. I have quite a few one pound cans coming in and have no use for them now. $35/lb covers my cost+hazmat+shipping+a buck/lb for my hassle/gas money to meet up. Since this is powder I can only do FTF in the Clackamas/OC/Molalla/Gladstone area. If you want to buy it all I can ship it but its on your dime. 

More info from Hodgdon's website. 
A spherical powder that began as a military powder used in the 7.62 NATO, commonly known as the 308 Winchester. When it was first introduced to the handloader, benchrest shooters and other target shooters made it an instant success. BL-C(2) works extremely well in the 204 Ruger, 223 Remington, 17 Remington, 22 PPC and of course, the 308 Winchester, plus many more. 

$35/lb and I'd prefer to do a 2lb minimum to make it worth my time and gas."

The 92A1 has an open slide top, and curvy lines. 
The roadster inspired top reduces weight.
Beretta uses a proprietary Teflon-based paint finish on their pistols, referred to as Bruniton. 
While traditional blueing or Parkerizing is a surface-modification, Bruniton is a coating.
The finished pistols are flat-black and have little glare – which is welcomed by soldiers in combat. 
The pistol coating provides a very durable and corrosion resistant layer. 
To further inhibit corrosion, 92A1 barrels feature hard-chromed bores and chambers.
The Beretta also features an automatic firing pin catch, which is a bar that blocks the firing pins forward movement, unless the trigger is fully depressed. 
Should this pistol be dropped on a hard surface, this block prevents an accidental discharge.
The 92A1′s ergonomics are fantastic. 
The grip naturally falls into place on each string. 
The pistol points well, and shoots where aimed.
The 92A1 features an integral Mil-Spec 1913 (Picatinny) rail, comes with three 17 round magazines, an internal recoil buffer, captive recoil spring assembly, and the old-style rounded trigger guard. 
The 92A1 also features a removable front sight; you can replace or upgrade sights with relative ease.
The 92A1 has the buffer assembly developed for increased durability.

(Please serious buyer's only)

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

996,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3343996,"For Sale:  spikes upper with 20"" lightweight barrel","Lagrange, Louisville, Kentucky",$ 200,"Listed On: Saturday, August 2, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"My father and I were building an upper for him and we bought this barrel at the Knob Creek Machinegun Shoot. We paid $225 about 1.5 years ago. We then mounted it on a Spikes Tactical upper that we got for $120.  The barrel was a real tight fit and we had to use a rubber mallet and a block of wood to get it seated properly.  We then removed the front sight base and completed the upper.  We shot it a realistic 10 times to test functionality. It worked perfect but over the year it set in my dads basement unused and surface rust appeared on the untreated portion of the barrel where the sight base was before we replaced it with a low profile gas block. When we purchased the barrel we were told it was 5.56, and that is what I shot out of it when I test fired it but there are no markings on it anywhere.

I have enough projects right now so we would like $200 for it.  

If it were my money, I would match it with a stripped lower and take it to Black Dove Customs in Shelbyville and ask him to Cerakote it OD Green for $30 or so and then build it up using OD Green Mapgul parts for a cheap, lightweight presicion build.

Lower is obviously not included."
