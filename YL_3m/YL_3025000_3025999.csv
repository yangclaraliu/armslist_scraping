The camo is factory, you can check out DPMS's website and check it out for yourself.

The way I have this gun priced is the bare bones gun, and 1 DPMS metal factory magazine. Yes I know I know, there are all sorts of goodies on the gun right now, they will stay on the gun till its either sold, or until I obtain my new rifle, witch ever comes first.

How accurate is it? Im shooting quarters at 100 yards, so its pretty decent. I have a few targets that I kept to prove it.

Now how was the gun treated? I did a barrel break in procedure on the gun. I'm a slow shooter, I believe in practicing the cold bore shot, because that is the only shot that matters, the first 1. I maybe ran 20 rounds a day through it everytime I went to the range. Probably about 300 rounds through it over the course of 2 years. I've shot everything through this gun, and it has NEVER jammed.

Why am I selling it? I love Savage model 99's. I want to sell this one and add onto my savage collection. I can't own every gun ever made, so I might as well just get rid of what I'm not using.

If you have any question or want to see the gun, feel free to e-mail me, or call / text Mike at REDACTED. If I don't answer your call, leave a message and Ill get back to you as soon as I can. I work odd hours and often time loose service going out into the woods. I travel to Green Bay for work during the week, and all over the place up north on weekends, so if you would like I might be able to bring the gun to you.

The 5-digit serial number dates the action to 1940. The trigger appears to have been upgraded. There is a Neidner butt plate and grip cap, both well fitted. The stock is a beautiful piece of walnut with a rosewood forend cap. The stock multi-point pattern checkering is very well done. The one-piece Buehler mount & rings hold a vintage Weaver 1.5x-4.5x variable scope that is clear. There are some light safe induced handling marks, but overall I would rate the rifle at 98+ condition; however please view the pictures carefully, and judge for yourself."
