Below is manufacture description:

The Gemtech 7.62mm QUICKMOUNT is a precision machined, heat treated suppressor adapter. It is available in a number of thread patterns to fit most popular 7.62mm rifles currently on the market. 

 There are three main types of QUICKMOUNTS available: Tensioning, VORTEX, and Standard ""Phantom"" style mounts. 

 The Tensioning style, which is generally for longer bolt action rifles not requiring a true flash hider. It is threaded from the front, telescoping back over the barrel, which must be specially profiled to fit this mount. This makes a shorter overall profile, moving the suppressor back further, and also tensions the last inches of barrel for accuracy. It has no flash hider slots, as this portion of the mount is behind the crown. 

 The VORTEX is for the ultimate in flash reduction and accuracy: GEMTECH and Smith Enterprises have joined forces to offer a QUICKMOUNT version of the proven Vortex tm flash hider (5/8-24 only). This gives the best flash reduction available when using your rifle with or without the suppressor mounted. 

 The Standard 7.62mm QUICKMOUNT fits our HVT, QUICKSAND and older TPR-S suppressors. It features a more conventional flash hider design, and is available in the most thread pitches for a wide variety of host weapons, such as: 5/8-24 (DPMS, Armalite, etc.), M18x1mm (Sako TRG or Tikka, Blaser LRS), M18x1.5 (Accuracy International), M14x1mm LH (AK-47), 9/16-24 LH ( FN FAL), and 1/2-28 (does not fit 5.56mm suppressors, some 6.8SPC and 6.5 rifles use this pitch, and it may be used to fit an HVT or QUICKSAND for subcaliber usage on 5.56mm weapons), M15x1mm (HK 91),and M13x1mm RH ( Galil). 

 For M1A rifles (except SOCOM 16"") you can utilize a 5/8-24 threaded flash hider mount (Phantom or Vortex) with our M1A Adapter. 

 As a safety feature, our 5.56mm suppressors will *not* fit onto our 7.62mm adapters.

HP Silver Bear ammo, so I was very pleased to say the least.  With a better trigger, 1/2"" groups or better should be easy to obtain consistently with little effort.  The pic of the PRS stock is shown on a different upper.

$800 firm in cash or better in trades for the upper and scope only, the lower is NOT included at this price.  Or sell upper for $660 and the scope for $160.  If offering a trade, please let me know if your offer is for just the upper or the upper and scope.  I may also trade the complete rifle if someone has something really nice to offer or maybe a good multi-gun trade to offer.

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, but will consider trading as long as the value is there, otherwise, I'll pass on trades and wait for cash.  

If wanting to do some type of trade, please state if your offer is for both or just the upper, what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.

I can always use more 5.56 ammo, prefer in this order, M855 / SS109 62gr., 5.56 55gr., then .223 ammo last.  I like semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants, pistols, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag.  Pistol caliber carbines like Beretta CX4 9mm, maybe the .45ACP model.  Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44) and shotguns(Mossberg 590 models & 930 SPX), but I will consider these as well, depending on the deal and values.  

Might also consider quality optics as well, would like to try the Nikon M-223 4-16x42mm or maybe a nice Vortex on one of my AR's.  I have plenty already, but will consider more ammo to help make a deal happen, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

Ftf in or around the Garland area.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed, no worries on shipping, you will get everything as described."

It has been to the range twice.  Total round count is under 50.  It shoots extremely well.  I lost interest in it and it has been in my safe since then.  I am interested in a cash sale or interesting trades to high end handguns.  I will consider all offers.  The worst I can do is say no.  Below is the description of the gun as printed by Bushmaster.

   The DCM Competition Model combines all the features we've seen as ""modifications"" by High Power Competitors - to create a rifle that can help you win ""right out of the box""! Bushmaster has designed a rifle for the serious DCM Competition Shooter. In keeping with DCM (Department of Civilian Marksmanship) High Power Competition Rules, this rifle looks like a ""stock AR-15"" type rifle, but includes all the modifications and upgrades that will give you a competitive edge. All the features built into this superb competition rifle result from years of observation and discussions with competitors at the Camp Perry National High Power Matches. These special accurizing features include: The M16A2 Dual Aperture Rear Sight is specifically modified to accept interchangeable apertures available in four sizes to suit the competitor's vision and preference... .036""; .040"" (Standard); .046"" or .052"" diameter. Additionally, the sight can be configured for a choice of 1/2"" or 1/4"" Minute of Adjustment for both Windage Knob and Elevation Drum. 
   The Competition Front Sight is specially ground on three sides for optimum clarity, and is available in the shooter's choice of two widths (.052"",or .062""). It is secured within the front sight base by a set screw to avoid the possibility of any movement once the rifle has been ""zeroed"". 
   The 20"" Bushmaster Extra Heavy Competition Barrel is a full 1"" diameter under the free float tube, and is precision button rifled 1 turn in 8"" - right hand twist - 6 lands and grooves. The Barrel material is ChromeMoly Vanadium Steel, and the Firing Chamber is machined to SAAMI specifications. It is lead lapped and hardened to Rockwell C26 to 32. Unlike many other Bushmaster Barrels, this barrel is not Chrome lined. 
   In the Upper Receiver, the Bolt is carefully matched to the Barrel Extension Lugs for precise lockup, maximum strength and optimum accuracy. 
   The Lower Receiver houses a finely honed Two Stage Competition Trigger that is factory set for a 3.5 lb. first stage and a 1 lb. let-off (second stage). This 4.5 lb. total trigger pull meets CMP/NRA competition regulations. 
   The handguard set looks like government issue parts, but is actually a Competition ""Free Floater"" Tube (handguard tube/barrel nut combination). It does not contact the Barrel forward of the Receiver. A sling swivel is attached to the forward end of the tube to avoid any possibility of deflection or pressure on the barrel that could degrade accuracy. 
   The Buttstock has been improved for competition with the addition of a 3.62 lb. lead ""Counterbalance Weight"" which can be trimmed by the competitor to achieve a comfortable balance and solid feel. 
   Shipped in a Lockable Hard Case with Operator's Safety Manual, 2 - 10 Round Magazines, Chamber Checker Range Safety Device; Black Web Sling; and Break-In/Maintenance Instructions specific to the DCM Competition Barrel."

The weapon has never been fired, is perfectly clean and free of any cosmetic or functional damage. It comes with all original paperwork (the original box was mangled when I bought it, sadly) and parts. Photos show an aftermarket-installed ATI 5-shell holder on the stock; this can be removed and replaced with the original adjustable cheekrest or left on. Either way, the shell holder comes free with the gun. Additionally, the shotgun has a factory-installed tactical flash hider, ATI stock/grip, and side and top-mounted accessory rails for lights and optics.

This listing is for FIVE Boxes, a total of 125 cartridges or rounds; winning buyer, however, may take any number of additional five box lots we have on hand at the same per-box price and no extra shipping. Do the math. Remington Golden Saber ammunition comes 25 cartridges to the box, not 20 rounds like competitors Federal, Winchester, PMC, and Mag-tech. That’s 20 percent more ammo for your money. Here is Remington's unmatched high performance load for the .380 Auto, its Golden Saber 102 grain Bronze Jacketed Hollowpoint. Here is what Remington says about the Golden Saber line: Golden Saber high performance jacket handgun ammo, the driving band makes the difference bullet diameter directly ahead of the driving band is reduced from groove to bore diameter, so the bullet is precisely aligned before the driving band engages the rifling. The result: match grade accuracy and reduced barrel friction. The driving band locks the jacket and core together for maximum weight retention and core/jacket integrity. This load is the 102 grain BJHP Load, Bronze Jacketed Hollow Point. It clocks out of a 3 1/2 inch Beretta Cheetah at 940 fps, and delivers a magnum-grade 200 foot pounds of energy at the muzzle. These cartridges come 25 to the box, enough to charge two magazines for a Hi-Cap Beretta 84. Similar loads fetch $1.50 per cartridge. Our Remingtons figure 63 cents per cartridge. We’re offering the peerless Remington .380 ACP Gold Saber ammunition in 5 box lots at only $ 15.80 per box. Own 5 boxes for only $ 79.00.

Bushmaster’s Carbon 15 made its debut at the 2006 SHOT Show in Vegas with mixed reviews. It has proven itself well in the past 8 years. Not only has its high impact polymer receiver held up, the Carbon 15 outclasses its new no-frills competitors who do not have a Forward Bolt Assist, the C-15 is equipped with one. This M-4 type carbine also has a 16 inch standard barrel, 18 inches including the 3 slot serrated cage flash suppressor; and it comes in traditional matte military finish. This variant has a full length 13 slot Picatinny or Weaver type rail on top of the receiver. It is Optics Ready, then, and it comes with a YHM two leaf aperture, flip up rear sight and conventional post front sight. Here is what the factory says about the Carbon 15: Features of this lightweight, semi-automatic rifle include a standard barrel with a Gov't. mil. spec. chrome lining in both bore and chamber for optimum durability and accuracy. The 16 inch barrel, and all the steel components, are manganese phosphate coated for complete protection against exterior corrosion or rust. The receivers, upper and lower, are precision molded polymer for maximum lightness and strength. The upper receiver includes an integral cartridge case deflector and a last round bolt hold open feature to alert the shooter of an empty magazine. Forward bolt assist enables the operator to continue firing under the most hostile and dirty conditions; and here the Carbon 15 stands out from its similarly priced competitors. The ribbed front handguard offers increased control and heat dissipation and is molded of mil. spec. polymer thermoset composite. Buttstock is 6 position retractable C-AR / M4 type that extends the overall length from 32 1/4 inches to 36 inches. All of these features on this variant of Bushmaster’s C15M4 series makes this not only the lightest AR-15 type rifle on the market, but the best value on the market for features offered. It comes with a factory issue 30 shot steel magazine. Replacement price on similarly equipped rifles, if a person can even find one, is upwards of $1000.00 apiece. We're offering Carbon 15 in the photos , however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 569.00. 2% Discount if payment is by USPS Money Order & Not Credit Card. Not transferable to civilians in Aurora IL, California, Chicago / Cook County IL, Connecticut, D.C., Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, or any jurisdiction that restricts AR15 Rifles or 30 shot magazines.

Been to the range twice.
ATI Talon 6-position tactical stock with Scorpion recoil reduction. To me it feels more like a 16 gauge when using 00 or slugs, and similar to a 20 when using regular 7.5 shot. Attached is the Warhammer Rail that can be used to add pretty much anything you want to it. Currently there's a TRUGLO red/green dot sight on it. You can select between several reticle types and adjust brightness to fit your needs. Below it is a NEBO tactical light/laser combo. You can select light, laser, light/laser, or strobe. It has had exactly 66 shells put through it (plus whatever they used during QC). 00, 000, slugs, and 7.5. Handles perfectly. If this listing is still up, I've still got it.

Cash only people get shells thrown into the deal. 100 + a box of PDX1 Segmented Slugs. Trade must equal $700."

Here is a specimen of Remington’s tried and true model 870 Express that we have outfitted with a +2 blue steel Choate tactical magazine extension and clamp. Shotgun manufacturer is Remington Arms; construction is matte finished blue steel, with black anodized alloy trigger group housing. Buttstock and forend are DuPont black synthetic with textured panel inlays. Buttstock length of pull is 12 3/4 inches from the trigger face to the end of the factory 1 inch recoil pad. Since the 20 gauge is built on an LT20 lightweight action, weight empty is 6 pounds 4 ounces empty with the center of gravity at the front of the receiver. Barrel is 21 inch Vent Rib Rem-Choke, with Modified, Steel shot compatible .598 diameter Rem-Choke tube; and replacement Rem-Chokes are readily available throughout the country. Star of this particular show is the blue steel CMT Magazine extension with matching stabilizer clamp that carries a sling swivel. It has an oversize spring and no-break orange hi-viz shell follower. Caliber is 20 gauge, 2 3/4 inch or 3 inch shells interchangeably; and the Choate Extension brings capacity up to 6 + 1 on 2 3/4 inch or 5 + 1 on 3 inch shells. Buyers who want to hunt with this shotgun under 2+1 capacity statutes will need to get a 12 inch dowel for a plug or adapter; we had to modify the magazine tube interior in order for the extension to work. This is a lightweight shotgun designed for lightweight or recoil sensitive shooters. It is much more effective and comprehensive than a handgun in most situations, and the sighting qualities of the ventilated rib coupled with a wide target pattern give it qualities no handgun can ever have. Replacement pricing on similarly equipped shotguns is upwards of $600 in many areas, and they aren’t easy to come by.

Manufacturer is Colt’s Mfg. Co. LLC of Hartford, CT; model is Match Competition HBAR, so marked on the left side of the receiver. Type is M16 style gas operated semi automatic rifle. Construction is steel barrel, bolt, trigger, hammer, and internal parts assembled into forged alloy upper and lower receivers. Barrel is 20 inch with six groove 1:9 right hand twist, chrome lined bore. Outside diameter is fully .725 from the chamber area to the muzzle area recess, with counterbore crowned muzzle. Chambering is .223 Remington and 5.56x45 NATO interchangeably. Sight system is classic post A2 elevation adjustable front, with a flat top Picatinny 13 slot rail system holding a factory Mag-pul MBUS flip up rear sight with dual aperture that is windage and elevation adjustable. The rifle’s front sight will not even be visible for 3x magnification or higher. Upper receiver incorporates a Forward Bolt Assist and deflector. Trigger is .300 smooth faced steel two stage, and the photo specimen gauged at 7 pounds with negligible felt creep. Buttstock is classic A2 type fixed with trapdoor compartment, its length of pull measures 13 1/2 inches from the trigger face to the end of the buttplate. Magazine is Colt Factory 9 shot, steel body and spring with polymer cartridge follower and bumper floorplate piece. We will be very happy to sub a factory Colt 20 or 30 shot magazine for the 9 rounder, for buyers residing in jurisdictions where those are civilian legal. Overall length is 38 inches, and weight empty is 8 pounds 4 ounces with center of gravity at the back of the forend pieces. Each rifle comes in its original factory box like the one shown in the photos, with cleaning rod, brush, manual, 1 1/4 inch black cotton sling, chamber protector, instruction manual and factory registration form. This MT6700 variant is no longer on any Colt Factory website, or in any of our distribution channels.

  A word on quality; prices are dependent on quality, and I prefer 'rougher' guns for shooting as opposed to 'crown jewel' Mosins(meaning they've never been shot, or are gorgeous examples, etc). I already have my prize Mosin, so I'm looking for, and I'm sure the Soviets would approve of my choice; ""quantity over quality"". I will not consider any Mosin missing major pieces, or with really poor rust/pitting issues. Anything else, however, is on the table. I love rough stocks, painted bolts, etc.


The picture below shows Mosins I have purchased in the last 30 days, and are meant to represent what I'm looking for. I paid $100 for the vast majority of them, which had some rough stocks and sticky bolts. That is my preferred price but again, nicer Mosins equal more cash.


   A short word on trade; I have plenty of things, not just firearms, for trade. For starters however, I have had much success with the following offer: I have several Type 53's lying about, and I love trading them for two 91/30's apiece. The '53's are double the worth of a regular Mosin, and a lot of folks seem to love the smaller carbine with the flip out bayonet for ease of storage(as opposed to the very long, somewhat bulky 91/30), whereas I vastly prefer the standard model, and have specifically built storage areas for them, so it works out as a win-win. If you are interested in this kind of trade, you will receive not only top priority, but you will be able to select your own rifle from whatever '53's I have at the time. If that means I have a dozen, I lay them out on the table and you pick whichever one you like best. This is personally my favorite, and most successful, type of deal. Depending on your Mosin quality, I will even throw cash/ammo/accessories on top of the rifle itself.


Other items for trade:

-MRE sides-237 available-choices such as cookies, biscuits, pretzels, etc. Actually very tasty.
-7.62x39/7.62x54R ammunition
-Snowboards
-Tons of paintball gear(guns, hoppers, masks, you name it)
-A selection of very unique black powder firearms, including a 2lb trader cannon!
-Mosins, and lots of them.
-Cold, hard, cash moneys.
-Other firearms go in and out depending on how interesting they are. I generally have a .45ACP pistol around, or a tactical shotgun, etc.
-Medieval weaponry(swords, axes, etc)
-Training bow w/ 6 arrows(40lb-ish draw weight, excellent for first-timers)
-Full size saloon-style pool table, New in Box.



  Again, quantity over quality. I'm looking for more Mosins, not straight 1-1 trades, if at all possible. I should mention that I do have one of the rarest Mosins in the world, but that is not available for trade(unless you have something in the realm of 100 Mosins). It is for sale, but I am in no hurry to part with this beauty. By far the prettiest Mosin I've ever seen, and I've had thousands pass through these hands over the last decade. It is a Stalinist Honor Guard rifle, with brass piping and inlaid painted numbers. I do not believe it has ever been shot; the only other Guard rifle I've seen was in a war museum in Moscow, just a few feet from Vasily Zaytsev's sniper rifle. There are roughly 70 known to exist and all of them are in private collections.


Other items I'm interested in:

-Rock Island 1911's
-Cheaper-cost pistols(9mm's and .45's especially)
-All Mosins, any variant, any model, any manufacturer, any condition
-Maxim/MG42 machine guns(not necessarily automatic, semi's work fine too)
-AK's, and AR pattern rifles.
-Unique, interesting, other otherwise 'fun' firearms.




   I should note I cannot accept faux or 'display' of any kind. I pride myself on maintaining a collection that is real; not even my medieval sword collections are 'display' pieces, each one is razor sharp and made from carbon steel.



Special attention will be paid to those with a ton of Mosins, or a Maxim. The Maxim is the last piece to my Russian collection; if you have it, I will find something you want just as badly.

Producer is Colt Manufacturing Company of Hartford, CT. Construction is stainless steel barrel, with steel bolt, trigger, and internal parts assembled into lightweight alloy upper and lower receivers. It comes with a 24 inch stainless heavy barrel that is completely free-floating, except for the gas mechanism. Outside diameter on the photo specimen measured .730 at the muzzle, .745 at the gas port, and .945 behind the gas port. Bore is right hand six groove 1:9 twist, and this rifle will perform with exceptional accuracy with any bullet weight. Trigger is .290 Stainless National Match two stage. Photo specimen pulled at 5 1/4 pounds with negligible felt creep. Weight empty is 9 1/4 pounds; and the conventional raised military sight system is completely gone, in favor of a 13 slot Picatinny rail upper that accepts any standard Weaver type mounting devices. Colt has included their factory #W2975, alloy body scope mount like the one in the factory photo we have attached. Each rifle comes in its original factory box with manual, cable lock and scope mount. This AR comes with one factory nine round magazine, and it will accept any conventional M-16 type magazines. We will be happy to sub a factory 20 or 30 round magazine for the 9 rounder, for buyers who reside in jurisdictions where those are legal. Despite its unparalleled match capabilities, and despite the absence of a bayonet lug, this rifle will still not pass muster for transfer to California. Replacement price on this rifle, if a person can even find one, is upwards of $2,000 in our area. Its most recent wholesale price was over $1300. We're offering the HBAR 6724 in the photo, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 1139.00. 2% discount if payment is with USPS Money Orders and not Credit Card.

Besides being light, small and concealable, it offers easy use, adjustable sights, an ultra-reliable low-recoil mechanism and a tough, durable finish that--with proper care--will give you a virtual lifetime of service.

Weighing only 11.5oz unloaded, this double-action-only (DAO) pistol is comfortable and unobtrusive to carry, no matter your preferred mode. The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts.

The Pico is soft-recoiling and makes target recovery lightning-quick after every shot, thanks to its minimal barrel tilt. This feature also makes feeding utterly reliable, even with more open hollowpoint designs or the hotter .380 commercial loads. This means that when you need it for concealed carry or home protection, the Pico will always deliver the performance you expect of a Beretta.

Here is link to take a peak at gallery of guns which is a very legitimate gun seller. 

http://www.galleryofguns.com/genie/default.aspx?pg=list&mfg=Colt&mdlno=Rail+Gun

The grips on the gun were 110.00 dollars because of the custom embedded colt medallion.

It has a custom fitted egw barrel bushing fit to .00015 to slide and .002 to barrel which was 40.00

This package also comes with 3 extra magazines that the gun did not come with from the factory.

2 Metalform 8 round magazines. 55.00

1 shooting star 7 round mag 20.00

also included is a egw flared magwell-20lpi mainspring housing 70.00

So i think it is fair to value gun at 1100 dollars. At the indy 1500 there were 4 railguns i saw there for over 1200 dollars before tax. 

So doing the math the price of gun with the things included in package comes to 1395.00 so 1200 asking price is fair."

This is a WW2 era September 1944 Springfield M1 Garand, serial # 3151xxx. That's right - almost a year before the war was over! This rifle came from the CMP with a 1954 Springfield barrel and Springfield trigger group. This gun has spec'd out very well (see details below). If you want a great wartime collector's gun that you can shoot, this Garand is for you. This gun was recently disassembled, parts inspected for tolerance (see details below), greased, oiled and thoroughly cleaned. The wood was also cleaned and retreated with several coats of linseed oil. It's a smooth operating piece of equipment! Sale includes sling (shown), CMP case, and certification as shown. Details: Barrel: 1954 Springfield. Barrel threads sharp and undamaged. Barrel crown is smooth. Gas port measures .071"" (tolerance=.0790"" +/- .0015""). MW=2, TE=2 Bullet guide: No notch on bullet guard. Accelerator cam surface measured .176"" (tolerance=.179"" +/- .004""). Follower parts: Follower rod: Fork shows no cracks and angles at 15 degrees (tolerance=15 degrees +/- 15""). Follower arm: Looks sound, no cracks, normal signs of wear. Op rod parts: Operating rod catch: Smooth with some pitting on surface but solid. Operating rod spring: measures 20.25"" (max. free length). Operating rod tab measures .292"" (min. tolerance=.235""), .108"" thick (min. tolerance .095"") and .315"" in height (min. tolerance=.310""). Bolt camming track smooth and clean with minor wear on front edge. Bolt: HRA. No chips or abnormal wear on op rod camming lug. Extractor on bolt is in good shape. Trigger group: Springfield Armory. Clearly reconditioned post WW2 and in excellent shape. SA hammer. Hammer hooks measure exactly same at .332"". Hammer hooks securely engage sear. Milled trigger guard, lugs somewhat flat but secures in housing well. Safety = SA11. Hammer engages with sear solidly. Sear transfers between hammer hooks properly. Safety engages solidly. Gas cylinder: Gauges properly at .528"". Gas piston on end of op rod measures .525"" (min tolerance=.5250""). Gas plug on spring stiff and solid. Rear sight: Parts in excellent condition except excessive wear on the rear sight aperture making it loose. This can be fixed by peening the parts or adding some JB Weld, but not something I wanted to do. I affixed a small piece of electrical tape to the side and it's solid, slides and holds position well. It held solidly while firing. Since this is an easy part to mess up or get a wrong type for, I'll leave it to the next owner to decide if this needs a more permanent fix. Type 3 windage/elevation knobs greased and operate smoothly. Stock: No cartouche markings on the stock. Stock is clearly of different vintage than handguards. Stock has dings and pits. While I did clean, sand and put several coats of linseed oil on the wood parts, I did not remove these dings and pits. I like the character it adds to the rifle. This was a shooter, not a ""safe queen"" and I left it that way. The stock is solid with one location where the wood was pinned. The handguards are in great shape. This requires an FFL."

It was special ordered from the Winchester Custom Shop and purchased from Builders Hardware here in Charlotte in January of 1964. It was ordered from the custom shop with the following upgrades.
Grade 3 wood instead of grade 2 which was standard on all Super Grades.
Winchester Custom Shop Island Express Safari sights which Winchester no longer makes due to cost.
KICKEEZ recoil pad.
The wood has fantastic color and figure and has only minor handling marks. The bluing is mint except for one small rub on the floor plate. The bore is perfect and looks like the rifling was done yesterday. I know for a fact the rifle has been fired less than 50 times over the years and has been taken care of very well. Comes with the original dealer hanging tag and owners manual.
The rifle will also come with a Browning model 1915 hand fitted safari case that was purchased fro the same place in the early 70s. Case comes with everything it did from Browning and is in mint condition. Owners Manual care card and both locking keys. I have seen several of these sell before but not one that looks like it was made yesterday with both keys and paper work. Also comes with a Torel hand tooled Cape Buffalo sling that was purchased along with the case and is in excellent condition. Will include one box of vintage Winchester Western 458 ammo and one box of empty cases. You will not find a more complete and better cared for transitional custom shop Super Grade in 458 mag."

On a separate note, it seems Armslist has decided that, no matter how I orient my photos, they will post them upside down.  So....if you would like to see an correct orientation view of them, I will either e-mail or text them to you until Armslist pulls their collective head out of their collective tuchus.  Thanks for the understanding.

And, finally--I prefer not to post my number here, but if you contact me via e-mail with your number, and request I contact you with it instead of e-mail, I will--likely with vox instead of text, as I find text loses nuance, and is strikingly impersonal."

*COMES WITH 2 MAGS*

The M9-A1 design is distinctive, compared to a Glock, Sig Sauer or Smith & Wesson M&P semi-auto, in that the Steyr feels different in the hand than a more traditionally styled sidearm. The best word to describe that difference is “ergonomic,” a term more often associated with automobile interiors than handguns; but in the case of Steyr’s revised M9-A1, it’s a good word to use.

M9-A1 looks oddly shaped, appearing to increase in proportions from the breech to the muzzle. It looks wider at the front than the back. The backstrap is also deeply recessed to position the back of the frame higher over the hand, thereby creating a low barrel axis to help reduce muzzle flip.

The grip of the M9-A1 is angled to position the firing hand high, keeping the bore axis low and helping tame perceived recoil."

Model: M1 Garand
Caliber: .30-06



This is a WW2 era September 1944 Springfield M1 Garand, serial # 3151xxx. That's right - almost a year before the war was over! This rifle came from the CMP with a 1954 Springfield barrel and Springfield trigger group. This gun has spec'd out very well (see details below). If you want a great wartime collector's gun that you can shoot, this Garand is for you. This gun was recently disassembled, parts inspected for tolerance (see details below), greased, oiled and thoroughly cleaned. The wood was also cleaned and retreated with several coats of linseed oil. It's a smooth operating piece of equipment! Sale includes sling (shown), CMP case, and certification as shown. Details: Barrel: 1954 Springfield. Barrel threads sharp and undamaged. Barrel crown is smooth. Gas port measures .071"" (tolerance=.0790"" +/- .0015""). MW=2, TE=2 Bullet guide: No notch on bullet guard. Accelerator cam surface measured .176"" (tolerance=.179"" +/- .004""). Follower parts: Follower rod: Fork shows no cracks and angles at 15 degrees (tolerance=15 degrees +/- 15""). Follower arm: Looks sound, no cracks, normal signs of wear. Op rod parts: Operating rod catch: Smooth with some pitting on surface but solid. Operating rod spring: measures 20.25"" (max. free length). Operating rod tab measures .292"" (min. tolerance=.235""), .108"" thick (min. tolerance .095"") and .315"" in height (min. tolerance=.310""). Bolt camming track smooth and clean with minor wear on front edge. Bolt: HRA. No chips or abnormal wear on op rod camming lug. Extractor on bolt is in good shape. Trigger group: Springfield Armory. Clearly reconditioned post WW2 and in excellent shape. SA hammer. Hammer hooks measure exactly same at .332"". Hammer hooks securely engage sear. Milled trigger guard, lugs somewhat flat but secures in housing well. Safety = SA11. Hammer engages with sear solidly. Sear transfers between hammer hooks properly. Safety engages solidly. Gas cylinder: Gauges properly at .528"". Gas piston on end of op rod measures .525"" (min tolerance=.5250""). Gas plug on spring stiff and solid. Rear sight: Parts in excellent condition except excessive wear on the rear sight aperture making it loose. This can be fixed by peening the parts or adding some JB Weld, but not something I wanted to do. I affixed a small piece of electrical tape to the side and it's solid, slides and holds position well. It held solidly while firing. Since this is an easy part to mess up or get a wrong type for, I'll leave it to the next owner to decide if this needs a more permanent fix. Type 3 windage/elevation knobs greased and operate smoothly. Stock: No cartouche markings on the stock. Stock is clearly of different vintage than handguards. Stock has dings and pits. While I did clean, sand and put several coats of linseed oil on the wood parts, I did not remove these dings and pits. I like the character it adds to the rifle. This was a shooter, not a ""safe queen"" and I left it that way. The stock is solid with one location where the wood was pinned. The handguards are in great shape. This requires an FFL."

 I have over 60 in stock. But I can order as many as you would like.

 These are just as good if not better than Pmags. The exterior has a hexagonal/honeycomb texture on the sides and bottom for improved grip and it has ridges on the front and back as well. I find that it provides better grip than the Gen. M3 Pmags. The follower is an anti-tilt follower similar to the Gen. M2 Pmags. 

 They come with an orange follower and latch plate.

 These magazines also feature the Hex ID System. The Latch Plate & Follower are orange but can be changed out to a number of different colors using the Hex ID system (Sold Separately). The available colors are: Panther (Pink), Nimbus (Blue), Zombie (Green), Blackout (Black), Hazard (Yellow), Lava (Red).

It's my first time on the website. Anyway, I'm selling an AR15 5.56 cal with one detachable magazine. I will also throw in the original plastic A2 hand guard and original magazine release button and spring. It currently has the California approve bullet button and a 10 round magazine. The rifle has currently had 500-600 rounds through it. The right ear that holds the trigger guard was damage during assembly a while back, but it doesn't affect the performance of the rifle. The barrel is a 1/9 twist and has an A3 upper rail. I hate to see this rifle go, but I lost my job and I need to make ends meet. This rifle is for sale for $650 or best offer. You will have to pay the dross fees and we can do the person to person transfer at any FFL dealer in the Bay area.

Very soft shooter, compared to recoil operated guns like Benellis. Fires 2.75"" or 3"" shells. On light gas piston, it cycles anything from low brass 1oz birdshot to high brass 2.75"" buckshot. The heavy gas piston is for 3"" magnum shells, but is only needed to keep recoil minimal. 3"" shells will cycle on the light piston too.  Both pistons included. 

Has fiber optic front sight and folding rear leaf sight with elevation marks. Has picatinny rail for optics. Comes with two chokes (modified and improved cylinder). Threads to accept any rem chokes you want to use. Also includes FN factory hard case. May include the Burris Fastfire 3 depending on trade or cash offer. May also sell Burris separately, but just as happy to keep it. I have the box and all mounts for the Fastfire. 

ONLY TRADES will be .12 guage semi autos that I can convert from field use to tactical. I bought this for 3 gun, and still haven't competed with it. I decided I enjoyed the semi auto a lot more than my pump gun. So, I'd like to have one I can hunt with and use for defense/competition by changing barrels and adding/removing magazine extension. Must be reliable with birdshot and defensive loads. Prefer 3"" chamber. No 3.5"" chambers considered. Prefer mossberg 930, Remington 1100, or similar. Must have factory magazine that's standard/field length, and there must be magazine extensions available. Must have provision to mount picatinny rail on receiver. Furniture can be wood or synthetic.

Looking for shotgun plus boot or shotgun with multiple barrels (18"" cylinder bore and 26"" or longer barrel threaded for chokes) and removable magazine extension.
May also consider a shotgun suitable for this conversion plus handgun in trade.

May consider shotgun of type described above and ammo in trade.

Cash price $1,025 (without optic). Look up prices on these and you will see its a good deal, as it is in good shape and appears to have a very low round count. I have only put about 100 shells through it myself. 

Please don't make trade offers that don't fit description above. If you prefer to text, my number is REDACTED. Please not calls. If you have an offer I like, I will call you."

I have owned it for about 8 months and I am selling this one to purchase a .357 revolver. Cash price is $365. Please don't email me telling me about the prices of similar pistols on gunsamerica, gunbroker, or other gun auction sites for $300 and thats what you want to pay. Instead of that you can try to haggle a reasonable price that you and I can agree upon, meet face to face with a local shooter, and skip all the BS with online gun auctioning sites. The only trades I am really interested in are .357 revolvers with at least a 3"" barrel and I can add cash as boot on my part if the trade is right. However, if you have something that is unique and/ or well worth it on my part, i may be open to trade on that. Please email me with your number if interested and i can text you photos and answer any questions you may have. Thanks! - Josh"
