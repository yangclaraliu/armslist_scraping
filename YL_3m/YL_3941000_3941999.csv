I added weapon light tlr1s and an awesome custom kydex holster in nomad kryptek.  Gen 4 NIBX Glock 19 nickel boron with NIGHT SIGHTS!!! This model of glock 19 is a little bit different then your regular glock 19. The slide, barrel, and INTERNALS are coated with nickel boron finish by NIBX.  Because the internals are coated, the trigger pull is smooth and crisp. I shoot a lot of glocks and this trigger is MUCH better then a stock glock.  I put truglo night sights and extended slide stop on it myself. This is the Gen 4 which is a lot harder to find then the Gen 3 in my experience. Because of that it comes with 3 mags and adjustable back straps. Also, because of availability the price will be adjusted accordingling because the price was adjusted on me. 200 rounds or so through it with no problems.

LaserLyte® returns to basics with the patented RTB-GL rear sight laser that fits all GLOCK® firearms. The high performance laser built into a rear sight specifically designed for all GLOCK pistols features a simple, ambidextrous “press and go” activation.  The laser is easily programmable to either constant on or pulse mode.

Another great feature is the “auto-off” feature that displays a unique flash after 5-minutes of operation and automatically turns the unit off after 6-minutes.

Made from heavy-duty, high carbon steel for added durability, the LaserLyte® RTB-GL rear sight laser has a black chrome finish for corrosion prevention. A great benefit of the LaserLyte® RTB-GL rear sight laser, besides the single-laser-fits-all-GLOCKS, is that the customer will not have to replace grips, internal stock parts or holsters. The LaserLyte RTB-GL rear sight laser is compatible with all Level 1 and Level 2 holsters including the BLACKHAWK!® SERPA® holster system.

Here is a link to the description on their website. http://ultimak.com/M1-b.htm
I will meet locally or ship at the buyer's expense.

AK ""scout"" mount Model M1-B 
Picatinny/Weaver style rail. 
Replaces gas tube. Clamps directly to barrel for maximum stability, accuracy, and optimum bore alignment. Solid, one-piece 6061-T6 hard anodized aluminum body. Comes with 4140 steel clamps, screws, allen wrench,	and instructions. 
No Gunsmithing. 
UltiMAK M1-B-- A rock-solid platform for your premium optics. With the increasing popularity of the AK based rifles in three gun competitions, the need for a handy, light, completely reliable high speed sighting system has resulted in the UltiMAK M1-B optic mount. Its Picatinny style rail is positioned well below the iron sight axis, making this the lowest optic mount available for the AK. With a tubular sight mounted low, you will be able to use your optic without a comb riser and still use your regular hold. The system allows for co witnessing (the ability to use your iron sights right through a 1x sight as a back-up sighting system) when used with a tubular reflex sight. This heavy duty mount replaces the original steel gas tube and upper handguard, so it adds less than one ounce to the weight of the rifle, making it by far the lightest optic mount installation in the world. The forward positioning of the optic gives you faster, easier and more natural targeting while maintaining your full field of view. Multiple target or moving target engagements, with both eyes open, become second nature. 
The UltiMAK AK optic mount rarely if ever needs to be removed to clean the rifle, so you need not worry about loss of zero. Since the mount is clamped to the barrel and not jammed in between the gas block and the sight block like the original gas tube, several UltiMAK users have reported an improvement in their AKs' inherent accuracy."

The MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area.

The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components."

No specific quantity in mind, I just want as many as you have. 
I prefer commercial brass over military. I don't want to deal with the extra steps.
Please just once fired brass. If it is more than once fired or I find signs of being fired more than once I'm either going to offer MUCH less due to various risks, or I won't purchase the whole lot. I will be running this through an M1 and have no intention and letting someone else's mistakes blow my gun up. Before messaging me please be sure the brass is:
Once fired (guaranteed)
All bad cases removed  (dented, cracked, rusted, berdan primed, reloaded) and in good condition. 
Please give me an accurate count of how many you have
I also need the price you are asking for all of them.
If you have pictures, that would be preferred so I can have an idea of what I might be buying before a meeting.

I want to purchase this locally because I do not want to pay extra for shipping. If you want to ship, I can do that, but I'm going to pay MUCH less due to shipping as well as I can't see the brass in advance. I don't like buying things that I can't inspect.

Sorry for the complicated ad, but I have had NUMEROUS people trying to ship brass to me at a highly overpriced rate (some before shipping, some after).

Hey all,
I'm in the market for a Ruger GP100 357 magnum revolver. 4 or 6 inch barrel. Cosmetics not terribly important, but price needs to reflect the condition it is in. Needs to have adjustable rear sight. I am fine with Stainless or blued. I may have cash or trades on hand depending on your values.  Cosmetics isn't important, but it must be mechanically sound with no issues in the functional department.  Shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. The trades I have consist of guns, ammo, and even some apple tablets (if you are interested). Would possibly consider other Ruger revolvers (no blackhawks) as well, just message me and maybe we can make it work. 

Thanks for your time and happy hunting!

This ""NW QRBP"" has four milled ""windows"" around the gripping surface, which renders the ignition ""open to the elements"" as required per the muzzleloading regulations of the three northwest states. It also features an integral nipple which is designed for use with traditional Musket Cap primers, and the face of the plug is funnel shaped for more reliable ignition with loose propellants. A firing pin sized specifically for musket caps and a stronger firing pin spring provide fast and reliable ignition of the propellant charge.

The bodyguard comes with the insight laser with two functions, normal and strobe. The S&W Bodyguard comes with an external safety that can be accessed with a flick of the thumb as well as an internal safety feature that makes it perfect for a concealed carry. The internal safety is built into the trigger pull, making the chances of it accidentally going off in the holster or by bumping the weapon almost impossible. 

The size of the pistol is perfect for the daily carry and the .380 caliber is a great in between caliber that you can actually find around and isn’t going to cost you an arm and a leg. The Bodyguard will include two types of holsters: A right IWB holster perfect for every day clothing, t-shirts, sweaters, and anything you don’t tuck into your pants, the second holster is a pocket holster, great for anything else including work clothes and dress clothes where a IWB would be impractical. The gun also comes with the soft case and original box with the barrel lock for extra safety features. It comes with two clips (both have pinky extenders) each capable of holding 6 rounds. There have only been about 100-200 rounds through it and cleaned after each time at the range.

$13 each

These are 'Used' military mags from a variety of Eastern European com-bloc nations built to Soviet spec with ridge-back design. Mostly Hungarian, but there could be some other mags in the mix like Romanian, Bulgarian, Russian, Polish, Etc, Etc.  Overall a great value and at prices I have not been able to offer for over a decade on true mil-spec steel mags, not garbage-like new commercial production AK mags often sold elsewhere. Condition Varies, they could be of these grades listed below, but mostly ""Very Good to Excellent"" from what I have seen.  Some mags may be grease packed and need cleaning. There may be some with bent floor plates, significant finish wear, possibly some with small dents and dings that need to be popped back out to allow follower to travel freely, but we do try to sort out any that are dented to the point that follower movement is restricted so this will be minimal and easy to fix with a little effort. These are used surplus and sold ""As-Is"". We do diligently inspect and sort out anything unfit for use that we can identify, so damaged mags should be a relatively uncommon issue, but it is surplus so things can slip past the check process and the goods are sold ""As-Is"" with no warranty.

""Used, Good"" meaning quite a bit if finish wear, minor surface rust, some cosmetic blemishing from storage, but functional.

""Used, Very Good"" meaning some finish wear very minor surface rust, some cosmetic blemishing from storage, but functional.

""Used Excellent"" meaning finish wear on edges and in fitting parts"

The G Code INCOG is a minimum bulk, multi-positional, deep concealment, high quality Kydex holster. Its distinctive features enable the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while facilitating the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw from the concealed carry. Inherent to the G Code INCOG are adjustments in the depth of concealed carry, angle of carry, the position of carry and security of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting points on the INCOG holster and the use of variable mounting components. Combined they maximize function respective to the users body type, concealed carry deployment tactics and personal preferences. The G Code INCOG holster is adaptive to varying operational environments and mission requirements. The mounting clip incorporates a negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the concealability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the positional security of the holster during use. This higher position facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. The mounting clips also have multiple mounting points further increasing the range of carry options and adjustments. The mounting clips open and slide down over the belt and lock in place. The clip is actuated via a finger tab, and is flexed to open allowing quick installation or removal from the belt. All INCOG holsters come with Black FUZZ coating except for the Kryptek Typhon color option. Kryptek is a laminated fabric covering. At this time, PatriotTAC is ONLY selling the INCOG's with black FUZZ coating on our website. If you'd like to special order another coating/color, or ANY G-Code product, please contact us by phone, text, or e-mail.

807,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3941807,For Sale/Trade:  Bushmaster 2 Stage Match AR 15 Trigger Group,"Lexington, Greensboro, North Carolina",$ 50,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 21, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I just purchased a used late 90's Bushmaster Match Target model rifle that had the factory 2 stage trigger in it. It is my first experience with a 2 stage trigger and I dry fired it to see how it felt compared to my other AR triggers. I found that the trigger is really smooth, but the second stage is really light, too light for my taste. I swapped out the 2 stage trigger for a Bushmaster mil-spec trigger without ever firing the rifle. The seller represented the gun as not being fired much, and the wear on the face of the hammer seems to support that as you can see in the photos. These Bushmaster 2 stage trigger groups sell for about $115 new, so I'm asking $50 for this one.

The stock is glass bedded to the receiver which means tight groups. Look up glass bedding if you don't kno what it is, but it definitely makes a huge difference. This Mosin is also a scout configuration with the best scope mount on the market, it has a picatinny rail. The mount also allows the use of the iron sights. You can see threw the mount which has a notch that will align with the front sight, which make this a true scout rifle. The iron sights are dead on at 100 meters. The scope has 12-20 inches of eye relief. It is a BSA edge pistol scope 2x-7 power. Scope is zeroed dead on at 200 meters. Best thing about this rifle tho is cheap ammo, you can get 400 rounds of surplus ammo for $100 and have a blast.

This pistol is awesome. With that new trigger it couldn't be better. The only reason I'm selling it us because I'm in a tight spot. I need some extra cash.
