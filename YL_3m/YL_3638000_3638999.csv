71,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3638071,For Sale:  WWI German M1915 Uniform Tunic 1917 Dated,"East, Tucson, Arizona","$ 4,700","Listed On: Saturday, October 25, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Rare and complete German uniform tunic, 1917 dated, as issued to Prussian Garde units. This tunic displays collar litzen and shoulder boards designating assignment to the 2nd Regiment, or the 2nd Garde. These units were used by the Kaiser as personal body guard units, and were some of the first complete units designated and trained as ""Storm Troopers."" The tunic is as modified for trench warfare. Regular tunic had modifications done by regimental tailors so troopers wouldn't get their belt caught on barbed wire, while crawling under. This is the centennial of WWI in Europe, America didn't official enter until 1917, which was delayed by the horrendous flu epidemic that killed so many US soldiers in training camps. These WWI German tunics are rare following the fire bombings by US & British Air Corps of cities like Dresden during WW2, where mostly citizens and refugees had fled. We allies have our little told dirty stories unlike the bombing of London. This tunic was originally sewn for a US size 44 chest. It was modified to fit a smaller soldier, as uniforms were recycled as soldiers died. It is currently about a US size 40, but the great news is that the tailor was wise enough to leave the extra material folded back when down sized. That is a bonus for anyone looking to find a large original tunic. The model of the tunic is M1915, which was simplified and had the hidden buttons unlike the prior models. Most collectors are holding onto their uniforms as the prices are soaring, but this is a spare tunic for me. This would look great in your man cave, and no the Prussian picklehaube is not included."

Brand new in box Springfield XDS .45 that has never been fired since it left the factory. Still has factory grease.

This is the 4"" .45 ACP model which is rare in California as it has only been produced since this Summer. It is off-roster and cannot be sold by dealers in California without modification. However, I am a private party, not a dealer, and therefore it can be sold legally to you, no questions asked. (Private party transfers are exempt from the roster)

Compared to the original 3.3"" XDS, you get better recoil control, a better sight radius, and improved expansion and velocity from JHP bullets. That makes this the most powerful ultra-compact pistol ever made.

Features grip and trigger safeties, fiber optic front sight, aggressive grip, several different backstraps, and thin profile.

Included in sale:

5 mags (2x 7-round and 3x 5-round)
50 rounds of Winchester Winclean ammo

2 mag holsters
Replacement sight rods
Cable lock

All the right proofs for collectors wanting the very best, with matching grade components. The bore is excellent. The stock has the start of the circular unit ID disc cut, but no wood was ever removed. These are known in collecting circles as the rifles issues early in WWI to US citizens who enlisted in Canada to fight in the war. These units of American volunteers had their identities hidden, so there would be no direct evidence of US involvement. This bravado is alluded to in the movie ""Legends Of The Fall"", staring Brad Pitt. I saw a rifle like this by itself sell for $1000 three years ago in Phoenix. Only difference was that it was dated 1916. This rifle, commonly known as the work horse of the British Army, will be 100 years old in a few months.

$400 cash, which is less than it'd cost you out the door new from Cabelas or Gander Mountain, let alone the cost of the upgrades.  Trade value will be higher.  And if you expect to get the same or more than your gun costs new, my price will go up accordingly.

I am unsure the exact age, but it is old enough that it does not have a serial number so that would be pre-1968. I have not fired this gun, I inherited it and I am selling it in the condition in which I received it. It comes apart fine, the hammer cocks back and releases when you pull the trigger, you can see the firing pin move forward when the hammer hits it, but the trigger seems to be lacking a return spring. I looked it up and the spring can be purchased for $2.90 at Numrich Gun parts (I will include the parts diagram and part number for the spring). It also has an ejector for the shell. Bead front sight. 28"" barrel. Everything appears to be original. Bore is bright and shiny, no pitting or rust inside the barrel.

Stock has aluminum bedding in block in standard VS configuration.
At the core of the 700 with 5-R Rifling is the machined stainless steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design ensuring uniformity, strength and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 24-inch stainless steel, heavy barrel featuring 5-R Tactical Rifling -- the same hammer-forged barrel used on the M-24 sniper rifles.
 The 5-R Rifling barrel features five lands with a right hand twist which allows for less bearing surface on the bullet for slightly increased velocity.
As a result of less bullet drag, copper fouling in the bore is reduced ensuring long-term accuracy and consistency. The barrel is offered with a 110 target-style crown and a 1 in 11.25-inch twist.
The rock-solid barreled action is full-length, aluminum bedded into a well-designed H-S Precision stock for enhanced stability and shot-to-shot consistency. Add Remington's X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger, designed to ""break-like-glass"" and set at 3.5 pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical-like accuracy.

This build runs great and looks even better! This build is also finished off with burnt bronze cerakote and color fill. The beauty of 300 blk is it runs in standard AR mags so if you have extras you are in business. What I'm asking is a couple hundred less than what it would cost to get the same parts and build your own. This build has only had 60 rds through it to ensure function. It will also come with 120 rds of super sonic ammo and 40 rds of subsonic ammo. Obviously we will need to meet at my preferred FFL for the transaction. Since this is a pistol you must be 21 yoa.

447,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3638447,For Trade:  M1 Garand early SPG gas trap stock 1937 first year of production,"Cordova, Memphis, Tennessee",Offer,"Listed On: Friday, November 21, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for trade is a VERY EARLY S.P.G. gas trap stock.  Based on specific features it has, a renowned M1 stock expert said this stock dates from the first 1,000 or so production M1 rifles. Since 1,034 were produced in 1937, this stock very likely dates from 1937.

This stock does not have any S.P.G. cartouche I can see, but it has the D28293 part number stamped on the stock. It also has an ""O.G."" rebuild stamp from Ogden, UT. It has a large hole over small hole in the butt (with modification for a trap door butt plate). It has a long channel, a ""scooped"" clip latch cutout, a number or letter stamped in the barrel channel, and numbers/codes stamped on the top front of the stock.

If you would like better/different photos, or even the full-size originals, please let me know.

I question whether I will ever be able to afford to match this stock to an appropriate 3-digit gas trap rifle. So, I may part with it.

At this point, I am only interested in possibly trading this stock, not selling outright. I saw a fairly recent SPG stock sold on eBay for just under $4,500. I can't find pictures of that one, so I don't know how mine compares. I know mine is very rare, possibly more rare than that one since mine is from 1937. For now, I am assuming its value to be in that ballpark.

I am not in a rush to part with this stock. Unlike in my prior posts, though, I do have my C&R FFL now, so I can trade as soon as the right deal comes along.

Thanks for looking!"

This is a very nice Colt Commander 1991A1 series. It is a one owner gun and comes with the original colt box and manual, one factory magazine and one aftermarket magazine. It comes as shown with black pearlite grips, I have misplaced the factory ones over the years,however, the ones on it now are much nicer.

The feed ramp has been polished and has had a trigger job. Almost no trigger creep and a very crisp release. I am not interested in any trades so cash only. Not willing to drive to far.

The 1991A1 roll markings are very desirable and the serial numbers were continued from where the original WWII numbers left off."

It shoots lights out–consistently sub 1/2 MOA with Federal Fusion 180 grain (this is HUNTING ammo). Best group is .33 inches at 100 yards. It has 220 rounds (give or take a few) down the pipe, including a 100-round specialized bore-breakin in.

Check out the youtube videos and these are all mentioned and shown where to look on the gun to make sure you have one of the ""correct"" ones with no ejection problems. This one is perfect.

Was going to use it to fill up on ammo but the wife won't let me buy the ammo so I'm looking to get rid of it. 

Its made by Peli Products and measures 29""Lx18""W on the inside. It has a fold up handle and roller wheels. I do believe that these cases are TSA approved. It has 2 holes for 2 locks on the front with heavy style latches. Its just taking up room in my apartment and I need it to go to a loving home if I'm not going to be using it. It does have some funky style foam as I've never seen these cases have the removable inserts. I did do my research before I acquired it and know these style cases this size go for 200$+ But I'm only looking for $125 for it to help offset the gun I partially traded for this.

First up is a Volquartsen trigger kit with a metal trigger housing. Trigger has a 4lb pull with a nice crisp break, it really is a huge improvement over the stock trigger. The metal trigger guard is a nice bonus too. I also swapped out the original stock (modified by the previous owner, see below) with a Ruger laminated stock, which I think is a nice visual improvement over the original stock. In addition, the laminated stock, unlike the original, this one has posts installed for attaching sling swivels (not included). Sights are the original stock iron sights with the gold dot on the front sight and a rail is installed on the receiver for optics.

Regarding the original stock (also included with the rifle), it was modified by the previous owner (shortened a bit on the barrel end) and is ready to receive a bull barrel (not included). 

Rifle has been well cared for. I’m the second owner - it’s in very nice condition.

I’m also putting this up with a brick (500 rounds) of .22lr so you’ll be sure to have something to shoot when you buy it.

It’s a very nice rifle, but I need the cash right now, so this is one item that needs to go.

What you get:
•	(1) Ruger 10/22 with Volquartsen trigger kit, metal trigger housing, original 10/22 barrel and laminated stock (installed)
•	(1) Original 10/22 stock, modified as noted above
•	(1) Ruger BX-10 10-round magazine
•	(500) Rounds of Remington Thunderbolt .22lr ammo, new, unopened brick

Price is $385, firm. I’m not looking for any trades or offers. NOTE: I have a second listing up right now and I'll make this offer - if you'd like to buy BOTH, I'll cut the price and sell both to the same buyer for $650 total. This lower price is only available if you purchase both rifles. My other listing is a Remington 870 Home Defense in 20 gauge here: http://www.armslist.com/posts/3639446/portland-oregon-shotguns-for-sale--remington-870-home-defense---20-gauge

Was going to use it to fill up on ammo but the wife won't let me buy the ammo so I'm looking to get rid of it. 

Its made by Peli Products and measures 29""Lx18""W on the inside. It has a fold up handle and roller wheels. I do believe that these cases are TSA approved. It has 2 holes for 2 locks on the front with heavy style latches. Its just taking up room in my apartment and I need it to go to a loving home if I'm not going to be using it. It does have some funky style foam as I've never seen these cases have the removable inserts. I did do my research before I acquired it and know these style cases this size go for 200$+ But I'm only looking for $125 for it to help offset the gun I partially traded for this

761,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3638761,"For Sale:  Flare Pistol Outfit - HK 26.5mm, .410/45LC & 12 Ga Adapters, Case, Cleaning Kit, Lanyard","Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 325,"Listed On: Saturday, October 25, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here's a very nice and complete outfit for emergencies, marine use, survival, or just to have some fun with. It's a genuine HK RAK PIST 78.

The RAK PIST is simply a P2A1 that was made on contract in the later 70's I believe for the Swiss or the Swedes. I have a HK P2A1 and I've compared it to this pistol and they are identical in every way except for the model stamping on the pistol's frame.

Condition is excellent with finish coming in at about 98%. The only wear at all is a slight bit right around the muzzle from going in and out of the holster. 

Additionally the bore is pretty much perfect. I've owned and fired many flare guns over the years and they all get tend to get a burn ring inside the barrel after being fired just forward of the flare cartridge casing. I've tried and tried to get these out of other pistols I've owned and never could. It doesn't hurt a thing but it is a good indication that the pistol has been fired. The pistol I'm offering here has no burn ring so I think there is a fair chance it has never been fired. I don't know that for certain, but again I do think chances are good that it is unfired.

Pistol comes with it's original holster/carry bag. This is the first time I've seen one of these and it's really a nice setup. It has molded storage to fit the pistol exactly, but the best part is the tons of storage capacity it has. You can put everything but the kitchen sink in this thing (ha!) yet it's quite compact. It's obviously well engineered. It's made from a water resistant leatherette type material in OD green color, and it has nylon shoulder strap for easy carry.

Set also includes the originally issued nylon rope style lanyard. Additionally there is a complete cleaning kit that has has a stiff bristle nylon brush, a brass brush for heavy duty cleaning and a cleaning rod with a permanent felt tip that fits the bore snuggly and eliminates the need for cleaning patches.

Finally there is a brand new adapter that allows you to fire the less expensive 12 gauge flares. Then there is another brand new adapter by KENNESAW CANNON COMPANY that converts this flare gun into a .410 shotgun or a .45 Long Colt. This adapter does turn the flare pistol into a real handgun so you must be aware of your local laws and abide by them. I've been told that KENNESAW CANNON has recently gone out of business so there may not be any more of these adapters. It's still sealed in it's original packaging and comes with instructions plus an approval letter from the BATF.

Price is $325 with pickup in the Brandon Florida area. Since this is a flare gun and it's not a firearm I can also ship this to you directly via USPS Priority Mail for $15. The .410 adapter will be shipped separately from the flare pistol. No shipping to AK, CA, HI, NJ, NY or MA.

I will need to see a copy of your ID for age verification and you'll need to be at least 21."

The pistol has polished slide flats, and matte slide top and undercarriage. The pistol has factory checkered wooden grips with gold-colored Colt medallions that look really nice against the Bright Nickel finish. The grips have black grain running through the brown. The factory magazine is Colt-marked. The pistol has some small but noticeable marks primarily on the slide. Otherwise, the gun is in very nice condition with a shiny bore and a very smooth trigger pull – overall condition is around 90%. Series 70 Colt 1911’s keep going up in value, and the nickel finished guns are quite desirable.

The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

This is a little different set-up from most when you can find them, it has the 28"" barrel and the Sporter sights instead of the Target sights, which is found on most of the 28"" barrel models, what does it mean exactly, I don't know, more rare or not, not sure, all the numbers match.  As you can see from pics, the finish on metal is not in great condition and the stock has some bumps and bruises from use, but everything is in good working order and the bore is in very nice condition.  Depending on the model 75 and condition, I've seen these going from $500 to well over $2,000, so hard to tell what it is worth, mine is definitely a shooter NOT a collector piece.  I'm happy to take more pics of any area you would like to see.  

$320 in cash or will ship in TX for $350. 

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I don't need anything and not really looking for anything at this time in trades, but I will consider trading if the deal makes sense on my end, otherwise, I'll take cash.  I have other items listed for a bigger trade deal.

A few items I would not mind having, FN SCAR 16 or 17, Tavor, CX4 in 9mm(92FS) or maybe .45ACP, quality stripped billet or forged AR lowers, Sig pistol arm braces for the AR and AK(2 for AK), AR-10 complete, just a lower or just an upper with 14.5""-20"" medium profile or maybe heavy fluted barrel and a Century C39 pistol, maybe other AK rifles.  Maybe another Ruger 10/22, MK III Hunter and .22 Mag rifle, semi-auto preferred.

Others I will consider more of, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, maybe shotguns, ammo in common calibers, maybe quality optics and/or red dots.  I am open to just about anything firearms related, depending on what the deal is.

I rarely get to wear them, but they are my favorite. After a decade of working out at the gym, finally they no longer fit me. Flektarn is by far my favorite camouflage pattern, and even after two deployments, one in ACU and one in OCP or multicam, not to mention the many other patterns the military has supplied me over the last decade, I still prefer this pattern and I will be replacing these small uniforms with medium ones ASAP.

The uniforms are dark, in fact the only faded one is the one I cut into shorts which on me are bellow the knee, and I am 5'8"" tall. They should fit anyone with a 30-32"" waist. I now have a 34"" waist and they don't zip all the way up... The tops are small, they still fit me though. In my US military uniforms I wear small or medium jackets and pants. The medium regulars are kind of loose and baggy on me though.

The hats are all extra small. They are more for a kid than an adult. They never fit me and I wear 7 ¼.

Purchased new at Gander Mountain. Paid $580 + tax and back ground.  Comes with all the original boxes and paper work. Two mags and three back straps included.Asking $525.

The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semi-automatic pistol manufactured in Italy and intended for personal defense and law enforcement deployment. The Beretta Px4 Storm is hybrid design borrowing the short-recoil, rotating barrel as the Beretta 8000 models and the trigger and safety system from the Beretta 92, 96, and M9 series. What makes the Beretta Px4 Storm unique is the light-weight polymer construction with steel inserts, a modular trigger group, fully enclosing slide, Picatinny rail, and changeable backstrap options. The Beretta Px4 Storm can fire 9x19mm Parabellum, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP rounds.

Design Specifications
•Weight: 27.7 OZ (without magazine)
•Length: 7.55 in
•Barrel Length: 4.0 in

Interchangeable Parts

Being one of the most versatile Beretta pistols available, the Px4 Storm has a number of parts that are designed to be removable and interchangeable. The back strap, magazine release button, slide catch, and hammer unit mechanism are all interchangeable with a variety of options. The back strap comes in slim, standard and oversized varieties. The magazine button can be mounted on either sides and be replaced by large or combat (extended) sized options. To avoid snagging the pistol when the weapon is drawn quickly, the slide catch can be replaced with a slimmer version.

Model Variations
The Beretta Px4 is available in four variations: •Type F: Single and double-action, decocker, and manual safety.
•Type C: Single-action only, spurless hammer, no decocker, and no safety.
•Type D: Double-action only, spurless hammer, no decocker, and no safety.
•Type G: Single and double-action, decocker, and no manual safety.

Px4 Subcompact

The Beretta Storm Px4 Compact is a Px4 chambered in 9 mm and .40 S&W with a DA/SA trigger. It also utilizes a tilt barrel system and is intended for personal defense and law enforcement with a focus on firearm concealment.

Px4 Compact

The Beretta Px4 Storm Compact is sized between the full size and subcompact models and employs a rotating barrel design of the full size pistols, but with a shorter and proportioned slide and grip. This model also introduces an ambidextrous slide stop lever, and a high magazine capacity.

The Joint Combat Pistol

The Px4 Storm is also available in a .45 ACP designated as the Px4 Storm Special Duty. This model features a desert tan frame color, PVD coated magazines and internal firing control assembly, double recoil spring, specially roll marked slide, and a longer barrel for use with a suppressor.

Noted Uses

The Beretta Px4 Storm is currently used by a variety of military and law enforcement organizations including the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police, the Canada Border Services Agency, the Maryland State Police, Venezuelan National Guard, and the South African Police Service.
