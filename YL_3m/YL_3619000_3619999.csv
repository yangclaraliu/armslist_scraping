This was my hog hunting rifle and I've less than 100 rounds through it, and cleaned it after every use.  The previous owner did the paint job with krylon and I left it on because I liked it.  It can easily be taken off.  The trigger assembly is marked HR-N and the barrel is marked SA.

The rifle comes with the 2x GI magazines pictured.  One of them is a bit rusted but both function fine.

I'm not trying to make a profit off this rifle, I am a proud gun owner and don't like screwing people over or being screwed over.  Do a quick search and see what this rifle is going for new and you'll be able to see I'm not profiting off of this.  I just need funds for another precision rifle I'm building.

I require a bill of sale for this purchase and proof of NC drivers license or military orders.  I accept cash or a USPS money order.

If you have any questions please email me.  I'm always down for trades, things I'd be interested in are AR-15s  (SPR build) and a new hunting rifle (Tikka T3 is what I have my eye on now).  But cash is king right now.

I am very firm on the price, this is an expensive gun and it is a good deal for someone who really likes the HKs and wants to save a fair amount on a gun that's not even ""broken in"" yet.
Also for sale separately, I have a new G-code OWB molded holster for it, left handed, covered in Kryptek highlander camo. Very nice. $45 ($79 new)
Serious inquiries only please, cash sale, no trades."

I am selling it because I have no use for it other than taking it to the range the few times I can get there. It is chambered in the awesome 7.62X54R round which is one hell of a round, especially for blasting apart cinder blocks and watermelons! It isn't a safe queen and it isn't a beauty queen, can't lie about that, and while there aren't a whole lot, there are a few spots that could really use some TLC, the most major spot is on the outside of the magazine well, has a bit of rust. The barrel is clean and the action is butter smooth. The bayonet also folds along the side . It has an internal magazine with a capacity of 5. I have also mounted a scout scope with a Brass Stacker mount and a 2x7 pistol scope along with an ATI Monte Carlo stock, the thing is rock solid and feels extremely good in the hands. There is also an Allen company casing holder on the butt stock, and there is a scope box full of random accessories and tools for this gun. And the scope isn't zeroed in, didn't really have the time to dedicate to doing so.  I am not interested in any trades, sorry, cash only deal.

STEVENS SAVAGE ARMS MODEL 320 12G PUMP SHOTGUN WITH PISTOL GRIP, GHOST RING SIGHTS- NEW IN UNOPENED BOX $240.00. The pictures I have attached are only stock pictures. The box is sealed and whoever buys it will be the first to open the box since manufacturing and it will look just like the ones in the pictures. Walmart sells a cheaper version of this shotgun with the inexpensive bead sights for $207.00 + tax ($226.49) with background check. The Ghost Ring Sights model runs an additional $35.00 + over the bead sight model and is favored. This model is not carried by Walmart as they only sell the cheaper model. Be legal to buy a shotgun and have your FL drivers license with you. I will fill out a bill of sale.

The Savage Stevens 320 12 Gauge Pump-Action Shotgun features a carbon steel barrel and a synthetic stock, both with a matte black finish. The shotgun is designed with a pistol grip, a rotary bolt, dual slide bars and a Ghost Ring Sight. Tube magazine. 5-round capacity.

Marked Remington Rand Inc, Syracuse NY USA
United States Property


I'm selling this for a friend of my moms. It's an older lady that inherited it 
from a family member. All she could tell me was that he was a lieutenant in the 
military. I don't have any other info on the gun. He have away all his other 
weapons before he passed and she found this tucked in with his possessions. Has 
a more modern holster but no box or magazine or anything else. Pistol seems to 
work perfectly.  I have dry fired it and the trigger is smooth but I have not 
fired any rounds through it. 

In this same condition, I found this model and year going for an average price 
of $1200-1600.  First 3 #'s of serial number are 141.... which appear to 
indicate 1943 manufacture date. All parts appear to be original. 

I'm asking $1400 obo and prefer straight cash for best deal. 

Send all reasonable cash offers. Must pick up in Clermont which is just west of 
Orlando. Would consider shipping to your FFL for right deal. 

If interested in trading then read below before wasting our time. 

I apologize for long ad, but if you've ever sold on here, it's a great source 
with great people, but also lots of challenging people too. 

Also,  I can send you several pics of every angle before you come look at the 
gun. I'm not into older collectibles, so I'm just trying to put some cash in her 
pocket to help her out.  don't waste our time with low balling. She doesn't need 
the money. But also doesn't need the gun. Rather have someone that will 
appreciate it for the collectors item it is and take care of it. 

If it helps make a deal, I would consider trades plus cash or possibly if 
something I would like that was a deal for me, I could trade straight up or 
possibly add a gun and then I'd give her cash.  But since I don't need anything, 
there has to be enough meat on yours that I can sell it and make a few dollars 
to be worth my time if I decide I don't want it. 

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used 
from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, not your full retail or BPS or 
Gander pricing. Sorry if you overpayed but I am very versed on gun prices 
wholesale and retail even though I'm a private seller. 

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask if what I'd 
want as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and 
condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's 
easier you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'd consider most ar's in .308, possibly spikes or maybe core in 
5.56 since transferable warranty, but no front posts and don't really want 5.56 
unless it's just tactical cool and a deal. Upper and lowers must be same 
manufacturer. Prefer factory built. Might consider a piston ar 5.56 too if 
factory built. Must be new or like new

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's. Like Century in pistol or 
rifle. Or higher quality but not looking for anything over $700 in trade value. 

Only new or like new .......prefer Glocks and will consider some sigs p238, 
p938, p226, possible other higher end versions, most 1911's, revolvers in 357 or 
38 like lcr or smith or similar or governor ....only interested in guns, optics 
like eotech or aimpoint or trijicon and some ammo. 

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or 
hunting rifles.  

Look up your gun on slickguns to see what I could buy it best price cash in last 
6 mths before trying to tell me your stock basic model glock is worth over $500 
or your sig that you fired is new and worth msrp.  Again apologize for rambling 
detail. 


Must come to Clermont to view. Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale 
required. You pay shipping and insurance if not picked up."

- 45 Degree CANTED Iron Sight System - These are brand new and sealed. Made from aircraft-grade aluminum they are the true definition of a ""Backup Sight"". Why ? Well , with most backup sighting solutions (BUIS) , a scoped user can only deploy the sight when SHTF; and the primary optic -- FAILS. With these sights , you can use them in any and every situation, allowing the operator to engage their target in all situations without having to remove the primary optic. You can not afford to NOT have a set on your rifle.

Enter the SOCOM II. It brings you all the compact power, performance and reliability of the SOCOM 16 with the added capability of a rail system.

The SOCOM II has a quad-rail that will allow you to mount whatever accessories your application requires. Maybe you need a light, laser or vertical foregrip – there’s ample space for all of these. Co-witnessed night vision and low-magnification optics are commonly found on rifles in this class, and the extended rail option gives you plenty of room for this.

The SOCOM II has the same specially-engineered 16 inch barrel and proprietary muzzle brake as the SOCOM 16, so you can expect the same excellent recoil reduction and low muzzle rise. The two-stage military trigger and fast acquisition sights – a ghost ring rear aperture and XS Tritium front sight – are more features that make the SOCOM II a great choice for a tactical rifle.

The SOCOM II is the next step in the evolution of the powerful, compact tactical rifle.

I am the original owner and have between 1,000 to 1,200 round down the pipe and never had an issue.

Comes with 2 modified 15 round mags, case and everything that came with the case.  Asking for $600 without the holster.

The holster cost me $87 shipped, waiting 9 weeks and it's brand new, but will sell it with the gun for another $50 or total of $650.
