It has the earlier style features including grip safety, no stock lug, and up-for-safe safety. The tapered barrel measures 120mm (approx. 4-3/4""). The area over the chamber is properly blank, the middle toggle link is marked ""WAFFENFARBIK BERN"" beneath a small Swiss cross. The Swiss cross is also found on the left side of the barrel, right side of receiver & grip frame, left side of the breech block, back of side plate, etc. The left side of the pistol has the Berner Probe proof, and a small square containing a small cross over the letter ""M"" (the control proof of Col. Muhlemann). The serial numbered parts are all matching, including those on the excellent bordered grips AND one of the magazines! Both of the magazines are nickel plated with wood bases (the spare mag is numbered ""22"").Overall condition is excellent with about 95% of the original blue finish remaining. There is some slight thinning to the finish at the edge of the muzzle and on the grip safety as well as some normal sharp edge wear. Good original straw finish remains on the trigger, safety, bolt lock, mag release and ejector. The grips are excellent with only very light wear, no cracks or chips. The pistol is in excellent mechanical condition and has a sharp, mirror bright bore. In addition to the two magazines, this handsome pistol comes with an original Swiss holster that is maker marked ""A. REUT/OBERAACH"" and dated 1945. The holster is in fine shape with normal light wear but no holes, tears or loose stitching. An exceptionally nice Swiss Luger that anyone would be proud to own!"

Marinerï¿½ Shotguns provide Corrosion-resistant Marinecote Finish for All-Weather, Year-Round Protection. This finish is ideal for humid environments. It was developed to prevent deterioration due to humidity and coastal environments, for boat patrol too, so it makes this shotgun last much better than other finishes. The Mariner is the ideal choice because your shotgun can be subjected to all-season climates, which can induce condensation. Rigorous testing proves the Marinecote resists corrosion better than stainless steel. This finish is harder than ordinary gunmetal and provides the added bonus of greater resistance to wear and distinctly smoother action. One reason so many military and police organizations purchase Mossberg shotguns is that the guns will withstand heavy wear and tear. But you don't have to be in the service or a police officer to buy this shotgun.In the event service is required, owners of Mossbergs always receive Mossberg's highest priority for inspection, repair and fast return of their firearms. Their expertly trained technicians complete every detail of service and repair at the Mossberg production site. Mossberg uses only factory original parts and install them to exacting specifications. Every firearm is returned inÂ readyÂ condition.

The PARA Warthog is the world's smallest .45 ACP, 10+1 round, semi-automatic pistol. It is unbelievably powerful for its compact size... only 6.75 inches in length and 4.5 inches high including the magazine. The genius of PARA is the reliability needed in a 3-inch 1911 style pistol, from its unique dual recoil spring system to its cone barrel lockup. The Power Extractor was designed for flawless feeding and extraction with the fast cycling time of the Warthog's compact slide. The Warthog's match grade ramped barrel delivers incredible accuracy in a micro compact pistol.The frames have integral plunger tubes and grip screw bushings and ultra thin polymer grips.

Both guns along with 1,500rds of ammo for $725. These are the lowest prices on any gunsite. If you can find them for a lower price buy them or let me know and I'll buy them.

""The P229Â® is one of the most popular law enforcement pistols available today. Its nearly indestructible design outlasts, and out performs, other pistols so much so that after extensive testing with over 3,000,000 rounds fired, the Dept. of Homeland Securityâs office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) selected the P229 over pistols from five other major manufacturers. Now the P229 is the standard duty pistol for not just DHS but also the U.S. Coast Guard, and is carried by other federal agencies that we arenât permitted to discuss."""

With CZ quality throughout, the 912's handsome lines and affordable price make it attractive to the eye as well as the wallet. The CZ 912 is built with a high gloss finish and sleek look with attractive lines both on the alloy receiver and on the walnut stock. The modern-style recoil pad provides for not only a significant reduction in perceived recoil, but is snag-free as well. A long recoil spring is located in the butt of the stock, simplifying assembly and allowing it to cycle a wide variety of loads across the power spectrum in both 2 Â¾"" and 3"". In addition, the rearward spring design makes required cleanings less frequent and easier when they are needed. Removal of the installed magazine plug is simple, requiring only the magazine cap to be unscrewed. Without the plug it gives the upland hunter a 4+1 capacity.

From the website:

Authentic Look of Old West - Modern Function 

All of the western gear I make is based on originals from the 19th century. Making my own patterns has allowed me to duplicate the styles and designs of cowboy gear that were once popular on the western frontier. Many of my dyes I mix myself to more closely resemble the colors that were used âback then.â I also use the same construction techniques that the saddle makers used 120 years ago. All of this ensures that my product is as authentic as I can make it. 

I only use the same western hardware that was available during the 19th century that is still made the same way today. My buckles are made either of solid brass or are nickel plated brass. The rivets I use are either âtubeâ rivets or copper bur rivets. 
Cowboy Action Holsters 

Back in âthe day,â cowboy holsters were designed to keep the gun in the holster regardless of weather, bouncing around on horseback etc. To accomplish this, the old holsters were generally made of thinner leather which ""clung"" to the gun. However, Cowboy Action Shooters want the gun to come out of the holster as quickly as possible, which means that the holster has to be made of thicker leather to hold its shape after the gun is removed. Although thicker leather works better, the edge doesnât look the same. 
My solution is to make the holster out of thicker leather, which holds its shape well so you can remove and replace the gun quickly; but I thin the leather at the edges to give the holster the same look as the originals."

The EOTech holographic sight features a heads up design that allows both eyes to be open in order to maintain peripheral vision and depth perception while shooting. It features an sleek and unobtrusive low profile design that points naturally. The reticle is a 65 MOA open circle with a 1 MOA aiming dot in the center, providing fast target acquisition and precise aiming options. The model 551 N is 4"" in overall length and runs for 200 hours on a set of N batteries. The 551 N also includes a toggle switch that immediately lowers the light intensity for use with night vision without any halo effect.

-EOtech 551 w/original box. It's currently mounted on a very nice AR build. I really want to sell the entire package, but will consider trading just the EOtech. If the 551 goes before the rifle.... Then I will be keeping the rifle. The EOtech is in very good condition. The 551 is no longer in production.....if you didn't already know the main difference is the smaller mounting base. It comes in the original box with paperwork. I'm mainly looking for handguns, but all reasonable offers will be considered. Really looking for a Glock 41 or Glock 34. Thanks!

-Also have a like new Magpul CTR butt-stock and Tango Down vertical grip that I can throw in for the right deal. Thanks!"

Borrowing features from predecessors like the Beretta M9 and Beretta 92 it is rapidly proving itself as a suitable option for law enforcement (both on and off duty) private security forces and responsible citizens.

The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact compact and full frame versions. Checkered grips on all models provide a sure grip in less than optimal conditions and three backstraps (included with every pistol) can be swapped for comfort and fit. The design is based on that of the M9 and 92 and the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way fit.

An ambidextrious safety (thumb operated decocking lever) prevents unintentional discharge in the event the gun is dropped. High capacity double stack steel magazines provide enough firepower for self defense and law enforcement. A non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty.

I have a Ruger LC9 that i've carried CCW for just over a year now. The gun is in good condition shooting wise and has approximately 175-200 rounds through it. It is not even close to broken in yet. The only bad with this gun is the grip as you can see in pictures. My 9 week old German Shepherd got ahold of it accidentally one night and did very minor puppy teeth damage to it. It does not affect the gun whatsoever except for maybe the feel of it. But it is not bad at all. A rubber grip around it and that problem goes away. Good little CCW gun if you're not looking to pay $350+

It comes with original box/paperwork and I have an in the waistband holster i'll give to.

This is a $400 dollar gun brand new I think my price is more then fair. Would be willing to throw in cash for a Glock 26 trade.

Cosmetic scratches give the gun a seasoned look that I think is pretty cool.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. 

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

Come check this pistol out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte. Give me a call @ 980-237-eight9eight1 if you have any questions. Shipping can be arranged for $20. Check us out on Facebook @ www.facebook.com/thearmsroomcharlotte or try our website @ www.targuns.com Thanks for looking and have a good day."

That is why my price is so low.  However, it does come with a two piece scope mount. $50 I think? It's either I sell this rifle or I cut it to pieces. If you're interested in upgrading to a Timney trigger anyways, this could be the rifle for you. You could have a very accurate sharp shooting rifle for the same price as the base model 700 SPS .223 even after you buy the trigger.  Again, if I can't sell this rifle I'm cutting it into a pile of debris."

Nano 9mm - Comfort and Power in Concealed Carry and Personal Defense

The Nano was designed with one goal in mind: creating the ideal micro-compact pistol for concealed carry and personal defense. Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing.

Easy to ConcealBeretta Nano

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.

Personal Protection Made Easy

Nano_with_Crimson_Trace_Laser

The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.

Easy to Use and Maintain

The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense.

Background:

What you are looking at is an early production Chinese SKS, deemed the Sino-Soviet. This is determined by a lack of an arsenal marking of the use of Cyrillic alphabet in the serial. This gun lacks any arsenal marking.

This is not a cheap Chinese Norinco import, this is a real military Arsenal SKS. The ATF gave the greenlight to a batch of these that were sitting in Albania after the cold war. After the Sino-Soviet split, Albania sided with China to continue on Stalinization policies. In return, China provided Cold War aid in the forms of weapons and industrial aid. These SKS's were part of those aid packages. Once these SKS are gone, there won't be anymore authentic Russian or Chinese coming into the country due to the importation ban. Get your little piece of history today!

The gun:

Nation: China
Type: Type-56 Sino-Soviet SKS
Caliber: 7.62x39
Barrel: 20 inch chrome lined threaded and not pinned like a Russian.
Receiver: All Milled
Matching: Yes, 95 percent. (Original Gas Tube is Corroded and the piston gets hung up on it, but it will be included with the gun. A replacement with the matching upper handguard is currently on the gun.)
Accessories: Yes, includes original cleaning kit, original cleaning rod, and original bayonet assembly and bayonet.
Finish: 95 percent of bluing intact. Stock is in great condition.

Extra Information:

1. This gun has been fired 3-4 times to insure that rounds cycle reliably. This was due t the original gas tube not cycling and a replacement being needed.

2. This gun was originally packed in heavy cosmoline and I spent over 5-6 hours of my time clearing it away. You get it clean and functional without the mess.

3. This gun has not been sighted in or shot at the range. It will need to be sighted in, there are guides online on how to do this.

4. This gun is C&R eligible. 

Price: 400$

This gun cost me 320 before taxes, another 20 shipped and 20 for a transfer fee. I cleaned it out of the cosmoline and found a rare, Sino-Soviet, matching rifle beneath it. The stock is in great condition, (Which is a gamble with buying these guns) and the bluing is almost entirely intact except for the replacement gastube. 

I'm looking to break even on the gun and hoping it goes to a good home. Extra expenses came up, so I need to sell it much to my dismay, but my loss can be your gain.

For 400 bucks you get everything mentioned above and seen in the pictures, except for the sling which belongs to my AK47. I will also throw in 2 SKS stripper clips to go with the gun for free.

I would prefer a FTF transfer, but the buyer can pay to ship and do the transfer fees to have it sent out of state or to have it transferred at an ffl, the buyer will pay the transfer fee to have it done. 

I'm open to question or other offers.

Thanks for looking!"
