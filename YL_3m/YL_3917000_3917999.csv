It does however include the bolt, cam pin, retaining pin and firing pin so it is ready to go!
The North Eastern Arms Compact Carbine Stock (CCS) is the ultimate Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) solution. A collapsible stock; shortening the overall length of the rifle approximately 2 7/8” inches compared to a traditional M4 stock.
The CCS has been designed with the professional in mind allowing for quick deployment into the firing position. The CCS is a 2 position stock and can simply be pulled into the fully extended position without the need for manipulation and collapsed by depressing the locking mechanism. The CCS is made out of 6061 T6 Aluminum and 4140 steel to ensure its durability in the harshest environments. The aluminum features a matte black Cerakote finish and the steel components have been treated with our ARC+ Nitriding giving an added layer of corrosion resistance and durability. The CCS comes as a complete drop-in unit containing stock, stock adapter, buffer tube, spring and modified full auto bolt carrier/buffer. The CCS is compatible with most mil spec AR-15’s.
Just remember you cannot put this on an AR pistol.  Only a registered SBR or a gun with a 16” barrel.

I'll be in that area for some time before going back. If interested, please let me know before then (around Feb. 14) so that I can bring it down. 

I have a Bolivian Contract VZ24 Mauser for sale or trade. As you know, (or maybe do a bit of looking around on the internet) this rifle is extremely rare. Only 101,000 ever produced in the caliber 7.65x53 (Argentine) for the Chaco War. Boliva has also never released their VZs (sent originally from the Czechs and ""approved"" by the Nazis who later used them in Stalingrad and other places after capturing Czech factories). It is also an extremely well-made weapon. 

Gunsmith inspected. Good headspace and bore. Caliber measured to be 7.65x53 (only Bolivan Contracts have this). Numbers don't match and crest has been scrubbed -- BUT for all the good in the world the Condor Bird marking still remains. It is very small but escaped scrubbing. Bolt cycles perfectly and the gun is a shooter as well as collector's prize. 

Wonderful and beautiful rifle, but I'm wanting something else and cannot afford to keep it and add a new beauty.

First issued in 1918 for WWI and the serial number matches that manufacture date. After WWI was returned to the arsenal to be reworked and stored. Received and new barrel in 1942 as reflected and confirmed by the stamps on the barrel. All markings in the stock reflect that this is the original stock for this rifle with all proper markings and stamps. The barrel inside is bright and shinny and the lands and groves are like new, showing very little use. I have fired this rifle and it functions flawlessly. It has the long range rear sights. Original sling dated 1944. I got this from the man that carried it during WWII and brought it home. It has been in his safe until he sold it to me.

I took this rifle to the cabalas gun library experts in Phoenix to have it confirmed and evaluated.

When the chips are down and stress is high, a quality laser can make all the difference in making it back home in one piece. Let's face it; bad things usually happen at night in dimly lit areas. When it is happening is not the time to think about the proper sight aids for night time encounters. With LaserLyte Lasers on your side you have the tool necessary to get your hits on target when it matters the most. Grab a LaserLyte and see what you have been missing. 

The Affordable, Holsterable, User Friendly Laser from LaserLyte now for the popular Concealed Carry Ruger LC9 LaserLyte builds on the success of the LaserLyte Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser (CK-AMF), made available earlier this year, by introducing the CK-AMF9 for the Ruger LC9. Made just as streamlined and programmable as the CK-AMF version, yet slightly larger, the CK-AMF9 design fits not only the Ruger LC9 but the Kel-Tec PF9 pistol, as well. 

It is easy to mount on the gun by simply pushing out and replacing the stock frame pins with the new threaded pins (included). Mount the CK-AMF9 to these pins with the included screw. Then push the ergonomic activation button with the index finger and the laser is on target. The programmable laser features a pulse or constant on mode and also has an auto-off function to prevent an unwanted battery drain. An added benefit to the Laserlyte CK-AMF9 is that the laser actually helps to provide safer trigger control by acting as a finger guide without blocking the laser beam. The smooth, no-snag design of the laser allows the pistol to easily holster in any available nylon or leather pocket holster on the market.

My first post was flagged as a scam and removed. I’m not certain why as I am new to Armslist. If the reason was I posted stock pics from Beretta, it was because my elderly father has the gun in Hialeah and I am posting for him from the Keys. I don’t have a pic of his gun. If you doubt this is legit, why not email me for more details instead of deleting my post and making me go through the PITA of reposting? Thank you."

I now have a good bit of excess .223 I can part with. If you're one of the weekend rock 'n' rollers that goes through alot of .223/5.56, this may be your lucky day.  My reloading is done by hand, no automated equipment whatsoever. I've been using the same powder charge for 30+ years (IMR 4198 21.0 grains). No sense in changing something that performs flawlessly.  Back in the good ole 20-inch AR days, my loads chrono'd at 3120 FPS. My cases are trimmed to specifications, not reloaded as-is, like some well-known southeastern outfits. My ammo is resized with a RCBS small-base 223 die, not a 5.56 one. It will chamber in any 223 AR platform. I visually inspect each piece of brass about 6-8 times through its reload cycle and have several quality control parameters I manage. The price of reloading components significantly affects the costs and therefore, my asking price. Willing to sell in lots of 500 rounds for $200 cash (40 cents a round), I'll do a small price break on a 1000 round lot ($380). Meet/pickup in West Knox only"

It apparently belonged to a Florida sheriff's office SWAT team that moved from bolt action rifles for their snipers to AR-10 type rifles and these were surplused out a few years back. I picked it up on a whim when I bought a couple of their surplus pistols. 

This thing has the wear you'd expect of a used surplus police sniper rifle. It likely wasn't shot much because the barrel is perfect but it looks like it has wear from being stored in a case in the back of a moving patrol car for years. Meaning: If you look at the handle on the bolt for instance, you see wear in the bluing and wear on the edges of the deputy's paint job. 

The stock is a Houge stock and I have no idea what the scope is but it is a variable power scope that is dead-on-balls accurate and clean and bright. I took this thing to the range ONCE and the rounds hit wherever the crosshairs were without any effort at all (and I'm not a long range shooter by any means). The name of the scope may be under whatever wrap is on the scope but it doesn't appear to be one of the nicer, expensive brands but it sure is crisp and accurate whatever it is. Make your trade offers or cash offers based on the rifle and I'll throw the scope in on the deal free because I'm too attached to this paint job to unwrap it to investigate the scope and I may just keep the whole rifle if no cool trade offers come in. BiPod and sling included and I'll even throw in the .308 rounds on the stock and about 50rds more. 

The paint job appears to be just spray paint so a little Citristrip should take this right off if you're not a fan of the paint job (which I think is the coolest part). 

Looking mostly for trades but feel free to make a cash offer."

When you need to respond in seconds and outside help is minutes away, the Para PDA .45 ACP is your able companion. A full 6+1 rounds of potent .45 ACP firepower are on tap when you squeeze the smooth LDA trigger. It won't weight you down at 24 ounces. Small, light, fast and carrying 8+1 rounds of low recoil 9mm Luger ammo, the Para PDA 9mm is a lot of reassurance in an ultra-compact package. PDA's are sized like Snubbies but they have 3-inch match grade barrels because you need accuracy in a defensive pistol.

 Browning Hi Power is a single-action, semi-automatic handgun available in 9mm. It is based on a design by American firearms inventor John Browning, and completed by Dieudonné Saive at Fabrique Nationale (FN) of Herstal, Belgium. Browning died in 1926, several years before the design was finalized. The Hi-Power is one of the most widely used military pistols in history, having been used by the armed forces of over 50 countries.

Hi Power. Take a true classic to the range. When it was introduced early in the 20th century, the Browning Hi Power 9mm pistol was a revelation. It offered the perfect balance of handling, size and firepower, with an impressive 13-round magazine capacity. Over the years, the Hi Power has aged gracefully and continues to have a loyal following among those “in the know.” Whether you are a novice or a seasoned shooter, you will appreciate the fine craftsmanship and function of these classic pistols, the sure heft of the machined steel frame and slide, and their natural pointability.

Even with the double-column magazine, the grip is narrow to neatly accommodate nearly every hand size, and the single-action trigger provides a smooth, consistent pull. As reliable, accurate and easy to shoot as ever.

503 rnds of ammo--20 of which is commercial PPU FMJ. The rest is NON-corrosive military surplus from Argentina. Fabrica Militar ""San Francisco"". Brass About 150 rounds are on stripper clips. The rest are in their original boxes. 95% of this ammo is CLEAN and has been stored in airtight ammo cans, of which both will be included.

First rifle: 1891 carbine, was built by Deutsches Waffen-und-Munitionsfabriken, Berlin, Germany-- for the Argentine Army. They added a list of features that they wanted, and it was designed and built especially for them. The metal and wood is gorgeous on this rifle. Everything matches. Only downside is the crest is marked off on the receiver. The upside is that it was done very clean.

Second rifle: 1909 carbine. All matching serial numbers. The fit and finish on this rifle is excellent. The wood is beautiful! The actions on both of these rifles are like butter.

Found a 1909 that sold for $700 on gunbroker this past december. And mine is in better condition..

I am asking $275 for the ammo, $225 for the first rifle, and $400 for the 1909. $900 even.I know mentioning gunbroker is a sin, but I have seen these sporterized horribly and still sell for $400-$600 (1909).

Perfectly sized and balanced, it is equally suited for concealed carry, home- or personal defense as well as recreational shooting. With its full grip, full-capacity magazine, accessory rail and interchangeable backstraps, you will get a further sense of its versatility. But it is at the shooting range that this double/single-action compact handgun will truly wow you: thanks to its rotary barrel system, recoil dissipates radially, resulting in much less thump in your hand and super-fast follow-up shots. An Ultra-Reliable Professional Choice for Holster Carry. As you read this, the PX4 Storm in its various configurations is being carried by countless law-enforcement and military organizations around the world, in every environment imaginable. This is because it is engineered to be absolutely reliable and ultra-durable, and it is capable of shooting well over 100,000 rounds without any part breakage. And its dimensions that fall right in between the full-size PX4 Storm and its sub-compact counterpart make it perfect for everyday holster carry (concealed or open), offering light weight and smaller proportions while still affording a full grip. This is a pre-order gun that will arrive within 7 business days of being ordered.   Was $552 - now only $533.00.  Free layaway option available.

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.
