East German plastic cored practice ammunition. Approx 62 gr. steel jacketed, hard plastic cored round nosed projectile chemically stained black for identification. Velocity out of an AK is in the 3,000+ fps range. This is LETHAL ammunition and will penetrate a respectable amount of wood at close range in my experience. It was designed for the AK and RPK and as a result, is not 100% reliable in the SKS due to the different gas systems. 

The ""Ub"" stands for ""Ubung"" which means ""practice"" in German. The ammo was designed for use on ranges with limited down-range danger space and was intended to be used out to 300 meters. It's danger range is 1,300 meters. It is not ""short range or ""indoor"" practice ammo like some folks have suggested. 

Was originally invented to shoot people climbing over the Berlin Wall and not harm the wall.

I bought this ammo at a gun show for my SKS not knowing that it rarely cycles properly in a SKS. I paid more then what I'm offering it to you for and I'm throwing in the 50cal can that I paid for separately. I'm looking for $120.00 obo. Also trades all will be considered.

Description of the scope from the website (http://www.minoxscopes.com/minox-zv3-scopes/):

The newest Minox ZV3 riflescopes produce fantastic overall performance that many hunters strive for and deadly accuracy that predators fear. Utilizing excellent overall optical performance, as a result of high quality, fully multi-coated glass along with trusted mechanics, the new ZV3 riflescopes match any hunter’s requirements for a high quality and an incredible value.

A sleek aluminum one piece body means durability and long-lasting performance.  Minox ZV3 rifle scopes are built to withstand weather with full waterproofing and nitrogen purged one inch bodies.  Sixty MOA of internal adjustment assures that you’ll be able to dial into a target at any range.  The 3:1 magnification range, the most common in modern rifle scopes, provides a wide field of view at low magnification and reveals up-close detail at high magnification, allowing the shooter to always put rounds on target. The Minox ZV3 rifle scope is available in 3-9×40 magnification with Plex and BDC reticles.

It has a Choate stock, an aftermarket flash suppressor, and a Bushnell scope on it. It has a 188 series serial number, so it was built after the retooling.

The weapon fires and operates flawlessly with both 223 Remington and 5.56 Nato. I got the gun used, and have shot it a few times myself, so I have no clue what the round count on it is for those of you that care about that. This gun is a blast to take out into the desert and shoot. This is a shooter, not a collector. While it is not in factory new condition, I do keep my guns very clean, and the condition of this one is very good.

In addition to the gun with its few attachments, I am including 1 5 rd Ruger mag, 1 20 rd Ruger mag, and 3 Tapco Pmags. These are the second generation Tapco mags and all 3 cycle rounds, both 223 and 5.56 just fine. (There are some reveiws saying the first gens had trouble with cycling rounds up, Tapco heard and fixed them). There is a bag of 500 M193 5.56 Nato and 45-50 rounds loaded into the a couple mags. The loaded rounds are a mix of 5.56 and 223 and the bag is all the same. There is a also a Ruger single point sling that will go with it.

When you come see it it will be in case, but the case does NOT go with the gun, that was a gift so I can't sell it with the gun. Please bring a case with you.

I am not interested in trades and this is a package deal for cash only. Please feel free to email any questions or for a time to link up. If you would rather talk on the phone just email your phone number and a good time to call. Thanks for looking and have a nice day!

More about the 1911B
The first Model B is fundamentally the 9 mm Luger/Parabellum version of a similar 1922 and first and secondModel A pistols. These are transitional guns, with broadly the control layout of the Colt/Browing guns (epitomized by the 1911), but based on the overall layout of the previous series of Star pistols.

The Model B was developed and marketed synchronously with the Largo versions, with production commencing in 1924. The model ceased production in 1931."

A vet at war’s end cut the stock under the sling band and affixed back together, expertly. This also adds to the rifles character and story.

It weighs approximately two pounds unloaded. This military model features gray oxide coating, and a ported barrel to help with the recoil of the high powered round it fires.
Due to its muzzle energy, higher pressure FMJ ammunition fired from the CZ 52 pistol will penetrate even NIJ II rated ballistic vests. Meaning your winchester white box ammo will go trough a ballistic vest like a hot knife trough butter.
This pistol has a few upgrades on it, including new rollers, firing pin, extractor, and springs. All the original military parts are also included.

The build was completed by Investment Grade Firearms with attention to detail. Absolutely no shortcuts in any way were made. All furniture and internals are factory HK PSG-1, not another .308 type HK being passed off as original equipment. The the barreled receiver has the correct T type PSG rails that have been custom CNC as well as LEO Restricted Marked. The barrel was made by Schnider To exact HK specs complete with Polygonal 1/10 Rifling for those heavier match bullets. The receiver comes complete with the correct HK PSG-1 scope tabs that are designed specifically for the almost mythical to obtain HK's Hensoldt ZF 6x42 PSG-1 scope, which included in the sale. As all of you HK buffs know, these scopes have been out of production for some time and are impossible to find outside of owning an original PSG-1. The reticle is Mildot and the elevation and windage adjustments are in MilRad adjustments.

    This is as close someone can get to a factory HK PSG-1 as one can get here. If you have ever wanted one, this would be the time act.

    This listing is only for the stock assembly, bolt group, barreled receiver assembly and trigger assembly and scope. Must ship to FFL. I accept only cash or postal office money order. Sorry no personal or business checks accepted. Sorry not looking for trades at this time. This is a very fine addition to the serious HK Collector.

This rifle has been highly upgraded and is great for     3-gun competitions, recreation, and tactical use. 

Here's everything the gun comes with:

Magpul Moe adjustable stock $40
Magpul ASAP Sling attachment $25
Free float handguard: Daniel Defense MFR 12.0 $280
Battlecomp 1.0 compensator/flash suppressor $140
Hogue Grip $20
Troy Folding Battle Rear sight $120
Daniel Defense Fixed front sight $65
ALG Defense QMS trigger $40

I'll include 2 30 round Pmags in the price. If you want more or fewer mags, we can work something out.

I'm keeping the Geissele SSA-E trigger currently in the gun (I'll put the ALG defense trigger in the gun if you want to come see the gun). If you really want the Geissele and don't mind paying full price for it ($230), I can leave it in the gun. 

These guns stock are going for $900 ($975 after tax). That plus the cost of the upgrades included is $1620. After tax, that's $1765. The gunsmithing costs to install all of this would probably be another $150 or so.

The rifle itself is in very good shape and has only seen around 2000 or so rounds fired through it and is about 18 months old. The barrel is chrome lined, chambered in 5.56 with a 1:9 twist, which will stabilize everything from very light bullets to heavy 75 grain rounds.

I'm willing to sell the gun with the features listed above for $1250 with two mags. This is a more that fair price, but I'm open to negotiation on price, parts, and upgrades. For example, if you don't want the sights I can knock some off the price. Make me an offer!

This is not a beat up police trade in, its in .40 caliber, in very nice shape with night sights.

Will come in its original case and 4 twelve round magazines, a paddle holster, and around 125 rounds of .40.

Metal stampings include: left side of slide -- three line maker mark, address and Browning Patent reference on the left side of the slide -- FABRIQUE NATIONALE D'ARMES DE GUERRE (NATIONAL FACTORY OF ARMS FOR WAR) HERSTAL-BELGIQUE (HERSTAL, BELGIUM) BROWNING'S PATENT DEPOSE -- along with the Nazi Eagle over WaA 140 and the Nazi Eagle over a circled swastika; left side frame - the Nazi Eagle over WaA 140 and the Nazi Eagle over a circled swastika; right side of slide, frame and barrel -- the serial number 31955 f; front of slide beneath muzzle -- the Nazi Eagle over WaA 140; magazine rear wall -- the Nazi Eagle over WaA 140. Condition is original and very good with an estimated 90% of the blued finish on all metal surfaces. Scattered handling marks. Grips are very good with some scratches. Leather holster has a mild scuffs and surface cracks from age. Mechanically, this pistol is very good to excellent. Serial number: 31955f. A collectible pistol from WWII that demonstrates the Belgian manufacturing characteristics under Nazi Germany occupation and control.
 The FN P35 “Hi-Power” had been in production since 1935. Designed by John Moses Browning, and completed by Dieudonne Saive, the pistol was chambered in 9mm and had a 13 round capacity thus called “High Power”, and was a desirable military firearm. For comparison, the German issued P.08 Luger and P.38 held 8 rounds of 9mm each. When the German forces invaded and occupied Belgium in 1940, they also took over the FN (Fabrique Nationale, in Herstal Belgium) plant.
 The Hi-Power was immediately liked by the Germans, and reassigned the designation Pistole 640(b)

 The pre-war inventories of parts at the FN were used to produce more of the Pistole 640(b), all bearing Nazi Waffenamts and the typical swastika-eagle stamps.
 When in early ’42 the pre-war inventories ran out, the German led war-production was started up, and most Hi-Powers after that had wooden grips, unlike the synthetic grips used on prior production guns.

 This pistol has a WaA140 waffenamt in it, which indicates it was produced in Belgium between 1942 and 1944 and inspected by the Wehrmacht inspectors in Luttich, Belgium.
 The Hi-Power was immediately liked by the Germans, and reassigned the designation Pistole 640(b)

 The pre-war inventories of parts at the FN were used to produce more of the Pistole 640(b), all bearing Nazi Waffenamts and the typical swastika-eagle stamps.
 That Hi-Power is known as the third (and final) sub-variation of the German occupation pistol designated the P.640b.
 Those brown plastic resin grips are original to that gun as are the rather roughly machined and finished major parts. The blue finish on the b suffix pistols was thin to say the least.
 The abbreviated serial numbers on the barrel and slide were common practice for Hi-Powers produced in that time frame.
 2 Unmarked aluminum follower magazines are also correct for guns in this serial range.

 Serials up to 63,000b in the b suffix when the Germans had to fall back to the East out of Belgium in September of 1944.
 No fixed dates of manufacture are around that I am aware of. 

 Good looking correct supple holster that does not look either over oiled or dried out. 
 It is best for the finish of the gun to not store it in the holster where rust has a better chance to develop or gun oil that would stain the leather and stitching.

 In my experience the plastic grip 3rds are more rare to encounter than the much more common wood gripped, fixed sight variation Hi-Powers. I say this as a result of my research of this gun and it’s history

 The majority of WWII Hi-Powers, due in large part to their popularity with shooters, have been shot and handled to the point of large degrees of finish being lost.
 This gun does not seem to have that apply as the front grip finish is the first thing to go on the Hi-Power and this one looks like the gun would rate in the high 90s for condition.

 I believe this gun would definitely generate collector interest. Based on my research, this gun would sell for a few hundred dollars more"
