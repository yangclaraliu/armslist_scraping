Like other XD® pistols, the XD® 3” Sub-Compact gives you great versatility when it’s used with X-Tension™ magazines. Enjoy 13+1 rounds of 9mm, (9+1 of .40SW) with standard flush-fitting magazines. Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 16+1 rounds of 9mm (12+1 of .40SW.) You’ll find everything on the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®.

If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD® 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range.

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

It includes a special bolt carrier with the buffer milled onto the rear.  Perfect for SBR's!  
I do accept Paypal as a gift if you want it shipped.  
Factory Description:
The new Patent Pending NEAG Inc Compact Carbine Stock (CCS) is the ultimate solution for close protection guns: a collapsible stock which renders the NEA-15 7.5” PDW only 21 inches in overall length - nearly 2 inches shorter than a fully collapsed MP5A5, with proven 5.56m NATO performance. A true collapsible stock with a total weight of only 1.5 lbs; only 1oz heavier than a traditional 6-position carbine stock system with buffer and spring. The minimum length is a scant 4.75”, while the fully extended CCS stretches to 8.5” for maximum ergonomic range even on rifles designed expressly for extreme compact size. Materials are 6061-T6 Aluminum and 4041 steel with NEA’s proprietary ARC+ surface treatment. The NEAG Inc CCS is the final evolution of a project intended to provide end users with the ultimate in rifle portability and concealability. Features a single point sling point.  These do not work with piston driven AR's.  US customers can expect to pay about $46 in brokerage fees at the time of delivery.  This is payable to UPS/USPS and not charged at the time of purchase.

In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.  MSRP is $653.00-Thats not my price"

UNFIRED, BRAND NEW IN THE BOX. only taken out of plastic for the pic.

INTERESTED IN;

 HK 91's & 93's also MP5. 

M-14's, Other Colts (other AR Models, Army & 1911 pistols), HK's, Leupold and high end optics only, that have resale value, quality glass only (i.e Leupold MK series, Nikon, Zeiss etc). Gold, Silver, Bobcat attachments, ATV's.
- If you have something worth more than my Colt, I have no problem kicking in the cash at my end. This gun will be traded for an equivalent of $1300.


NOT INTERESTED IN;

- AK's of any kind.

- Reproductions, commemorative's or special editions

- Cheap rifles with lots of accessories regardless of what ""total $"" you paid for them. Rifle value to rifle value.

- Optics unless they have resale value as mentioned above, no Tasco or anything that has ""Sniper"" on the box, scope or literature.

- Money. I don't have to take less than this gun is worth in trade, I don't invest in Colts so I can offer them to the public at a discount. 

- Mentioning you are a police officer- I respect your job just as my own son is LE but Im not interested in your profession or the discounts that come along with it. Get your guns where you get discounts.

- Lessons on what  Mil-spec ""really"" is (I already know)

- Supplier links showing all the places where the price is ""cheaper"" . Purchase the gun without psychical inspection, pay for it then pay tax, transfer and shipping and wait for it to arrive at your local dealer.

- So just trying to be clear, I'm just looking for an even trade, nothing more, nothing less. I am a collector who maintains a surplus of inventory for when I come across other collectors who also may have a surplus of something they want to trade. I am not a dealer or flipper nor do I need to ""get rid of it"".

Thank you for viewing my listing and your consideration."

http://www.armslist.com/posts/3835714/houston-texas-optics-for-sale--trijicon-rmr-sight-adjustable-led

Most of the fakes will be pretty easy to spot, here's what to look for:

No ® (trademark symbol) after the Trijicon logo on the left side
Most are supposed to be RM06 models
All have the same fake serial number---- 080782
Hex adjustment screw, the real RMR's have slotted adjustment screws

Notice the fake one in the link I shared (and flagged) above has all of the fake things to look for on the list.  There is NO WAY it isn't a fake.

If you buy one of these don't expect it to hold zero or last longer than a full magazine.  These were built for airsoft use, not for use with real steal!

In the photos below you can see the real Trijicon RMR on the left and the fake on the right.  Don't let sellers fool you by saying it's a different or newer model.  It's not.  It's a fake!

People trying to scam people out of their hard earned money, especially around the holidays really make me mad.  Flag the ad I listed and please share any other scams you see on this site.  We have to look out for one another!"

It's basically a milled tubular upper that uses its own bolt and recoil system. He made 3 various 9mm uppers for the AR that built out of 4130 tube.

STI International’s 2011® technology gives the STI Tactical 3.0 more fire power advantage than 1911 tactical pistols without greatly increasing the size of the grip. Combining this advantage with less felt recoil and other popular 2011 features, the STI Tactical is a superior pistol for all personal protection applications. Introduced in 2012, the STI Tactical 3.0 fulfills an important part of the ‘STI Tactical Family’ line of pistols.

Building on the popularity of the 5.0 version, the STI Tactical 3.0 delivers the same high capacity, accuracy, and dependability in a more compact package with an aluminum frame to lighten the pistol even further. The STI Tactical 3.0 is well suited for multiple applications, ranging from police and SWAT teams requiring a back up firearm with a light rail and high capacity, to the individual demanding a high performance pistol with special features for personal protection. The tactical rail milled into the dust cover of the frame accepts all industry standard light mounts.

From Remington...
Overview:

This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds. Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, but at a much more affordable price.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years1.

Key Features:
26"" or 28"" vent-rib bead-sighted barrel 
Standard Express finish on barrel and receiver 
Shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells

Included in these parts is a G2 trigger assembly which reduces trigger pull poundage and doesn't have the trigger slap that the standard trigger has.

I've had interest in individual vehicles. I can't sell them individual for the $1200.00 each, but if
I have 7 people that want a different one I'll work with each for an individual price,,, to be able to stay close to the $1200 each. But 7 people have to be commited for the one they want when all are spoken for...Or, the price would be higher if I sold one without it being in the 7 group. Really what I'm trying to do is get away from 7 project cars and have enough money to buy a nice truck or car. Just a change of plans. All of these are worth more than the $1200.00 each. Or, You wanna trade me a nice truck or car for all 7? that would work too. So, Outright cash price for one (Right Now) would be higher.  But I'm ready to deal. Thanks

1988 Chevy Dually - Very good engine and drive train. Had new tires but has been parked for a year. Body and interior pretty much major work to be done. Lots of rust on cab. Bed is Good, passenger fender has small damage at back up light. Thought on this one is if someone has a nice dually body all the drive train from this one will make theirs a nice truck.

1979 Firebird Formula - Inside very nice. Outsiide Nice. Body has some rust but workable.
This would be a good restoration start. Your engine, your transmission. This one has an engine and transmission but engine heats up and then I could hear a small knock... and I was told needs a water pump. That might stop the heating up and knock but I have no way to say for sure. Transmission,,, I think is wrong one. It would drive but I was waiting on right engine and transmission. This is a real formula. I checked VIN number.

1988 Z28 - Body looks really good, transmission not pulling in any gear. 
I think the engine in this one is newly rebuilt. Just looking at it is all I'm going by.
This car is not a junker. Red with gold ground effects. Needs the lower ground effect on passenger side. I have original one off, it was busted up and just haven't found a body shop
to go find me another. They tell me to go find one and bring it to them. Phhhhh, I think to myself, Want me to paint it too? :) 

1988 Chevy Stepside - Body looks good but does have some rust in cab corners and rocker panels. Either head gaskets or heads. Ran good but after one winter water was getting in oil.
This will be a very sharp truck when completed. It has nice wheels and just needs the heads or head gaskets. --- Then it's drivable to work on and make it nice.

1998 Ford Explorer - Body very good - Parked it because of emission problem, fuel pump stopped working. I think this one needs upper plenum and possibly a gasket for transmission valve body? and the fuel pump. Thoughts on this one is for the money, a little work and this is very nice family vehicle. If worst case, put another engine in it and stop the transmission code by replacing the gasket and it's ready. transmission worked fine for 2 years with code. I'm no transmission expert but fairly sure this is the gasket on the valve body causing the code.

1993 Lincoln Town Car. 53,000 miles on body. Has engine ready to be removed and replaced,,,,except for transmission bolts. Very nice body and new tires when parked. I mean New with no wear at all. This is a really nice four door town car, baby blue with sun roof. Interior is almost perfect. (Few small areas I was planning to fix. ) Body is almost perfect. Passenger head light is busted. That's a $40.00 fix. 

1984 Corvette - Good engine, body is workable, Have new hood on it, Have new rear bumper Cover. This is a Project Car. I have lots of parts for it. Two sets of wheels and many other parts.
just the hood and rear bumper cover would be $1000.00 or more if bought from Ebay or other site. It's far from a show car, it was that way when I bought it and still needs more work.

None of these are just get in and drive home vehicles. All are projects. I'm ready to trade or sell.

I also have 2 sets of Pontiac 14"" rally ii wheels with center caps and rings. Excellent.

I know after making a few phone calls that 22Lr is in dire need around NKY so this is awesome because I would estimate that there is about over 75,000 rounds to 85,000 rounds in this house just in 22 Long Rifle.

I DIDNT write, ""email me asking what's the lowest I'd take.""

Frame rails show very minimal wear as well.  Night sights are effectively dead--they do faintly glow in very dark conditions.

I have less than 200 rounds through this rifle...it has performed flawlessly without one single problem. I have also maintained the rifle perfectly and it has been stored in a humidity-controlled safe. 

This is really a great shooting gun and I am not at all eager to part with it but I haven't really shot it as much as originally expected and would like to focus the proceeds (if it sells) elsewhere. The gun truly is in like-new condition...my pics do not do the gun justice. If you would like any additional pics and/or specific views please message me.

Owners manual for the rifle is included as well as the original DPMS hard case the gun came with.

I will only sell according to prevailing gun laws.

NOTE: If you would prefer to buy the gun without the Bipod I will deduct $100 from the price of the gun...I will gladly keep the Bipod if you don't want/need it."

This light weight machine gun was arguably one of the finest in the world, and the high quality predecessor to the famous MG42 machine gun of WWII.  It's attributes included, speed (800 - 900 rounds per minute), weight (small enough for one soldier to carry), and an effective range of approximately 2,000 meters.  The MG34 is chambered for the 7.92 mm x 57 cartridge which it takes from a 50-round drum magazine or belt feed 

This is a semi-auto version, modified from original German MG34s that have been re-manufactured using genuine parts and shoots closed bolt. You will find the detailed workmanship of this re-manufactured weapon to be very close to the original.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc. ----------------------------------------- Not to Mention: I also have 2 brand new steel targets which are human body size and selling them for $70.00 Each if interested please let me know.

I am in no hurry to sell.  This is a very shootable  rifle, but personally I would throw it in the safe and watch it go up in price.  If you reply put something about the rifle type in your email as spam is hitting Armslist just like it does Craigslist.  
I will consider trades for certain Kimbers in .45, or other quality guns."
