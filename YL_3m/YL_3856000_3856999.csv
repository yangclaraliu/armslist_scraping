I had just picked up and installed the barrel (it's brand new and unfired) to replace the one I had originally built the rifle with.  I couldn't resist when I had a chance to grab a new Noveske barrel, but it turns out that there are a couple of other items that I'd rather have right now so this is going up for sale

The BCG has previously been used (about 150 rounds) but looks brand new.  There are marks on the charging handle due to being used but they can only be seen when the handle is pulled back.  

It is extremely light weight for a 300 Blackout upper, weighing 3lbs 11 ounces with charging handle and BCG.  And Noveske makes some of the most accurate barrels available on the market.  The barrel and gas block are tuned to enable both supersonic and subsonic round use.

Specs are as follows:

Upper Receiver - Spikes Tactical forged upper
Charging Handle - Mil Spec 300 Blackout engraved
BCG - NiB full auto 
Handguard - BCM KMR 10"" keymod handguard
Barrel - Noveske stainless steel, chambered in 300BLK, 1:7 twist, pistol gas
Compensator - Kaw Valley Linear Compensator

2. I also have a Lone Wolf 40-9 conversion barrel, and two glock 19 (9mm) mags. In addition, I have a new-in-package (never installed) lone wolf ejector assembly which is the correct part to install if you decide to shoot 9mm exclusively out of this pistol -- it basically is a 9mm extractor specifically for gen 4 and makes brass eject more consistently and not hit you on the head. Install it or don't, comes with the package anyway.  The barrel was only tested with one box of 50 rds, so it is basically like new.

Nickel/ stainless finish

two original 6rd colt magazines

I am not the First owner. The pistol has wear marks on it from the years of it being carried. Still cycles and shoots great and would make a great first CCW for anyone. 


Price out right is 500 cash money.
Could ship depending on the situation. Buyer would pay for shipping (UPS) and pay via pay pal gift. 
This is not a cheap plastic new Colt mustang. It's the quality old school one. The one you feel comfortable trusting your life with. Those plastic mustangs are like kissing your sister... just wrong.

Carried it ""condition one"" for two years and never had a ND.

As Springfield puts it-
The rear-lugged action of the Super Match is masterfully glass bedded into an oversized stock. At the core of the Super Match‚Äôs unparalleled performance is the heavy match Douglas barrel. These oversized match barrels are the heaviest possible match-legal barrels that can fit in the M1A‚Ñ¢, and they feature a 1 in 10 twist that gives optimal performance for the .308 match bullets we recommend. The Super Match also features a National Match recoil spring guide and a match-tuned gas cylinder. Add the match tuned 4.5 ‚Äì 5lb two-stage trigger, .0595‚Äù hooded rear aperture (¬Ω MOA adjustable) and .062‚Äù front sight, and the resultant rifle will blow away the competition with its precision and accuracy. - See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/m1a-super-match/#sthash.skgmBPaq.dpuf"

This is a beautiful old gun. The patina is fantastic and it appears that with the exception of the butt plate it is complete. 

But this gun does have its issues: I think it bears the wrong butt plate, it appears there might be some epoxy in the trigger guard area and one barrel has a sizable dent in it. This is not a shooter! Wall hanger or etc. It is possible that this is the real butt plate and the butt has been shaved some, I can‚Äôt make up my mind on this issue. Firing pins have been removed for safety reasons but are included.

I have over $900 invested in this gun and I know that I won't get that out of it.  So I am only asking $500 cash firm for the pistol. Trade value is of course a little higher so I would need a trade value in the $600 to $700 range.  Text me at REDACTED if interested.

The LC9 is chambered for the 9mm Parabellum cartridge. There are those who belittle the ""nine"" as a defensive round, but it is significantly more powerful than the .380. And thanks to modern propellants and jacketed hollow point bullets, it performs better than the iconic .38 Special, especially when fired from short-barreled handguns. It also does this with lower levels of recoil, which is a prime consideration when using small, light handguns.
As you might expect, the LC9 shares many of the features of the LCP. First of all it is small, only six inches long and less than an inch wide.
It's also light. Built on a glass-filled, nylon frame, which helps pare its unloaded weight, it weighs in at just a tad over 17 ounces.
Inside the frame is a hardened alloy insert that provides additional strength and includes rails that the slide reciprocates on. The LC9's slide is machined from hardened steel and features a blue finish.
Both the slide and frame have been ""melted"" to remove any sharp edges or corners that might injure the shooter's hand during reloading or clearing a malfunction. This process also makes for ease of drawing the pistol from concealment and re-holstering. Unlike its .380 caliber cousin, the LC9 features a set of rugged, easy-to-see, three-dot sights, both of which can be drifted to make windage adjustments."

 Model 51 Ithaca featherlight 20ga autoloading shotgun. The gun is nearly perfect except for some wear on top of the receiver where the previous owner had a scope mount. Other than that its nearly spotless. The barrel is marked for 2-3/4"" chamber, however I've found this gun chambers and fires 3"" shells perfectly also. I've never had a single jam, fail to feed, stove pipe, fail to eject, etc. with the gun. Its been a flawlessly performing gun for me,  and has always been well loved and cared for. $300 is a good price for an Ithaca if this age and condition, and I won't consider less. I price things I sell at a good price, and am not interested in haggling, your machetes you have to trade, or anything else. If you don't consider yourself a buyer at my price, I'll thank you to look elsewhere. With that said, you can reach me by call or text at REDACTED or feel free to email. Thank you!"
