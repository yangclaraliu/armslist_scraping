I got this as part of a trade and don't have the time to work on it.  The gun did fire fine, however the spent casing were not ejecting correctly, and sticking sometimes.  I went to tear it apart to clean it, and the internals came apart on me and I haven't been able to stick them back together.  I have all the pieces, just don't have the tools/patience to work on it.

What I know about the Felk...  The company essentially cloned the G26 and then modified it so that you could run different calibers though the same gun with a barrel swap.  It will accept Glock magazines as well.  They only imported these guns for a few years in the late 90's early 2000's and then went tits up.  So there isn't much, if any aftermarket support for this handgun.  Like I said, its a project.

This handgun was discontinued in 1999.  It's complicated and hard to work on.  Other than replacement springs parts aren't numerous.  

Also this isn't a spring issue.  The garage gunsmith can't disassemble safely enough to fix and fire, ask me how I know.  

You asked how I know CID.  I bought one off here for $400.  The slide always had issues.  Took it to a gunsmith they replaced the slide stop and springs for around $100.  That didn't fix it.

I have sold and purchased quit a bit here on Armslist this last several years and what I hate is when you get a lowballer or someone that says I can get it way lower. Why don't you, it makes sense if I can buy a brand new car from car lot ""A"" why would I waste my time tire kicking the same car on Car lot ""B""...? HELLO..."

226,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3488226,For Sale:  Winchester Model 1873,"Florida, Florida, United States","$ 2,300","Listed On: Thursday, September 11, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"From my personal collection, here is a fantastic Winchester Model 1873 in extremely high condition. Made in 1886, this little 32 caliber rifle is one of the finest original condition examples I have ever owned or seen anywhere over decades of collecting this model. For starters, it is a fairly early gun, made in 1886 and with some nice features that go along with its early manufacture date, like the caliber marking and sights. It has the ""32 Cal"" barrel marking instead of the later ""32 WCF"" marking that came into use shortly after this gun was made. The original untouched rear sight is the earliest 3rd model variation, with the short elevator of course, but more importantly made without a sliding elevation plate and set screw on the back. The original untouched front sight is the earliest variation as well, with no set screw. Condition of this gun would be very hard to improve upon, and my photos are taken in outdoor light so very harsh. The gun looks practically new indoors in normal light. The wood has all of the original untouched lustrous Winchester finish with normal handling marks here and there, and the slightly raised grain that's typical of a high condition original gun. Wood-to-metal fit is perfect and a hair proud of the metal, as is proper. The stocks have clearly never been off the gun, with gunk buildup at all the wood/metal junctures...it looks like it was molded to the gun, just like you want to see it. The blue on this rifle is truly magnificent, with essentially all of the original glossy high-polish brilliant Winchester blue. It only has minor high edge wear, even in the typical heavy use areas that fade quickly like the upper tang, lower tang behind the lever, and on the belly of the receiver. The pictures are the best description, as you can see there is no thinning ahead of the side plates, and the blue on the dust over and rail is almost all there, even the forend cap and mag retaining band (which brown-out quickly with use) have all of the original glossy blue. Just normal handling nicks and scratches, occasional slight oxidation, and gunk buildup in all the right places that attest to its originality and age. The 24"" octagon barrel truly has all of original glossy blue with the correct original polish, color, and sheen, and perfect crisp barrel address and caliber markings. Sharp edges and just minor handling marks here and there. The only real wear on the barrel to speak of is from the sight elevator sliding a couple notches back and forth, as is typical. The tube has just started to turn a touch plum, which is quite characteristic of this period on the 73, but has all of the original blue, and really you can only see the plum in the harshest outdoor light. Case color on the hammer is bright and nicely patterned with slight fading. Still has good visible case color on the lever latch (which was hard to capture in a picture), and beautiful color on the buttplate which is difficult to find on guns of this age. The lever has faded color on the sides, and vivid color in protected areas like underneath. If you look close at the photo of the color on the underside of the lever, you'll see it never was brilliantly colored when it left the factory, it has a lot of light browns, grays, and blues in the pattern. The brass cartridge elevator has a rich old untouched mellow butterscotch patina, with perfect ""32 Cal"" marking, and on the inside hardly has a mark on it, indicating very little use as the soft brass got dinged-up quickly. Even the bolt has most of the original blue remaining. Mechanically like new, and bore near perfect, like the outside of the gun."

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R.

As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

299,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3488299,For Sale:  ALG Defense ACT Advanced Combat Trigger,"Largo, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 64,"Listed On: Thursday, September 11, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The ALG Defense Advanced Combat Trigger (ACT) is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the ACT is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however it is sharper and the grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the traditional reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs.

HardLubing is ALG's term for electroless Nickel plating with an integral modifier to the base nickel plate. Either Boron or Teflon is used to enhance surface hardness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance and also create favorable tribological properties of the trigger components. Testing has shown that differential coating of the trigger parts contributes to the sharpness of the ACT's single stage pull. The trigger component is plated with Nickel-Boron which has a high surface hardness combined with excellent wear resistance. The color is a pleasing matte light grey that may be painted on non-functional surfaces if the shooter so desires (such as the trigger bow that is visible outside the lower receiver). The hammer, disconnector and trigger/hammer pins are plated with Nickel-Teflon which combines a low coefficient of friction with good wear resistance. The Teflon impregnation colors the metal a mottled, greyish/green. Parts coated with Nickel-Teflon cannot be painted. Both coatings are highly corrosion resistant eliminating the oil seal of traditional phosphated firearm components."

Boresnaked it after the first 10 and next 10 rounds to knock down any factory machining burrs and then put a few more rounds through it for fun once or twice since then. I was in the process of zeroing perfectly to the ammo I was using when the range closed, but its pretty close. I was just trying a few different boxes of cheaper 55gr. and 50 gr. hollow point/soft point stuff to get it close. Never broke into the good 69 gr. match ammo I had bought for it. It has a Centerpoint 4-16 x 40 Illuminated(red and green) Mil-Dot reticle scope that seems to work just fine holding the zero I last stopped adjusting at. I got a couple 3/4 inch groups at 100yds with that cheap ammo, which aint bad for a pistol/shotgun guy. Ive read on forums some guys get down to less than 1/3 inch groups with the right ammo. Which can mean 1 inch groups at 300 yards, and I think that'll do for just about any varmint, 4 legged or 2 legged ;) Also has a Blackhawk bipod and elastic shell holder on the buttstock. Im throwing in 2 boxes (40 rounds) of Hornady 55gr. V-MAX .223 and a hard case. Im asking $625 negotiable. Its a fun gun to shoot, and wont burn through ammo like an AR!

This is the relatively rare six shot M856, not the M85; it is one of the very few 6 shot J frame sized .38 snubs out there. Easily pocket carriable which is a plus in the summer heat. Will include the gun and box it came with, around 50 rounds of assorted .38 special, two Bianchi speed strips, and an ankle holster.

I also have a brand new, unfired ASI PASI1 12 gauge HD/tactical style shotgun. These are patterned after the Benellia Nova and will accept 3 inch shells. These are made in the same ISO NATO certified facilities in Turkey that make the Canik TP9 and CZ75 clones as well as the Girsan 1911's, Tisas Zigana handguns, and many others.

I'm looking for a compact or subcompact 9mm.  Primarily interested in a Glock 26 or 19, XD9 subcompact or XDm 3.8 compact, or other similar handguns.  Not looking for anything full sized, but feel free to let me know what you have.  No Kel Tecs.

It's a newer Waffen Werks/DDI AK74 in 5.45x39mm.

Waffen Werks had problems in 2013 but DDI bought them out and rebuilt most of their rifles on in-spec receivers.  They are still honoring past warranties and so far all DDI rebuilds have been pretty top notch. This one was rebuilt by DDI.  It passes the bullet test and seems to be put together very well.  Straight sights, decent wood, etc.

This rifle is built on a Bulgarian Circle 10 parts kit with a US made barrel, receiver, pistol grip and fire control group.

Comes with 1 Tapco Black AK74 magazine. 

**AMMO NOTICE**
This rifle did not perform well with Red Army Standard 69gr 5.45x39mm.  If you read online you can see others are having issues with the same ammo. I would stay away from RAS 69gr.  Performed flawlessly with Wolf 60gr 5.45x39mm.

This conversion kit is designed to turn a Glock 23 or 23c into a pistol caliber carbine by simply sliding the pistol frame off the rail of the glock and sliding it onto the carbine conversion. The conversion is simple and can literally be done in under a minute to change into a carbine or back to a pistol in less than a minute with no tools necessary.

The CCU was recently featured in article in Front sight magazine, a USPSA sponsored mag where competitors decidedly used the CCU in 3 gun events for PCC because of the familiar fire control and trigger pull.

This posting includes the CCU, a mini quad rail device forward of the handguard , M4 type collapsible stock and, A m16/4 style carry handle sight.

If you would like the mechtech CCU and the Glock 23  I could do both for $700 But would then have to ship firearm to an FFL if out of state or meet at an FFL OR Maryland State Police for in state transfers.

Condition would be stated as very good to excellent. Comes in original Box.

More info can be found at www.mechtechsys.com

If you would rather trade instead of purchasing outright please feel free to offer.

This is not considered a firearm but rather a firearm part and therefore can ship anywhere in the US and with whatever options the buyer would prefer."

This conversion kit is designed to turn a Glock 23 or 23c into a pistol caliber carbine by simply sliding the pistol frame off the rail of the glock and sliding it onto the carbine conversion. The conversion is simple and can literally be done in under a minute to change into a carbine or back to a pistol in less than a minute with no tools necessary.

The CCU was recently featured in article in Front sight magazine, a USPSA sponsored mag where competitors decidedly used the CCU in 3 gun events for PCC because of the familiar fire control and trigger pull.

This posting includes the CCU, a mini quad rail device forward of the handguard , M4 type collapsible stock and, A m16/4 style carry handle sight.

If you would like the mechtech CCU and the Glock 23  I could do both for $700 But would then have to ship firearm to an FFL if out of state or meet at an FFL OR Maryland State Police for in state transfers.

Condition would be stated as very good to excellent. Comes in original Box.

More info can be found at www.mechtechsys.com

If you would rather trade instead of purchasing outright please feel free to offer.

This is not considered a firearm but rather a firearm part and therefore can ship anywhere in the US and with whatever options the buyer would prefer."
