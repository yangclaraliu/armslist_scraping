260,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3777260,For Sale:  SIG SAUER SB15 STABILIZING BRACEFACTORY NEW,"HILLSBORO, Portland, Oregon",$ 100,"Listed On: Thursday, March 5, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"SIG SAUER® introduces the SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace, a shooter’s aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols. This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using an AR-style pistol. Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0” – 1.2” in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user. Features - Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter. - ATF compliant* - Veteran designed - Made in USA - Quick and easy to install * ATF has reviewed this product and determined that attaching the SB15 to a firearm does not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the firearm to NFA control 

The pistol stabilizing brace was neither “designed” nor approved to be used as a shoulder stock, and therefore use as a shoulder stock constitutes a “redesign” of the device because a possessor has changed the very function of the item. Any individual letters stating otherwise are contrary to the plain language of the NFA, misapply Federal law, and are hereby revoked.
Any person who intends to use a handgun stabilizing brace as a shoulder stock on a pistol (having a rifled barrel under 16 inches in length or a smooth bore firearm with a barrel under 18 inches in length) must first file an ATF Form 1 and pay the applicable tax because the resulting firearm will be subject to all provisions of the NFA.

SIG BRACE can still be used as intended, use to brace on the forearm.

The Colt 1991 Series is a direct descendant of the original Colt M1911. A long trigger, flat mainspring housing and original style recoil spring system remain from the original M1911 design. Upgrades from the original include white dot sights and a lowered ejection port for extra reliability. It still remains “the standard” that everyone tries to imitate, but no one duplicates.

Might even fit a target pistol with scope or red dot sight, plus makes a good pistol rug to lay your gun, mags, and other items on when shooting.

Description:
The KAC URX 3.1 Rail is a free floating, fully modular replacement forend for the AR-15 platform. Unlike traditional quad rail designs, the URX 3.1 incorporates short sections of M1913 Picatinny rail at its front and rear ends for mounting tactical accessories, eliminating the commonly unused sections of rail for reduced overall weight and a more comfortable grip. A total of 4 integral QD sling swivel sockets are provided for ambidextrous sling compatibility. Add-on KAC URX 3.1 Rail Panels and additional rail sections allow shooters to customize the forend to their needs (both sold separately).

Specifications:

    Length: 13.5""
    Weight: 13.8 oz
    Free Float: Yes
    Material: Aluminum
    Finish: Black Anodizing


Rifle Requirements: This URX 3.1 rail is compatible with any standard gas system length but does require the use of a low profile gas block. Disassembly of the rifle's gas system and removal of the factory barrel nut will be necessary. This forend uses a proprietary barrel nut that MUST be installed using a KAC URX Barrel Nut Wrench (PN: 20495, Sold Separately). For AR-15/SR-15 based platforms only; not compatible with SR-25 variants. Installation instructions, barrel nut and hardware are included."

Today, the OA is recognized as Scouting’s National Honor Society expanding its reach beyond camping to include broader service to Scouting and community. To celebrate 100 years of the Order of the Arrow and honor this high mark of distinction, Henry Repeating Arms is proud to introduce the Order of the Arrow Centennial Rifle. This special rifle commemorates The Order of the Arrow’s vision as stated by Co-Founder E. Urner Goodman, “The Order of the Arrow is a ‘thing of the spirit’ rather than of mechanics. Organization, operational procedure, and paraphernalia are necessary in any large and growing movement, but they are not what count in the end. The things of the spirit count: Brotherhood, in a day when there is too much hatred at home and abroad; Cheerfulness, in a day when the pessimists have the floor; Service, in a day when millions are interested only in getting or grasping rather than giving.” This Henry Big Boy .44 Magnum commemorative rifle is made in the USA by American craftsmen. Built upon Henry’s legacy of reliability, accuracy and smooth engineered action, this tribute rifle is like owning a piece of American history. The right side of the brass receiver features a black filled etching of the new Order of the Arrow totem with the banner CENTURIES OF SERVICE to commemorate the 1915 founding. The left side displays a black filled etching with the Boy Scouts of America Fleur-de-Lis emblem and banners with the motto A BROTHERHOOD OF CHEERFUL SERVICE and ORDER OF THE ARROW. The right side of the American Walnut stock is laser etched and hand-painted with the Order of the Arrow Centennial logo and totem with the commemorative dates 1915-2015. The forearm’s right side bears the words THE ADMONITION which represents the core conviction that all Arrowmen strive to attain. The Order of the Arrow has embodied brotherhood, cheerfulness, and service since its inception and Henry Repeating Arms is proud to recognize these fine men and thank them for their contributions to our country.

That is how much they used to sell for but they have recently been discontinued. It is actually a tall version of their Light Hiker. Very lightweight and breathable and have a built in Orthotic insole. They are awesome boots that are very popular and these are still brand new in box, they have never been worn. They are size 13 but I think they would work for someone that takes a 12 too. I ordered them for $69 plus shipping on clearance hoping they would fit because the cheapest I could find them in my size (14) was $112 plus shipping, but as soon as I tried them on I knew they were just a little too tight for me. I didn't even have them on for more than 10 seconds and the tags are still on them. I can send them back if no one wants them within a few days but I won't get refunded the shipping charges I paid plus I would have to pay shipping again to return them. So if anyone wants a great deal on an exceptionally comfortable pair of quality boots they can have them for the $69 I paid and I will only lose the shipping once in stead of twice. No need to send me any offers of less, it is $69 firm or I will just return them.

Die cast metal receiver, steel barrels and double triggers, this cap gun also has a true break-open action. It includes two “shot gun” shells for youngsters to practice both loading and un-loading. The receiver has “engraved” scrollwork, which was then ""antiqued"" to look very authentic. This piece also has a functioning safety, put right where it should be. The stock set is a thick, high quality wood-grained synthetic.  Just check out the photos!

It can also shoot proprietary caps. 

If your young hunter isn't quite ready for his own shotgun, he can now own the next best thing. This authentic looking side-by-side toy shotgun, scaled down to 33"" and very lightweight - is a great way to learn gun handling and safety.

The Astra modelo 400 was a Spanish service pistol produced by weapons manufacturer Astra-Unceta y Cia SA.[2] as a replacement for the Campo-Giro 1913/1916, which had also been chambered in 9mm Largo.[3] It was the standard issue sidearm in the Spanish Army during the Spanish Civil War and also saw service in Germany during World War II.

The pistol was mass-produced and many examples still exist today. The Spanish Navy, along with the German Luftwaffe and the Chilean Navy primarily use the smaller variant Astra 300 and the Wehrmacht later altered the Astra 400 into the Astra 600 to better handle the 9mm Luger. The 400 was considered heavy as in order to handle the power of the 9mm Largo round in a blowback action the 400 had a reinforced slide and tough spring."

   The phrase gets thrown around quite a bit, but what you see here? This is the real deal baby! 45oz of pure awesome, this 'snub nose' is bigger than life & meaner than a junkyard dog.

But if you've got the stones to wrestle this beast, now's your chance to score a very hard-to-find piece.

I'm sure your questions will be answered if you read through, if not, by all means drop me a line.


For sale I have a complete AK-74 package.

Rifle shoots excellent and functions flawlessly (as AK's are known to do) The only reason I'm selling is I'm looking to get a M1A and I already have a Couple of AR's that will fill the same role as this rifle.

Breakdown of whats included.

AK-74 built by Waffen Werks purchased last year and has 180 rounds through it.

From The Website:

These high quality AK-74 rifles are built from all matching Bulgarian AK-74 parts sets. Rifles are built to exacting standards on a new U.S. made Waffen Werks receiver. Each rifle features a brand new chrome lined U.S. made barrel properly chambered for the 5.45x39 round. They have been extremely accurate.

Rifle features a Tapco G-2 trigger set and a U.S. grip and is fully 922r compliant with all AK-74 mags regardless of country of origin. Rifles also incorporate a side rail for easy installation of scope rails or accessories.

New $619.

AK-74 Accessory package, 4 30rnd parts kits, mag pouch, bayonet and oil bottle. $169

2 Tapco 30rnd parts kits $24

900rnds 7n6 ""banned"" ammo. Full case $240 Since its a partial case I'll value it at $200

AK ergo grip, so you can actually hold the rifle. $20

Kvar O.D. green ""NATO"" length stock, A inch longer to fit us decadent capitalist pigs in the West. I have both the original stock and grip that will go with it. $47

""Venezuelan"" PK-A red dot. A excellent red dot that was built for the Venuzualian Army by the Russians. The great thing about this particular sight it that it uses a regular AA battery and it sits low enough to co-witness the stock AK sights. It also allows a proper cheek weld on the rifle a huge plus. $400

Total price if bought separate $1479

My price $1200. Non negotiable!

No Trades unless your looking to trade a M1A Loaded with a stainless barrel.

I will not break up the package it's all or nothing, sorry I just don't want to deal with all the hassle. I'm in no hurry to sell, I really have no need to sell just trying to diversify my collection so the price is the price. Don't bother contacting me saying ""I found all this stuff at the gun store for $30."" If you did, great, buy it. Don't bother telling me.

You line up the Dealer and cover the fees.

I wont travel out of the Denver Metro area so I hope your local or willing to travel.

Sorry to come off like a dick, but I think we all know how this site can be sometimes."

Wood grips, no rail, and safety/decocker points to this being an early 1990s model. 

The main difference between this and the Beretta version is the location of the safety. This is a frame mounted 1911 style safety. The Beretta has the slide mounted safety. 

Gun has wear mostly from carry, I would rate finish between 85-90%. Mechanically excellent, I just polished throat and ramp, excellent rifling in the barrel. This past weekend I took the slide all apart, and cleaned it all up. 

Comes with 2 hi cap mags and a hard case. Also have a spare set of grips for it. 

Only wanting to sell because I have a Beretta 96fs (the .40 Cal version) and am honestly looking for a Beretta 92fs to have a ""set"". I've done the same with 3rd gen S&W autos. I do have some trade interests, and some disinterest listed below.

NIB complete Spike's Tactical AR dressed in OD Green Magpul furniture with Ergo grip. This is a 100% complete Spike's AR inside and out right down to the carry case. It is not a piece part rifle that most people post on here as a Spike's AR. I bought this rifle new a year a go with plans to dress it up and make it my own. I did add a KNS anti-rotation pin kit, matching Magpul OD green forward grip. Comes with OD Green Magpul rear flipup sight also and one 30 rnd PMAG that does not come with it from Spike's due to different state laws. Comes with all that came with it from the factory including owners manual, Spike's stickers, patch, hard carry case, etc...$925 cash FIRM or I'll keep it. Trade offers welcome, high end stuff only though, firearms+plus cash offers maybe considered also, what you got?.... Look it up on the website, my loss is someone elses gain! Have close to $1100 it in when bought new with the extras I have added. Live in Chatham County, but I work in Wake County....TEXT to 9one9-4four8-six3four7

Bluing is 95% and the bore is like new. This is a very well cared for pistol.
Price includes 3 extra clips. (4 total)
Also available to the buyer is 700 rounds of Speer Lawman ammo. Price to be determined.
I have quite a few good pictures available, email if you'd like to see more.

I will not ship.  I'm in Chico and will consider a moderate drive to meet a perspective buyer at some midpoint. 

EDIT.  I received some good questions and decided to answer them here.

The year of manufacture was 1988.

I'm selling it because I'd like to get a Browning 1911-22. I think I'd be happier with something a bit less 'collectable'.  I'm always afraid I'll scratch it or something.

I do not have a manual or case.  The manual can be downloaded or I'll be happy to email you a copy.

It's a terrific shooter.  I love shooting it.  My wife hates shooting it. One more reason to trade it in for the Browning.

I do not have a round count.  Personally, I've put 48 rounds through it. The person I bought it from did not shoot it at all. The person he bought it from may have been the original owner but I'm not sure of that.  Reading the wear on the barrel, I'd say it has been carried quite a lot but probably not in a holster because the bluing doesn't show that kind of wear.  The barrel bushing leaves a distinctive ring at the front when it rattles around in there and it has a clear ring at the front.  Again, the barrel bushing wears the barrel whenever it cycles and it also shows some wear there.  If I were to make a guess, I'd put it at several hundred rounds.  I don't think the count can be too high or the bore would show some evidence. The bore looks perfect with no pitting or discernible wear.

I have a lot more high def pictures if anyone would like more detail.  Just email."
