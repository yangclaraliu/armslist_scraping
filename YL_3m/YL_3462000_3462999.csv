Can a gun actually make you shoot better? No, But the right gun actually can allow you to shoot better. The XD is a perfect example. It is designed to work with your body, not against it - allowing you to reach your full potential as a shooter. Pick it up. Point it. Raise an XD naturally to eye level and you will be looking right down the sights. That's what we call Point & Shoot Ergonomics. Try this with some other popular pistols and you may be looking at the top of the slide instead -more like ""Point and Adjust."" With a pistol like that, you will always need to bend your wrist forward to compensate for the unnatural grip angle. The natural pointability of the XD, combined with the compact size and shape of its polymer grip, makes it feel more like a natural extension of your body than an object in your hand. That's why most people find they shoot better with an XD. Does the XD make them shoot better? No. But it allows them to shoot their best.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

This gun is from my late father-in-law's collection and he was an avid lifetime fisherman and hunter.  I haven't fired this gun but it was working correctly the last time he used it.  Included are 26 rounds of Remington Ammunition in two partial boxes.

It has a smooth wooden stock with some minor surface marks. There are also some surface marks and shiny places on the barrel. The rifle is fitted with a Leupold M8-4X scope; the scope has some dust on the glass surfaces but the image through the scope is nice and clear.

Images are left for the curious for now.

I do have a 160 and 150 available if a similar gun with sloped grip is desired.  Also, the Steyr FP.

Some other 120 are in testing at this time, and probably will be available in the spring or early summer.  Feel free to contact, if you wish to be notified when they are available.  They will be advertised on Armslist, and probably also Target Talk.

The Hammerli 120 pistols area an extremely accurate single shot pistol in .22lr, using a lateral or side positioned Luger locking system.  

The trigger pull can be adjusted from several lbs down to a few ounces, rendering them suitable as hunting guns, target guns, or free pistols.  Among the free pistols, they are the only ones that were made with a ""Colt 1911"" style military grip.

The gun is available either with the grip as shown, or with a more combat style (but still right handed) grip with no palm shelf.  

10"" barrel, .22lr, made in Germany (as were 99.9% of the 120).

The accuracy of this handgun is better than that of nearly any USA target rifle.  It can be used with any velocity ammunition (CB through ultra-high velocity), extending its utility.  Designed for iron sighs, it also has an 11mm dovetail integral to the gun, for optical sights.

This gun is one of several free pistols available.  For a complete list and EXPERT'S SELECTION GUIDE to these guns, please email.  The guide and list are free.

FFL transfer only.  Please note, in some localities, this gun is classified as an assault weapon and is banned from presence within that town or geographic area.

FFL transfer only means precisely that, and includes all LEOs, CIA, DIA, other government agencies.  IL FOID alone not accepted for transfer. Also please note, this gun IS an assault weapon under a number of assault weapons bans.  

It also is dovetailed for immediate installation of scopes, and can use HV ammunition with ease.  Effective range with good accuracy, depending on the ammunition, can reach 200 yards.  It also can use the ""quite"" or low noise ammunition or CB ammunition that several companies others market, for use on in-home target ranges indoors.

If a gun closer to a true free pistol is desired, please email for information about the Steyr, Pfuff, and Hammerli 150 and 160 pistols.  Of that group, the Pfuff is perhaps the best available, with the Steyr a very close second.  Some feel the reverse is true, with the Steyr being the best of all.  The Hammerli 150 and 160 are a close second best.  All are much more accurate than the current Morini and Pardini free pistols."

This is arguably the best piston-driven AR on the market.
Some would say LWRC makes the finest, some might argue POF or LMT, but all of these other piston ARs today rely on short-stroke piston design (which utilize more proprietary parts prone to breaking).  The PWS is the only system designed after the venerable AK-47's long stroke piston.  It is light weight (weighs in under 7 lbs) and is imho the most reliable design as well as the simplest, I wouldn't take another piston system over it that's for sure.  These go for $1900 new.

Rifle has roughly 500 down the tube.
Still in great shape.
Thing is an absolute animal - it eats Anything.  Literally has not had a single malfunction.
I have shot around 200 rds of brass and the rest has been steel-cased Russian stuff like silver bear.   Its been flawless.

The hand gun comes with the original box, carrying pouch, gun lock, and instruction manual.  This LC9 makes a great choice for CCW, it has smooth edges around the entire frame and handle, has a visual inspection port on top of the slide, it's light weight, thin size and equipped with a RED laser and a exterior safety.  This gun will not fire unless the magazine is in the gun, which can be another safety.

The light weight is perfect for a woman's purse or small enough for ankle carry, or inside the waist band, or even in a pocket hardly even knowing its there.

Check the Gunbroker Website, these handguns are going for $500-600.

It's chambered in 7.62x54r which is a powerful, yet extremely inexpensive rifle round. As far as I can tell, all of the parts of the rifle are matching. The wood is fairly good, considering the age, and is auburn with a few various markings, most notably the etched russian character Ж near the sling and an Izhevesk manufacture print in a large star on the buttstock. Though it's only a Ishevsk made in 1943, I'd very much like the person I sell it to not irreparably damage by it trying to make some sort of fugly sporterized gun. If you wanna do that sort of thing, they sell an archangel stock with an attachable magazine at Cabelas, and you won't have to damage the wood, or weld anything to the metal. Included are roughly 40 rounds of surplus/modern steel production, and 14 rounds of winchester white box JSP. Also contains the original issued sling, a dis-assembly tool, and a stripper clip.

 Here is what the Ruger website says about the Bearcat:

The Ruger® New Bearcat® is different from other single-action revolvers. Smaller, lighter, and based on older Remington® single-actions of the 1800's, it has a one-piece cylinder frame that also forms its compact grip. It has been described as ""a mechanical jewel,"" and is the smallest and lightest 22 LR caliber single-action made by Ruger.

Compact and perfectly proportioned for 22 LR caliber ammunition, it is easy to carry and fits comfortably in a backpack or tackle box. Fulfilling the ideal of a smaller ""kit gun"" style 22 LR caliber single-action revolver, it is perfect for hikers, campers, boaters, small game hunters, or just about anyone who needs a dependable 22 LR revolver for the trail."

I believe this is a Colt Dragoon .44 caliber revolver that seems to have all matching #'s.

The gun does cock back like it should and seems to be functioning as it is supposed to. I took the gun apart so you can see what I have here and then put the gun back together for the last set of pictures. This gun came to me from a older man in Amherst Mass and he told me the gun was given to his father by a neighbor many years ago. Over the years the gun has been fired a little bit but it has not been fired in a lot of years. The man is at the point in his life where he needs to get rid of the gun as no one in his family wants the gun so he contacted me. The man told me he was told it was made around 1859 but he really was not sure. The gun shows finish wear from age and use. No clue when it was made or any other info about it. NO FFL NEEDED"

My price is $440 for quick sale. It comes NEW-IN-the-BOX, never handled by the public. However, I broke the factory seal to inspect and photograph it because there were reports that CIA (Century International Arms) AK’s were coming from Russia with crud under the handguard and crud in the barrels. I opened this box and ran a solvent-patch down the barrel, looked inside, checked under the handguard. This pistol came absolutely clean, externally and internally. I can find no fault, no criticism, plus it has the smoothest action you will find on any AK. Remember, AK’s are made from stamped parts, and it is their simplicity that gives them their legendary reliability. 

Other than my inspection, this pistol has not been out of the box. This M85 PV has the Yugo style muzzle break and comes with 3 (three) 30-round magazines, plus I throw in FREE, a brand new, packaged, ProMag AK-5, 30-round magazine in 5.56/.223 (Total = 4 magazines, each a different brand). (The “NP” series comes with only 2 magazines). Shipping is $30 to the lower 48, or actual cost, whichever is lower. 

Advice: Always, insert AK magazines with the bolt locked open. There is a technique for inserting AK magazines. First, practice with an empty magazine and open bolt/action until you get a feel for it. Don’t force it, use the magazine release. It’s quick and simple with one hand. 

This is a close-out, as old age is forcing retirement. I will no longer inventory any guns. My personal guns will be going too.  We are strictly a catalog-internet-wholesale-mail-order supplier of specialty & hard-to-find items for knowledgeable buyers.  None of our inventory or firearms are on display nor handled by the public.  All items are new in the box and are not on display to the public.  For locals, if you want to buy elsewhere, we will receive firearms free of charge if you order elsewhere (you pay your own shipping costs and background check).  If you are not knowledgeable in firearms and don’t know what you want, we are NOT the supplier for you."
