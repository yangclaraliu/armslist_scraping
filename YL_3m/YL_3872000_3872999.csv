Buffalo ammo is as listed on the box.  2 rounds missing out of the 10 with 20 per box.  Also included is approx 80 rounds of lead bullets.  Cost of Buffalo ammo alone was 170 with shipping.

This is a package deal all going for 450$.  Lowball offers not considered. 

This revolver comes with the original Magna Wood Grips which are in excellent conditon. Also 2 Pachmayr grips are included. One is similar to the original but a bit bigger and better for recoil and a bigger one which tames this tiger. All are shown.
Also included are three holsters. One is the original S&W holster, one is an IWB Uncle Mikes holster and the last one is a rough out pocket holster.
Two speed loaders are included as well.
This is being sold by me for the original owners mother. He passed away several years ago and the gun sat in the closet until a few months ago. I took it to the range to fire it and fired a box of ammo including a few +p hollow points for self defense, with most being standard vel. lead bullets. It shot very well and it is unusually tight with little if any cylinder play. It does HAVE SOME PITTING ON THE BACKSTRAP from not being oiled after the owner passed away.  It does not show with the bigger grip.  The rest of the gun is in good shape with almost no holster wear altho there is a spot on both sides of the barrel. Bluing is shiny and not dull.
This will make a good carry gun and shooter as it is not of investment quality and I did look up the serial number and I think it is late 1980's or early 1990's origin. I will send you the number if your interested.
No internal lock.
Sold as a package deal only. 
Must have a FL license and CWP to buy and be willing to sign a bill of sale. Also must be picked up in the kindall area.
Not interested in trades."

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

From Beretta;
 Beretta 96A1: Ultimate Tactical Firepower

The 96A1 is an evolution of the legendary 92FS (M9), one of the world’s most successful pistols for military, law-enforcement and self-defense use. Chambered in the powerful .40 S&W, it comes with three 12-round magazines to deliver impressive firepower for any tactical use. It is safe, accurate and reliable while offering easy operation, accessorization and disassembly; and its durability is further enhanced by a recoil buffer that greatly diminishes component stress. A pistol that bears the unmistakeable Beretta looks, it is the ultimate choice for shooters wanting a professional-grade personal- or home-defense pistol that can also be easily adapted for concealed carry.

Accurate and Reliable

The cold-hammer forged barrel on the 96A1 is designed to deliver great accuracy out of the box, while the dovetail-mounted front sight is easy to adjust to always keep you on target. The barrel is encased in an open slide typical of Beretta’s 90-series pistols; besides reducing weight and backward-momentum during firing, this design maximizes reliability and virtually eliminates “stove-piping.”

Durable and Made to Last

With the 96A1, the hard-hitting .40 S&W comes back stronger than ever in the 90-series lineup. We have worked in conjunction with law-enforcement experts to make this pistol shrug off tens of thousands of full-power rounds with Beretta-style durability. The brand new recoil buffer that is machined right into the action of the 96A1 essentially acts as a cushon against the stress between moving parts, greatly boosting the service life of this powerful pistol. Also, the Bruniton finish on the metal is designed to be corrosion resistant to give worry-free maintenance even after all-day concealed carry in scorching-hot conditions.

Easy to Accessorize

The 96A1 comes with an integral Picatinny rail on which users can easily mount a variety of tactical accessories--such as tactical lights, aiming devices or even both. Additionally, the front sight is dovetail-mounted, meaning that it is adjustable for windage and can be easily replaced with an accessory front sight of the user’s choice. If you love the unmatched performance of the Beretta 92FS or M9 and want a few extra tactical features as well as the extra power of the .40 S&W, the Beretta 96A1 is your ultimate choice."

There is no refinishing, no extra holes, no tune-ups, or repairs. Overall condition is very good. The the finish on the receiver has flaked and faded to a mostly smooth patina on the sides. There is a some minor corrosion and some very fine pitting but nothing deep. The barrel and magazine tube retain most of their original finish but there is some fine surface freckling present here too. I'd grade the finish on the barrel and mag tube at about 90%. The stocks are in very good condition also and although they show the usual handling marks, are free of any cracks or chips. The wood retains almost all of the original varnish, having never been sanded or refinished. This Winchester is in excellent mechanical condition and functions perfectly. The bore is in excellent condition too with bright, sharp rifling. According to available serial number listings, this Model 1894 was manufactured in about 1917.

Great mid-sized gun with all the punch you can want, all the classic Sig functions, Sig quality, and designed for concealed carry.  This one is the single/double action version with the de-cock lever used by militaries around the world, and many law enforcement agencies.

This gun was designed for those who love/depend on the functions of Sig's 226, 228, and 229 (that means single/double action, with a de-cock) but is small enough to comfortably carry as either a backup or as an ""off duty"" concealed carry.

This is a single stack 40 so you get a 7 +1 in a very lethal round.  After all, if you cannot solve your problem with 8 rounds of 40, you need to spend more range time.

This gun is lightly used with holster wear and comes with two clips.

I'm selling my Gen4 Glock 23. I have put roughly 900-1000 rounds through it, and it has been cleaned and maintained for carry regularly.

Included with the gun are the three 13rd mags it came with, plus one 15rd G22 mag and one 22rd extended mag. This was purchased in early 2013, before they started shipping the beavertail grip extensions. I have only the 2mm and 4mm extensions it came with.

The holsters are an Aker leather OWB holster in like-new condition (still needs to be broken in), a Blackhawk Serpa with belt loop and paddle, and a Galco Triton kydex IWB.

The gun has only minor holster wear which I tried to capture in the detail photos; two minor scuffs on the slide and some wear on the grip texture only on the left side. The only modification done was the 25-cent trigger job. No stippling or aftermarket components.

All in all a fantastic carry setup ready for a new owner, I'm only selling because I have another pistol of nearly identical dimensions in 9mm I prefer to carry.

I'm asking $500 for everything; I can meet you face-to-face somewhere public in the Portland area (I'm in SE PDX), and will sell to a CHL holder willing to fill out a bill of sale. Out of state buyers will have to cover shipping and transfer fees.

I'm not interested in trades.

The Model 870 is so smooth and reliable that today – nearly 60 years after its introduction – it’s still the standard by which all pump shotguns are measured. With a receiver machined from a solid billet of steel, it is the model of enduring strength. True to its original design, the pump glides with silky surety on two twin action bars for the utmost in positive chambering and ejection. These characteristics, along with its flawless balance and natural pointing qualities have made the Model 870 the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – of any action type, from any manufacturer. As the most aesthetically refined representative of our prestigious pump-action family, the Model 870 Wingmaster is a true American icon.

 Payment with PayPal gift or add 3 percent if not a gift.  Money order is accepted also.  Thanks. 
The AFG-2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the original AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

 Compatible with most any M1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG-2 (Angled Fore Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore grips, the AFG-2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Colt Defense - Roll Mark Change.
August 5, 2011 at 1:38pm

Colt Defense is discontinuing the use of the LE “restricted to Military and Law Enforcement” roll mark. As soon as existing production runs are complete, models previously roll marked as LE6920 and LE6940 will be roll marked as SP6920 and SP6940. This change applies immediately to all new orders. In addition, existing orders will be filled with rifles marked with the new model numbers as soon as the LE roll marked inventory has been manufactured and shipped.
Accordingly, proceeding from this date forward, all orders for LE6920’s and LE6940’s will be entered as SP6920’s and SP6940’s respectively.

From their website: Adding to our line up of OWB holsters, we are excited to introduce the CrossBreed® SuperSlide. The SuperSlide 3 slot holster can be worn in one of two positions. Most common is the standard behind the hip with a slight forward cant set-up. This is probably the most common carry position for CCW and off-duty carry as it provides great concealment and easy access to the firearm, while keeping the gun out of the way and in a comfortable location. The second option is a slight reverse cant for cross draw wear. Not as commonly used as other carry positions, cross draw can still be a useful and viable option to have for driving or while seated for long periods of time. Staying in tradition of the IWB SuperTuck®, the comfort of the SuperSlide is second to none. The design of the holster pulls the gun and grip in tight to the body, with the proper concealment garment the gun and holster is virtually undetectable. The SuperSlide offers a clean, comfortable, and professional appearance, along with several different carry options. It provides excellent weight distribution of your firearm, ensuring stability and comfort."

For the age of this rifle it is in great condition, the action  and firing pin are smooth and function great. The steel in the rifle is high quality  and does not display rust  like new low quality steel rifles. It is a model 1870 which was a standard U.S. military issue at the time, in the pictures you can see the foundry stamps on the action and you can Google more history about this rifle. What makes it unique  is that if you look at the picture of the sight, there are 23 intentional knife markings  along the right side of the site, the orginal owner  of this rifle must have been an exceptional marksman.

There is one small crack in the stock as shown in picture 4 but does not cause any issues, and the orginal cleaning  rod is missing other than that thus rifle is fully functional and in mint condition."
