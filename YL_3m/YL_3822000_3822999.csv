This is fully loaded ammunition, ready to shoot in your 300 AAC Blackout caliber 1 - 500 round box of 147gr FMJ ammunition. Comes in bulk pack box and loose packed in plastic bags. This Cartridge should attain a velocity of approximately 1949fps out of a 1/8 twist 16in barrel with a carbine length gas system and should function properly in all 300AAC rifles. With great ballistics and a great price, this represents on of the most cost effective 300 Blackout rounds on the market today, pickup a couple boxes for your next trip to the range! The popularity of the 300 AAC Blackout round is soaring, and for good reason! With more muzzle energy and knock down power than a 5.56 round it has the stopping power that smaller calibers lack. And with the ability to switch quickly from a supersonic high velocity round to a sub sonic suppressed round with the simple change of a magazine, this round provides more versatility than just about any other caliber on the market today! Its one drawback is its cost, rounds can typically cost $1.00 to $3.00 each or ever more. Ozark Ordnance is going to change that! Finally a way to break into 300 Blackout without breaking the bank. Our 300 Blackout rounds are manufactured with new projectiles and re-manufactured mil brass, built to the highest quality, hand inspected and tested, guaranteed to exceed your expectations.

BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE HEAVY 357 Mag - 140 gr. Barnes XPB @ 1550 fps - 20 Round Box




For those wanting/needing a lead-free, HEAVY 357 Magnum load, generating full power plus, here it is.

Below are real world velocities taken from my personal stock guns. The industry established use of long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings is essentially misleading to the public who won’t be firing the ammo from a laboratory test barrel in the real world, where it matters.

1947 fps—Marlin mod 1894, 18 inch barrel
1518 fps—S&W mod 27, 5 inch barrel
1519 fps—S&W MT Gun, 4 inch barrel
1436 fps—S&W mod 66, 3 inch barrel
1385 fps—S&W mod 66, 2.5 inch barrel
You’ll notice the newer S&W 4 inch Mt. Gun, gave higher velocities than the older 5 inch mod 27 S&W. This is because of different internal barrel dynamics and chamber dimensions of the newer gun. In general, the newer S&W revolvers are made to tighter tolerances than those of 30+ years ago.

Due to the long-for-weight all copper bullet, the 357 does not have the case capacity to use a bulky flash retarded powder and thus there is a noticeable muzzle flash with this load in all the test revolvers, however the rifle shows no flash at all due to its longer barrel.

This load is the typical barn-burning, turbo charged, Buffalo Bore type HEAVY 357 Mag. load and as such, should only be used in revolvers made of all steel. It should not be fired in light weight, alloy framed or cylindered revolvers. Feel free to use it in ANY/ALL 357 mag. chambered rifles and all steel revolvers/handguns."

The famous Winchester Model 1912 pump shotgun was designed by Winchester's Thomas C. Johnson. Introduced in 20 gauge in 1912, 16 and 12 gauge guns followed in 1914. From its debut until the end of the 1950's, the Winchester Model 1912 was the pump shotgun, long known as ""the perfect repeater."" After 1919, the model designation was shortened to ""Model 12,"" but the gun remained the same. Oh, sure, Ithaca, Stevens and Remington guns had their fans, but it was Winchester's Model 12 that dominated both the market and the public consciousness for decades. However, by the beginning of the 1960's, the times were a changin', to paraphrase Bob Dylan.

This is why the pre-64s are so sought after especially when you have a Georgia Peach this sweet my 12 boasts the 28 inch barrel, Full Choke, beutifull wood no scatches or knicks, the finish has been well kept and the blueing is phenomanal.
I have never held a Model 12 in my hand that is over 50 years old almost 60 years old and looks and feels as if it was just made. This with out a doubt a safe queen the bore and action are spotless and tight there are no flaws or no suprises when looking/getting this gun in your hands this is the Winchester of a lifetime and will be a prize in anyones collection. The SN# is 150XXXX Which dates it at 1954/55 production right inbetween there, sorry this is a NO TRADE SALE, I will ship to FFL one must be provided to me before i ship and i will only accept a POSTAL MONEY ORDER if your out of state no exceptions. ALL OTHER LAWS APPLY please email me for more pics or any questions whatsoever!! Thanks for looking please ck my other listings."

Up for sale is what seems to be a 1964 Remington 1100 20 ga standard weight with a plain barrel (full choke). I got in a trade several weeks ago but need to fund some purchases. It was intended to be next year's dove gun. 

It's surprisingly unmarked and not fired much; the only perceptible wear is on the shell carrier tip. There is no bluing loss or rust on the receiver and barrel; no gouges or dings on the wood. Based on the research it appears to have been made in 1964 and is a 20 ga built on a 12 ga receiver. It has a little more heft than an LT or LW which is nice for volume shooting. Otherwise the barrel is clean and bright; it's ok to thread for chokes if wanted"

About the Zev Trigger Kit
You will immediately notice the difference in your gun’s performance after installation: 
• The trigger face is flatter and the trigger safety is three times wider than a stock trigger; this is ideal for quickly placing your finger in the optimal firing position. This will help build proper muscle memory for improved consistency and accuracy. 
• Because of ZEV’s proprietary trigger bar refinements the trigger operates smoothly through the entire length of pull.
• The trigger’s crisp tactile reset gives the user a clear feeling for the moment of reset. This feedback improves the user’s ability to “ride the reset” to improve follow up shot speed and placement. 
• The trigger weight can be adjusted to as low as 3 lbs. A lighter pull weight requires less pressure, reducing trigger fatigue and improving accuracy. 
• The pre-travel and over-travel are adjustable to allow for a shorter pull, crisper break and faster reset.
• Trigger adjustments will give the benefit of short take up, post break travel and will result in a a shorter reset.
• The Ultimate Kit has a Skeletonized Firing Pin, the benefit is its lighter construction, polish, and the tip of the firing pin is extended for more positive primer ignition. 

ZEV Parts always incorporate design, feel and performance at the same time. A Fulcrum Adjustable Trigger Kit will upgrade the look of your gun as triggers come in a variety of color combinations. 
Finally, ZEV Trigger components are designed to last; replacing plastic stock parts with aluminum or stainless steel assemblies.

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth.

Our exclusive ArmorLokt™process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

The Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem™ Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail.

Solid veteran war Rifles. Shoots the cheap and plentiful 7.62x54R round. If these rifles could only talk ...(it probably wouldn't make a difference, unless you speak chinese) Bayonets are attached - good shooters. Great for going after Hogzilla, or for an arch-angel stock swap. If you prefer, I can get you beautiful Russian version for around $260.00., but they probably won't shot any better. Because they are Chinese, you can shoot-em all day, and still be hungry for more. Very smooth triggers. Maybe it is my imagination, but doesn't the last picture look like Jane Fonda? Price is firm. I'll probably reorder them, but the supplier raised the price, so the next ones will have to be $134.00.

I've put in a recoil buffer as well as a rubber buttpad. I have also wrapped the stock in 8 strand 550lb paracord. The proper milspec stuff, not the commercial crap. Stock still folds up nicely.

Not those crapco muzzle brakes that hardly do anything. Absolutely zero mag wobble or binding. Mag releases are fast and easy wih the extended mag release. Even with rapid fire its easy to get all 30 rounds on a silhouette at 100 yards. If you are trading an AK-47, I have extra mags and 8-900 rounds of 5.45 I can add in for any ammo and mags you may have.Looking for cash but I would trade for a century AK-47/74+cash, or a sub-2000 in .40 that takes glock mags plus cash. Open to partial gun trades+ cash or multi gun trades.

This is just a mans' toy for the weekend, nothing but a show off piece while target shooting and almost never running out of ammo in your mag. Outside is powder coated, everything works great and has been oiled, sitting in its case for long time. Email for questions. Was asking 1500 for everything, but will lower to 1000 cash. Absolutely no trades unless you have a Glock 19 gen3 or newer plus cash. I like Sigs and HK's but those are a little too nice for me right now. Glock 19, AUG NATO A3, or AR-15 that's got a stainless steel barrel. NO OTHER TRADES!!! This is for sale, I just want to be clear, don't ask about any other weapon to trade unless they are on of the above. I only want to sell this and take cash. 1000 cash. Beaverton off 217 Hwy"

If you know 1911s, then you know what this is. Comes with two factory mags, original hard case, and papers. Wears beautiful RoCo grips. Not a V16. Frame made at the SA factory in Geneseo IL, not by Imbel in Brazil like the newer ones from the last few years.
Some minor finish wear on the left side. 250 rounds fired through it by me, don't know about the original owner. Overall great condition for a shooter grade target pistol.

This rifle was designed for the international military market as a replacement for the  AR-15  project, which had been sold to the Colt in 1959 by the Armalite's parent company, Fairchild Aircraft and Engine Corp. The AR-18 was designed as a competitor to the AR-15, which could be made at much less expenses and on simplified machinery, with the view to sell the manufacturing licenses for AR-18 to the third world countries. The AR-18 was a really successful design from a technical standpoint, but it come out too late to compete with both officially accepted and adopted  AR-15/M16  rifle of American origin and already widespread  AK-47  rifle of the Soviet origin. The Armalite company by itself made very few specimens of this rifle.

One reason for this is multiple radar antennas! The only other detector with two radar antennas is the Bel STi Driver, but in the STi both antennas face forward. In the Valentine One, there is one forward antenna and one rear-facing antenna. Using this combination of antennas, it effectively tells you the band and strength of the radar signal, along with the number of ""bogeys,"" or radar units being detected. It will also tell you what direction the signal is coming from, and provide the best rear detection out of every other windshield-mounted detector on the market. Even when this sounds too good to be true, there's more. If you decide on a Valentine One, you'll be in good hands with the same detector for the rest of your life.

888,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3822888,For Sale/Trade:  Very custom package Winchester 94 44 mag W/ custom box Tops knife 1894,"N.E., Bend, Oregon","$ 1,000","Listed On: Tuesday, February 3, 2015",Rifles,Winchester                                                                                ,44 Magnum                                                                                ,Lever Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Here is a one of a kind buy. I am trying the waters here I was a finish woodworker turned aircraft mechanic and have put together this nice nostalgic carry setup that does justice to this nice Winchester model 1894 in .44 Magnum/special. I have made some of these boxes for any type of application, I have made these for pistols, knives etc... And am seeing if there may be interest out there in this, or from someone wanting one custom made. I purchased the rifle a short time ago. I have shot it some, sighted it in and it is a great little carbine. The gun is an earlier model while they were still U.S. made. It is pre crossbolt safety, one of the rarer tang safes. Much easier to access than the crossbolt types. It has the saddle ring and dark, I believe walnut, stock. Very nice rifle, excellent bore and crown, quite accurate, handy little carbine. It has minor rust pitting from a previous owner on the left side of the receiver, saddle ring, and a touch on the forward barrel band. Other than that there are a couple very light areas of wear to the bluing, lumber is in perfect condition. The box is made entirely of distressed cedar. It is about 48X6.5X5.75 inches. I have fitted it to secure the gun tightly without it bumping or touching anything that would damage or wear it. Its' barrel slides onto an oak dowel turned down to fit it tightly and stop its' travel before hitting the 1.25 inch pivot rod. The rod and dowel move to allow the rifle to swing up and be removed. There is a piece of rubber/Denim covered cedar channeled in and set with countersunk screws and glue to keep the rifle from inverting while the lid is being closed. The butt of the rifle is protected by the denim Carhartt pocket which is lanyarded with paracord to the box and gives enough slack to easily put on or take off the rifle. There are two pillow blocks contoured to the rifle's stock , one on the lid and one fixed to the accessory compartment and box bottom which pinch the end of the gun stock over the Carhartt pocket when the box is closed. There is an aft accessory section made up into two compartments, as well as a forward pivoting storage area. These can be used for any type of storage needs be it cleaning accessories, cigars, lighter cutter, flask or what-have-you. The travel of the forward compartments swing is stopped by one of the hinge acorn nuts to prevent it from over travel. Under the forward storage compartment is a loading block which snugly fits 35 rounds of .44 ammo which is perfectly locked in when the compartment is swung shut. The compartment will stop on a channeled piece of cedar should there be no .44 rounds to stop its' travel. The knife is a Tops covert anti terrorist model. It is in its' original Kydex sheath and stows parallel, and swings up 45 degrees to access it. There is also a paracord lid catch which goes over top of the knife and keeps the lid from overswinging and damaging the hinges. The box is fitted with a leather Beretta sling on two AR-15 A2 butt stock loops. It is easily put on and taken off, and should the rifle ever have sling swivels put on it, would make a great sling for the gun as well. The strap hinges, bolt latches and sling loops are affixed with through hardware so as not to have a screw pull out and drop or loosen the box. Lid incorporates longitudinal and cross members of Cedar glued and screwed on to increase rigidity and keep it from ever warping or cracking. The lid and base register into the box and result in a very solid structure. The box ends are fit at 45 degrees on the back, and butted up on the front. everything incorporates long wood screws, all of which were predrilled and countersunk prior to installation so as to maintain the wood's integrity. All in all this would make the ultimate Christmas gift for the classic enthusiast. It is a nice little package that has an air of nostalgia, and a great way to compliment this Winchester rifle. All the stuff in the box is to give ideas, I can't legally sell alcohol or tobacco so that stuff is not included, nor is the ammo, blanket, or lighters."

The wood is in very nice condition as is the metal work. The stamped cartouche dated ""1902"" is very sharp and clearly legible on the stock. . The bluing looks great. There is  some thinning but most of it looks very dark with no rusting or pitting. This is a very fine collector military rifle. It has the bayonet lug on the front for trench warfare. It has the proper original ""trap Door"" storage on the buttplate and it is in good working condition. It has the two sling straps and the front ""stacking sling strap"". This rifle was designed for warfare and it did it's job well. It's use in the Spanish American War is but one historical example. The action works as smooth as glass and is legendary for its durability and functionality. 
   If you want to take a look at a 30-40 Krag in action I would suggest going to Youtube and doing a search: ""Hickock45, 30-40 Krag"". Whether or not you are interested in buying this particular rifle I'm sure you will learn something about the 30-40 Krag. It's worth watching just for the education.
30/40 Krags are superbly engineered rifles with appealing clean lines and they were considered very high tech weapons for their time. In fact 30/40 Krag bullet  ballistics are still very comparable to modern cartridges of the same approximate size and they are still easily available. They are more powerful than the 30-30 and just below the 30-06. They are a very powerful and accurate cartridge round. Although I would never shoot my Krag due to it's rarity many people choose the 30-40 Krag round for hunting large animals, including Elk.  It can drop any game animal in the lower 48 and it has dropped many record holders. It has a long sight radius for long and accurate shots. It has a unique 8 round tip out bolt side magazine that is quickly reloaded for rapid firing during battle. If you are a serious firearm collector or militaria collector you will probably want it in your collection. There are very, very few original versions of this rifle in existence. The vast majority of them have been ""Sporterized"" somewhere along the line and thus rendered worthless as collectors pieces. Krags in good shape are rare. Unmolested 30-40 Krags are even more rare. As far as I can tell this Krag is as original as it gets . If you are a hunter looking for a good buy on a deer rifle this rifle is probably not for you. 
$1750 cash or $2000 trade value. Multiple trades with cash are possible.
