This is a recent Zastava O pap import so it comes with the correct double stack bolt for standard and high cap AK mags and a buldged receiver for added strength. The Rifle has been cleaned thoroughly and lubed. Cycles smooth and straight. I loosened up the safety so its smooth. Sights are straight and was bore tested to be sighted in for accuracy. Zastava factory built AKs are well known for being built like tanks. These O paps have one of the best fit and finishes on any AK I've ever seen. It has the original military finish and original wood furniture. I tested the cycling of the rifle and all of the mags(Romanian,Yugo,Bulgarian,tapco, promag, and magpuls) work perfect along with the 75 round drum. I have no rush selling this Rifle. Just focusing on other projects for the time being and could use the cash. I might put a side folder and rail system on this later if it does not sell. Selling for 700.00.

Figure the gun/scope mounts/trigger upgrade is worth $250 based on what I saw on Gunbroker, scope is worth another $220 new.  I recently put Butler Creek flip up covers on the scope as well, that ran me about $30.  Total value is about $500.

I'll sell the gun and scope w/caps for $400.

I've also got 82 rounds of ammo - 40 rounds of 150 grain Winchester, 20 rounds of PPU 180 grain, and 22 some rounds of loose ammo also Winchester (mostly); and a nice Allen soft rifle case.  I'll add this stuff for an extra $100.

Total value for everything I figure is about $625 bucks.  It's a great rifle, I'm just a lefty and really would like a rifle that suits my wrong-handedness!

I purchased everything new this past summer. This has seen 20 rounds of factory ammunition and 1 range trip, has been in the safe since. I really don't shoot bolt actions much, I was planning on going hunting this year and that didn't happen. I can use the money more than I can a safe queen. It's an excellent rifle, I just prefer handguns and semi rifles.

Included in the sale is:
Rifle, manual, original box, 4 round magazine and firearm lock
In addition you will also receive a Ruger buttstock pouch, an additional 4 round magazine and the best for last...
A Nikon ProStaff 3-9x40 Scope with BDC reticle, mounted with Weaver Rings, Scope packaging and manual also included. I will also throw in a 20 round box of Fiocchi 168 Gr Matchking HPBT cartridges.

The Model 700â¢ SPSâ¢ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because itâs built on the Model 700â¢ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence. Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the hot new 17 Remington Fireball. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes wonât spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700â¢ SPSâ¢ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.


The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use. 

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

At 100 rounds, its magazine has the largest capacity of any modern shoulder-fired carbine. This one's only had about 400 rounds fired through it and is in excellent condition--always well cleaned and maintained.

This may be one of the most advanced arms any civilian will ever be allowed to own. I am consolidating my collection and this is the only 9mm weapon I own so it needs to go. If you have an interest in this weapon, don't wait too long to contact me. Used Calicos don't last long on the market.

This weapon is an absolute blast to fire. You can make a soda can dance across the desert floor. For self defense you can't beat 9mm. You won't nail the neighbors through a wall and even though it's not super powerful you've got 100 rounds available as fast as you can pull the trigger. To fire, turn the crank on the end of the magazine 23 times (takes about 10 seconds or less to accomplish) and 100 rounds await your semi-auto command.

Much more accurate than a shotgun, this dude will put all the lead you want where you want it, fast. And, because spent rounds eject downward, you won't hit anyone in the head with hot brass."

It is a real shooter! The pic group is the norm, when shot from a sand bag rest. The only reason I am getting rid of it, is I also have a SPR and I just do not need two 308 bolt guns.  The pic with the coyote is how it looks now, the other pic is before the camo was complete. All work was either done by me, or Short Action Customs. I have the recept for almost $500 worth of work they did.  Rifle started life as a new extreme weather stainless model. I bought it new last year from Buds. I have the box, manual, and invoice from Short Action Customs . I replaced the aluminum factory bottom metal with a new Willems Stainless piece. I then marine tex bedded the action and first inch or so of the barrel. I sent it off to Short Action Customs and had them fit a hunter series bolt knob, install a badger ordnance 20moa FN SPR scope base and modify the receiver for the larger screws, and Cerakote the rifle. I added TPS rings and a Redfield acurange 3X9 scope. About the only thing this rifle could use is a better scope. Round count is right about 175. The stock bare rifle was $1000 plus tax from Buds. Over $2,200 invested in this rifle. Will sell it for $1,150 or $1,050 with out the scope and rings. I can email more pic just contact me for them.   The stock pack is NOT included in the sale."

Ive had this rifle for about 1 year now. It has performed flawlessly. The rifle is in good condition overall. Comes with an EGW 20 MOA rail. Also I recently had a gun smith perform a trigger job. The trigger is now at a crisp 2 pounds with no take up and almost no over travel (almost as good as a Timney!) Also I had the extractor replaced. 

The rifle comes with 46 rounds of hand loaded ammo. I have shot upwards of 300 rounds through this rifle (all hand loads) and settled on my current load (which I have 46 rounds of). This load produces 1/2 inch groups. I had a Leupold Mark 4 mounted on this rifle when shooting (Sold). The bullet is a 162gr Hornady SST traveling at 3100 FPS. Long range shooting is my hobby so I strive for accuracy and consistency. This rifle with this current load has that ability! Not only is this ammo good for long range shooting but it al makes an excellent hunting round. 

I am also selling other reloading supplies (powder, bullets, primers, brass) that I used for this rifle.

The Town, now known as Robbins, NC actually began in 1795 when gunsmith Alexander Kennedy and his family left Philadelphia to settle along Bear Creek. Kennedy set up a factory, which produced long rifles for American soldiers, near the site of the present day Robbins Water Plant. The Kennedy rifle works continued in operation until 1838 and the place became known as Mechanics Hill.



Kennedy also established what was reputed to have been ""the largest gun factory in this part of the south"" in which he worked as many as seventy-five hands.

According to tradition, Kennedy bought part interest in a small gun shop owned and operated by William Williamson after which they ran the concern jointly as Williamson and Kennedy. A few old guns in the section bear the initials ""W. W. and D. K."" Later, Kennedy bought out sole interest in the business.

Various types of guns and swords were made in this factory. The finer rifles were said to have been ornamented with silver melted from sixteen silver dollars and sold for proportionately higher prices. Large grindstones, which were operated by water power, shaped the barrels into octagonal shape and the metal was drawn out and molded by large trip hammers, also operated by water power. Finally, the task of truing the sights on the rifles was accomplished by shooting across the millpond to a target on the other side, near which stood a man to mark the deviation from the bullâs eye. The sights were then patiently varied until they were found true. Many of these guns are said to have been used in the War of 1812. So important did this business become that a post office was established there and names Mechanics Hill.

There is a local legend to the effect that Kennedy, weary of paying such a high price for his gunlocks which he ""imported"" from a New York factory, made a trip on horseback to the latter factory, where he found that the secret method used in making the locks was carefully guarded. Undaunted, he finally wormed his way into the good graces of the workers and operators by his violin music, which they greatly admired. Once inside the shop, he soon discovered the secret involved and returned to Mechanics Hill where he began to make his own.


This gun was Authenticated by Aaron Capel."

Throughout our 20+ year history, weâve designed, tested, redesigned and perfected many new firearm and ammunition technologies, all in the name of advancing the industry.

We started out manufacturing Swiss CNC machine Match Solid Bullets for use in competition.  Starting with the outdated products of the day, we questioned how to push the limits of the technology and spent months in the shop working through previously uncharted territory.  Our research and testing ultimately led to the development of a world record setting high performance bullet that delivers the highest possible reliability.

Not content to rest on our success, we started to look into the terminal performance of hunting ammunition.  Convinced we could improve upon a neglected technology, we created the industryâs first Controlled Fracturing bullet for the Muzzleloader industry.  Originally developed exclusively for Knight Rifles, we have continued to work on and perfect our achievement and now offer a complete line of Controlled Fracture ammunition.

Next, we decided to work on producing a Subsconic Bullet that would match or improve upon the terminal performance of a high velocity bullet.  Today our Subsonic ammunition delivers unparalleled terminal results.

As our reputation has grown, Lehigh has continued to investigate and improve upon our most revolutionary ammunition.  Building on the predictability of our Controlled Fracture technology, we now produce personal defense ammunition with exceptional terminal and barrier performance.  As a result, this revolutionary projectile has earned a reputation for outstanding bystander safety with law enforcement officials and military personnel.

I do not have title for the bike, my plan was to apply for a builders title after i was done doing what i wanted to it. The bike is clean legally and it has the factory ignition and key on it.  Does not run at this time, but is not for from doing so.

Bike is in great condition overall, but needs a few things done for it to run, wires need plugged in correctly and batteries wired up. It seems to have good compression from what i can tell. It is also going to need a seat bought or made for it. Front brake will need hooked up, comes with drum and disk front wheels.
