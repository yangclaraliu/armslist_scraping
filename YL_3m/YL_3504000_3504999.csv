I have a nice Kimber TLE II 1911 for sale or trade.  Great pistol, but have had the good fortune to acquire a couple of Springer TRPs lately and just don't need this one.  Good over all gun, but has been lightly used.  Some minor marks but no heavy damage/scratches.  No ""idiot"" mark from reassembly.  I've replaced the stocks with a set of Magpul grips and they feel AWESOME.  I've also replaced the full length guide rod (FLGR) with a standard mil-spec type guide rod/plug and stock spring.  If I can find the factory FLGR and accessories you may have your choice of it or the mil-spec.  I've found no significant decrease in off-hand accuracy with the mil-spec setup and no tools/accessories are required for takedown.  Comes with box and 2 Checkmate 8 round mags.  Other mags available for sale/trade depending.

Custom one-off offroad adventure trailer. 

Professionally Built.

The body of the trailer was removed from the frame. 

The frame was powdercoated black then Rhino lined. 

At the same time the body of the trailer was sandblasted, then buffed out, then painted with 10 coats of awesome AM General Hummer H1 Ocean Blue Metallic. 

The trailer really shines!

The shop put the body back on the frame. While doing so all 3 tires were replaced and rims were powdercoated as well. 

The tires are Superlug 36"" x 9.5"" tires and have very little wear on them. 
The spare has never been used and still has nips. 

All lights on the trailer work and have a 7 Pin connector ( I have a 4 to 7 pin connector if you need it)

The trailer has a custom made top for it by a local Denver Canvas shop. It cost over $1500. 

Underneath the top are 5 sturdy hoops. 

Attached to the trailer are custom roof racks. Similar to a Yakima rack. I had mounted a roof top tent and a Kayak rack on there when I first had it. 

The trailer itself inside was rhino lined then sides and topper were carpeted and a middle section added for under storage. 

The inside is 8 ft long and 5 1/2 feet wide. 

I had the original pin-tail hitch removed and had a 2"" ball receiver mount welded on its place.

These are the Lamborghini of AK rifles. Now banned from import. This was made in Russia and is without a doubt the highest quality AK rifle you can purchase. Even better it shoots 308, so you do not have to worry about ammo shortages and it is extremely accurate. best of all this is a rare square back model, so it takes standard AK47 stocks unlike most VEPR rifles.



Russian Vepr Rifle .308 Square Back with 20-1/2"" Barrel, Integrated Sights
Each Vepr version features Molot's incredibly accurate cold hammer forged barrels that are threaded in the standard Russian 14mm x 1 left hand pattern. Each threaded barrel is capped, pinned and spot welded according to import requirements. The 01 versions feature the standard RPK rear sights. The 02 versions feature the flip rear sights that are set at 100 meters or 300 meters and the front sight is integrated to the gas block. These features allow for faster target acquisition, reduced weight and results in the most balanced Vepr rifle ever produced to date.

The new Vepr Rifles are patterned after the original Kalashnikov design. The Molot Factory has changed the receiver from a slant back to a square back design, thus allowing for the use of most standard AK buttstocks.

PLEASE NOTE: Stocks and forend are unfinished, incomplete and may be cracked or broken.

This new VEPR rifle accepts most standard AK buttstocks.

Russian Vepr Rifle .308 Square Back with 20-1/2"" Barrel, Integrated Sights
Each Vepr version features Molot's incredibly accurate cold hammer forged barrels that are threaded in the standard Russian 14mm x 1 left hand pattern. Each threaded barrel is capped, pinned and spot welded according to import requirements. The 01 versions feature the standard RPK rear sights. The 02 versions feature the flip rear sights that are set at 100 meters or 300 meters and the front sight is integrated to the gas block. These features allow for faster target acquisition, reduced weight and results in the most balanced Vepr rifle ever produced to date.

The new Vepr Rifles are patterned after the original Kalashnikov design. The Molot Factory has changed the receiver from a slant back to a square back design, thus allowing for the use of most standard AK buttstocks.

PLEASE NOTE: Stocks and forend are unfinished, incomplete and may be cracked or broken.

This new VEPR rifle accepts most standard AK buttstocks.

Up for sale is my CZ-82, which is chambered in 9mm Makarov, or 9x18. If you're looking at this ad, you likely know how reliable and respected the CZ-82 is. It's just a fantastic gun, and has never jammed or failed on me, ever, in the few hundred rounds I put through it.

I've got pistols in 9mm Luger (the ""normal"" 9mm) and 380 Auto (9mm short), so I just don't need to be in this caliber. I'm trying to consolidate pistol and rifle calibers that I own down to a few...so this gun and ammo needs to go.

It's a surplus gun, that was used...so the condition shows that. Is it tore up to hell and back? No, but it's got some wear on it. I don't think you could turn up a CZ-82 in any other condition...sometimes much worse.

I've seen these sell for $260-280 online, but you have to consider shipping and FFL fees on top of that. Buying mine for $240 would be a very fair deal! My quick search showed that most dealers don't even have these in stock anyways.

Comes with 1 magazine.

I have 15 unopened boxes of ammo...mostly Tula, but some Silver Bear HPs in there also. If you shoot 9mm Mak, you know how difficult it can be, and currently is, to find ammo. I'll sell for $14 a box.

If you buy the gun and all the ammo, I'll sell for $440, firm.

The trades I'm interested in are below, and I'll gladly add cash or vice versa depending on the deal.

Quality, complete AR upper in 5.56
Lever action in 357 Magnum
Sweet Remington 700
S&W 617

Chambered in 9x18mm Makarov, which is similar to 380 acp but ballistically superior. This is a solid milled steel, military grade firearm with a chrome lined barrel. Cosmetically similar to the Walther PPK, it will fit in holsters designed for the PPK. DA/SA with a decocker and loaded chamber indicator.
This is a 1968 model with a rounded hammer for snagless drawing. The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is very hard wearing. I have also added custom walnut grips that give a more ergonomic fit than the originals. Comes with two magazines, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I have ground down the finger rest on the non matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady xtp defense rounds and the original grips.
With the gun, refinishing service, and grips, I have just over $500 into this pistol and that is the basis I will use for any trades.
Looking to trade for a Sig P938 plus cash on my end. Offering an additional $100 for a basic model, more for a higher end model (SAS, Blackwood, Equinox) and/or additional mags.
Though not my first choice, would also consider a straight trade for a Sig p238.
Would also consider a quality J-frame size revolver
I will consider other trades but these are the ones I'm primarily interested in.
Otherwise will sell for 400 firm.

I purchased this pistol for my wife as a starter gun. It has been a great gun. We had no intentions of selling it; However we have a child on the way and could use the extra money. This pistol has less than 500 rounds through it and is still in the break in period. It functions flawlessly with copper plated .22 ammo, but will jam sometimes with lead .22 rounds. It has some very minor scratches on it. If you are interested in looking at it please text me at REDACTED)."

Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder who recently chipped in $500,000 to back a gun control proposal in Washington state, is now catching flak for buying a World War II Nazi tank. The tank in question, a Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf. H, commonly referred to as a Panzer IV, was allegedly sold in July for $2.5 million to a foundation tied to Allen.

It is truly different. All parts are made in the U.S.A., and major components are built and assembled in Adcor Defense’s Baltimore factory by American workers.

Patented Revolutionary Gas Piston System

-A gas-driven piston incorporated into the upper half of the forward rail system never touches the barrel and, therefore, allows a free-floating barrel and increased accuracy.
-Carrier tilt is completely eliminated because the operating rod is connected to the bolt carrier and rides through a machined boss in the upper receiver and rail system.
-The lower half of the rail system detaches easily without special tools for quick cleaning and easy maintenance.
-The piston’s cyclic rate is easily adjusted by the operator for a controlled rate of fire, thus minimizing wear on critical parts.
-The precision machined tolerances of the piston eliminates the need for rings.

Patented Port Dust Wiper with Cover

-The ADCOR A-556 ELITE™ has a spring-loaded dust shield mounted on the bolt carrier. Upon firing, the bolt carrier returns to ready position. The dust cover moves into the ejection port opening flush with the inside geometry of the upper receiver preventing entry of dust, sand, or debris.
-The highly durable, self-lubricating polymer shield withstands extreme temperature.

Patented Non-Reciprocating Ambidextrous Forward Charging Handle 

-The creative design of the ADCOR A-556 ELITE™ allows the operator to keep his or her strong hand on the firearm and use the other hand to clear the rifle.
-Ambidextrous charging handle detaches easily without special tools and returns to locked position once used. It folds forward, recessed, and easily swings back in a single motion.
-Handle is non-reciprocating and only engages when the operator charges or clears.

Patented Rail System 

-Innovative, key locked, highly rigid rail system mounts seamlessly to the upper receiver. This ensures proper alignment of the rail with a redesigned boss, spline and groove system.
-Upper and lower rail guards separate with the push of a button; no special tools necessary.
-Fully compatible with optical, image intensification or thermal sights; laser targeting systems; bipods; tactical lights and Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES)."

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything.

This particular rifle features a hammer forged heavy barrel which is chrome lined along with the chamber, gas block and gas piston. They are built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel. These guns are imported from Russia and they are manufactured at the famous MOLOT factory. MOLOT has been building firearms for over 50 years.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."""

558,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3504558,For Sale:  HEAVY 30-30 WINCHESTER AMMO - 190 GR. JFN @ 2100 FPS (1860 FT.LBS.) - 20 ROUND BOX,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 54,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 16, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=222

Buffalo Bore is introducing a truly Heavy 30-30 Winchester loading. This new load utilizes a 190gr. custom Hawk bullet and gives the venerable 30-30 here-to-for unrealized power and is designed so that the person who owns a 30-30 can now reliably kill elk or moose sized game. The 30-30 can now be carried as a defensive tool in grizzly country and will be much more effective in stopping a grizzly attack than any other 30-30 ammunition in the world. This heavy 30-30 load is not designed for deer, although it will kill deer and if you line them up right, it will kill three or four deer with one shot……….

The custom 190gr. hawk bullet is designed with a harder core and thicker than normal jacket, so the expansion is minimal, thus insuring very deep penetration which is needed to break large bones and destroy organs deep inside large game animals. This load generates an unreal 2100 fps from normal 20 inch carbines—this is the type of velocity that the ordinary 170gr. 30-30 loads generate, but again, we are using a 190gr. bullet. The product SKU# for this load is 28A/20
Check the below real world velocities from my personal stock, over-the-counter firearms—truly amazing.
2071 fps -- Marlin Model 336 20 inch saddle ring carbine circa 1950’s
2061 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2075 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1953
2116 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1963
2172 fps -- Marlin model 336A 24 inch carbine circa 1940’s
2146 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2020 fps -- Win. Model 94AE 16 inch Trapper carbine circa 1992
1983 fps -- Savage 99 26 inch rifle circa 1917 - Not a Typo
Note that the longest barrel gave the slowest velocity and even the short 16 inch Winchester trapper model gives faster speeds than the 26 inch Savage 99 rifle, which shows that barrel length is not always the sole indicator of velocities a firearm will generate.
Buffalo Bore always uses stock over-the-counter- firearms that give real world velocities. Other ammunition companies normally use laboratory test barrels which give much higher velocities than stock firearms. We at Buffalo Bore see this long established practice as misleading to the consumer.

This 30-30 loading (Item 28A/20) is safe to use in ANY/ALL 30-30 chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition—no exceptions, no need to “double check” with us."

Piston Driven Sniper Rifle in .308 caliber (LNIB) Tack Driver.
I have a (LNIB) Sig Sauer 716 DMR Sniper Rifle for sale. I bought this rifle NIB around 6 weeks ago and put only 30 rounds total of 168 grain Hornady Match ammo thru it with a cleaning after every 5 rounds fired for proper barrel break in. This Sig 716 Sniper Rifle was giving me 1/2"" groups at 100 yards consistently. Very accurate for a Semi Automatic rifle.

This is a Piston Driven .308 Caliber Sniper Rifle with a 4 position gas regulator adjuster for different conditions and for Suppressor use. The rifle is nice and tight and functions flawlessly with no issues whatsoever.

It comes with Troy flip up sights, MagPul UBR stock, MagPul MIAD grip, Harris BR-S Bipod, Bipod Adapter, Sling, Rail Covers, 2-20 round P-Mags, and a Hard Shell case. It has an 18"" Heavy Match barrel with a 1x10"" twist for Ultimate accuracy, And the barrel is threaded for your favorite F/H or Suppressor. It also comes with a Geissele SSA Match Trigger.

This is an Awesome weapon that is like Brand New and is Very Accurate, it is actually a Tack Driver.

Iactually hand picked this Sig 716 DMR from a batch of 4 NIB rifles at the time I bought it. I opened 4 boxes and picked out the Very Best one from the lot of 4 rifles. I also picked out the one with the very best Test Target. This Sig 716 DMR has perfect color Match up with the Upper and Lower receivers and the receivers are tight with no play.

I have put only 30 Easy Slow fired rounds down the pipe of this Sniper Rifle with a cleaning after each 5 shot group. This rifle is shooting 1/2"" MOA groups at 100 yards with 5 shots. This thing is a Tack Driver and you will be very happy with it. It is Like Brand Spanking New. 99.99%

I also tested some 155 grain Hornady TAP AMAX and 175 grain Lapua Match ammo with great results. See attached Pics in the links below.

I had this scope for a little over a month (still have box). Reason Im selling is that I was planning on doing more long range shooting than I actually have time for (or the money). This scope was going to be used as duel use for long range shooting and (long range) hunting. I did not try and cheap out on this scope. I bought what would be best for the scope. Also I put in a lot of time lapping the rings so there would be equal pressure around the body of the scope. 

The scope is in like brand new condition. It is currently held by Burris extreme tactical rings (low), that have been lapped. 

The anti-cant is a Holland Signature Series. Best in my opinion. 

The rail is an EGW 20 MOA rail for a Remington 700 Long Action.

I paid:
Scope $1400
Rings $63
Anti cant $65
Rail $45

Total $1573

Asking $1425 obo for all or trade (look below) 
This is a package deal My loss is your gain!

You are more than welcome to check out the scope but only serious inquiries. 
Scope will remain on rifle until I have cash in hand. I have no other scopes for my rifle so for the time being I need this one on it. 

Will only trade for Glock 20 with or without red dot (RMR or Deltapoint only) depending on what you have I'll decide how much cash on your end. NO TRADES FOR RIFLES, SCOPES, ACCESSORIES, ETC!

Glock polymer-frame fixed-sight pistols have seen military, security and law-enforcement duty across the globe. Known for being nearly indestructible and totally reliable, they’re also popular with civilian shooters. Light, durable, oil- and corrosion-resistant polymer frames are mated to steel slides. The harder-than-steel slides are treated with a nonreflecting, rust-resistant Tennifer-coating. Hexagonal barrel profiles result in longer service life and easy cleaning. Loaded-chamber indicators confirm the presence of chambered rounds by sight and touch. Glock’s Safe Action System controls three internal safeties, including a drop safety that prevents discharge if the gun is dropped. Each pistol comes with a pair of magazines and a hard-plastic case."
