New, Unfired -- The Beowulf ""Thumper"" ... I ordered this from Alexander Arms and it finally showed up.  Have not had time to fire it so might just get my money out of it and pass it on to someone has time to shoot it.   You see it still has the AA factory inspection tags attached to the barrel.

What you see is what you get.   it is an upgraded AA .50 Beowulf upper with a threaded barrel and the bad-ass tank baffle everyone wants; looks great and cuts recoil.

I put a single point attachment ring and the throat of the lower and added a nice single-point sling.  I added the grips on the front and the bi-pod pistol grip and the front ... all mounted to MagPul rails.  I even put an extra rail on the top right for a flashlight (its out of the way there) if you get to where you want one.   This has FDE or tan MagPul furniture throughout and all mounted on a PSA multi lower.  For optics, I put on a 3-9x42 NcStar scope and I like the scope a little higher, so I added a UTG 1/2 inch riser rail ... all with quick disconnect attachment bars.  (If you like MagPul pop-up sights, I have a pair and would switch the scope for the MagPul set.)  I also added an ambidextrous BCM Gun Fighter charging handle.

You can see that I added 100s in gear to the basic Beowulf in order to outfit this properly ... ready to use.

I will throw in a hunting-legal 4-round magazine and a larger (10 round I think) mag to get you started.

Separately, I also have some AA Wulf ammo that I can help you because no one local carries it ... it must be mail ordered.  I can make you a fair deal on ammo if it helps.

Prefer FTF and cash but will ship via my FFL at costs.  Local ... VA ID, 21+, and BoS paperwork are non-negotiable.

So ... Let's make a deal."

It takes down just like a 1911 and it has both a grip safety and thumb safety the gun will not fire if the mag is not in which is another safety feature. There is also railing/ribs on top of the slide. The barell is threaded so it can accept attachments and so forth. Sights are adjustable. It comes with 1 mag that holds 8. The grips are made of a hard brown plastic with black streaks going through it, they look quite nice so I didnt have them replaced. Bluing is 95% and it was made in 1972 imported by stoeger. This gun is made of high quality pieces and guns made by Llama in the '60s-'70s were considered to be the best of Llama. This would make a great carry pistol or a nice piece to a Spanish collection. It comes with 300 rounds of Remington Viper. Due to the fact these are hard to find the price is firm."

NAA-Black Widow Mini-Revolver 22LR 
Fixed Sights
The Black Widow is a special revolver that improves upon 
the standard NAA .22 Mini-Revolver resulting in the ultimate handgun
 for up front, personal, close-in protection. 
It's small, easy to conceal and safe to carry, and offers 
enhanced stability and accuracy in a great concealed carry package. 
The rimfire mini-revolver in this auction features a heavy vent barrel, 
22 Long Rifle bull cylinder, fixed low profile sights, 
and oversized black rubber grips with that deadly Black Widow red hourglass inlay.
Whether you carry it for hiking and camping, or for self-defense, 
this gun delivers when you need it most. 
Each cylinder provides a safety notch half-way between the chambers 
so the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber to prevent accidental discharge.

It has an over the top rail mount with rear peep sight and an inexpensive 4 power scope mounted on it.  I set this up to hunt and shoot pigs.  I was always a fan of the SKS and the 7.62x39 for a pig gun.  The Saiga is a major step up from an SKS.  You have all of the reliability of an AK and the handy feel of a carbine for those who don't like the all out assault look and feel.  The Saigas also have the integral side rail in case you want to use a side mounted optic.  These make great truck guns although this one was never treated like one.  The Saiga is all Russian made with a chrome lined, cold hammer forged barrel and a unique to the Saiga bolt hold open feature.  These rifles are the ultimate in reliability.

This one comes with rail mount, scope, original sight blade, sling, factory 10 round magazine, and a 30 round SGM USA made magazine.

Some of the West Hurley guns came without these and if you have a GI gun you know these get pretty gummy after awhile. Trying to clean them leaves you with felt that is expanded by cleaning agents (the felt gets all ""puffed up""!) and tends to cause a bit of drag on the bolt after cleaning. Once these are FUBAR the only thing you can do is replace them.

I have these extras left over from some trading I did a few years ago (bought a mess of Russian parts kits and extra parts) and won't use them all. so am selling off the extras.

The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The 1911 RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS – which stands for 1911 Compact SAS – comes from the SIG SAUER® Customs Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a Natural Stainless (shown) or Nitron® finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom wood grips. The grips are either gray diamondwood on the Stainless model or rosewood on the Nitron® version. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.

No modifications done, but I did paint in the “Ruger” on the gun and the “numbers and Ruger sign” on the mags, as you can see on the pic. This does not affect the functionality of the gun/mags at all.  It’s enamel paint and will not flake or peel (unless you physically try to chisel it out).

This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, may take any number of additional magazines we have on hand at the same per-mag price and no extra shipping. Photos show some of the first ever used trade in, genuine factory Smith & Wesson High Capacity Magazines for the M&P .40 Smith & Wesson Caliber or .357 Sig Caliber Pistols. Manufacturer is Smith & Wesson, Construction is serrated body matte blue steel with black polymer floorplate and cartridge followers. Capacity is 15 rounds of .40 Smith & Wesson or .357 Sig calibers ammunition. These magazines themselves show the most significant of Smith & Wesson’s improvement upon Gaston Glock’s design; these magazines hold together, free-fall eject, and always lock the slide open just like they’re supposed to, something that cannot be said for Glock pistols and their magazines, admirable though they are. These magazines come from a distinguished Department in New England, and they are well maintained. Surface detractions principally amount to edge whitening from magazine case contact, and occasional finish freckling. We rate them as Very Good, perhaps even Excellent, but photos ought to suffice for our shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. They are certainly excellent mechanically. Replacement pricing on these in our area is in the $60 range, and they’re not easy to find at that. Single mag price is $39. We’re offering them, however, in lots of 3 or more at $26 per.

Comes with original box, original paperwork, original gun lock, 2 magazines (7rds).  I also have a 40cal mag (7rds) with pinky extension that I’ve been using with the gun.  I have not had any issues while using the 40cal mag, no failure to fires, no stove pipes, no double feeds, nothing.  The 40cal mag falls out easily when doing a tactical reload, and slides in easily when using it as the back-up mag.  If you don’t want the 40cal mag, I’ll keep it, but you will still get the original 2 9mm mags.  Front sight has been changed to a red fiber optic but I do have original white dot post.  Has “talon” grip tape on it, which greatly improves the tackiness feel in your hands.  Gun doesn’t slip or shift when fired.  I also have a 40mm Shield w/o the grip tape and you can tell a huge difference.  Fired about half a dozen times, a little over 120rds through it.  Cleaned and well cared for.  I recently purchased a Colt Defender and love it more, so I’m clearing out my collection.  I can add a box of ammo for $20, 50rd.  I would prefer cash, but I’m open to trades for revolvers or lever action rifles.  I would be willing to trade several guns or guns/cash to make the trade fair.

This is an all steel construction magazine, even the follower (which is a last round hold open).  It is built like a tank, like the Vepr 12.  It is about a million times better than any of the junky SGM mags you can get these days, and unlike the SGM mags it will not break/malfunction with slugs, crack/fracture from normal use, and fits much better in the mag well than the awkwardly sized SGM version.  It is meant to be an 8 round mag, and is most reliable at that volume, but can fit 9 and still function properly.  This is new, still in the factory wrapping.  I bought a handful of them, and I've decided to cut loose of two of them to get some more fun money.  This is a good price, and it is firm.  

If you can't spring for the really nice steel mags, I'm selling off some of the SGM 10 round mags I replaced with these."

The Urban Go Carrier Package is ideal for home protection and emergency situations where rifle threat protection may be necessary. The open side design with a quick release buckles unfastened allows the Urban Go Plate Carrier to be quickly tossed over a single shoulder and worn over any existing gear or body armor. Front access shoulder mounted quick release buckles allow rapid removal compared to plate carriers that utilize a cummerbund. Fast into action, fast out of action.

(Unfortunately last sale fell through)

This Jianshe Factory 26 Type 56 SKS rifle is a 7.63x39 semi-auto rifle recently imported by Inter Ordnance of Palm Bay, FL.  IO has had quite a few of them in varying conditions after the Sino-Soviet connection was made in the 80s and 90s and is still 100% valid.

""Sino-Soviet"" is an early model SKS produced by China using surplus Russian parts under Russian supervision using a mix of domestic Chinese and Russian supplied components (thus the Russian blade-type bayonet instead of a spike bayonet on a Chinese rifle). The sino-soviet ones were actually built by the Russian technicians themselves as a model/training for the first 10,000 Chinese before turning over production fully to them (then longer numbers and Chinese characters began to be used to mark the rifles). A sino-soviet is a first year production chinese rifle made with surplus parts marked with an arsenal /26\ stamp. 4-6 digit serial number preceded by two cyrillic letters.  Lack of a /26\ (or any arsenal) stamp was not necessarily unusual with the flood of SKSs hastily assembled and imported prior to the ban in the 90's.  

The sino's are the most highly sought after because they were the ones the Russians built to teach the Chinese how to mass-produce them.  Crisp-breaking triggers, chromed-lined barrels, and long-lasting accuracy are the markers of this awesome carbine.  The chromed-out barrel on this rifle is pristine and still looks brand-spankin' new!  
---> SEE PIC OF 2 x 5 SHOT STRINGS FROM THE HUNTING MAGAZINE USING IRON SIGHTS AT 100 YARDS TO HIT THE LITTLE 5-POINT TARGET IN THE TOP LEFT CORNER OF QUALIFICATION TARGETS!  AND THAT WAS WITH WAL-MART TUL-AMMO!
YOU WILL BE HARD-PRESSED TO FIND ANOTHER SKS THAT CAN DO THIS!!!

You couldn’t want a more rugged and reliable hunting gun; in Siberia Russians still use them to take Moose and Elk.  In addition to the standard 10-round magazine, this rifle also includes a 5-round magazine legal for hunting in all states except PA and Delaware.  I dropped a 160lbs whitetail doe with it last year at about 80 yards (Hornady SST double-lung shot) and it only went 10 yards before it dropped. 

Before I understood what a Sino-Soviet was I was going to “tacticool” this rifle out over time as a project gun, but being a C&R guy at heart I just couldn’t do it.  I have all the tacticool stuff included (but not attached) including:

- UTG dust cover with top and side mount Picatinny tri-rail
- OEM Steel Universal Design SKS Rifle Ejected Brass Shell Deflector Scope Protector Shield
- Williams Fire Sight SKS Rifle Front Sight 
- BSA Red-Dot sight
