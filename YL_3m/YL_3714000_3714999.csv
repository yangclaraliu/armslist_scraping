125,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3714125,"For Sale:  Antique 1890's Side-lock SXS Shotgun by S. J. D. & Co., Good Worker Order, Nice Condition","Skagit County, Mount Vernon, Washington",$ 200,"Listed On: Sunday, November 16, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have an antique Side by Side double barrel shotgun made by Simonis, Janssen & Dumoulin of Belgium.  They made fine firearms from 1884 to 1905.  This shotgun has a unique side-lock action release, seen in the first few pictures.  The break-action is released when this lever is depressed, easily done with the right thumb without repositioning the hand.  Pretty ingenious.  The action locks up tight, and both hammers cock and fire.  The triggers are double, one for the right barrel and one for the left.  The ejectors also work as they should.   The Wood looks to be walnut, and is absolutely beautiful, with no damage or cracks.  The Checkering on the fore grip is mostly worn away, but leaves behind the impression of a beautiful hardwood burl.  The barrels have some pitting, but retain lots of bluing.
There is a really pretty twisted ""grain"" to the barrels from the damascus design.  The chambers are standard for 2 3/4"" 12 gauge shotgun shells, BUT this gun is in excess of 114 years old, so it is designed for black powder only.  The action and barrels may hold up to light target loads, but then again it may not.   Each modern light target load would exceed the original proof load for the gun, so shooting modern ammo should not be attempted, unless the gun was checked out by a gunsmith.
That all being said, the lock, hammers and triggers all appear to work as they should.

This would make a great addition to anyones gun collection.

I would like to see ID for the purchaser for my records.   This gun is clearly an antique, and requires no paperwork as thus."

I'm the original owner. A Birthday Gift to teach me to shoot and safe handling in 1967. 

The beautiful American Walnut stock and forearm, Gold Trigger, Factory Sling Mounts, White 
Spacer butt plate and M1 Styling makes it very special.  Marlin patented the ""Micro-Groove"" 
Rifling with 16 closely spaced and low profile rifling grooves which enhances the velocity and accuracy by less bullet rifling deformation prior to exiting the barrel.  

A really Great .22 rim fire rifle with a M1 carbine look built on the Model 60 action with a 7 Round Magazine. They are hard to find these days and Marlin made less than 50K of these little rifles. Research for these rifles establish a value of around $250 in good condition. A Marlin 989 M2 will go for or even more when in great condition. If the factory rear sights are still on the rifle they command a good deal more. The rear sights for the Model 989M2 and 99M1 both mounted to the integrated receiver top rail and were often removed so scopes could be mounted and then subsequently lost. The rear sights can go for as much as $90 since they are hard to find. The 989 M2 was made from 1966-1979.

So here's your chance to own a great little Marlin that was designed to look like the M1 30 caliber carbine of WWII fame.  

This one is Priced to Sell. 

Can meet face to face for a Cash Sale near Green Bay.  
Remember to Bring a gun case.

The pistol grip is Magpul MOE pistol grip and the stock is a Magpul Training systems PRS (READ!!!!  The training systems PRS stock is the same adjustability as the true PRS but the training systems stock doesn't have the positive clicks with adjustment which keeps price a little lower it works fine for target, match, and hunting just not the tactical environment).  The rifle has an 18"" Douglas match barrel chambered and reamed by one of the nations best AR 15 company's, Compass Lake Engineering.  The barrel is the exact barrel the Military uses on the MK 12 223 designated marksman rifle and sniper rifle.  The rifle is finished off with a free float hand guard and picatinny sling swivel for bipod.  The muzzle device right now is for my suppressor and will switch it for a flash hider or a break/compensator that you provide I will cover the gunsmithing fees.  I can have the rifle cerakoted any color or pattern you want to help sweeten the deal at no cost.  Scope and mount do not come with rifle.

 The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

Back in early 90's I used to travel to South Florida a lot on business. So on one of those trips I managed to track down SAMCO Global Arms facility in Miami and I figured out how to talk them in to allowing me to go into their warehouse and sort through the mountain of Swedish Mausers they had. Back then they were the big importer for most of the Swedish guns. They literally had half a warehouse full of cross stacked pallets of M96's M38's and others. So I spent a few hours sorting through tons of rifles and ended up picking out this M96 and an equally nice M38 bent bolt. I paid them and they shipped them to my local FFL in Brandon.

The rifles I picked were the best of what was there and my main criteria was mechanical function and bore condition. Plus originality/matching numbers. All of them were issued and showed signs of use. However I also managed to pick rifles that were in really nice physical condition too.

This particular rifle is a relatively early one made in 1900 by Carl Gustaf. Metal finish is 80%+, and wood looks very nice. It's mechanically excellent and the bore is beautiful and shiny with no rust, corrosion or dark spots. Every number matches (and there are a lot of numbers on this one) except for the cleaning rod. I went through a bunch of rifles and they all were either missing the cleaning rod or it was mismatched.

Rifle is quite accurate and I'd put it up against any other Mauser - period! The Swedes were fanatics about accuracy and bore condition and it's quite evident when you shoot one of their rifles. This one is equipped with an original front sight hood, trajectory/range tag and flash suppressor. Additionally there is an original bayonet and brass catcher for target use (not shown as I removed it for the pictures).

Finally there is a blank firing adapter which is a hoot on the 4th of July and New Years Eve. An original and correct leather sling plus an aluminum oiler. Ten original Swedish Mauser stripper clips. Then 30 rounds of M41 Long Range Red Tracer ammo on clips. This ammo is quite rare and it brings $1.50 a round plus on GunBroker if you ever happen to find it.

Bottom line is I'm preparing to retire so this needs to go, but selling this one is tougher than most. Given that the rifle is 114 years old I'd have to rate it's overall condition as very good and borderline of excellent.

Asking $575 local sale only picked up in the Brandon area. Rifle is 2 years short of being a true antique in the eyes of the law. Buyer must be a Florida resident and at least 18 years old.
