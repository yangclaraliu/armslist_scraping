I believe the rate of fire is around 800 rpm, possibly faster. it is select fire : semi and full auto. I dont know the original round count. I have fired it only on one occasion to check functionality and reliability. and yes, it runs like a champ. I never had one hiccup with the factory brass case ammo. it is very fun in full auto mode but goes through the ammo quickly. It comes with 4, 32 round magazines and a briefcase that has seen better days-thats what it came in when I bought it. There are a few scuffs here and there but nothing major, most ikely they are from storage wear. This weapon has been well cared for and kept clean. The price is what it is, there will be no negotiation. If youre not willing to pay it, then please move on. I do not want any trades of any kind. this weapon is for a cash sale only, no exceptions in the terms of the sale will be made for anyone for any reason. the buyer is responsible for all transfer fees and the purchase of a class 3 tax stamp. If you dont know whats all involved when buying a machine gun, I suggest you contact a qualified gun dealer or research it online. There is a considerable amount of paperwork and a wait period. The buyer must pay up front before the weapon is signed over to the dealer during the application process and no refunds will be given alothough I do guarantee this weapon works awesomely and is fun to shoot. can send pics of magazines with speedloader, and briefcase if needed."

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

I received this shot gun as a gift last year for my birthday and have really enjoyed it even though it just didn’t fit me very well. I only shot about 10 rounds of Sporting Clays with it this last year with it for a total of only 500 rounds though the gun. I liked it so well that I bought another Silver Reserve Sporting only a little longer and with that I have way too many shotguns so I want to sell this one.

I hate to say goodbye to the best 1911 I've  ever had which I purchased 2 weeks ago but I got to as an immediate expense got in the way. This is one of the best 1911's ever IMO, personal defense and competition ready whatever is your purpose. I shot only 100 rounds of AE 230gr ball ammo through it  and hits a 15 yarder target with 1-1.5inch groupings. The stupidest thing I did and which some of us have committed is that idiot scratch, a tiny speck on the slide stop. No matter how careful I am when I reassembled it after cleaning, the tightness of  this pistol made me pry the slide stop with a plastic bushing wrench wrapped in cloth to be able to remove that slide stop and of course, that idiot mark afterwards. Slide to frame fit is the tightest I've ever encountered in a 1911, well outside perhaps of Ed Browns, Les Baers and WC ( which I had not held) . Enough said, this is a COLT and no much introduction needed. I can meet and sell to buyers only after signing a transfer form after showing a TX DL or CHL. The model number of this Colt Combat elite is : O8011XSE and you can find more about it on Colt's website.  Thanks."

Asking $999 for the rifle with scope [pics will be at the bottom of the gallery ASAP]. Also have several boxes of factory ammo for it at the reasonable rate of $2/rd.

Have assorted ammo for most everything listed, but shipping ammo sucks so it's your call. Pics of ammo by request. I'll be camping this weekend, back monday. As always, all laws apply, anything outside IL will require an FFL, anything in-state requires a FOID, waiting period, and urine sample.

977,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3922977,For Sale:  Custom Made Riggers Belts in Black or Coyote Broen,"west, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 22,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 10, 2015",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Let me make you the last belt you will ever need! Each belt is custom made to your specifications. If you have questions, please send me a message, I would be happy to answer them and make you the belt of your dreams! My goal is to provide you with a product that is extremely durable, reliable, and aesthetically pleasing at an incredible value. Because of this, I offer this belt in several configurations, so you only pay for the features you want.

I can meet you locally for the exchange, or ship it to you.  I will only ship if purchased through my Etsy store (https://www.etsy.com/listing/217188140/custom-riggers-belt-perfect-tactical?)  I ship to US addresses for $7.  I will not accept money orders, or anything like that.

First, a little bit about the materials:

The webbing is mil-spec, and is rated to a breaking strength of 6000 pounds. The buckle is specifically made to secure parachute straps, and is rated to 2500 pounds. Each belt is sewn on an industrial sewing machine using size 92 bonded nylon thread. The industry standard is size 69, but I kick it up a notch for better durability, strength, and just because I don't believe in doing things half-assed.

Each belt is made from a double layer of webbing, and reduced to a single layer right before the buckle. This provides rigidity and strength. This belt is great for attaching holsters, multi-tools, and drop leg rigs.

A little bit about the options:

Basic Riggers Belt ($22): Standard double layered belt. This includes a parachute grade buckle, and hook and loop velcro sewn onto the belt to keep the tail from dangling in the wind. This belt does not contain the V-ring like the belt shown in the picture.

V-Ring Belt ($29): This includes all the features of the standard belt, but with a V-ring for attaching accessories such as eye glass cases or water bottles. This is the V-Ring shown in the pictures. To keep the V-ring from dangling in the wind, I sew a retention strap made from 1 inch nylon webbing and hook and loop material.

Internal Loop Liner ($32): This includes all the features of the V-Ring Belt, but the entire inside is lined with loop velcro type material. The purpose of this is to mate with pouches, holsters, and accessories made for a duty belt, which have hook velcro type material on the mounting straps. This is the belt shown in the photographs.

Double Loop Liner ($35): Includes all the features of the Internal Loop Liner belt, but also has loop velcro type material on the outside of the belt. This is perfect if you intend on using this belt for the internal belt of a padded ""war belt"".

If there is something else you desire in a riggers belt, please let me know and I will add it as an option. I can do everything from putting soft loops in the side or back of the belt, adding additional d-rings, using a different buckle like the cobra buckle, and pretty much anything else you can dream up.

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING SIZING: To determine the size you need, measure one of the belts you currently wear from the end of the buckle to the hole you usually wear it in. The sizes here do not correspond to your pant size. The reason I use this method is because different manufacturers of pants size them differently. I know, it's weird, but that's what they do. Additionally, everyone wears their pants differently, resulting in a different belt size. The reason I use this method is to get you the belt in the exact size you want the first time.

My belts will adjust approximately 2 inches in from this size, and approximately 3 inches out from this size, similarly to a leather belt worn with the buckle in the middle hole.  If you need more or less, please let me know."

I will only ship if purchased through my Etsy store (https://www.etsy.com/listing/217188140/custom-riggers-belt-perfect-tactical?) I ship to US addresses for $7. I will not accept money orders, or anything like that.

So, a little about this sling:

This is the toughest single point sling you will find, made of Mil-Spec Tubular Webbing. I made this sling myself, and I am proud to offer you this exceptional sling at a very competitive price point.

Fully adjustable from a 60 inch loop to literally a 0 inch loop. This sling features a fastex buckle with the female portion on the body of the sling. This allows you to manipulate your weapon from a carry stance to a shooting stance without the sling grinding against your clothing or your gear. The buckle slides along the sling instead. This is smoother, faster, and more comfortable. This sling also facilitates the ""dumping"" of your primary weapon to producing a secondary weapon. 

Additionally, the fastex buckle provides a quick detach point. This also allow you to purchase one sling for multiple weapons, and just leave the connected portion on the weapon when not in use. Contact me if you desire additional adapters. 

You have your option of connection hardware depending on your desires and your weapon type. As shown in the fourth picture, I offer the standard webbing adapter ($14), UTG brand quick detach swivel mount ($20.50), tan HK spring clip ($18), or the popular mash hook (17). The standard webbing adapter is the most versatile, and can even be wrapped around the narrow portion of the butt stock of weapons without sling mounts.

If you would like this sling, or any of the slings I offer in another color, configuration, or anything else, please let me know. I am sure I can make your custom sling or gear to a level of exceptional quality for a price you will be happy with.

As you can see from the photographs, I take great pride in my trade. All stitching is done on an industrial sewing machine using size 92 bonded nylon thread. The industry standard is size 69, but I make my own gear with size 92, and I feel that I should offer you the same added strength and durability also."
