I took this to the range the day I bought it, fired less than 200 rounds, cleaned it and put in my safe. I probably could have said this was ""new"" and gotten away with it, but I have this thing about honesty. This is a fantastic, reliable firearm at any price, especially this one!

This may work better for an LCR owner who lives up north. I've never worn this in the bush and the holster has no damage or scratches.  

Those gun owners who are concerned about buying quality products have probably already heard of the Simply Rugged brand - once you hold a holster like this in your hands it's obvious that it will stand up to years, even decades, of hard use. Here's a link to the product page:

Note that the holster + IWB hardware costs 65$ - they've actually slightly lowered the price since I purchased it. I'm willing to sell this custom leather holster to you for 65$ flat - saving you the normal 11$ shipping fee that Simply Rugged charges their customers.

The G2 Contender is essentially dimensionally the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore style trigger group. Due to the changes in the trigger mechanism, and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the buttstocks and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange. The G2, though, uses essentially the same barrels and fore-ends as the original Contender[6] and barrels will interchange, with the only two exceptions being the G2 muzzleloading barrels, which will only fit the G2 frame, and the Herrett barrels/fore-ends, which are specific for use only on a G1 frame.[7] Unlike the original Contender, dry-firing of the G2 Contender is possible only in the center (safe) hammer position, located on the hammer between the centerfire and rimfire positions. Also, unlike the original Contender, the break-action does not need to be opened/closed (cycled) to practice dry-firing, provided the hammer is lowered between dry firing ""shots"". The adjustability of G2 Contender triggers is also slightly different from the original G1 Contender. This is serial number 218507 and comes with a stainless 12"" ported 45-70 gov't barrel, 14"", 30-30 WIN Super 14 barrel, 10"", 44 MAG barrel and a 14"" 45 Colt / 410 Barrel. This is a fantastic gun in around 95% original condition so look close at this gun for your hunting and collecting needs."

This pistol has the nickel Boron coating over Glocks standard tennifer on the slide, internals, and barrel. In case you are unfamiliar with nickel Boron, it is an ion bonding process that results in a finish that is like stainless steel in appearance, however, it has a lifetime warranty to NEVER chip, crack, or rust. This stuff is near indestructible. I have seen torture test that are unbelievable. People have left guns with this coating in Salt water for 12 months without a single spot of corrosion. They also say you don't have to ever clean or lubricate the gun because the nickel boron has high lubricity. All you ever do is give it a quick wipe and pass a patch down the barrel. However, having said that, this gun has been cleaned regularly anyway.

This pistol is in like new condition. I bought it new and have put maybe 75 rounds through it. I'm only selling to make room for a new purchase. The pistol comes in the original box, with two magazines. One of the magazines has a finger grip extender that makes drawing and firing much easier. The grip has a rubberized talon decal to help with the grip, but if you don't like it you can remove it. Also comes with the factory speed loader and a nice leather in the waistband holster from Tagua. Let me know if you have any questions, and thanks for looking!

This belt is in excellent condition. This particular model is a size Small (30-34) ""Miss Be Havin"" purple suede belt with an ornate silver buckle. 

I bought this belt about six months ago, and while I love the fit and function - it's just not particularly well suited for my lifestyle or fashion. This may be a better fit for a lady or gentleman who lives up north or needs to support some heavy iron worn OWB. No color shows when the belt is worn - 'tactical' and attractive black leather only - but you'll smile knowing there is a splash of purple berry on your waist. The silver buckle can be replaced using the hex head hardware included on the belt. 

Here is a link to the product page:
 http://www.looperlawenforcement.com/miss-be-havin39.html

Lisa Looper is selling this sturdy, functional and attractive gunbelt for 69$ + shipping. I'll give it to you for only 55$ *including* shipping. You'll save a considerable amount of money and get a product that's in just as good condition as it was the day I bought it. I've never worn this belt in the bush and it has no scratches. You'll get a tracking number sent to you promptly. 

I'll accept paypal, silver of roughly equivalent value, cash or money order. Again, my price includes shipping and is extremely competitive relative to any online store you can name. 

This belt is a standalone sale, but I can include my other listing, a Simply Rugged Premium Leather Holster for the Ruger LCR. It fits like a glove with this belt and they look very attractive together. A great purchase for an active outdoors woman or a man who enjoys a splash of color on his gunrig. Buying these two items together will save you money - contact me for details."

Here are the details for the 2 scopes (neither is mounted on the rifle currently ... just put there for the pictures)
1 - Pentax Gameseeker II  4-12 X 40mm. This was on the rifle for the 60 rounds and after 10 rounds to zero, I shot .75 moa with itt @ 100 yds.  Pretty nice but I really like the Nikon glass 
2 - Nikon Buckmasters 4.5-14 X 40mm SF BDC Never got around to mounting it to shoot it. It was on my 30-06 but I sold that too.  It was on that rifle for about 50 rounds and I loved it. 

- Rifle with rings, bag, bore sight laser and bipod. $625
- Above with the ammo. $725 ... ammo is 20 7.62 brass, 30 308 brass and 180 WPA steel case.  All 145 grain.

Basics of Bartering....
Don't ask me what I like, because I do not know what you have just make me an offer the worst I can say is no or make a counter offer. I gave a list of items that I do not want, I like guy stuff could use a bench top metal lathe I have ordered one and it is on back order! Remember, This is bartering so the only thing that matters is we both walk away happy or the items we came to the table with.

Barter Value: Your item may be worth more than my item or my item may be worth more than your item. Trade value is relative to need, want, appreciation and depreciation of an item but again what matters is we both walk away happy with the deal.

I am not desperate to trade so just let me know what you got I will say Yes, No, Or Counter Offer!"

ALL OTHER CALIBERS IN STOCK. OUR BEGINNING GRADE OF WOOD STOCKED RIFLE IN THE UNITED STATES. BEAUTIFUL NEW RIFLES. ALL AUCTIONS SUBJECT TO IN STORE SALES. PICTURES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF WOOD ONLY. The detachable magazine was right at the top of the -optimisation list. Here we managed to find the perfect solution – ergonomically ideal and convenient to use. But we have also taken the fans of the integral magazine into account. Either way, it was important to us that our bolt action rifle remained the benchmark in compact design and usability. And we were able to do this without restriction. Nevertheless, the new magazine type is just one of a multitude of innovations that make the R8 so unique. The trigger as a crucial factor in precision and its safe functioning, even under extreme conditions, posed a very special constructional challenge, one that has been brilliantly mastered. In order to make shooting with the R8 as comfortable and safe as possible, we attached immense importance to optimizing the stock, reaching a new level of perfection here, too. We made all efforts to achieve maximum technical performance without compromising on superior style and design.

The mighty 686-4 has all the best parts with no MIMs or that ridiculous built in lock.  It has the hammer mounted firing pin and full forged internals.  I will not sell it for less or split up the items.  This is a VERY rare round - butt version 686 -4 in a 4 inch barrel.  These were only produced in 1996.  Great thing about the round butt is it will accept both round butt and square butt SW grips so you can collect and customize.  (Square butt SW revolvers cannot use round butt grips)

 It is used and does have minor wear it is not an unfired collector gun. It is dead on accurate and gunsmith checked this year.  I have fired it personally and can provide pictures of paper targets.  Lock-up, timing, and all the technical stuff are good to go.  Trigger action is simply perfect.

 Includes the following extras and ammo:
 Looper Oklahoma made leather holster with thumb - break
 2 HKS speedloaders
 Original wood medallion grips
 Hogue brand rubber combat grip
 20 rounds of Speer Gold Dot defense .357
 128 rounds of new .357
 60 rounds of new .38 special
 Original SW case

Everything in the picture is included. This is a Distinguished Combat Magnum and this model is no longer in production. It has been increasing in value everyday and will continue to do so. Text preferred for questions but can call or email as well. I will deliver it in the OKC and surrounding area for the right person. I am a safe military vet with a handgun license and am always responsibly carrying to support the 2nd. Contact 4zero5-4seven4-058five. Thanks - Ken

It's not pristine on the outside but still a good shooter. The grips alone sell for over $300. Fits in your pants pocket, purse or?? Light weight and 6-round magazine. Known as the Model ‘N’ internally within Colt, the 1908 Vest Pocket is a diminutive 4.5 inches long, and sports a 2 inch barrel. Weighing a mere 13 ounces, it is fed by a six round single column magazine. The pistol’s fixed open iron sights were rather small and rudimentary, but typical for small hideout automatics of its era and adequate for the short range at which it was intended to be used. The Model 1908, has a standard slide-locking safety catch, as well as a grip safety.

 A piece of American history to be had with a 5-digit serial number.Manufactured around end of 1910. Has two-toned magazine and crimped well. The bottom of the magazine has ""25 auto Colt"" on it. Make me an offer. I also have a few boxes of 25 ammo (150rounds). Be reasonable and don't insult me.

I do not have a price because I am not really looking to sell, mostly trade.  I might sell for the right price, all I can say is make an offer if you want to buy."

Quality M24/47 Yugoslavian Mauser in 8mm. Only have shot 50 or so rounds through it. Mirror bore (probably new barrel) and very smooth action. Straight bolt. Just google the M24/47 to get an idea of the quality rifle this surplus is - for a low price. Imported by Samco. Non-matching serial numbers but functions very well. Head space checked by importer and fired by me without issue. Finish is at least 75% and stock is good, no cracks. Cosmoline free! Has front sight hood and cleaning rod. No bayonet. There is one small wood fix in upper hand guard. But it is very very accurate, and very pretty. Would make a great deer hunting rifle with a scout scope. I also have 150 or so Yugo surplus 198 grain FMJ 8mm rounds left (from the 50's) that go bang every time. Better ammo is recommended but I'll sell the rounds off for a bargain if interested ($0.40 per). Rifle comes with a new leather repro sling from the era. 

I love it but it kicks me like a mule and I don't have the resources to properly scope it. The iron sights on Mausers are a bit tough to see lol.
