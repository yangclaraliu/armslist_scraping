These are the older heavier built models.  I am told these have more machined parts and less stamped parts.  I also have the issued cleaning rods for both.   

I purchased them from AIM Surplus back when they still had them a few years ago. The guns fire well, but sometimes the empty shell fails to extract all of the way. Extractor issue I am guessing.  The guns have the wood grips and not the black plastic ""synthetic"" grips.  

I paid 800 for the pair and would like to get as close to that as possible.  Feel free to make an offer. Nobody under 21 please and must be legally able to own firearms. 

Here is the link to the AIM site 
http://www.aimsurplus.com/product.aspx?item=F3StarB

This is how AIM described them, ""WWII Star Model B 9mm Luger Pistols. Manufactured in Spain between 1943-44 as part of a 15,000 piece contract for Bulgaria. These pistols feature original Wartime Factory Markings. They were refinished by the Russians after WWII as was common practice with firearms they obtained during & after the War. They will have checkered wood or black synthetic grips. Some markings may be lighter due to the refinishing. Almost identical design to the 1911. Includes 1-8rd magazine.""

Would like to sell both to the same person/collector.  
Local pickup only.  I have 800.00 into them, but feel free to make an offer for both."

Kept really good care of it and cleaned as soon as I came back from shooting. Currently has a Houge grip on it, which I really like. Do have the original grips, made of real wood. I made a little modification to the sight which is, painted a white dot on the front sight post and a white line around the back sight (as seen in 3rd picture). Also the trigger has been polished and trigger over travel has been modified. Weight is still around factory standard weight, just more smooth than a factory trigger. Last of all, the load chamber indicator has been deactivated. All of these modifications, other than polished trigger, can be reverted to stock at your request. I personally believe these modification only make it easier to shoot more precisely.

7mm-08 chambering, bolt action with carbine length barrel. 

I have owned this rifle since new.  788's have developed a bit of a collector following due to their accuracy.  The 7mm-08 chambering is relatively rare in this model.  This rifle shoots great, the action has been glass-bedded and the barrel free floated.  

It is not a safe queen, I have hunted with it and it has taken many a deer.  The stock shows some scratches and aging of the finish.  There is some wear on the bluing. 

The scope and sling shown in the photos are NOT included in the listed price, but the scope mount/rings and sling mounts are included.  I am also including two (2) factory Remington clip magazines.

Unlike some 788's that have been fired with hot loads and have the bolt handle welded, this one has only fired Rem factory loads and the bolt is original.

From Brownell's website:
""Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights."""

I will gladly provide you with a bill of sale if you desire one. None is required by me.
This gun came to me on a trade deal and it could pass for unfired. Very nice shape.
Ex military collector was parting with some nice weapons to get a high end pistol from me.
It looks and functions like new in every way. You will love the look and feel of the gun.
Short trigger pull, crisp break and short trigger reset are also nice touches on gun.
17 round high capacity gun makes it an excellent carry, defensive or range gun.
Comes with the factory case, manual, and 2 mags plus the key to the built in lock. 
If you wanted to come test fire it at my range you are welcome to do so before buying.
I'm a trader, so if ya have something you want to trade, shoot me a pic and give it a try.

I purchased the rifle new 3 months ago and have taken it to the range a grand total of ONE time during which I fired TWO twenty round magazines to dial in the sights and check for functionality. The rifle performed flawlessly and exceeded my expectations in accuracy. I took the rifle home, cleaned it, checked the bolt gap, and returned it to the safe... and there it has remained because I have found that I cannot afford to shoot 308 as much I would like.

Therefore, I have found myself with another excellent safe queen and without a safe big enough to continue stockpiling. Rifle comes with 6 mags + the original hard plastic case and manual. If you only have cash, feel free to make an offer but realize that I am not particularly looking to sell the rifle, just to trade straight across or with some cash and/or ammo from either end

I would like to trade for a Sig Sauer 556R (that's the 7.62x39 version) or other ""tactical"" style rifle. I will not entertain offers for handguns, shotguns. antiques, collectibles or anything of the sort. I will also look at higher end ARs in 5.56 and Arsenal AKs in 7.62x39 or 5.45x39. I would especially like a ""retro"" style AR (A1 or A2 receiver w/ 20"" barrel) in 5.56. That being said, please don't hesitate to contact me with any inquires. Thanks!"

The walnut grips are not the ones that come with the pistol--these are a beautiful dark wood that have a much more natural feel in the hand than the rubber, but I am also including the smaller rubber grips, in case you prefer that feel. 
As far as the gun goes, I've fired about 75 rounds down the barrel, so it's fantastically close to new. I've also got the original hard case and a leather holster that is immaculate--never been used. 
Here's a little about the pistol from Chiappa's site:
Defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

It is a Remington 700 action with a 26"" bull barrel cambered in 7mm-08. The 7mm-08 is a cartridge born from the 308 necked down to .284. There are a few great advantages to this the bullets used will have a higher BC( ballistic coefficient ). Which means the bullet flies farther, straighter, truer, greater velocity, high energy, and less recoil. It is ballistically far superior to the .308. I was able to shoot 3/4 moa with un-tuned loads very easily this is a 1/2 moa gun at 100 yards easily. It is set in a bell and Carlson A5 completely adjustable stock comb height, length of pull, and cant.

I bought this rifle from the original owner last year and replaced the sloppy factory trigger with a crisp Timney adjustable. This rifle is in near perfect condition and has shot numerous sub-MOA groups. The original Japanese Tasco scope that came as a package deal when new is also included. These rifles have become huge hits with competition shooters and  collectors alike, with the carbine being the most sought after. This gun will only increase in value and is very difficult to find.

Technical Details and Condition: 

Astra 600/43 in 9mm Parabellum (9mm Luger) SN #53xxx date of production: 1945. Overall very good condition, minor holster wear evident on the sides of the middle frame and on back edge of slide. Bore excellent, rifling intact. Original Astra magazine but unnumbered. Mechanically excellent, have never had a failure to fire or failure to feed with factory ammo or reloads in this firearm. Very clean and all original. 

Additional Information: 

Groups very well and has eaten all brands and makes of ammunition including hollow points. Half-moon sights typical of a WW2-era military sidearm with lanyard ring. Blowback design is unusual for a 9mm Luger pistol and provides a unique feel to this 9mm and provides excellent reliability. The Astra 600/43 was used by German (possibly other European axis powers) during WW2; however, this gun was not delivered to Germany by war's end but was likely used by the West German Police when it was delivered after the war. Great gun but have other 9mm's I would rather play with. 

Contact Details: 

I live in Old Louisville and can meet in person for inspection of the firearm and purchase for most times of most days at my house. Please contact me through armslist via email with your name, phone no. and date/time you would like to meet. 

I am willing to drive within the Louisville area, let me know your location if you want me to come to you. I will ship to an FFL for individuals unable to meet in person, select an FFL that will receive shipments from individuals or I can ship from an FFL for an additional cost.
