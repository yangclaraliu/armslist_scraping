CEO, and founder of Civilian Force Arms, former Army Specialist Yonas Hagos lives each day to give back to the country who gave him freedom. Hagos spent most of his childhood in a refugee camp in Sudan, arriving to the United States when he was 10. He joined the army after 9/11 because, he says, he felt this country had given him so much. Hagos was seriously injured by a rocket--propelled grenade and was later awarded a Purple Heart. Recovering from his wounds, and reflecting on his days in the Army, he began building AR-15s. He considers each AR-15 a work of art, and they provide a new purpose after nearly surviving his darkest days of combat. Civilian Force Arms manufactures, distributes, and sells customized tactical weapons and weapons parts for law-abiding consumers. Our guns are 100% guaranteed, and we only produce weapons that we would take into combat. Our forged Civilian Force Arms signature on every AR-15 guarantees that the weapon is trusted, safe, and can be displayed proudly.

I have a low round count Colt LE901. The rifle has less than 200rds through it. I keep the gun clean and there are no flaws, the brass deflector has a slight mark from throwing spent cartridges. Gun cycles great and it really accurate for what it is. The gun will come with the Magpul prs stock and Magpul grip. -Harris bipod not included- 

EDIT: rifle does not come with the 555 adapter kit. The early 901s did not come with them and I never had a need to buy it

I have the Colt factory box, birth bag and a few other things that come with the rifle when purchased new

ALL laws will be followed 24hr waiting period, show FOID and the state police FOID verification. 

Check my listings....I also have a brand new LMT AR15.
I will package the Colt and LMT together for $2,500

Comes with 2 extra genuine Colt Pocket 9 mags.
This Colt is the same size as the “Colt Pocket Lite Mustang .380” but in 9mm.

This was considered the finest compact 9mm ever made, and is still one of the smallest and lightest. It was only manufactured 1 year when it was discontinued due to a patent infringement law suit. They are quite hard to find and almost never found in unfired condition. Check Gun Broker, there are lots of parts and mags but rarely one for sale. They are still carried as back-up by law enforcement.

Here’s your chance to own one of the finest Colts ever made, with no paperwork, when purchased before Dec 4th.

Trade could be just about anything of interest, but I do not want anything that has been shot to death or a $500 gun with 10 magazines. Gun and ammo combinations are fine. This gun has never been shot, it has never had a round loaded into the magazine. I had a 17 HMR TC but sold it so I am going a different direction. I am particularly interested in a quality 9mm. I prefer Sig, HK, or Springfield, 1911 and other 45 ACP offers are always welcome as are wheel guns in 44mag or 357 Mag, interested in a Kriss Vector, not looking for a hunting rifle or shotgun at this time. I can add cash to the right deal. My price is firm. I would prefer to meet somewhere in or very near polk county. No felons and a valid ID required to complete transaction."

The advantage of the super mag as a hunting shotgun is its ability to fit even the large 3 1/2 inch shells which pack more punch.  At the same time you can shoot even the small shells out of this gun.  The receiver is designed to match any size.  Remington's classic 870 design also guarantee's durability and function.  This gun was just recently bought for me as a gift but I already have too many shotguns.  It's a 4+1 tube loader, pump action in all black.  Everything on this gun is brand new.  I have not shot any rounds out of it and it comes with all the parts from the box including the instructions.  I have however oil it twice since I received it since most guns come from the factory fairly dry.  This would make an ideal hunting shotgun but would also be excellent for home defense.  Remington makes an extended ammunition tube for fairly cheap which is installed very easily for those who would use this for home defense.

This is a 1973 original manufacture military grade AK (shown by the triangle in front of the serial number), remanufactured by Century Arms. I am not an expert but my friend who knows AK’s way better than me said the GP/WASR-10/63 is the mid-grade Romanian AK. The wood seems to be matching grains, and overall the rifle is in great condition, with the original 45 degree compensator. The guy I bought it from said he only fired 20 rounds through it, and said that the guy he bought it from never fired it. Comes with 7 Tapco polymer 30 round  waffle mags and an almost brand new camouflaged Allen rifle case with two exterior zipper pockets. 

$625 OBO. 

The gun case and the mags are for sale in my other ad as well, so if either of them sells first I will adjust the price accordingly. I will put as many non-corrosive 7.62x39 rounds as you want into the deal, up to 200, at the cost of an additional $6.50 per 20 rounds (the rounds in the pictured mag are just for illustrative purposes unless you buy some)."

 One is a MK3 Talo exclusive that I bought new. It is catalog number MKIII4GPRFS model 10154. It has a 4"" threaded barrel with flash suppressor. Hogue grips and Picatinny rail. It has a black matte finish. It comes with the box, soft carrying case, trigger lock, manual and two ten round mags. It has had three mags run through it. It is also topped with a Burris Fastfire II. I bought the FF used and it came with a FN 5.7 mount. I bought a Picatinny mount and put it on theMK3. I'm asking $450 for the package.

 The other is a MKII target model. It has the target grips and a 6 7/8"" tapered bull barrel. This 1984 production gun has excellent bluing with the only blemish being what looks like the outermost curve of the back strap was rubbed. The pistol has a VQ trigger, but I make no claims that it has VQ innards. I know the trigger pull is very light, but I don't know the poundage. Comes with two mags, but no box. I'm asking $325.

713,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3763713,For Sale:  RAVEN CONCEALMENT VAN GUARD 2 FOR M&P PISTOLS DOESNT FIT SHIELD,"Burbs, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 30,"Listed On: Friday, March 27, 2015",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I sold my M&P So I no longer need this holster.  It is almost brand new only used a few times. 


The VanGuard 2 is a minimalist IWB holster.  Unlike traditional IWB holsters, the VG2 covers only the trigger guard of your weapon.  This unique design eliminates the bulk of a traditional holster, while providing a level of safety and security not attainable by simply sticking a pistol in the waistband of your pants.

The VanGuard 2 can be used multiple ways: 

First, it can be used (without the lanyard or the strut and soft-loop assembly) as a trigger guard cover for storage and transportation safety.  This prevents foreign objects from finding their way inside the trigger guard and potentially pressing the trigger, while still allowing the slide to be cycled and the magazine released.  This gives users the ability to clear the weapon without the danger of a negligent discharge.

Next, it can be used with the static-line tether for on-body (IWB) or off-body carry (such as inside a bag, purse, briefcase, vehicle console, etc).  This allows the weapon to be safely carried with a chambered round without fear of a negligent discharge, while still being rapidly deployable.  The holster can also be removed by catching the nose of the holster and prying it off.  This allows one-hand deployment of the weapon even if the tether or attachment point fails to remove the holster.

Finally, the user can attach the strut and soft-loop assembly to create a stable, secure, IWB holster.  The complete system is fully adjustable for ride-height and cant, is tuckable for maximum concealment, and fully ambidextrous.  Please be aware, we do not advise attempting to re-holster the weapon while the VG2 is inside your clothing.  You should remove the VG2 and install it on the weapon outside of your waistband.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

832,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3763832,For Sale:  Brand New TA31ECOS ACOG/RMR Combo Flat Dark Earth For Sale,"North County, San Diego, California","$ 1,450","Listed On: Sunday, November 30, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a brand new TA31ECOS Trijicon Acog for sale. It's in perfect condition and comes with the following:

(1) Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Flat Dark Earth Optic
(1) 3.25 MOA RMR LED Red Dot Sight mounted to the ACOG (RM01)
(1) A.R.M.S. Throw Lever Mount
(1) Set of back up Iron Sights
(1) LENSPEN
(1) Trijicon Logo Sticker (PR15)
(1) ACOG Manual
(1) Warranty Card

The reticle and dot for the RMR are red. The RMR red dot is battery powered and can last 2-5 years on a single battery (depending on conditions of storage) and has windage/elevation screws for adjustments. There is no off switch for those of you wondering about the RMR. It stays on continuously until it runs out of juice. I'm only selling this because it has been sitting in the safe for quite some time and I have no use for it. The ACOG is an outstanding optic for those who have never used it and can take an extreme amount of abuse (ask any combat veteran who has had experience with it down range). The price is a solid $1450 (considering I paid $1900 for this optic). Method of payment is cash only, unless you are out of state. We can discuss that further if need be. Unfortunately since a friend of mine had a shotgun stolen from him at gun point off of this website, we will meet at a public location (ie: inside a gun shop) for the safety of both myself and the buyer. For any further questions feel free to contact me via email off this website. Cheers"

Put an XD® Mod.2™ in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone™: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone™, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone™ doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone™ advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact. - See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/xd-mod-2-3-sub-compact-9mm/#sthash.PNKCT2Q6.dpuf

I've shot the gun at the range three times (shooting a couple hundred round through it overall) and have cleaned it every time I've shot it. I'm maticulous with cleaning my firearms, so you'll be getting a ""like new"" Ruger LC9. There's nothing wrong with it, I'm just wanting to clear up space in my collection and focus on in my .40's.

Details: The LC9 is a double-action-only pistol with a smooth trigger pull. Control and handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil (very comfortable for a pistol of this size) and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. The Ruger LC9 features smooth rounded ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing.

The LC9™ is a lightweight, compact 9mm pistol for discreet carry by law abiding citizens, or a full-power, no-compromise backup for off-duty law enforcement officers. This highly requested pistol was developed through Ruger's Voice of the Customer program and incorporates the features and rugged reliability desired by Ruger customers.

The LC9 has a 3.12"" barrel, is 6.0"" long and 4.5"" tall, making for a very compact 9mm pistol. The LC9 is impressively narrow at a mere .90"" wide, and weighs only 17.1 ounces with an empty magazine. Featuring a black polymer (glass-filled nylon) frame and blued alloy steel slide and barrel, the lightweight, full-featured Ruger LC9 offers the versatility and capability of the popular 9mm cartridge in a highly compact, reliable, and user-friendly pistol.

""On the heels of the overwhelming and on-going success of the LCP®, customers repeatedly requested a lightweight, compact 9mm pistol. Frankly, they wanted an LCP chambered in 9mm"" said Ruger CEO Michael Fifer. ""Delivering an American-made, compact 9mm that provides the same legendary Ruger reliability as the award-winning LCP, LCR® and SR9® became our focus. Meeting customer expectations is our goal and key to Ruger's continuing success,"" Fifer continued.

The LC9 is a double-action-only, hammer-fired, locked-breech pistol with a smooth trigger pull. Control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. The Ruger LC9 features smooth ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing.

One seven-round, single-column magazine is provided with each LC9 pistol. The magazine's standard flat floorplate aids concealability, while the provided finger grip extension floorplate offers an option to shooters who prefer a longer grip surface with more hand-to-pistol contact. Seven-round magazines, holsters and other accessories are available for purchase at ShopRuger.com.

The wider rear aperture of the dovetailed, low-profile, two-dot rear sight aids quick acquisition of the single-dot, dovetailed front sight. This high-visibility, three-dot sight system provides fast, positive sight alignment.

The slide locks open on an empty magazine and the external slide stop is easy to reach and manipulate for positive firearm functioning. A single-sided manual safety and a magazine disconnect are additional features of the Ruger LC9. A California-approved loaded chamber indicator allows for immediate visual and tactile confirmation that the chamber is loaded. A pivoting external extractor provides reliable extraction of the 9mm cases."

The pistol put all 15 rounds from the magazine into the inner ring of a target the size of a dinner plate at 10 yards so it is more accurate than I am. Open to offers, so please just let me know what you have. I can be reached by email or text at REDACTED. Thanks for looking."
