Features:
- M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)
- USGI 1/7 Twist Rates
- USGI 5.56 NATO Chambers
- Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel (CMV)
- Chrome Lined Bore and Chamber
- Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
- USGI Government Profile Barrels
- HPT (High Pressure Test) Barrels
- MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) Barrels
___________________________________________________________________
Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM™) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty.

These are stripped 16"" Mid Length Standard 11595E barrels with gas ports installed and dimpled for a strong gas block installation.

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM barrels.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Also installed is a side folding adapter for the arm brace as well as a detent and midwest industries flash hider. I have also installed a recoil buffer and fresh recoil spring. Also mounted on magpul rails molded into the wooden handguard are MAKO FAB DEFENSE ptk and vts angled foregrip with storage and a hand stop. 

This gun has great build quality unlike some Century products... Check the reviews online. I built this gun for fun, now it is time for a new project. 1 mag (30 rounds) through to check function. The usmachinegun adapter has a much more secure fit than the sb47 brace. You wont find an AK pistol this sweet. I have more pictures if you want them. This is NOT a sbr! It is a sweet pistol."

I would sell a CBC clone of the Remington Nylon 66.  It's a .22 LR and prefers the high or hot loads.  It's tube fed through the rear of the stock.  This is an early edition of the CBC clone when all the material used to make this gun was the same as the original Remington model.
It's great gun to hang in the back of your truck and it needs very little cleaning (might swab out the barrel and spray some Rem. Oil on it once a year.
I am purchase it new.

I am getting older and it's time to move some guns to new owners that can get some use from them.
All CO laws apply.  Buyer pays transfer and background.  I have an FFL, in Highlands Ranch, that will do the transfer and background for $25.00.
Contact Tom at REDACTED or by email.  If interested, let me know and let's see what we can work out.

It's listed under Remington because there's not listing for CBC or other."

CZ 91153 75 SP-01 Tactical 9mm Semi-Auto Pistol with Decocker, Tritium Night Sights, Two 18-round Mags The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72 bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the latest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The CZ 75 SP-01 model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005 s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

The LWRCi Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle is the right tool for when you need to precisely place many rounds on targets at varying distances. The 20 round magazine makes for constant target engagement for multiple threats or targets. The Geissele Automatics trigger is super smooth and light enough for extremely precise shots on target. The spiral fluted barrel really lightens up the swing weight of a 308 carbine making it possible for an effective heavy perimeter defense rifle for law enforcement, or heavy class for three gun.

The side charging handle allows for easy charging of the weapon in the prone position without giving up your shooting position. The Fail Zero coated bolt carrier group and the piston gas system really help the reliability of the 308 based ARs due to the tremendous amount of carbon being expelled while firing a cartridge that has more than double the powder of the 5.56 round. This is problematic for most direct impingement 308 carbines because more carbon gets deposited on the internals.

The smooth hand guard with the modular rail set makes adding white light or bi-pod easy while keeping a smooth profile to assist in marksmanship. The 16"" barrel provides enough velocity to be effective out to 800M and capable to 1000M with the right ammo without being to heavy to quickly deploy like many longer barrel precision rifles. The barrel  process is so effective that you will only wear out this barrel under extreme round counts. It is made of cold hammer forged 41V45 steel alloy and treated with NiCorr™. This is extremely important on 308 based AR because of the heat produced with heavy firing. The 16"" barrel is also a great length to run a suppressor (silencer) because the overall length will be more compact than the 20"" barrel version. Additionally you have an adjustable gas system with a suppressor setting to allow for optimization while suppressed.

Choose the LWRCi  R.E.P.R over a 5.56 carbine if you need more penetration, range, accuracy, a more compact semi auto sniper system (SASS) and the need for more firepower than a bolt action rifle."

Included with the gun is a hard carry case, six round magazine, and all factory literature. The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slide stop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters. The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The lightweight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety. Come check this pistol out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte. Give me a call @ 980-237-eight9eight1 if you have any questions. Shipping can be arranged for $15. Check us out on Facebook @ www.facebook.com/thearmsroomcharlotte or try our website @ www.targuns.com Thanks for looking and have a good day.

I bought it back in November 2004 to celebrate the sunset of Slick Willie's assault weapons ban.  I moved on to the AR-15 platform very soon afterward so this rifle saw very little use by me since then.

Not sure of the round count but it's well under the 200-round break-in period suggested by Armalite (http://www.armalite.com/images/Manuals%5C180bman.pdf).  I'd say probably 60-90 total rounds fired, if I had to guess.

This rifle can still out-shoot most basic AR-15s with its average of about 1.5 MOA accuracy, using factory ammo.  

Also the AR-180b uses STANDARD/STANAG AR-15/M-16 magazines, the same as any other AR-15 pattern rifle.

They don't make the AR-180b anymore so if you're interested, get it while you can!

Comes with:

Two-point nylon sling
One 20-rd AR-15 pmag
One 30-rd steel GI M-16 mag

I have a like new M&P Shield 9mm for sale with a few extra's.  The Shield was bought in March of this year and I've put less than 200 rds through it.  The only reason I'm selling is because I'm 6'7"" and after firing the first 100 rds through the gun, I realized that my gigantic hands and small thin frame don't get along to well.  Basically my hands are too big for the gun.  Included with the gun:

Ameriglo Trijicon I-dot Night Sights
Two 8rd Mags, One 7rd Mag with Pierce extension
KT-Mech IWB Kydex Holster
KT-Mech OWB Kydex Mag Holder
Talon Gun Grips on the frame of the gun and bottom of all the mags
All Mags loaded with Federal HST rounds and Hornady Critical Duty rounds + leftover box
Factory 3-dot sights
Original box with barrel lock, 1st round fired, manual etc...

Together this package cost me over $600 to piece together, including the price of the gun.  It conceals great, shoots awesome, and functions perfectly.  After putting rounds down range, it just doesn't feel good to me anymore.  Looking to get $540 OR BEST OFFER for the whole package.  I AM NOT going to split the package up!!

The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Come check this pistol out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte. Give me a call @ 980-237-eight9eight1 if you have any questions. Shipping can be arranged for $20. Check us out on Facebook @ www.facebook.com/thearmsroomcharlotte or try our website @ www.targuns.com Thanks for looking and have a good day."

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle. The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots."

Included with the P-11 is a hard carry case, 10 round magazine, lock, and all factory literature. 

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. 

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.

Come check this pistol out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte. Give me a call @ 980-237-eight9eight1 if you have any questions. Shipping can be arranged for $15.

The PWS MK107 Pistol was developed for those who desire the MK110 rifle, but cannot possess a short-barreled rifle. The short, compact design retains lethal capability out to 300 meters and has been proven highly effective with very little sacrifice over a standard rifle.

As the only piston-driven pistol on the market today that was designed from the ground up as a 7 platform, the PWS MK110 pistol is a dream come true for those looking for the shortest possible package and the reliability of a full-size rifle. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long-stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 10"" handguard and free-floated barrel.
The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS Enhanced Buffer Tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The pistol is rounded out with industry-leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, and MBUS2 sights.

Simmons 3-9X40 scope in good condition. There are prettier rigs out there but this one will put a hole through a dime just fine in the right hands.

Priced as one sale, I'm not parting it out.  considering $20 for the scope, $400 for the rifle, and $60 for the ammo. That's $480. So when I ask $450, I'm not budging much. This is not a high-mileage rifle. If you wanted to take a deer a year, this piece will keep you hunting for generations. 

To go to the store you'd pay about $110 for the ammo, $50 scope and $450 for the rifle. $600+ before tax. The value of this gun for your money is based solely on how you take care of it. Guns retain resale value better over decades than cars retain over months. Take care of it and you'll always get out of it about the same as you put in. 

.270 is the standard against which all other hunting rifles for any game smaller than an elk are measured. The best part is, it's a great round for low-recoil and so this can be your first rifle. It's not how much lead you put in your target, it's where you place the round that drops the game. i've had to search for a deer I hit in both lungs with a 30-06 before. You don't need a cannon, you need to mark the heart on the first shot. This rifle marks the target like the sun rises; you can count on it day after day. 

There's nothing about shooting this gun I don't like, not that I've shot it all. But for the price you get a very good value. I'm only selling it as I no longer get into the woods very often and I'm paying on 2 vehicles so this helps me take a breather for a month."
