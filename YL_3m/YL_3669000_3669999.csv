Never had any FTF FTE, this gun is very accurate and the low height over bore axis of the pistol slide gives it minimal recoil for the .40 cal.  This comes with the complete package of the original box and paper works, a IMI serpa type holster that will hold the pistol and an extra magazine, and 4 mags all together.  It does have night sights but they need replacement because the tritium is out on the front sight and the rear is getting dim.  Exterior is in a like new condition, the coating is flawless, the interior has minimum wear and the bore is shiny.  Not interested in trade, cash only and I am firm on the price, you can do your research on the package, you won't find a better deal; if you do you better get it.

The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

Only trade I am interested in at the moment are any scopes that have the Horus Reticle in them, like the bushnell elite tactical 3.5-21x50 g2dmr.  Also the EBR stock from Sage for the M14/M1A rifles.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

I put uncle mike sling swivels and a black hawk sling on it. All photos are from the internet so if you want real pictures just let me know and I will send you some. Will come with gun sock if the price stays relatively close to what I want or if I trade. Would rather have the cash though but I am in no need of money so don't try to lowball me.

Browning's AB3 Composite Stalker gives you legendary A-Bolt accuracy and performance in a value-packed platform. The AB3 Stalker combines a matte blued finish barreled action with a rugged matte black synthetic stock to create a high-performance hunting rifle that won’t blow a hole your budget.


• Button-rifled barrel is triple-checked for straightness and interior finish and then air-gauged to ensure a consistent diameter throughout the bore’s length.

• Every AB3 barrel is individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace.
• The barrel’s target-type Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.
• The free-floating barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the barrel to perform consistently and accurately and reach its full accuracy potential.
• The receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mounts using two 8-40 screws for each base to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform.
• The AB3’s unique integrated trigger design provides a crisp 3½-pound pull that ""breaks like glass.""
• The generous trigger guard opening allows easy access, even when wearing gloves.
• A robust, precision-machined standard-length steel action allows you to mount your scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between the bore centerline and the optical centerline.
• The fast 60° bolt lift keeps your thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
• The bolt body is plated with matte electroless nickel for smother operation and added corrosion resistance.
• The Bolt Unlock Button allows you to unload the chamber with the safety in the on-safe position for an added margin of safety.
• The top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. You can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
• The detachable staggered box magazine has a rugged formed steel body and feed lips for added durability, plus a tough polymer baseplate and shoulder that’s designed to stop the forward movement of the cartridges. This helps prevent recoil-induced bullet tip deformation and bullet setback in the cartridge case.
• Magazine capacity is 3 rounds in magnum calibers, and 4 rounds in standard calibers.
• The innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from your face when firing to reduce felt recoil and flinching.
• A durable matte blued steel finish on all external surfaces minimizes reflection and provides resistance to corrosion.
• The rugged synthetic stock with molded-in matte black color and textured gripping surfaces can stand up to virtually anything you (or Mother Nature) can dish out.
• Steel sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling or bipod.

The pics are attached. The scope is nothing special, just a Vortex. I'm sure I have the original box somewhere. I bought it from a dealer in Arizona and there had only been a few rounds fired through it. I have only put about 20 rounds through it using the iron sights. I still haven't zeroed in the optics, which are new and pretty much never used. 

I'm basically selling it because I'm jobless, have four kids and a wife and have bills to pay. I wouldn't be selling it if I didn't have to. The pictures show what the rifle comes with. The only thing not pictured is the laser bore sight I have in to help sight in the optics. You can have that too. The picture shows: 

1.) Carrying Case with multiple pockets
2.) Iron Sights
3.) Two survival knives. The black one has a hollow handle and carries a compass, matches, etc...
4.) 4 Ten Round Mags
5.) Cleaning Pad
6.) Cleaning Kit
7.) Cleaning Oil
8.) Solar Flash Light
9.) Two carrying straps, One shoulder and One tactical
10.) Several hundred rounds of various ammo and ammo can. 
11) A bunch of paperwork the rifle came with. 

I think I'm asking $2,500 for the rifle, so the only thing I'd be willing to take in trade would maybe be a revolver valued at around $500-ish to knock the price down to $2,000. I have a concealed carry permit and need a good revolver to carry."

Two 12 round magazines and TRU DOT Tritium factory night sights ($107 addl’ when new). 

This is “Version1/2”- This rarer version of the USP Compact came from the factory with the identical left hand/right hand ambidextrous control lever ($50+ part) and is SA/DA with manual thumb safety and de-cocker.  The firearm is totally ambidextrous for equal left hand or right hand tactics.  Fantastic tactical or target weapon loaded with features for CCW and it's in incredible shape.

Wikipedia explains the action better than I:  
The first USP Compact models appeared in 1994. These are scaled-down USPs, and are available in all the same cartridges as the full size version, and additionally the .357 SIG.[1] Due to the smaller size of the frame, magazines for the Compact variant may have a handgrip extension to better accommodate the shooter's hand. Standard flat floorplates are also available for the USP Compact magazines. The USP Compact comes standard with a bobbed hammer equipped with a flat rubber external thumb grip. This reduces possible snag from the hammer on a holster or clothing while the pistol is being drawn, but still allows the USP Compact to be cocked from a decocked position even in the absence of a spurred hammer. This can be done since decocking the weapon does not fully drop the hammer, leaving it in a somewhat ""half-cocked"" state. However, the USP Compact cannot be cocked from a dry-fired position as the hammer will be flush to the back of the slide, although the operator could pull the trigger approximately halfway back in a dry-fired position to put the hammer in a half-cocked state, allowing the hammer to be fully cocked with the thumb. A spurred hammer, similar to the one that comes standard on the P10 can be installed onto the USP Compact. USP Compact models lack the mechanical recoil reduction system of the larger full sized USP pistols. Instead, a more compact recoil buffering system is composed of a polymer bushing, around the captive recoil spring, which is designed to absorb energy at the end of the slide's travel rearward. This polymer bushing, with an estimated lifespan of around 20,000 rounds, is used instead of the double spring/captive recoil spring/guide rod found in the full sized USP.

I'm not going to do that.  These boxes are available for $20 each or $35 for both of them.

If someone is interested in all of it, I would consider some flexibility on the prices.

This is the sale of 2 boxes of ammo.  It's not going to break the bank if I don't sell them.    I'm not interested driving all over creation to link up with a buyer.  I do travel around central Ohio, so there are frequent opportunities to execute a transaction somewhere other than where I am during the day.

As this is handgun ammo, it is available to those who are over 21 only.  I also ask that, if you are not eligible to own a firearm, don't put me in the morally and legally compromised position by asking me to sell to you."

825,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3669825,For Sale:  Super Dynamic 3 Gun (SD-3G) Trigger at Ventura Munitions,"SW Corner of Russell and Valley View, Las Vegas, Nevada",$ 260,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 14, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Geissele Super 3 Gun (SD-3) trigger is a semi-automatic derivative of the two-stage Super Select-Fire (SSF) combat trigger that Geissele Automatics has developed for customers in the U.S. Special Operations Community. In semi-automatic mode, the SSF performs like a match-grade two-stage trigger that allows precise and accurate trigger control that is ideally suited for engaging demanding medium and long range targets. In fully-automatic mode, where threats are generally encountered at close range and under extreme time pressure, the SSF performs like a single-stage trigger with a smooth, continuous trigger pull. 

 The Geissele Super 3 Gun trigger has a super short trigger pull and a short reset so that rounds can be sent downrange as quickly as possible while still maintaining superb accuracy. The shortened trigger pull combined with a lightning-quick reset gives this trigger a unique, hybrid trigger pull that is a cross between a traditional two-stage and single stage trigger while at the same time retaining the safety and robustness of the trigger design. The result is a superb, well-balanced trigger that is ideal for high-volume, accurate fire. An S3G-equipped rifle enables the shooter to engage targets more quickly and more accurately than with any other trigger/rifle combination available today. In fact, field tests have shown that the SD-3 can routinely and accurately deliver up to twelve shots on target in an amazing 1.6-1.9 seconds. 

 A description of the S3G pull: 

 1) The shooter starts pulling the trigger as his sights become aligned on target.

 2) At about 3-1/2 lbs., the trigger starts to move back smoothly, like it's on ball bearings.

 3) After the trigger moves a short distance, the weapon discharges. Nothing precedes the discharge: no second stage stop, no grittiness, no stacking of the trigger pull weight as the hammer is cammed down like on a stock AR15 trigger. The trigger finger feels a sensation of walking along a perfectly flat, glassy-smooth plateau that suddenly drops away.

 4) After a short overtravel, the trigger is quickly reset when the shooter slightly relaxes his trigger finger and the next shot is ready to be fired without having to go back to the beginning of the trigger pull cycle. 

Type: Single Stage 
1st Stage Weight: 4.0lbs 
2nd Stage Weight: N/A 
Total Pull Weight: 4.0lbs. (3.25lbs. or 4.0lbs depending on spring) 
Adjustable: No 
Recommended Use: 3 Gun 
Pin Size: Mil-Spec 

All weights are approximates.


The Geissele Super Dynamic 3 Gun (SD3G) trigger is the flat trigger bow version of the Geissele Super 3 Gun (S3G) trigger.




Item Number: 05-166 

Availability: Out of stock

Note: The SD3G trigger has a very short, light pull and reset. We do not recommend it for duty use, bench rest, accuracy work or shooting small groups. It is designed for close course competition use where rapid target engagement with quick follow up shots are required

This is a One owner 2004 Kia optima EX, 4 cylinder with roughly160k miles. 

The good:
Heat, a/c, stereo, power windows and accessories all work.
New tires within the last 6 months
Timing belt replaced 10k miles ago
Alternator replaced 8 months ago
Interior is in clean condition with no rips or tears

The bad:
It has some cosmetic front end damage due to a deer strike (see pics)
A few dings and paint is fading in a few areas
Fog lights broken
Driver door trim needs to be re-attached (included. See pics)
The most significant thing wrong with it is the crank shaft sensor needs to be replaced. It is broken and causes the car to randomly shut off while driving. Some times it starts right back up, sometimes not. the last time it happened I had to have it towed home. It is a $20 part, but requires 4-5 hours of labor to replace. I don't have the time or facilities to do it myself. For this reason, no test drives and I highly recommend towing it or having it towed if you purchase it. However, you can hear the engine run.

Aside from that, it has been a reliable and fuel efficient (28 mpg highway) daily driver.

Private party kbb in ""fair"" condition says $2700, I am just looking to get rid of it. So $1500

Email is the best way to get a hold of me.
Thanks,

I am the second owner. I've put 100-150 rounds through it and that is probably pretty generous, new kid, have only had it out twice, bringing the total to 400-450. 

Gun is in excellent shape, I've never carried it, shoots well, night sights are super bright. My hands are quite large and this gun is deceptively thin for a double stack 45. Its just not a good fit for me based on where my trigger finger contacts the trigger. With the exception of that its extremely comfortable to hold, handles well, points well, etc. The gun is more accurate than I can be and groups well. 

Gun comes with the factory case and literature as well as 2-10 round magazines that are labeled for a P227 and a 10 round magazine labeled for a P250, it fits fine, the base plate has two tabs that were ground off so that the magazine locks securely, dimensions are identical everywhere else.

Will need to see your LTCH and DL, no info recorded. Not interested in shipping, if I can avoid it.

Please no trades unless you have a Glock 21 SF or a GP100 that you are interested in adding cash with."
