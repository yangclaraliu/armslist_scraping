It has come to my attention from a fewer other guys that frequent this site, that there are one or two guys here in mobile that are building uppers with Ptac parts, sometimes putting a nice rail on there, then selling them as ""factory"", or sometimes claiming they are much nicer brands.
I do not have any info on them, but I just wanted to give everyone a heads up. If you don't know how to distenguish between brands and/or if it's ""home build"" or not, do some research or find someone who does know.  Don't lose a ton of money on sh**ty parts."

If you wish you can pay the shipper (MAIL DOCK) directly via credit card by phone so that you know you're paying the exact shipping costs and I'm not padding the bill. You're getting a rifle that has roughly 300 rounds through it and has been well cared for. You're also getting roughly $300 in extras at no cost to you. This rifle is priced well below retail so as it is and no low ball offers or trades are welcome. Bottom line is I need cash and this will be first come, first served.

I need this gone ASAP. Thanks!"

I sold off all of my 7.62 x 39 and switched to 5.56. I now need the money for other reasons. Literally everything I have is brand new and has never been to the range. It's been sitting in my safe for the past 2 weeks since I made the switch. I can't sell it for retail price even if it is new, which is why I knocked the prices down. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask, I'm willing to wheel and deal a bit. Thanks.

I sold off all of my 7.62 x 39 and switched to 5.56. I now need the money for other reasons. Literally everything I have is brand new and has never been to the range. It's been sitting in my safe for the past 2 weeks since I made the switch. I can't sell it for retail price even if it is new, which is why I knocked the prices down. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask, I'm willing to wheel and deal a bit. Thanks.

I sold off all of my 7.62 x 39 and switched to 5.56. I now need the money for other reasons. Everything I have is brand new and has never been to the range. It's been sitting in my safe for the past 2 weeks since I made the switch. I know can't sell it back for retail prices even if it is new, which is why I knocked the prices down. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask, I need the money so please don't offer trades. Thanks.

Introducing the SIG556xi, rewriting the standard for modularity, reliability, and performance for the modern rifle platform. 

Based on the legendary SG 550, the SIG556xi will change the way military, law enforcement, and responsible citizens look at adaptable rifles. Utilizing the time-tested rotating bolt and adjustable gas piston operating system, the SIG556xi allows operators a choice of caliber, barrel length, handguard/stock configurations and lower receivers. 

A removable barrel allows the operator to select the necessary length for a given mission. Adding the appropriate bolt, the SIG556xi can be changed to any of three calibers, 5.56x45mm NATO, 300 Blackout, and 7.62x39mm NATO. Users can also quickly change out the non-serialized lower receiver, allowing the use of either AR-style STANAG magazines or rock-and-lock AK-style magazines. The SIG556xi upper receiver is the serialized part, making the lower an easy to purchase part. 

Polymer handguards accept all Magpul® light and rail kits, while the aluminum and carbon fiber handguards accept 2”, 4”, and 6” M1913 rails. Barrels are available in 10”, 14.5”, and 16”. Truly ambidextrous, the SIG556xi features an ambi safety selector, magazine release and user swappable charging handle (right- or left-handed). Optional receiver end plates allow for the use of either AR receiver extension tubes and buttstocks or M1913 compatible stocks"

I will also include two boxes of 20 Federal Hydra-Shok jacketed hollow points as well as a very basic, inexpensive pocket holster (that's surprisingly effective).

There were a few spots of missing blue on the trigger plate, possibly from a few drops of blood, and some fine scratches on the barrels from what I assumed was from use in the field. The buttstock and forend wood were and still are just about perfect and needed no attention at all.

After about six weeks, Lou in the gun room at Connecticut Shotgun sent the gun back to me. His work on it was exceptional. It hasn't been fired since.

The length of the raised matted rib barrels is 28 inches. The left barrel is choked WS-2 and the right WS-1. The front sight is a Bradley red bead and the middle is the 94B Winchester white metal sight. The safety is non-automatic. The trigger is gold plated. The ejection is selective. Bore diameters by my CPS bore gauge are .616 for both barrels. The choke constriction on the left barrel measures just shy of .602 and the right comes in at .603 so in fact, the chokes run closer to modified. Quoting from Schwing's book on the 21 regarding chokes, it states on page 95 ""Where constriction was slight, in the case of Winchester Skeet #1 and Winchester Skeet #2, choke diameter would vary with the bore.""

The stock is the straight English style with the later Diamond pattern checkering on the slim beavertail forend. DAC is 1 5/8ths of an inch and DAH is 2 inches. LOP is 14 inches to the center of the checkered butt. The cast is neutral and the overall length is 44 and 5/8ths. It has ""select nice wood"" and a ""medium comb - leaning to the thin side"". Although the gold oval name plate is supposed to be engraved with the owner's initials according to the build sheet, there are no initials present. The oval is still slightly proud of the stock, so I think that he must have changed his mind about that. Weight is approximately 6 and 1/2 pounds. 

I'm not a dealer but I can go through a local dealer if needed at an additional cost to cover his transfer fee. The gun will be carefully packaged and shipped in a hard case. 

One like this doesn't come along often. I have been very careful to represent this desirable 21 as accurately as possible. As stated previously, this gun was reblued and serviced by Connecticut Shotgun and has not been fired since. It is in perfect working order if you choose to actually shoot it."

This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times and you’re buying 9, and so on. Winning buyer may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. The old model Browning B.A.R. Semi-auto Sporting rifles were such good guns that there are literally tens of thousands of them still in service, and there will be during most of our shoppers’ lifetimes. Here is the standard factory Magazine for those most powerful Magnum chambered B.A.R. Rifles, the .338 Winchester Magnum. These are brand new, never opened or chambered factory Browning Magazines in their factory packages just like they shipped from the factory some 10 years ago when Browning discontinued the magazines. These magazines are not for the later Safari Mark II models with the bolt release lever; they are only for the Belgian and Belgian/Portuguese original B.A.R. Sporters manufactured from 1967 until 1993 which do not have an external bolt release lever. These magazines will hold 3 rounds of .338 Winchester Magnum caliber cartridges. We are unclear as to whether these will work reliably in the 7mm Remington Magnum and .300 Magnum guns; but we have magazines available for those caliber BARs in stock at press time. Replacement pricing nowadays, if a person can even find One of these, is upwards of $75 apiece. Our single magazine price is $35.00. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $23 each. Own 3 for only $69.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

I found it here in Tucson in August of 2006. The previous owner was selling this 20 gauge Skeet model and an original Model 21 Skeet model in 410 bore, both of which were left to him by his father. The father bought both guns from the original owner here in Tucson on December 16th, 1976. The original owner had ordered both 21's through Mathews & Boucher in Rochester, New York on February 7th, 1952. The guns were built to his specifications and finally arrived at Mathews & Boucher where they transferred to the original owner on September 24th, 1952.

Once I took possession of the gun, I decided to send it to Connecticut Shotgun in New Britain, Connecticut to have the barrels and receiver reblued. There were a few spots of missing blue on the trigger plate, possibly from a few drops of blood, and some fine scratches on the barrels from what I assumed was from use in the field. The buttstock and forend wood were and still are just about perfect and needed no attention at all.

After about six weeks, Lou in the gun room at Connecticut Shotgun sent the gun back to me. His work on it was exceptional. It hasn't been fired since.

The length of the raised matted rib barrels is 28 inches. The left barrel is choked WS-2 and the right WS-1. The front sight is a Bradley red bead and the middle is the 94B Winchester white metal sight. The safety is non-automatic. The trigger is gold plated. The ejection is selective. Bore diameters by my CPS bore gauge are .616 for both barrels. The choke constriction on the left barrel measures just shy of .602 and the right comes in at .603 so in fact, the chokes run closer to modified. Quoting from Schwing's book on the 21 regarding chokes, it states on page 95 ""Where constriction was slight, in the case of Winchester Skeet #1 and Winchester Skeet #2, choke diameter would vary with the bore.""

The stock is the straight English style with the later Diamond pattern checkering on the slim beavertail forend. DAC is 1 5/8ths of an inch and DAH is 2 inches. LOP is 14 inches to the center of the checkered butt. The cast is neutral and the overall length is 44 and 5/8ths. It has ""select nice wood"" and a ""medium comb - leaning to the thin side"". Although the gold oval name plate is supposed to be engraved with the owner's initials according to the build sheet, there are no initials present. The oval is still slightly proud of the stock, so I think that he must have changed his mind about that. Weight is approximately 6 and 1/2 pounds. 

I'm not a dealer but I can go through a local dealer if needed at an additional cost to cover his transfer fee. The gun will be carefully packaged and shipped in a hard case. 

One like this doesn't come along often. I have been very careful to represent this desirable 21 as accurately as possible. As stated previously, this gun was reblued and serviced by Connecticut Shotgun and has not been fired since. It is in perfect working order if you choose to actually shoot it."

Restrictions apply on higher capacity magazines in some parts of the United States, so please read this entire ad carefully before offering to buy. This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of additional magazines we have on hand at the same per-mag price and no extra shipping. Here are genuine factory Glock magazines to fit the Model 23 Compacts in .40 S&W Caliber. They will also fit the model 27 with extra capacity but some protrusion; and of course they work just fine in the small and midsize Glock 32 and 33 chambered in .357 Sig caliber since the case heads are the same for the two calibers. These magazines free-fall like they’re supposed to; lock the slide back like they’re supposed to; and most important, feed reliably. Construction is classic polymer body with steel inner lining, and visible loading ports so the operator can check round count. Replacement pricing on these in our area is upwards of $40 apiece, and many times they’re hard to come by even at those prices. Our Single Mag price is $35.00. We’re offering these excellent magazines, however, in lots of 3 or more at only $26 each. Own 3 for only $78.00. Not for sale to civilian residents of California, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, or any other jurisdiction where 13 round magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement only. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

Optic is a Leupold Mark AR MOD 1 3-9x40mm mounted in a Larue SPR-E (reversed) mount. Mil-dot Reticle, zeroed in so far. 

It comes with 9+ 20 rd. mags, I know for sure that 7 are Checkmate, with a couple still in the wrappers, others are various manufacturers, I'd have to gather them all up to see how many in total. 

It's just an awesome rifle. I haven't really gotten a chance to take it long range and see what she can do, but the groups I was getting @ 100 yds were impressive. 

It's getting to where I can't really afford to shoot .308 like I want, and just seeing if anyone is interested in a fully built rifle. Not dying to sell it, but she should get more use instead of sitting in my safe. 

Only trades I would be interested in are an Eotech XPS + cash, or an nice Aimpoint + cash. Would also consider Glock 9mm guns + cash.  
(I put it as a Norinco, because Polytech isn't an option. Both are the chinese M14s, with the forged receivers)

So here we have a Benelli M2 12 gauge tactical semi-auto with a Sure Cycle 3-round extension magazine tube and Brownell sling ring (still in bag). With the extension you have 8 shots of 2 3/4"", more if you ghost load and this gun is so fast you empty that mag in just a couple seconds. These bad boys run $1200 on gunbroker (and that's without the extension!) but will take the first $900 that's coming through the door on this one and cry myself to sleep tonight as I hold my beard. Be advised there are small scratches on the mag tube from the sling bracket and its a little dusty overall, but that stuff wipes off. Have put about 100 rounds through it without a single hickup. 

This is probably the best deal on a home defense/3-gun scattergun you will come across this year. 

I know you may have trades you are just looking to get rid of, but I really need the cash on this. However, will consider partial trades along with cash, but its still gonna have to be mostly cash. Can meet in Gulfport at Barnes and Noble for face to face. Will not ship. Will not drive all over the world. Sorry.

This is a full power 10MM load that is within SAAMI spec and is thus safe for use in ANY/ALL 10mm pistols. Loading this long-for-weight all copper bullet in the 10MM case, causes powder capacity limitations that we do not experience with shorter/heavier lead alloy bullets and thus our advertised 1500 fps velocity cannot be reached, regardless of how may internal ballistics charts tell us that we should be able to launch a 155gr. bullet @ 1500 fps from a 5 inch barrel, that long light weight bullet simply uses too much of the available case capacity to do so. See our below real world velocities fired from real world pistols, not extra long laboratory barrels, that give false high velocity readings. With Buffalo Bore ammo, you’ll achieve the velocity reading we advertise in the real world where it matters when your life and the lives of your loved ones may hang in the balance.

1455 fps - Custom 1911 with Nowlin 5 inch barrel
1429 fps - Colt Delta Elite, 5 inch barrel
1401 fps - Glock Mod 20,  4.6 inch barrel
If you are firing this 10MM ammo from an auto loader and are experiencing high extreme velocity spreads, it is not the ammo. Full power 10MM ammunition has always generated enough pressure to require a pretty stiff recoil spring in your handgun—this of course depends on many variables like your particular slide weight, etc. When the cartridge fires, it generates enough pressure/recoil to prematurely open your breech face in some guns. When this happens, the opening breech has an effect on the burn rate of the powder. This can result in some fairly high extreme velocity spreads. If you are experiencing extreme velocity spreads (in excess of 50 fps) simply install a stiffer recoil spring. For example, I have an original Colt Delta Elite. This Colt, with the factory spring runs extreme spreads of about 35 fps, with this load. I am happy with an ES of 35 fps, so I leave the Delta spring alone. My custom built Para Ordinance 1911, with a Nowlin barrel, runs extreme spreads of about 70 fps, so I installed a recoil spring that was roughly 4 lbs heavier and the extreme spread dropped to about 35 fps. (Wolff Gun Springs—REDACTED-- www.gunsprings.com ) My Glock mod 20 was running extreme spreads of nearly 100 fps, so I installed a 6 lb heavier recoil spring and brought the ES down to 50 fps. The folks at Wolff will tell you what the factory spring rating is for your particular pistol, so you’ll know where to start. I should note, these high ES #'s really don’t matter in the real world as they do not affect accuracy or reliability. The firearms industry fixed this ES problem by watering down 10MM ammo, to the point that most 10MM ammo made by major manufacturers is pretty weak, but it does not open your breech face early…... If weak ammo is the “fix” you want, most any 10MM ammo made by major manufacturers will do. If you wish to shoot our full power 10MM ammo, you can choose to live with the high ES (you’ll only know if you are getting high ES #’s if you use a chronograph) or you can install a stiffer recoil spring.

This load was accurate and reliable in our three test pistols."

But for that I'll have to sell some stuff that I've grown attached to. 

So here we have a World War II era Russian Mosin-Nagant Izh M1891/30 3.5x PU sniper rifle with Molot made military scope and correct 'dog collar' sling. 

Scope: Magnification, x3.5m   Lens diameter, mm 22,  Field of view, degree 4.5°,  Exit pupil, mm 6,  Eye relief, mm 72,  Reticle type 3 post,  Operating temperature, °F -48° to +122°,  Length, in 6.1"",  Weight w/o rifle mount, oz 5.2,  Weight w/ steel rifle mount, oz 20.2 t was robust and  extremely effective; its  metal body, thick lenses, tough mechanism and firm mount allowed the scope to withstand uncommonly rough conditions. The scope and mount is made in Eastern Europe by the original factories, to the original spec. 

All matching (force matched) serials.

Price is $500 and is worth that all day, here's why: 

The last base price on the I/O import was $539 http://www.impactguns.com/inter-ordnance-m9130-pu-sniper-mosin-nagantwscope-762x54r-5rd-gmosi0021.aspx  but they have been out of stock for some time and likely will not come in again.  Note Molot still makes these guns new http://www.molot.biz/product-e/ko91-30.php but since Kalashnikov owns Molot and the company is now under sanctions, you can bet any of these guns remaining wont be shipped into the US in the future, so grab this working collectable while you still can. 

The lace on cheek-pad is for a left-handed shooter (I'm a southpaw, don't hate) but you can take it off if you want, etc) 

I know you may have trades you are just looking to get rid of, but I really need the cash on this. However, will consider partial trades along with cash, but its still gonna have to be mostly cash.
