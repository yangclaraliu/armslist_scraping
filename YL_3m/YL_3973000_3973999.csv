This assembly is legally a pistol, so an FFL is required for interstate transfers. This pistol is Not C&R Eligible. FFLs and gunsmiths, and even gun tinkerers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-assembly price, and with no additional shipping charges. About five years ago, our neighbors at Tennessee Guns in Knoxville brought in a couple containers full of CZ-82 pistols from service with the Czech Federal Police. All of those are completely out of the distribution channels, and we happen to have some pretty nice CZ-82 pistols left. Here, however, is one parts guns that we extracted some parts from. We intended to take their barrels off and sell them, but this one’s barrel is squibbed 1/2 inch forward of its chamber, note the swell that is obvious in the photos; and besides, the barrel both pressed and pinned into the frame. Removal of the barrel will require the services of a competent gunsmith, and we are neither competent nor gunsmiths. Manufacturer, of course, is CZ of the Czech Republic, Czeska Zbrojovka of Strakonice, Czech Republic. It was manufactured in 1987 for duty with the Czech State Police. Importer is TGI Knoxville. Most specimens had TGI stamping on the bottom of their slides, GA search terms CZ82 Slide Robertson. Construction is entirely steel, blued finish on the barrel surfaces and semi-gloss black finish on the frame. Barrel length is 3 3/4 inches; and the barrel is polygonal bore like their Heckler & Koch rivals. Caliber is 9mm Makarov, 9x18; these pistols will also chamber .380 ACP ammunition with the correct barrel installed. It will not chamber and fire standard 9mm Luger. Weight on this assembly, after all, is only 8 3/4 ounces. Finished CZ82 pistols hold a standard 12 shot magazine, with 10 rounders available direct from CZ-USA. Surface detractions on this is moderate, with slide bushing contact whitening on the barrels and holster wear on the frames. We rate it as Good, and the photo specimens are representative. Replacement pricing on this assembly will run upwards of $200, and CZ USA doesn’t even offer them this way. Parts, however, are readily available from CZ USA and from a whole host of parts dealers including Midwest Shooters, Numrich / Gun Parts, and Brownells, to name a few.

This is a full power 10MM load that is within SAAMI spec and is thus safe for use in ANY/ALL 10mm pistols. Loading this long-for-weight all copper bullet in the 10MM case, causes powder capacity limitations that we do not experience with shorter/heavier lead alloy bullets and thus our advertised 1500 fps velocity cannot be reached, regardless of how may internal ballistics charts tell us that we should be able to launch a 155gr. bullet @ 1500 fps from a 5 inch barrel, that long light weight bullet simply uses too much of the available case capacity to do so. See our below real world velocities fired from real world pistols, not extra long laboratory barrels, that give false high velocity readings. With Buffalo Bore ammo, you’ll achieve the velocity reading we advertise in the real world where it matters when your life and the lives of your loved ones may hang in the balance.

1455 fps - Custom 1911 with Nowlin 5 inch barrel
1429 fps - Colt Delta Elite, 5 inch barrel
1401 fps - Glock Mod 20,  4.6 inch barrel
If you are firing this 10MM ammo from an auto loader and are experiencing high extreme velocity spreads, it is not the ammo. Full power 10MM ammunition has always generated enough pressure to require a pretty stiff recoil spring in your handgun—this of course depends on many variables like your particular slide weight, etc. When the cartridge fires, it generates enough pressure/recoil to prematurely open your breech face in some guns. When this happens, the opening breech has an effect on the burn rate of the powder. This can result in some fairly high extreme velocity spreads. If you are experiencing extreme velocity spreads (in excess of 50 fps) simply install a stiffer recoil spring. For example, I have an original Colt Delta Elite. This Colt, with the factory spring runs extreme spreads of about 35 fps, with this load. I am happy with an ES of 35 fps, so I leave the Delta spring alone. My custom built Para Ordinance 1911, with a Nowlin barrel, runs extreme spreads of about 70 fps, so I installed a recoil spring that was roughly 4 lbs heavier and the extreme spread dropped to about 35 fps. (Wolff Gun Springs—REDACTED-- www.gunsprings.com ) My Glock mod 20 was running extreme spreads of nearly 100 fps, so I installed a 6 lb heavier recoil spring and brought the ES down to 50 fps. The folks at Wolff will tell you what the factory spring rating is for your particular pistol, so you’ll know where to start. I should note, these high ES #'s really don’t matter in the real world as they do not affect accuracy or reliability. The firearms industry fixed this ES problem by watering down 10MM ammo, to the point that most 10MM ammo made by major manufacturers is pretty weak, but it does not open your breech face early…... If weak ammo is the “fix” you want, most any 10MM ammo made by major manufacturers will do. If you wish to shoot our full power 10MM ammo, you can choose to live with the high ES (you’ll only know if you are getting high ES #’s if you use a chronograph) or you can install a stiffer recoil spring.

This load was accurate and reliable in our three test pistols."

Here is Panther Arms / DPMS’s response to the economical class of AR15 rifles like Smith & Wesson’s MP15 Sport. Manufacturer is D.P.M.S., Defense Procurement Manufacturing Services, simply known as Panther Arms, parent company to Remington Arms. This is Panther Arms’s A-15 Sportical, a modified descendant of the highly popular Colt C-AR, Collapsible AR-15, that evolved into the U.S. Military M-4 carbine. Like the Smith & Wesson Competitor, it does not have a forward bolt assist, but the FBA is usually not necessary for shooters who practice adequate gun hygiene and keep their rifle bores and chambers clean. Furthermore, according to many of our old head veterans, when it gets so bad that one has to use the FBA, one is already down to a single shot. Barrel is 16 inches of full length medium light contour barrel, 18 inches counting the muzzle brake. The Panther 5.56 NATO Sportical, writes the factory correspondents, has a 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with 6 grooves, right hand 1X9 twist, button rifled Lite Contour with A2 flash hider (birdcage) 16 inch barrel, gas operated rotating bolt, and a 8620 steel bolt carrier. The upper receiver features flattop Lo-Pro Extruded. The Upper Receiver made of 6066-T6 aircraft aluminum. The Lower Receiver is made of 7075 T6 aircraft aluminum and feature semi-auto trigger group, aluminum trigger guard, and a aluminum magazine release button. The stock is DPMS Pardus Carbine Stock. The handguards are GlacierGuards oval carbine length with aluminum Delta Ring.

Construction is steel barrel, slide, and working parts fitted into a 7075 lightweight alloy frame. Finish is non glare weather resistant Brunitron.

Safety system consists of an internal firing pin safety to guard against accidental discharge if the pistol is dropped, together with a slide mounted ambidextrous main safety that functions as a decocker.

The first ones, the 2000 series, were excellent guns but incredibly ugly to us. That is not the case with the Beretta PX4 Storm, attest the specimen in the photo. Here are Beretta's headliner remarks: The Px4 features innovative locked breech with rotating barrel system, the light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass, modular grip system, manual safety and standard Picatinny Rail. This specimen is a civilian owned, barely used, traditional double and single action semi-auto. From a resting hammer with safety off, the first shot requires a long smooth pull, and then the hammer stands for single action shooting until the operator fires dry and the breech locks open, or until the operator engages the safety and decocks the pistol. This Storm has a total of two eighteen round high capacity magazines. Barrel is 4 inches; capacity is 17 + 1, sights are three dot fixed, drift adjustable rear. Each PX4 comes in its original box with all its papers and two replacement mainspring housing / backstrap covers that will allow the owner to customize the grip contour. Beretta SKU is JXF9F21. Replacement price on these pistols is well over $700 apiece in our area, if a person can even find one. We're offering this one, however, for only $459.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 17 round magazines are restricted to law enforcement, $40 off but no magazines. 10 Round Magazines are widely available.

Where the CZ75 is all steel and pretty heavy, This L120’s alloy frame renders the gross vehicle weight down from the CZ’s 34 ounces, to 28 ounces empty. Turkish guns are here to stay, and this one is remarkably well executed. It will be a strong, perhaps even fatal, competitor to EAA’s Witness series, because the Witnesses we’ve had will not accept CZ75 magazines. Its price competition to both Baby Eagles and parent CZs themselves will at least make ripples in the market. Design, of course, descends from John M. Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Manufacturer is Samsun Yurt Savunma Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., simply SYS, of Canik, or Janik, Republic of Turkey. Importer is Tri Star of North KC, MO. Type is traditional single and double action blowback semi-automatic. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts all on a lightweight alloy frame. Finish is attractive, durable Hard Chrome. Barrel is 4 1/2 inch 6 groove, with pressed in barrel bushing. Slide to frame fit is excellent, with full contact rail that runs the length of the frame. Sights are classic CZ style three dot configuration, dovetailed rear sight and rivet secured modified partridge front, 6 1/2 inch sight radius with serrated rib on the slide. Hammer is .212 serrated skeleton Commander type, with .312 smooth face combat trigger. Double action pull is hitchy from a resting hammer, but smooth and consistent from the half cock position. Single action pull on the photo specimen measured 6 pounds with moderate felt creep. This pistol has a firing pin safety and main safety for right handed shooters. Lever safety will engage in all three hammer positions: full rest, half cock, and fully cocked for secure carry and single action cocked-and-locked readiness. Trigger guard configuration is SP01 type square serrated front face, and the grip frame is serrated fore and aft. Grip panels are hard grainy polymer with the T Tri Star logo. Magazines furnished are Mec-Gar CZ7517B, not catalogued but produced for Tri-Star exclusively in a bright blue finish. This is an excellent pistol. Fit and finish are excellent. Similar pistols from the parent CZ manufacturer command pricing upwards of $700 apiece. While we expect substantial price increases, we’re nevertheless offering the Tri Star / Canik 55 L120 in the photos, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 359.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, Maryland, or Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 17 round magazines are restricted, we will sub 10 round Baby Eagle [or used 15 round CZ75] magazines for $10 per mag extra, $20 extra for 2 mag sub, or $30 off with no magazines.

It is in great condition for its age, has a few scratches and dings. It retained most of its original bluing. The wood looks great except for a hairline crack just behind the tang which has been repaired (looks professional) in the past. 
Many of these have been butchered to mount scopes, but this one has not. If you choose to add optics, there are stock holes tapped in top for which you can buy a proper scope mount rail.

We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges. The Mossberg model 500 has never been as prestigious as the arch-competitor Remington 870, but it’s just as tried, and just as true. Here is a very attractive specimen from Mossberg’s model 500 Military & Police series. Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Model is 500, Persuader series; factory sku is 50411 or thereabouts. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Construction is steel barrel and working parts all built into an alloy receiver that undercuts the 870 on weight, with durable synthetic stock and traditional synthetic forend. Finish is blued steel with semi gloss black anodized receiver. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 smooth faced combat trigger. Safety is top tang type. Barrel is 3 inch chambered 18 1/2 inch matte blue steel plain bead sight, with .730 vicinity Cylinder Bore muzzle. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, 5+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells. Weight empty is 6 3/4 pounds, with center of gravity at the breech. Buttstock measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch black rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. If this shotgun didn’t have a heat shield, we have added a trench type black polymer heat shield for the barrel, that will be obvious from the photos. This model 500 comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system. It is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or a showgirl at a Firearms Industry trade show. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. This 500 Special Purpose comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. Replacement pricing on mossberg com was well over $400 on this shotgun. We’re offering the Mossberg 500 in the photos, however, or one of its substantially identical mates, for only $ 219.00. Any ammunition showing in any of our photos is Not included. Shipping. $20 flat fee lower 48 states; $60 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground or USPS Priority with full insurance coverage.

It is in very good condition with very minor wear on the barrel hood, and the left thumb safety. It has on SigLite night sights in addition to beautiful rosewood grips. It will also come with an OWB factory holster and hard case. In addition to the factory 6rd mag I have added a 7rd extended mag (which was $40) with pinky rest which makes it much more comfortable at the range. This is a great pistol I have only put 150rds of 115g fmj and 40rds of Speer gold dot 147g jhp down the pipe. This pistol has been well maintained and has had zero non-staged malfunctions so 100% reliable thus far. Its a very nice compact pistol with a great single action trigger which makes it extremely accurate for such a small package. The only reason I'm letting it go is its a bit small for what I like.

I am asking $585 cash or $625 trade value for the package with a meet in the Hendersonville area, I do also get to  the Asheville  area about one to two time a week if that helps.

Pay attention because there's a lot going on here! This will come as a package deal unless otherwise agreed upon during negotiation. It comes complete from the factory with three 16 round magazines, paperwork, spent case, and original hard case. The gun has seen right at 1000 rounds and is in pretty fantastic shape. There is no holster wear as it wasn't a primary carry gun. This gun was cleaned generously after each range session. The barrel is in flawless condition.  Condition will speak for itself when you see it in person. The grips, as you can see in the photos, are stippled. A talented friend of mine did the stippling and he was very consistent with his work across all three straps. It comes with two holsters. The first is an XST G-CODE thigh rig. It was purchased and only used a handful of times. The second holster is an Uncle Mike's owb holster with adjustable tension. (not pictured) The next accessory included in the package deal is an NcStar tac light. It's got a new battery in it and fits perfectly on the rail of this M&P. Now to show you how I've come up with the price...

$400 for the gun w/ case and 3 magazines
  $20 for the thigh rig holster w/ thumb release
  $15 for the Uncle Mike's owb holster

Both my wife and I do however have CCW permits, and are modern gun enthusiasts and like to shoot, so I'd be very interested in trading some of these collectibles for more modern weaponry.  Specifically, Clip style modern handguns.  I'm looking for zombie killers, not collectible show pieces.

222,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3973222,For Sale:  AR15 to PS90 Upper PWA AR57 5.7x28 NIB 16 inch Fluted Barrel Quad Rail 1 FN Magazine $589 + $29,"Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 618,"Listed On: Sunday, July 12, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Seller Stock #: XBAR57LEM

 We cannot ship this to some jurisdictions; please read the entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for ONE upper and ONE magazine. Dealers, collectors, and law enforcement, however, may take any number of extra packages at the same price and with no additional shipping charges. Here is a complete upper that enables owners of AR-15 type rifles to convert their gun into something as good as an FN P-90 rifle, for about 1/3 of the usual cost. This is PW Arms’s AR57 Upper. The receiver and its component rails begin with a single block of Aircraft Grade 7075 T6 aluminum, rated at 83000 PSI strength. The entire upper is precision milled to within .002 tolerance. This upper is well ported for heat dissipation, and comes with an integral picatinny quad-rail system. The assembly process’s final steps include Infused Hard Coat Anodized finish on the alloy, and parkerization on steel surfaces, installation of front and rear sight area picatinny rails. GBQ Parkerizing process ensures finish durability on the steel. Barrel is 16.04 inch 4 channel fluted, free floating with open ended flash suppressor. Rate of twist is 1: 8.5 inches. Bolt is heat treated 4140 chrome alloy parkerized, like the barrel. Receiver and rail block measures just over 17 inches overall length; from the receiver back to the muzzle end, total length is 24 9/16 inches. This upper receiver comes furnished with a 3 5/8 inch Carbine buffer; owners of A2 rifles will need an AR type buffer. The most important feature of this upper, writes the factory, is its reliability. Unlike many other receivers, they continue, there is no gas system to become clogged with carbon or fouling. The chamber stays clean well beyond extended shooting sessions. Simplicity is key, they summarize, with the free sliding bolt being the only moving element. Its easy removal makes maintenance literally a snap. The AR-57 system ejects spent rounds through the lower’s magazine well, another plus. Factory cautions against using non-factory or non-FN magazines; against using reloaded or non-SAAMI approved ammunition. While we have never heard of any of these requiring the receiver to be fitted, that is always a possibility that a buyer needs to be prepared for. While these assemblies do not come furnished with any magazine from the factory, we are including the buyer’s choice of an FN Factory 10 rounder or 50 rounder. We might even have a 30 rounder on hand. Replacement pricing on uppers of this quality and caliber ranges upwards of $1000 per unit in many areas. We’re offering the complete PWA AR-57 Upper with bolt, buffer, and FN Factory Magazine, the ones in the photos or their identical mates for only $ 618.00. FFL not Required, but, Not for sale to civilian residents of Aurora IL, California, Chicago Cook County IL, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or any jurisdiction where AR15 or AR57 Rifles are restricted to Law Enforcement. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where the Upper is legal but 50 round magazines are restricted, we will sub a 30 or 10 shot magazine: includes Colorado and Ohio.

It was advertised as a ""38 Colt"" but is only handwritten on the box.  Assuming that to have meant .38 Long Colt, I purchased the kit.

It isn't. 

The entire conversion kit is for the .38 AMU, a nearly extinct pistol caliber used by the Army Marksmanship Unit.  In order to recoup some of my loss, I'm parting out the kit to anyone who may have use for the components.  The shell plate and the locator buttons can be used to load the .25-20 and .32-20 Winchester rifle calibers as well as the .218 Bee.

The powder funnel is a Dillon ""F"" funnel for most of the .38 caliber pistol bores and is not offered as part of this sale unless requested.  Shell plate, buttons, and box are $25 shipped to your door, entire conversion kit with powder funnel is $35 shipped.  Buyers near the Columbus area may opt to meet in person, I will accept trades for reloading items, let me know what you have."

This is a high quality factory upper professionally built by Seekins. The barrel is Black Nitride / melonite treated which is more accurate and lasts longer than chrome lined. The extremely lightweight 10"" MCSR V2 Keymod rail has a 1.8"" inside diameter to accommodate suppressors. The Seekins adjustable gas block is over $60 alone and offers you complete tuning capabilities (see below).

The first to come with $500 cash takes it. It is brand new, never fired, and price is firm. Or I might trade for a decent 1911, S&W stainless .357 or larger caliber revolver, other quality pistol or revolvers, Mossberg SPX, AK, Mini 14, or ?

*For an additional $125 I can include a $150 Seekins Precision Melonite / Black Nitride full milspec M16 bolt carrier group (shown at the link below) and charging handle if you need them, which is a steal. Or if you prefer I can include a Nickel Boron treated BCG and Nickel Boron treated charging handle by WMD instead for $150. 

http://www.seekinsprecision.com/m16-bolt-carrier-group.html

From the manufacturer:
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block lets you to fine tune your rifle's gas system for smoother cycling and operation. Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.
Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes.

The MCSR V2 rail is comfortable, extremely light weight modular rail system that will work in any situation as well as comfortably fit a suppressor inside the rail. The MCSR V2 was designed to make using a quick mounted suppressor easy to install or remove while inside the rail.
The MCSR V2 rail is designed so that the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions will accept all keymod accessories and have two anti-rotation QD positions per side (6total). The internal dimension has increased to 1.8"" to accommodate most suppressors on the market."

In spite of its light weight, it is rated to withstand the pressure from +P, high-velocity proof-load .38 Special ammunition. The -1 suffix to the model number dates to the first engineering change in 1996 with the introduction of the magnum type reinforced frame. This variant does Not have an internal keyed lock like its 642-2 production mate. Manufacturer and warrantor is Smith & Wesson, 2100 Roosevelt Ave., Springfield, MA. Manufacturer’s sku number is 103810A, so marked on the box, with the letter A stamped onto the frame’s top strap. Construction is stainless steel barrel and cylinder; steel internal parts including hammer, and case colored MIM .312 smooth faced trigger all housed in a coated white alloy frame. Barrel is 1 7/8 inch six groove right hand with integral blade front sight; the frame supplied the fixed notch rear sight. Chambering is .38 Smith & Wesson Special, and .38 Spl +P ammunition interchangeably, 5 round cylinder. As with all Smith & Wesson revolvers, safety system is transfer bar internal hammer block. Grips are factory boot type, with stippled lateral surfaces and groove indention for two fingers.Weight empty is 15 ounces, with center of gravity at the trigger, 17 ounce vicinity loaded. Maximum overall length is 6 1/4 inches from the muzzle to the grip frame curve; 4 1/4 inches high, and with a lateral thickness of only 1.3 inches, comparable to the slide thickness on many semi automatics that are more complicated and less reliable. More than any other firearm, a double action revolver will only fire when its operator intends for it to. Each 642-1 comes in its factory cardboard box with protective wrapper, red factory cable lock, instruction manual, fired brass case, and factory registration card.

The M&P 9mm, writes the factory, features Reinforced polymer chassis, superior ergonomics, ambidextrous controls, and proven safety features. This is the compact size M&P, 3 1/2 inch barrel with integral rail polymer frame and 12+1 rounds of firepower capacity. Chambering is 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. The safety levers are frame mounted. That in addition to the M&P’s basic trigger safety and firing pin safety. Weight empty, no magazine, is 21.7 oz; weight fully loaded will be a bit over 30 ounces. Overall length is 6.7 inches from the muzzle to the grip frame strut; 4 1/4 inch height with a flat plate magazine and 4 3/4 inch height with finger rest magazine. Barrel length is 3 1/2 inches with a 5 3/4 inch sight radius six groove ECM 1:9 rifled bore, good to go on well made lead bullets where German and Austrian pistols are not. Slide is melonite finish stainless steel, 1.2 inches thick.

Sights are dovetailed into the slide, front and rear, in 3 dot configuration.

Each M&P 9 Compact comes with a total of two magazines, one flat plate and one finger rest type.

Where the CZ75 is all steel and pretty heavy, This C55 Shark’s alloy frame renders the gross vehicle weight down from a full size CZ’s 34 ounces, to 26 3/4 ounces empty. Turkish guns are here to stay, and this one is remarkably well executed. It will be a strong, perhaps even fatal, competitor to EAA’s Witness series, because the Witnesses we’ve had will not accept CZ75 magazines. Its price competition to both Baby Eagles and parent CZs themselves will at least make ripples in the market. Design, of course, descends from John M. Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Manufacturer is Samsun Yurt Savunma Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., simply SYS, of Canik, or Janik, Republic of Turkey. Importer and warrantor is Rifles Antiques Relics Express LLC, 229 Buckley, Oxford, NJ 07863, marking as R.Ox.NJ. Type is traditional single and double action blowback semi-automatic. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts all on a lightweight alloy frame. Finish is Hard Chrome, very much like a Satin Nickel finish. Barrel is 3 7/8 inch 6 groove 1:16 right hand rifling, with full length steel guide rod and pressed in barrel bushing. Chambering is 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Credible test reports show that this Canik pistol will digest any 9mm ammunition, including the Brown Bear Steel Case Russian rounds in the photos that are not included. Slide to frame fit is excellent, with full contact rail that runs the length of the frame. Sights are Italian LPA combat three dot configuration, dovetailed rear sight and rivet secured modified partridge front, 5 1/4 inch sight radius with serrated rib on the slide. Hammer is .212 black matte steel serrated skeleton Commander type, with .312 smooth face matching combat trigger. Double action pull is hitchy from a resting hammer, but smooth and consistent from the half cock position. Single action pull on the photo specimen measured 6 pounds with moderate felt creep. This pistol has a firing pin safety and main safety for right handed shooters. Lever safety will engage in all three hammer positions: full rest, half cock, and fully cocked for secure carry and single action cocked-and-locked readiness. Trigger guard configuration is SP01 type square serrated front face, and the grip frame is serrated fore and aft. Grip panels are hard grainy polymer. Magazines furnished are Mec-Gar, not catalogued but produced for Canik exclusively in a bright blue finish. The magazines, interestingly, will function with both 9mm calibers and .40 caliber Canik 55 Compact pistols. This is an excellent pistol. Fit and finish are excellent. Each Shark C pistol comes in a factory hard case with cleaning brush, cable lock, instruction manual, factory certificates, and magazine loading tool. Similar pistols from the parent CZ manufacturer command pricing upwards of $700 apiece. While we expect substantial price increases, we’re nevertheless offering the Canik Shark CC in the photos, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 339.00.

Construction is steel barrel, bolt, and internal parts with lightweight alloy receiver and polymer trigger group housing. Capacity is 8 + 1 on 2 3/4 inch shells, or 7 + 1 on 3 inch magnums. Barrel is 20 inch Police Cylinder with perforated Trench Gun type heat shield. Front sight is Hex based solid brass, threaded into place. Forend is traditional serrated Corncob configuration polymer, with matching factory combat finger groove type pistol grip. Overall length is 31 inches from the muzzle to the back of the pistol grip. Metal is matte blue steel on the barrel, magazine tube, and double steel slide arms, with black matte anodized finish to the lightweight alloy receiver. Safety, as the photos show, is traditional Mossberg top tang, polymer construction and user-friendly for southpaws. This shotgun is also equipped with a bayonet lug that will accept an M8A1, M16 / M4 Bayonet or similarly equipped accessories. Weight empty is a surprisingly light 6 7/8 pounds. Magazine capacity is 8 + 1 on 2 3/4 inch shells, and 7+1 on 3 inch shells. Current pricing on the 590 is upwards of $700 apiece in our area, and they’re scarce.

Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Original sku was Mossberg number 50667, and that is what its box label reads. We have subbed, however, an ATS, Advanced Technologies full length combat type buttstock with pistol grip so that this Mossberg is closer to the 50645 factory variant. Construction is steel barrel, bolt, and internal parts with lightweight alloy receiver and polymer trigger group housing. Capacity is 8 + 1 on 2 3/4 inch shells, or 7 + 1 on 3 inch magnums. Barrel is 20 inch Police Cylinder with perforated Trench Gun type heat shield. Front sight is Hex based solid brass, threaded into place. Forend is traditional serrated Corncob configuration polymer. Buttstock is manufactured by ATI, DuPont® Extreme Temperature Glass Reinforced Polymer with stippled pebble surface pistol grip, and measures for a 14 inch length of pull including the 1 inch super absorbent scorpion recoil pad. Overall length is 41 inches. Metal is matte blue steel on the barrel, magazine tube, and double steel slide arms, with black matte anodized finish to the lightweight alloy receiver. Safety, as the photos show, is traditional Mossberg top tang, polymer construction and user-friendly for southpaws. This shotgun is also equipped with a bayonet lug that will accept an M8A1, M16 / M4 Bayonet or similarly equipped accessories. Weight empty is 7.2 pounds. Magazine capacity is 8 + 1 on 2 3/4 inch shells, and 7+1 on 3 inch shells. It and its mates are brand new shotguns, shipped as cruiser grip Persuader type. We changed their stocks to ATS, and had to rebox them. The original box label is taped to the instruction manual envelope. Current pricing on the 590 is upwards of $700 apiece in our area, and they’re scarce. We’re offering this 590 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 419.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of New York, or any jurisdiction where pump shotguns with 8 round magazine capacity are restricted to Law Enforcement Only. Add $19.00 for a factory Pistol Grip kit, but note that pistol grip kit inclusion requires a consumer age of 21, and residence in the jurisdiction where the consumer receives the shotgun. Shipping. $20 flat fee lower 48 states; $60 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground or USPS Priority with full insurance coverage.

The gun is amazing and functions excellent and is believed to be complete and original.

Condition: The gun has lots of wear on both sides of the slide, to the point a lot of the markings are hard to read. ALSO persumably the gun after the wars was Nickel plated as was common during the times. I was told Colt didn't make nickel guns until much later but I am not an expert on this so it is a bit of an unknown. The gun is in correct and working mechanical order. 

History: The gun was traded to me for a high-end trade with the story that it was handed down through out the family they were the original owners until now. 

On the side of the gun it show bright and clean where it says ""United States Property""
and the serial number bright and clean and has been confirmed through colt as manufactured for the military in 1916. Other than that, thats all I know. I will try to answer questions as best as I can and accurately describe the gun as to not misrepresent this special piece of american history.

Manufacturer is FMK Firearms of Placentia, CA. Type is striker fired, blowback semi-automatic. Construction is steel slide, barrel, and most internal parts mounted in a polymer frame. Slide to frame mating is achieved with integral parts and with a slotted metal trigger insert. This pistol’s slide rails measure at .735 inch on the front and .565 on the back, considerably more metal contacting the slide than many similar pistols, notably the Glock 19. Magazine release is steel as well, not capable of being reversed for southpaws. Trigger is .415 wide combat, with a service width .265 center trigger safety. The 9C1 also has a firing pin safety to guard against accidental discharge if the weapon is dropped. Sight system is conventional 3 dot, with the front sight doubly anchored with a stud and a Phillips screw from the underside. This pistol comes with no fewer than 5 replacement rear sights, for center aim, 1 inch right or left windage, and 2 inch right or left windate. It also comes with a total of two or three, depending on the specimen, front sights for elevation correction. Rear sight is semicircle base slotted into the slide. Barrel is service length 3.87 inch, .562 outer diameter, 1:16 Left Hand Twist 6 groove. Overall length is 6.85 incheas; height is 5.09 inches from the magazine floorplate to the top of the rear sight; weight empty is 23 1/2 ounces with center of gravity empty where the trigger guard intersects the frame. Frame is integrally rail equipped, and grip frame has moderate finger grooves on its front strap, and pliable back strap insert for sure grip and for arresting recoil fatigue. Slide width is 1.07 inches; maximum thickness 1.15 at the slide release lever. Action is full time double action, of course; trigger pull on the photo specimen gauged at a uniform 6 pounds of pressure, with 17 mm travel distance. Magazines are both 14 shot steel body with rounded polymer floorplate and white polymer cartridge follower.

The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

It's a pre-E-series ""billboard"" 1911 that was refinished by S&W. JRD serial prefixes were the first run of S&W 1911 from around 2002-2003, with JRD being the initials of the engineer who designed them. During the first run S&W's Performance Center assisted the production line during assembly, so they are better fitted than later models.

JRDxxxx serial number is a Performance Center done just before they started calling it Performance Center. It is not considered an E line or anything to that nature because it predates this. What Smith and Wesson had done was custom hand fit frame and slide and use high and quality aftermarket parts (Les Baer, Wilson Combat, etc.) in the build of the pistol and that's what developed into the Smith & Wesson Performance Center.

Examination of its lines and workmanship demonstrate the impressive expertise of Turkish Gunmakers who, after all, have been at the trade for as long as their Italian teachers and counterparts. Not only Mossberg, but also Remington, Smith & Wesson, and Weatherby have all indulged their lines with shotguns made in Turkey; and this is the most attractive of the entire lot. The Silver Reserve Field, of which this is a specimen, is equipped with five interchangeable choke tubes and wrench, providing the ultimate in versatility with lead, steel and other non-toxic loads. Manufacturer is Kayhan Art, or Khan, of Konya, Turkey. Importer is Mossberg International of New Haven, CT. Mossberg Int’l SKU is 75410. At the heart of every Reserve Series Over-and-Under is an underlock design, box lock action for superior strength and low profile. So says Mossberg. The photos show the attractively blued barrel, 3 inch chambered 28 inch Vent Rib with a total of five Benelli/Beretta thread choke tubes: two each .708 Improved Cylinder; and one each .701 Modified, one each .691 Improved Modified, and one each .683 Full. Rib is field type, .235 high above the barrel, with 8 slots whose canted posts and anchors support a .320 wide checkered serration rib with brass bead front sight. Stock and forend are satin finished European Walnut with cut checkering. Receiver is engraved satin nickel with gold inlay. Trigger is gold plated, and the tang safety serves as barrel selector. Barrels have single block extractor, and the extractor and chamber sides are nicely jeweled. Buttstock measures for a 14 inch length of pull including the Decelerator type buttpad; 1 1/2 inch drop at comb and 2 1/4 inch drop at heel with about a 3 degree right hand cant from the frame, so this O/U will not be Southpaw friendly unless a competent stock smith alters the cant. Weight empty is a well balanced 7.7 pounds with center of gravity at the back of the forend. Firing selection is by mechanical transfer, not by recoil. All our specimens are new and unfired, manufactured in 2011 or 2012, and this 75410 variant has given way to an essentially identical 75412 variant in the Mossberg International Line. All of our specimens are in their boxes with all their papers and equipment just like they shipped to a distributor last year. Those papers include a never executed factory registration certificate. Forends will show some finish stain weakness on their edges and checkering like the one in the photos. These shotguns were never out of Mossberg distribution channels until we got them. These Silver Reserves command prices upwards of $900.00 apiece in our area. We're offering the 75410 Mossberg Silver Reserve in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for a wholesale level price of only $ 469.00.

Examination of its lines and workmanship show the impressive expertise of Turkish Gunmakers who, after all, have been at the trade for as long as their Italian teachers and counterparts. Manufacturer and warrantor is Kayhan Art, or Khan, of Konya, Turkey. Not only Mossberg, but also Remington, Smith & Wesson, and Weatherby have all indulged their lines with shotguns made in Turkey; and this is the most attractive of the entire lot. The Silver Reserve Field .410 gauge handles both 2 1/2 inch and 3 inch shells interchangeably; barrels are 26 inch Vent Rib, full choke bottom tube around .375 muzzle diameter; and Modified top tube around .385 muzzle diameter. Mossberg International SKU is 75410. At the heart of every Reserve Series Over-and-Under is an underlock design, box lock action for superior strength and low profile. So says Mossberg. Mechanism is Single Selective Trigger; the safety lever serves as barrel selector. The shotgun cocks itself upon unbreeching, and transfer is mechanical, not recoil. Mechanism is extractor, no hull-wasting automatic ejectors. The photos show the attractively little lightweight. Stock and forend are satin finished European Walnut with cut checkering. Receiver is engraved satin nickel with gold inlay. Trigger is gold plated, and the tang safety served as barrel selector. Barrels have single block extractor, and the extractor and chamber sides are nicely jeweled. Buttstock measures for a 13 3/4 inch length of pull including the Decelerator type buttpad; 1 1/2 inch drop at comb and 2 1/4 inch drop at heel with about a 3 degree right hand cant from the frame, so this shotgun will not be Southpaw friendly unless altered by a professional gunsmith with expertise in stockwork. Weight empty is a very pleasant 6.25 pounds, center of gravity 2 inches forward of the trigger guard. Photo specimen and its mates are unfired, in their original boxes with late 2012 manufacturing dates on their labels. They have occasional shipment wear to the edges of their forends, and weakness to the gold plating on their triggers. They are otherwise new, unfired, and qualify for factory warranty service if needed. These Silver Reserves command prices upwards of $800.00 in our area. We're offering this one, however, the shotgun in the photo or one of its identical mates, for only $ 519.00.Shipping. $20 flat fee lower 48 states; $60 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground or USPS Priority with full insurance coverage. Offers to buy must be for the registered user with his/her own money. Don’t let your buddies use your account, that kind of thing smells like felony level straw purchase attempt. GA Pay, MC/Visa/Discover/USPS MO paid orders shipped ASAP. 7 extra day hold on checks. FFL ok by fax, e-mail or mail, please ask your dealer to put your name on there. We offer 7 day money back on used guns and items, but No Returns on New in Box guns or on Lay-aways or ammo. We do not pay transfer fees or return shipping.

As soon as we planted a couple of their standard 16 inch rifles locally, however, it became a matter of accuracy and reliability. Our local buyers report superb accuracy compared to similar rifles marketed by competitor manufacturers that have chrome lined bores. A chrome lined bore is attractive, but the lining process throws the bore diameter consistency off. Del-ton does not chrome line their rifles’ bores for that exact reason. This is Del-ton’s DT Sport rifle, built by our neighbors in Elizabethtown, North Carolina, only minutes away from Fort Bragg. The DT Sport, writes the factory, has a 16 inch light weight barrel with 1x9 twist, 6 position M4 stock, CAR handguards with single heat shields, and A2 flash hider. It comes with 30 shot factory magazine, chamber safety tool, and gun lock. This rifle features M4 dual feed ramps, and unlike many of its competitors has a standard Forward Bolt Assist. Finish is mil-spec matte blue steel with matte black anodized receiver. Receiver is flat top full length picatinny that will accept most any optical devices or detachable rear sight. Note the A2 front sight; it will not even be visible under 3x or higher magnification, and it is calibrated for mil spec removable rear sights in case the optics fail. Overall length is 39.5 inches; and weight empty is 5.8 pounds, with center of gravity at the barrel-receiver junction. Own the Del-Ton DT Sport in the photos, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 539.00.

The following bills are scheduled to be heard in the House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee at 1:30 P.M. in Room 271 in the State Capitol Building:

House Bill 1009, introduced by state Representative Steve Humphrey (R-48), would repeal the rights-infringing legislation passed into law during the 2013 legislative session that arbitrarily limits the number of rounds of ammunition you can use to protect yourself and your family to 15.

House Bill 1049, introduced by state Representative Justin Everett (R-22), would extend the protection and right to self-defense you currently have in your home, to your place of business.

House Bill 1050, introduced by state Representative Janik Joshi (R-16), would repeal the ineffective and onerous private transfer background check law that passed during the 2013 legislative session.

House Bill 1086, introduced by state Representative Patrick Neville (R-45), would mandate the timely transfers of certain lawful firearms by chief law enforcement officers to individuals once they have passed a background check.

House Bill 1127, introduced by state Representative Gordon Klingenschmitt (R-15), would admonish business owners who permit lawful concealed carry on their premise from any civil liability if an action were to take place.

The following bills are scheduled to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee at 1:30 P.M in Senate Committee Room 356:

Senate Bill 32, introduced by state Senator Vicki Marble (R-23), would allow all law-abiding Colorado residents to legally carry concealed without having to possess a concealed carry permit.  This bill would also keep in place the current permitting system so that people who obtain a permit would still enjoy reciprocity in states around the country when legally carrying concealed.

Senate Bill 86, introduced by state Senator Kent Lambert (R-9), would repeal the egregious legislation passed in 2013 that requires a background check for the private transfer of a firearm between law-abiding citizens.

It is critical that you call and email the members of these two key committees and respectfully voice your support for these bills TODAY.  Please ask these legislators to vote YES to these bills and send them to the floor of their respective chamber.

Horton’s daily operations and their special editions have upwards of two decades’ seniority on their friendly competitor neighbors, only 12 miles from each other. Here is the latest Colt Horton’s Special, and it is as traditional as they come. This is a Series 80 descendant of the 1911A1 with firing pin safety, but also with full coverage military style finish, brown Bakelite type GI Grips, and a lanyard ring type Mainspring Housing. Manufacturer is Colt Industries of Hartford, CT. Exclusive distributor is Lew Horton Distributing of Westboro, MA. Colt factory designation is Model O1991Z, M1991A1 Series 80. Construction is entirely steel, with the exception of the grips, and the anodized trigger and mainspring housing. The Colt M1991A1, writes the factory, is a direct 4th generation descendant of the ""often imitated but never duplicated"" Colt M1911 classic automatic pistol, and this variant is the closest approximation to the World War II version. Type is Browning Design 1911 Government type Single Action semi-automatic pistol. Chambering is .45 ACP Caliber. Barrel is 5 inch stainless, 6 groove left hand 1:16 rifling. Frame and slide finish are matte blue, approximating the WWII parkerized versions. Sight system is matte blue stake on front and dovetailed notch style rear that is drift adjustable only for windage. Safety system is classic threefold, main safety for right handed shooters; grip safety; and Series 80 type firing pin safety. Each 1991 comes with a total of two factory magazines, Colt factory marked and made for Colt by primary supplier Check-Mate. Each magazine holds 7 rounds, so 7 + 1 fully loaded capacity, and 8 shot magazines are readily available from us and throughout the country. Weight empty is 35 ounces with center of gravity at the magazine release. Trigger is .250 serrated face alloy, and the photo specimen pulled in the 6 pound vicinity with minimal felt creep.

It's a pre-E-series ""billboard"" 1911 that was refinished by S&W. JRD serial prefixes were the first run of S&W 1911 from around 2002-2003, with JRD being the initials of the engineer who designed them. During the first run S&W's Performance Center assisted the production line during assembly, so they are better fitted than later models.

JRDxxxx serial number is a Performance Center done just before they started calling it Performance Center. It is not considered an E line or anything to that nature because it predates this. What Smith and Wesson had done was custom hand fit frame and slide and use high and quality aftermarket parts (Les Baer, Wilson Combat, etc.) in the build of the pistol and that's what developed into the Smith & Wesson Performance Center.

For now I will charge $125. cash (depends on where and what I pay for receivers) more if I have to travel further than Fort Wayne. And if you can not own a gun legally, please don't bother asking cause I will have to see some sort of proof that you can legally own a firearm before we proceed. Also you have to be able to mill your own receiver PER ATF RULES I will only instruct and explain to you how to mill your receiver per ATF rules on home built firearms. If you can not and/or comply with my rules please don't contact me, I will not jeopardize my freedom for anybody. For now I am staying around the Northside of The Fort cause of my disability and recent back procedure but will be going further as I heal.

If you made it this far then you must have some form of interest and if that is the case please email me with your contact information and I will call you. I have some receivers now but don't know how fast this will go. Thank you for your interest"

Armscor/Rock Island M1911-A1 Tactical II 45 ACP 5"" Full Size, Parkerized, VZ Grip

The Rock Island Armory 1911 series consists of a product line of single-action recoil operated semi-automatic pistols. They are designed and manufactured by Armscor in Marikina City, Philippines, and distributed in the United States by Armscor USA, located in Pahrump, Nevada.

RIA (Rock Island Armory) 1911s are clones of the US Military G.I. M1911-A1, the standard issue US Service pistol from 1911 to 1985. Most RIA models are targeted for the low-end price point of the 1911 pistol market and are basic entry level MIL-SPEC versions of the 1911, however, the RIA Tactical, Compact, and Match models offer additional semi-custom high end features. The Compact model features a skeletonized hammer and beavertail grip safety while the Tactical model also adds a target-grade hammer and trigger as well as an ambidextrous safety, and enhanced contrast combat sights. Armscor is an ISO 9001 certified-compliant company which manufactures Rock Island pistols using CNC (Computer Numerical Control) equipment. RIA 1911 series pistols are constructed of 4140 chromoly steel with a cast frame, and are available in .45 ACP, .38 Super, 9mm Luger, and .22 TCM chamberings.
