This is one of the most fantastic guns I have ever owned. I have never had a FTF, or FTE, and this little beauty ingests anything you put through it. It is astonishingly accurate, both 9mm, and .22 uppers, and is the most comfortable handling and holding pistol on the market IMHO. If you don't know anything about CZ 75 pistols, do yourself a favor and look them up. If you can go out and shoot one. The P-01 is based on the CZ 75, the most used pistol in the world. The P01 was put through some of the most rigorous small arms testing ever. It was adopted by the Czech national police. It is a NATO classified pistol and issued the NATO stock number NSN 1005-16-000-8619. A description of the NATO certification trials can be found on CZ's website. http://cz-usa.com/press-release/cz-p-01-gets-nato-approval-the-next-generation-of-perfect-pistols/

This is a post 1964 designed Mauser design claw extractor bolt action rifle in excellent condition.  The stock is made from carved walnut.  My family bought it from a collector 14 years ago, and it was properly stored and maintained since that time.  It has never experienced much sunlight or moisture.  It was hunted for one season, and took a moving deer at range with a heart shot.  The trigger feels about 3.5 pounds, and is of excellent quality.  
This is the best example of this rifle I have ever seen for sale.  The walnut stock has only two small nicks on it.  
A month ago before I decided to sell this rifle, a gunsmith installed a brand new Nikon Buckmaster’s scope on this rifle.  The cross hairs may be canted, and so I would adjust it I were you.  That is a 200+ dollar scope plus mount, and it is free if you would like it.    
If you wish to have this rifle shipped:  I will sign it over to my FFL, and they will verify with your FFL.  Then you can securely pay.  A money order at that time is appropriate.  No Paypal."

BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE 500 S&W - 375 gr. Barnes XPB 1800 fps - 20 Round Box

PRESS RELEASE FOR BUFFALO BARNES LEAD FREE 500 S&W 375gr. XPB (ITEM 18D)

This is an ultra high performance 500 S&W loading.  It is safe to use in any and all 500 S&W chambered firearms EXCEPT guns that are fed from magazine tubes.  ALWAYS use flat nose bullets in guns fed from magazine tubes.  Click HERE to see Buffalo Bore 500 S&W rounds that are flat nosed.

This spire pointed all copper Barnes XPB bullet will fly very flat and penetrate very deep for an expanding bullet. This load can be used on animals as large as Bison or Cape buffalo. If you need an expanding load that penetrates super deep, I do not know of a better or more capable one. Plus we were able to safely drive it at a super high velocity.

We were also able to use a flash suppressed powder for those who may need to shoot a camp raiding dangerous animal in the dark. If you need your revolver for defense against wild animals, chances are it will happen in low light, when animals are most active—same goes for human criminals. No sense in blinding yourself with your first shot and becoming a blind victim.

As always, we use real world firearms to generate our advertised velocities. We believe that the industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to produce extra high velocities is dishonest to the customer as he/she will never be able to produce such high velocities under real world conditions, where it matters. My single 500 S&W revolver has a nine inch barrel and produced the following velocity.

Price is obo, but any ignorant offers will be ignored, I have $650 into just the pistol, add in the extra mags at $25 each, Hogue grips at $25, buffalo grips at $75, compensator at $40 and 100 rounds of ammo at $50, subtract for the whopping 32 rounds fired through it since new, and there you have my pricing strategy. Would consider trades for HK USP in .40 or 9mm, or Sig 226 in .40 or 9mm, with 2 or more mags and night sights. Also have .45acp dies, brass, and bullet molds for the right deal."

This is not your typical consumer grade M4/AR15 platform or accessories. It meets/exceeds Military specifications all the way around, using only high end parts and components as you are about to see.

I present the Daniel Defense DDM4 V5 M4 Carbine Mil-Spec Rifle. Below is a link giving the specifics of this same rifle for sale (except the stock). The rifle is 100% factory installed, not a ""parts gun"". Daniel Defense is widely considered the premier MIL SPEC AR15/M4 platforms being made. It is one sexy and effective piece of art...

https://danieldefense.com/firearms/mid-length/daniel-defense-m4-carbine-v5.html

I purchased and added on to this rifle after doing many months of research on creating the ""perfect weapon system"" for any defensive/offensive situation in virtually any scenario that would come up. ONLY reason I am selling is because I am saving up for a full auto, so my baby has to go...

As part of building this weapon system, I chose the:

-Daniel Defense M4 Carbine because it kept popping up in list after list of the ""best of the best"" because of its durability, attention to detail/quality, and adherence to Military Specifications/tolerances. Watch this video on YouTube and you'll see why the DDM4 is the best M4/AR15 on the market from a durability standpoint http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kX0nCEh5E

-Burris MTAC Ballistic CQ/LR (Close Quarter/Long Range) tactical optic because it offers both Close Quarters and Medium/Long Range capabilities in the same platform and the same time. Using ""true 1x"" it allows for both eyes open use (just like a red dot...AimPoint for example), and up to 4x magnification with built in 5.56 BDC reticles for effective engagements up to 600 yards. Just zero for 100 yards (which it already is) and your ready to go out to 600 yards using the built in BDC dots. It is extremely clear, has illuminated reticle (which work even if the battery dies), weather and shock proof, with a lifetime warranty. It is just like having both a Red Dot and a Tactical magnified scope in one, giving you the best of both worlds in one small, lightweight package.

-5.11 LED Tactical Lightweight High Output Weapons light because of it's superior performance inside of an extremely light frame. It is weather/shock proof with high, low, and strobe capabilities. Mounts perfect along side the foregrip for easy of use in any conditions.

-45 degree backup sight for obvious reasons; just in case something were to happen the MTAC optic this rifle can still be effective at close and medium/long ranges.

-Viking VTAC battle sling after much research in the best sling for all situations. Check out how awesome this sling is here: 
http://www.vikingtactics.com/product-p/vtac-mk2.htm

-Quick detach Harris bipod. Small and compact, but adjustable and sturdy. Can be added/removed to the M4 very quickly if the situation requires it. Quickly turns this M4 from a close quarters machine into a medium/long tactical precision weapon. 

Comes with everything listed above, plus:

Hard Carrying case, (4) 30 round mags, 90 rounds of ammo, scope lenses covers, and original boxes for most accessories.

I have well over $2500 invested in this barely used and meticulously cleaned package. Cash price is $2100 OBO. This is extremely fair for everything included...you will NOT regret taking this beauty home. Please be realistic with your offers or they will be ignored.

FTF only, no shipping. Must be 18 with an OHIO ID. CCW preferred (I'll show you mine as well). 

I have extra mags and ammo for purchase to buyer ONLY."

This is not your typical consumer grade M4/AR15 platform or accessories. It meets/exceeds Military specifications all the way around, using only high end parts and components as you are about to see.

I present the Daniel Defense DDM4 V5 M4 Carbine Mil-Spec Rifle. Below is a link giving the specifics of this same rifle for sale (except the stock). The rifle is 100% factory installed, not a ""parts gun"". Daniel Defense is widely considered the premier MIL SPEC AR15/M4 platforms being made. It is one sexy and effective piece of art...

https://danieldefense.com/firearms/mid-length/daniel-defense-m4-carbine-v5.html

I purchased and added on to this rifle after doing many months of research on creating the ""perfect weapon system"" for any defensive/offensive situation in virtually any scenario that would come up. ONLY reason I am selling is because I am saving up for a full auto, so my baby has to go...

As part of building this weapon system, I chose the:

-Daniel Defense M4 Carbine because it kept popping up in list after list of the ""best of the best"" because of its durability, attention to detail/quality, and adherence to Military Specifications/tolerances. Watch this video on YouTube and you'll see why the DDM4 is the best M4/AR15 on the market from a durability standpoint http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kX0nCEh5E

-Burris MTAC Ballistic CQ/LR (Close Quarter/Long Range) tactical optic because it offers both Close Quarters and Medium/Long Range capabilities in the same platform and the same time. Using ""true 1x"" it allows for both eyes open use (just like a red dot...AimPoint for example), and up to 4x magnification with built in 5.56 BDC reticles for effective engagements up to 600 yards. Just zero for 100 yards (which it already is) and your ready to go out to 600 yards using the built in BDC dots. It is extremely clear, has illuminated reticle (which work even if the battery dies), weather and shock proof, with a lifetime warranty. It is just like having both a Red Dot and a Tactical magnified scope in one, giving you the best of both worlds in one small, lightweight package.

-5.11 LED Tactical Lightweight High Output Weapons light because of it's superior performance inside of an extremely light frame. It is weather/shock proof with high, low, and strobe capabilities. Mounts perfect along side the foregrip for easy of use in any conditions.

-45 degree backup sight for obvious reasons; just in case something were to happen the MTAC optic this rifle can still be effective at close and medium/long ranges.

-Viking VTAC battle sling after much research in the best sling for all situations. Check out how awesome this sling is here: 
http://www.vikingtactics.com/product-p/vtac-mk2.htm

-Quick detach Harris bipod. Small and compact, but adjustable and sturdy. Can be added/removed to the M4 very quickly if the situation requires it. Quickly turns this M4 from a close quarters machine into a medium/long tactical precision weapon. 

Comes with everything listed above, plus:

Hard Carrying case, (4) 30 round mags, 90 rounds of ammo, scope lenses covers, and original boxes for most accessories.

I have well over $2500 invested in this barely used and meticulously cleaned package. Cash price is $2100 OBO. This is extremely fair for everything included...you will NOT regret taking this beauty home. Please be realistic with your offers or they will be ignored.

FTF only, no shipping. Must be 18 with an OHIO ID. CCW preferred (I'll show you mine as well). 

I have extra mags and ammo for purchase to buyer ONLY."

There must be something magical about armslist. Since this is such a special site that you can name your own price I have decided to sell my one of a kind Hybrid Skunk here name is MRS Stinky.

Also Im going to sell my one of a kind Hybrid Opossum his name is Bugger. They are both very friendly and eat out of the same bowl as you can see in the pictures. I will sell MRS Stinky for 12,000$ or Bugger for 8000$ or I will sell both together for 15,000$ I feel this is a very good deal on this Mythical Magical Wonderful site called armslist.

Product Information

The DPMS Lo-Pro AR-15 Upper Receiver Assembly comes fully assembled and ready to install on any standard small pin, mil-spec lower receiver. The Lo-Pro Upper Receiver is constructed of 6066-T6 aircraft aluminum and is of the ""Slickside"" variety, with a sleek profile devoid of protrusions through the elimination of the conventional AR-15 forward assist, case deflector, and dust cover. The result is a clean, minimalist appearance that is both fully functional as well as lightweight. 

The Lo-Pro Upper is equipped with a 16"" Target-Crowned Bull Barrel, a true 5.56x45mm NATO chamber for use with either commercial or mil-spec ammunition, and employs the versatile 1 in 9"" rifling twist rate capable of stabilizing a wide selection of different bullet weights. Additional features include heat resistant GlacierGuard polymer handguards, single rail gas block, charging handle and complete bolt & carrier assembly. Aluminum parts are hard coat anodized to mil-spec, steel parts are manganese phosphate treated (parkerized) matte black.

I recently purchased a suppressor and plan on doing some small game hunting.

I'm not opposed to other ammo that is specifically loaded to stay under the speed of sound (1100 feet per second), preferably hollow point.

It has an upgraded Ace SOCOM collapsible stock which is extremely burly. The MagPul sling mount and MS3 sling are included. The trigger is a WMD nickel-boron group, the selector has been upgraded with a Noveske 60 degree selector, the charging handle is a BCM Gunfighter and there's an oversized mag release button. This carbine lists for $1725 in stock configuration, the stock costs $225 alone and the sling, mount, selector, oversized mag release and BCM charging handle, trigger group, etc. are probably worth another $200. I'll also include a new $55 Blackhawk! Sportster rifle case and 2 new black PMags rather than the one aluminum mag shown in the photos. You're really gonna like how comfortable the smooth handguard is!

 Now for the extras, available but not included in the quoted price is a new EOTech XPS2-0 with GG&G flip-up covers mounted on a LaRue Tactical ECOS-C quick release mount that places the YHM back-up sights in the lower third of the lens. Mounted up front is an also Streamlight TLR-1SHP white/strobe light with remote activation. If you want the EOTech, mount and covers add $550 to the price (the street price of the EOTech alone is $500 or more, the mount cost $135 and the lens cover was $42). If you want the tactical light plan on another $150. The YHM flash hider/suppressor mount is not included but will be replaced with a new Troy Medieval hider.

This handguard has threaded mounting holes at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions for mounting our Customizable Rails.

Only real reason for getting rid of it is the E2 grip size is pretty small and my hands are very large. Felt pretty good at first, but once I shot a box through it, the size of it really showed its slimness. The E2 grips are great, just a little to small for me. I have more pictures if interested.

I am located in the Margate/Coral Springs area and would like to keep this local. 21 and over please, and prefer to sell to someone with a CWP, but if not, a valid FL DL will do. Please no low ball offers as my asking price is fair for a Sig. Thanks for looking.
Asking $550.00 or best offer."

It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.


The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

You get one 1/2 lb Tannerite target. Tannerite® Brand Binary Exploding Targets are a binary explosive used primarily as a shot indicator for firearms practice. Tannerite® is unique in that it is exceptionally stable when subjected to less severe forces such as a hammer blow or being dropped. It is more than 1,000 times safer than ordinary black powder since it is not flammable and can not be initiated by any kind of flame or electricity. It is supplied as two powders which are combined to produce the explosive. Tannerite® is a trademarked name, and binary exploding targets are a patented invention by Daniel J. Tanner/Oregon. Tannerite® detonations occur at a very high velocity, producing a large explosion and cloud of water vapor. It may be useful for persons who are firing at long ranges; in this scenario, a long-range rifle shooter places targets downrange, retreats to his firing position, and fires. The shooter does not have to walk down range to see if he has a hit, the Tannerite® brand target will detonate and serve as an indicator. Since the two components are not explosive until mixed, they can legally be purchased in the USA without a license. They can be legally used for sporting purposes in conjunction with small arms, just like black powder and other exempt sporting powder. The federal government, not the state, governs the manufacture of explosives. They specifically exempt the need for an explosives manufacturing license in five separate statutes. In the CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Publication 5400. Q&A section, question #48 expressly addresses that a license is not needed for personal, non-commercial manufacture and use of binary explosives.
