The ATF says that I can't loan you my tools-so I'll sell them to you instead. Here's how it works: $100 for the incomplete lower receiver, $125 for the steel jig to line everything up for you and $150 for the drill bits and end mills that you need to build it. Receiver can be used to build an AR pistol or a rifle. I sold all the receivers I had, sent in a new order and should have them in 4 days. Email me so we can make arrangements. 

Make your lower, don't break or abuse the bits or the jig and I will buy the bits and the jig back for $275. Or, if you want, keep them (your choice). This is an easy way to fabricate your own, legal, unmarked and unserialized lower receiver without creating a paper trail. 

Please note: this is only legal if a) you are not forbidden by law from owning or possessing a firearm; b) you are making the firearm for yourself and not to sell or give away; and c) if the firearm is in a legal configuration when complete (i.e., if you make an NFA item without NFA approval you can go to jail for a very long time). 

The jig and bits mean that all you need is a drill press. A milling machine is better, but drill press has worked for me just fine. No returns on the receiver (can't transfer it once it becomes a firearm and milling mistakes are your responsibility), but I will buy the jig and bits back as long as they are in good shape. 

Who knows how long it will be until the goons stop the sale of 80% receivers - and where else can you pay cash and avoid leaving a credit card trail? Don't miss out on the opportunity to exercise your right to keep and bear arms WITHOUT giving up your privacy."

I'll entertain trade offers, but I'm mainly looking for cash. Absolutely no negotiations on price, as I'm taking a big hit, and throwing in an extra two magazines. With this setup, you still get a brand new rifle, without paying for shipping, FFL fees, and still saving at least another $40 on top of that.

Features a beefy, M16A2-pattern reinforced area around the front pivot pin, a strengthening ridge over the receiver extension threads, and a ridge around the mag release button to guard against accidental magazine drop by preventing unintentional button activation.

Built around Beretta's latest PX4 modular technology, the Beretta PX4 Storm Sub-Compact Semi-Auto Pistol delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower. The Px4 Storm Sub-Compact utilizes Beretta's reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system for a more compact and lighter package. Direct barrel-slide locking system design delivers a low barrel axis that reduces felt recoil and minimizes muzzle rise. Its stainless steel barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance, a great choice for a concealed gun kept close to active, perspiring bodies. The PX4 Storm's durable frame includes an integral Picatinny rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. Ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating provides superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. White 3-dot sights provide quick acquisition of the target.

Here is Remington’s best combination of accuracy, price points, effective range, and manageable recoil, its model 783 Bolt Action chambered in 7mm Remington Magnum Caliber. Manufacturer is Remington Arms’s nearby Mayfield Kentucky facility. Construction is steel barrel, receiver, bolt, trigger assembly, and internal parts all assembled into a one piece modular stock, with detachable flush fit magazine. Barrel is 24 inch six groove right hand 1:12 rifling, with recessed / counterbored muzzle crown and Savage style barrel collar at the receiver. Outside diameter is .655 at the muzzle and .755 at the forend area. Bolt is 3 piece steel, with rotary 700 style twin lug face and extractor, and black matte alloy firing pin cover. Magazine is 3 round polymer, so 3 + 1 fully loaded capacity. Trigger is .360 smooth faced white stainless, but with Remington’s Crossfire adjustable set trigger feature. Photo specimen pulled on the advertised 3 1/2 pound mark, with no felt creep and minimal overtravel. Receiver is rounded top, drilled and tapped on 4 points; and uses two identical Weaver #35 bases or their equivalent. Distance is 3 1/2 inches between the nearest holes; of course a 7mm Mag is a long action. Weight empty is 7 pounds 7 ounces, with center of gravity at the breech face. Length of pull on the buttstock is 13 1/2 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 1 inch factory recoil pad. Buttstock has a 3/4 inch right hand cant, so this rifle will not be southpaw friendly. Each 783 comes in its original factory box with Remington lock, instruction manual, and factory registration papers. Replacement pricing on this and similar rifles in our area is upwards of $400 apiece. We’re offering the 7mm Magnum 783 Remington in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 269.00. 2% discount if payment is with USPS Money Order & Not Credit Card.

The ATF says that I can't loan you my tools-so I'll sell them to you instead. Here's how it works: $100 for the incomplete lower receiver, $125 for the steel jig to line everything up for you and $150 for the drill bits and end mills that you need to build it. Receiver can be used to build an AR pistol or a rifle. I sold all the receivers I had, sent in a new order and should have them in 4 days. Email me so we can make arrangements. 

Make your lower, don't break or abuse the bits or the jig and I will buy the bits and the jig back for $275. Or, if you want, keep them (your choice). This is an easy way to fabricate your own, legal, unmarked and unserialized lower receiver without creating a paper trail. 

Please note: this is only legal if a) you are not forbidden by law from owning or possessing a firearm; b) you are making the firearm for yourself and not to sell or give away; and c) if the firearm is in a legal configuration when complete (i.e., if you make an NFA item without NFA approval you can go to jail for a very long time). 

The jig and bits mean that all you need is a drill press. A milling machine is better, but drill press has worked for me just fine. No returns on the receiver (can't transfer it once it becomes a firearm and milling mistakes are your responsibility), but I will buy the jig and bits back as long as they are in good shape. 

Who knows how long it will be until the goons stop the sale of 80% receivers - and where else can you pay cash and avoid leaving a credit card trail? Don't miss out on the opportunity to exercise your right to keep and bear arms WITHOUT giving up your privacy."

Designed for the plinker, serious shooter or varmint hunter, Colt's CR6724 is a direct descendant of the rifles that made Colt ""the small-arms sensation of modern warfare"", the original AR-15 design from 1963. The CR6724 has many features that make it right at home on the range on in the field. A flat top receiver will allow for many types of optics and a tubular handguard is comfortable for all day long shooting. With its full floated 24"" stainless steel heavy barrel and enhanced trigger and hammer, the CR6724 lives up to its name as the Colt Accurized Rifle. The CR6724 is the perfect choice for the shooter who wants the look and feel of the original, but requires the accuracy of a modern semi-auto rifle. We buy guns and layaway is available!

Buffalo Bore Ammo - 9X18 Makarov +P Ammo - 115 gr. Hard Cast - FN (1,000 fps/ME 255 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box




Our introduction of a ""heavy bullet for cartridge"" 9X18 Makarov +P loading is the sole result of numerous customer requests.  With millions of these pistols now on American soil and no +P heavy loadings available, this cartridge and the many pistol owners are suffering from the lack of serious fight stopping ammunition.  This load is 20grs. heavier and 100 fps faster than standard 9X18 ammo.

This loading features a flash suppressed powder, so if you need to shoot in low light, you won't be blinded by your own gun fire and this is a useful tactical advantage since around 95% of all civilian shootings in the US happen in low light while the criminal element is out and about.  Our use of a hard cast bullet, with a flat nose, can best be understood if you'll read our technical article on ""The Use of Expanding Bullets in Small Defensive Cartridges,"" posted under the ""Technical Articles"" category on our home page.

Further, please note that the use of hard cast bullets (not lead but, Hard Cast) does NOT cause lead fouling in the polygonal rifling's used in all 9X18 Makarov pistols.  For more information, please see our technical articles entitled ""Hard Cast Bullets in Polygonal Barrels"" and ""Dangers of Pure Lead Cowboy Bullets"". We found no appreciable leading in any of our Makarov test guns. It should also be noted that all of our test guns functioned and fed flawlessly with this load. We also experienced very good to excellent accuracy in all test guns.

Please note the real world velocities listed below from real world 9X18 Makarov pistols. At Buffalo Bore we always use real, ‘over-the-counter’ firearms for our published velocities, as we feel the use of laboratory test barrels that give false, high velocities does the customer a disservice as each customer needs to know what their carry ammo will really do on-the-street in a real world situation.

Here is some of Europe’s best, Prvi’s 7.62x25 Pistol round, or .32 Tokarev caliber. Manufacturer is Privi Partizan of Uzice, Serbia, producers of military and sporting ammunition since 1928. Importer is TR&Z of Stratford, CT. Construction is small pistol primer, flake powder, brass cases, and copper alloy lead core bullets. This is Prvi Partizan's standard Military & Police load in 7.62x25 Tokarev, one of the most popular and most efficient rounds in the world. Its clean-ignition components produce impressive ballistics, and Prvi Partizan’s brass quality is second to none. This load uses an 85 grain Full Metal Jacket bullet. In a 5 inch barreled Tokarev, it develops an incredible 1600 feet per second velocity, and 500 foot pounds of muzzle energy. It is too hot, the manufacturer warns, for .30 Mauser pistols.

This bullpup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition. The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. 
This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas 
where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the 
case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG."

This listing is for FIVE Boxes, a total of 250 Cartridges or Rounds; buyers, however, may take any number of extra 5 box lots at the same per-box price and with no additional shipping charges. CCI's Blazer line of ammunition was responsible, more than any other brand, for causing the price slide in ammo in the early 1980s, and it gave us two decades of relatively cheap ammunition. Here, however, is the pioneer for inexpensive, reliable center fire ammo, the CCI Blazer .38 Special in the work horse 158 grain lead round nose variant. Manufacturer is Cascade Cartridge, Inc., CCI, of Lewiston, Idaho. Construction is CCI small pistol primers loaded into a non reloadable but eminently recyclable aluminum alloy case, with CCI powder and a 158 grain lead round nose bullet. This CCI 3522 Blazer .38 Special pushes its bullet out the muzzle of a 4 inch Model 10 at 755 feet per second, and delivers over 200 foot-pounds of muzzle energy. It will work just fine in revolvers or lever action rifles chambered for .38 Smith & Wesson Special or .357 Remington Magnum calibers. It will not work in revolvers marked .38 S&W, unless the S&W is followed by Spl or Special on the barrel or caliber marking. This cartridge does not develop high pressures like +P ammunition does. We have sold this round now for 30 years with excellent performance and customer satisfaction. Similar loads command prices upwards of $30.00 per box, as much as 60 cents a cartridge. Ours figures only 40 cents a round. We're offering it is five box lots at only $19.80 per box. Own a total of 250 rounds for only $ 99.00. Shipping $15.00 flat fee shipping lower 48 for the whole order. No Returns on Ammunition. Bids and offers to buy must be for the registered user only.

No other firearm brand can lay claim to the legendary reputation of Winchester Repeating Arms®. Through the genius of John M. Browning, many of these all-time favorites are forever a part of America’s history. When it came time to chase a band of outlaws out of town, blaze a trail across the Great Plains or face down a charging grizzly on a narrow trail in the High Rockies, the men whose legendary courage tamed the Wild West chose to arm themselves with a genuine Winchester rifle or carbine. It was the gun they carried with absolute confidence, knowing that their lives and livelihoods depended on it shooting straight and true every time they pulled the trigger.

These magnificent historic rifles are limited production models and each one is crafted to the most exacting standards. This level of quality takes time and talent, and with so many classic variations in detail — like case colored receivers, different barrel lengths, deluxe and commemorative models in both rifles and carbines — it means that Winchester Repeating Arms will not have every historic model in the product line every year.

Secant Ogive Design
Pioneered by Hornady for use in hunting bullets, this technology broke new ground in ballistic engineering and is now used in bullets for everything from match to varmint shooting.

The secant ogive is a geometrically developed design that creates the most ballistically efficient profile, yet retains the optimum bearing surface. The combination of the slender point and increased bearing surface results in lower drag, increased stability, flatter trajectories and amazing accuracy."

This one has an 18"" barrel and 4+1 capacity. Shoots 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells. I added a list below of the major differences between the police and express guns just to give you an idea of why they are more desirable HD guns. Trades listed below, please call or text REDACTED, thanks.

The 870 Police has:
- An aluminum trigger group (vs plastic on the 870 express).
- Old style magazine retention system (you can add mag extension w/o modification)  
- A much smoother finish inside and out, no machine marks or burrs.
- The Police gun receives a higher level of inspection and finishing and is built in a special area of the plant from 100% inspected parts.
- A military-grade parkerized finish.
- A polished bore.
- A one piece barrel.
- A short police-length fore end. 
- The Remington “R3” super recoil pad that reduces felt recoil by 30%.
- Sling swivels.
- Heavy-duty magazine spring to ensure positive shell feeding.
- Heavy-duty trigger-sear spring. to reduce the chance of accidental fire
- Heavy-duty shell lifter spring which also improves positive feeding.
- No use of MIM parts, the extractor is milled
- Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
- The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing."

Double/Single action provides a very safe and time proven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. . Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged. . Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. . Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer. . Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. . External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol. . No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. . Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy. . Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released. . Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop. . High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm. 92 FS. A LEGENDARY FIREARMS. The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history. The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them. BERETTA U.S.A. RELIABILITY AND DURABILITY STATISTICS FOR THE BERETTA 9mm PISTOL. • The average reliability of all M9 pistols tested at Beretta U.S.A. is 17,500 rounds without a stoppage. • During one test of twelve pistols fired at Beretta U.S.A. before Army supervision, Beretta-made M9 pistols shot 168,000 rounds without a single malfunction. • The Beretta 9mm pistol was the most reliable of all pistols tested in the 1984 competition which resulted in the award of the M9 contract to Beretta. • Two-thirds of all M9 pistols endurance tested at Beretta U.S.A. fired 5,000 rounds without a single mal function or, at most, with only one malfunction. • The average durability of Beretta M9 slides is over 35,000 rounds, the point at which U.S. Army testing ceases. • The average durability of M9 frames is over 30,000 rounds.

I found a new one online from grabagun with laser for $734.46 and grabagun is the cheapest online gun store that i have found. The only used ones i could find a price on what they actually sold for was $617-680 and those were without the laser and only came with 1 mag and thats what they actually sold for, not what people are asking for them. Going from what i found online i would say a trade value of around $700 with all the ammo and holster. Im really wanting a larger caliber handgun, im open to any handguns so make a offer. i would trade down a little bit if i really like the gun but if its a big difference then we'll figure something out. I might consider selling it. Located near paducah/murray kentucky. thanks.

In production since 1899, it is a six-shot double-action revolver with fixed sights. Over its long production run it has been available with barrel lengths of 2 in (51 mm), 3 in (76 mm), 4 in (100 mm), 5 in (130 mm), and 6 in (150 mm). Barrels of 2.5 inches (64 mm) are also known to have been made for special contracts.  Some 6,000,000 of the type have been produced over the years, making it the most popular centerfire revolver of the 20th century.

The particular example, we are listing here, features the 4"" barrel and will include the original blue box it was shipped from the factory in.  Additionally, the grips, [right grip panel], are numbered to the firearm with the serial number stamped into the inside surface of the panel.  No tools, oil paper, or documentation are included.

This firearm is rated as being in excellent condition with 99% of the bluing still on the metal.  There is a slight turn ring on the cylinder and the sharp edge of the muzzle shows some wear of the bluing.  There are a couple of minor nicks in the checkering of the grips, but other than this they are also in excellent condition.  The bore is also excellent.  As can be seen in the photos, the box has had tape placed around it sometime in the past.

It also comes with 160 rounds of Tulammo brand ammo. I have put about 100 rounds through it. It fires great and feels great in your hands. This is a great rifle.

It's basically a British Pattern 1914 rifle that was being produced in the United States under British Contract that was re-chambered in the US Standard 30.06 Cartridge. 

At the time the M1903 Springfield was our official rifle, but production difficulties led to the adoption of the M1917 and more of the US Expeditionary Forces headed to Europe to fight in WWI were issued the M1917 than any other rifle.

This particular one was imported by Century International and was re-serialed on the left side of the receiver because the original markings were obliterated somehow and only faintly are partially visible.  The import bond inspection tag still is present on the trigger guard.

This would be a perfect one to use for a sporterized hunting rifle as the collectible nature of the rifle was seriously compromised with the re-serialed receiver.

I was going to have it built into something else but plans change.  It is glass bedded and appears to have a custom trigger.  There are some very light wear marks on the barrel but nothing I could capture in a picture.  Not sure what contour barrel is on this rifle.  It is not a full bull barrel but it is considerably heavier than any of my other Mark II rifles.  It is Ruger target grey.  The price is $700.  Please call with any questions but please don’t call to offer me any less because I am not interested in less than $700.  Only gun I am in the market to trade for would be a Sendero in 7 STW or 7 Ultra mag.  Obviously I would add cash on my end.  REDACTED

It has been fired exactly 68 times.  Selling because I'm more into rifles and haven't fired this piece in almost 6 months.

DETAILS: 

MSRP 745.00 (Selling for $600) Screamin' deal. 

The A1 class is a specialized tactical branch of the classic 92FS

The most noticeable difference between the classic 92FS and the 92A1 is that this comes with an integral Picatinny rail situated in front of the trigger guard. The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit.

The base design of the 92A1 is the 92FS or M9, the pistol that has served the US military admirably throughout its campaigns in the world’s toughest environments. But even in this respect, Beretta never rests on its laurels. This pistol incorporates an innovative internal frame buffer that greatly reduces component stress under firing (yes, even with hot +P ammo), making it even more durable and smooth-shooting. The best of both worlds, the 92A1 offers discriminating shooters the classic overall look and feel of the 92 (including the more traditional rounded trigger-guard) with today’s most advanced tactical features.
