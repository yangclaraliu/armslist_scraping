Had planned on modifying but never got around to it. Pretty fun the way they are set up now. Its a full-auto fire simulated in a ""nearly"" harmless toy, with a single stack style mag and twenty rounds of flying foam-cushioned fury..... VERY FUN to play with around the house, especially if someone else has another nerf gun as well.  I have two in the box with everything included and one I've assembled, has batteries in it, and used a few times (I took off scope and lost one disc) but nothing else. Its a lot of fun, and super cheap to reload... just retrieve fired discs, press into mag, lock n load and let em rip. They sell additional discs and mags at Wal-Mart and Toys R Us. I dont really want to get rid of but my girlfriend finds them extremely annoying and said they've gotta go. Also, if you check out YouTube, their are modifications that can change the guns performance. Simple enough for a middle school kid to explain and diagram the electronic wiring mods.

Like new SIG Sauer P229 DA/SA in .40 S&W.
Has night sights, E2 grips, and a loaded chamber indicator.
Purchased this SIG as a red box (factory certified pre-owned).  This weapon looks like it has never seen a round.  Absolutely no wear on the barrel, not a single scratch on the weapon or any signs of wear.  Factory SIG SLP lubricant was still on the weapon when I purchased it.  I have only fired 25 rounds through this gun. A great chance of have a brand new SIG without paying new SIG price.  Comes with two magazines.  I just purchased this, but have had some unexpected expenses come up.  This pistol was $699 at Vance's just 25 rounds ago.  Must sell quick...have step-kid medical bills to pay.

I purchased this brand new in the middle of March for $415. I've put exactly 350 rounds through it. When I took it out the first two times I experienced a dozen failures to feed. It would eject the spent cartridge fine, but would not fully return to battery when feeding the next round. It was a tight fitting weapon, and was pretty cold out, and the first two times I took it out I did so without field stripping the weapon and cleaning it even though I just bought it....so I chalked it up to a fluke. I field stripped it, and gave it a good scrubbing, having found it loaded with oil. A little frog lube on the rails and a couple other lubrication points, manually cycling the weapon, and I haven't had a problem since. 



My very first time reassembling after having cleaned it, I put a slight ""idiot scratch"" in it while trying to re-insert the slide stop. When I say slight, I mean slight. I could probably buff it out in two minutes....but the bluing on the Metro Arms American Classic II isn't exactly known for being top notch as demonstrated by the bluing being worn off underneath the safety and slide stop. It is in very good condition. It's not at all a bad weapon...in fact I really enjoy it. I had plans lined up to send it to a gunsmith for a few customizations that I wanted to get done (trigger, night sights, mainspring housing)...but that idea has been cancelled in favor of knocking out an unplanned bill.

It is a very robust design and built like a tank to handle a steady diet if even the heaviest magnum loads.This particular one has never been subjected to any abuse and will not disappoint you, and is one you would be proud to own. It has only minor handling marks .This is vintage of 1984 and is one of only 150 built. Thirty years old and they really do not build them like they used to, outstanding craftsmanship, with excellent fit and finish."

She also has a new ELZETTA C CHARLIE 333 900 lumens weapon light sitting in a new ELZETTA ZSM mount with optional side rail.This is the brightest weapon light you have ever seen ELZETTA calls it the scorcher. It will disorient you in the daytime and if you get hit with it at night you will be grabbing for spots for a hour. Check these lights out on ELZETTAS site. Last is the AIMSHOT LS8300 Green Laser. Try to find one of these. They are only sold to SOCOM and other SOF on military PO only. They are no longer even sold to LE Agency's. You can check with Jeff at AIMSHOT to confirm this. Its the brightest laser you will ever see mounted to a rifle. You can follow the beam even before dark and after dark it looks like something from STAR WARS. Comes with two pressure switches one click and the other a pressure pad. Also comes with zero tool you have to see this laser at night and then you will know why the sales are restricted for military only! Also have gotten in trouble with it several times here on the lake at night! LOL. Would rather trade than sell. Thanks so much for looking.

Trigger is 3.5 pounds national match along with the iron sites.  All of this installed in a FDE or coyote tan Sage EBR stock with EBR scope mount with return to zero capability after being taken off and put back on. The Sage EBR stock was designed for the military to modernize the M14 and they did more than that. This is the best stock made for a M1A or M14 as it fixes the common problems and greatly increasing accuracy while adding rails for accessories. The boost in accuracy comes from free floating the barrel from the Op-Rod guide forward, Sage's custom ""glass bedding job"", and adjustable cheek rest for scoped shooting. The only reliable way to mount optics on an M14 is the EBR scope mount. If you want one rifle to do everything from point blank to 1000 meters this is it. Sage M14 EBR rifles are used in all branches of the military as semi auto sniper rifles. This sale includes the following:

They are rugged, and build very well. If you look them up anywhere you will see they run from $140.00 to $185.00 for the MAD sight with the Trijicon inserts.

This package comes with one 5 round magazine, one Salem 6 converted to 10 round magazine and one additional Salem 6 conversion kit.  By purchasing this firearm the buyer accepts all responsibility/waives liability for the function/liability of the converted magazine and kit.

Shotgun must be transferred at a local gun range or substation, for a background heck to be completed.  I will not sell without a background of the actual buyer or to anyone not able to legally posses a firearm.  Thanks for understanding!!!!

 The MKA 1919 has a striking resemblence to the AR-15 and shares placement of many of the controls, including the safety, magazine release, and bolt release. Unlike many semi-automatic shotguns, the MKA 1919 is quite light due to its use of modern, high strength composites. The upper receiver is manufactured from Aluminum Alloy with a Picatinny rail. The 19.7"" barrel is Chrome Lined and threaded for removable chokes. The front sight is a removable AR style post sight and the rear is integrated in the removable carry handle. Caliber: 12 Gauge, Capacity: 5 and 10 rounds, Barrel: 19.7"" Chrome Lined barrel Dimensions: 39"" long Weight: ~7 pounds"

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. 
The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers."

I dont want to, but I am having to sell my pretty much brand new Springfield 1911 TRP in .45 ACP. I have only had this for a few months and used it at one steel match competition, so it has had less than 50 rounds total through it. Other than that, it just sits in my safe as a safe queen/king. I am only selling to help fund me moving here soon for a new job. I already had to sell my FN 5.7, now this. Anyways, it comes with everything that is pictured. The gun it self was $1400 brand new, the two holsters are Blackhawk Holsters, one is a Serpa and the other is an IWB concealment holster, both were $50. It also comes with 10 magazines. 2 of them are the factory 7 round mags that came with the gun, 4 are Wilson Combat 8 rounders, and the other 4 are Chip McCormick 8 rounders. Each extra magazine was $35-40. So there's $280 in magazines alone. Just about $1780 invested total. I am asking a generous and fair $1500. I can also throw in a box of self defense ammo for free for a serious buyer. I need the cash, so NO TRADES and NO Low Ballers. Located in Idaho Falls, ID.
