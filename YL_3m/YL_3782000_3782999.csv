M1 Garand manufactured by Harrington & Richardson Arms (HRA) for US Government in 1955. There are no import parts or marks anywhere on this rifle. Performs and cycles flawlessly and is in very nice original condition.  The original USGI issue HRA barrel (Dec. 1955) is shiny, measures only 1 at muzzle and just 2 at throat. It has been sighted in for 100 yards and it exceeds accuracy of the US Army's specifications at time of issue.  The Bolt, Op rod, Trigger Group and Gas plug are all stamped HRA and have correct lot numbers for date of issue. All metal has original USGI finish. There is no rust or pitting anywhere. The walnut stock is also HRA. As you can see in the photos the stock is beautiful and does have strong US armory ""eagle"" cartouche as well as the ""circle P"" on handle. 

M1 Garands manufactured by Harrington and Richardson Arms are considered the finest quality of all four Garand manufacturers. To find one with this many original HRA parts is very rare. This Garand is not some piece of junk collection of mismatched parts you find at gun shows or elsewhere. It is a correct and complete functioning M1 Garand that would still pass inspection at Parris Island. It is both beautiful to hold and shoot. No modifications or alterations have been made and is competition worthy for John C. Garand matches. It is something that you will be proud to own and pass on down. - If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me. I am selling for economic reasons and will entertain reasonable offers - I have 3 Garands and one must be sacrificed.-Thanks.

Included in this sale:
1 M1 Garand HRA 
10 Enbloc clips
80 Rounds of 30.06 150 grn (I will not ship ammo)

For sale I have a complete AK-74 package.

Rifle shoots excellent and functions flawlessly (as AK's are known to do) The only reason I'm selling is I'm looking to get a M1A and I already have a Couple of AR's that will fill the same role as this rifle.

Breakdown of whats included.

AK-74 built by Waffen Werks purchased last year and has 180 rounds through it.

From The Website:

These high quality AK-74 rifles are built from all matching Bulgarian AK-74 parts sets. Rifles are built to exacting standards on a new U.S. made Waffen Werks receiver. Each rifle features a brand new chrome lined U.S. made barrel properly chambered for the 5.45x39 round. They have been extremely accurate.

Rifle features a Tapco G-2 trigger set and a U.S. grip and is fully 922r compliant with all AK-74 mags regardless of country of origin. Rifles also incorporate a side rail for easy installation of scope rails or accessories.

New $619.

AK-74 Accessory package, 4 30rnd parts kits, mag pouch, bayonet and oil bottle. $169

2 Tapco 30rnd parts kits $24

900rnds 7n6 ""banned"" ammo. Full case $240 Since its a partial case I'll value it at $200

AK ergo grip, so you can actually hold the rifle. $20

Kvar O.D. green ""NATO"" length stock, A inch longer to fit us decadent capitalist pigs in the West. I have both the original stock and grip that will go with it. $47

""Venezuelan"" PK-A red dot. A excellent red dot that was built for the Venuzualian Army by the Russians. The great thing about this particular sight it that it uses a regular AA battery and it sits low enough to co-witness the stock AK sights. It also allows a proper cheek weld on the rifle a huge plus. $400

Total price if bought separate $1479

My price $1200. Non negotiable!

No Trades unless your looking to trade a M1A Loaded with a stainless barrel.

I will not break up the package it's all or nothing, sorry I just don't want to deal with all the hassle. I'm in no hurry to sell, I really have no need to sell just trying to diversify my collection so the price is the price. Don't bother contacting me saying ""I found all this stuff at the gun store for $30."" If you did, great, buy it. Don't bother telling me.

You line up the Dealer and cover the fees.

I wont travel out of the Denver Metro area so I hope your local or willing to travel.

Pump is generally best and I would consider a semi-auto but it just doesn't seem necessary in a 20 gauge.  Recoil is minimal with the loads I use and semi-autos just aren't as reliable and they are more expensive.

Its a little over a year old, and in near perfect shape. Im just selling it to replace it with a smaller eotech exps2. I have installed the gg&g flip up lens cover hood. I do my shooting out on my friends farm and I liked the lens covers for the ability to set the weapon down in the grass without worry about scratching the lens. Prior to that I had purchased a scopecoat for it, which I liked for storage. Both covers are included, and the scopecoat still fits over the gg&g hood if you want extra protection. The factory eotech hood is included as well.

Breakdown of paragraph above:

Eotech 517 used, but perfect condition 

Gg&g lens cover hood installed. Factory eotech hood included, along with gg&g install/removal instructions and tools.

Scopecoat optic cover for the 517. Will fit with gg&g hood installed

Includes box, manual, Samsung OEM wall charger and two charging/data cables, a USB adapter (so you can connect a USB stick/thumb drive to the tablet), a protective case that also functions as an easel that props the tablet up, and a Logitech keyboard (keyboard comes with box and manual as well).

Both the fake leather case and Logitech keyboard are made specifically for the Galaxy Tab 10.1 - the case has cutouts for the charging/data port, headphone jack, power and volume buttons, and speakers. The keyboard also serves as a protective case - can lay the tablet onto the keyboard and it makes for a slim, compact carrying package and keeps the screen protected.

Screen is in excellent condition and there are no dings/dents on the tablet, and it works great. The back cover has a little smudging from the case (see pic); I imagine this might be rubbed off, but since I keep the tablet in the case, I don't ever see the back cover, so I never bothered.

The frame has been blued nicely and the swamp scenes are visible. The stocks have a nice finish and the butt plate is correct for the model. 
The barrels retain a lot of bluing, have a few very small nicks and freckling (no dents). The bores are shiny and clean. The gun shoots.
There is a small chip out of the left front of the butt stock. This will not affect the shootability.

Cabela's offered $960 for it and they only pay 60% of value which puts this one at $1600+. A quick search online shows nice condition ones sell for$1600-$2200. I don't have a license to ship so I wanted to sell to someone locally private party.

This was manufactured in 1942 so it's right in the heart of WWII - very rare in this condition. Barrel has perfect rifling, and shows almost zero wear around the muzzle. See the photos this is not some heavily used, well worn or redone rifle. This is original with almost no wear on even the slide of the pump.

All wood is in beautiful condition. The original Winchester bakelite buttplate - most of these have replacement buttplates since they would crack or break during use.

This is collector quality - check out this one at Cabelas for $1399 and its not nearly as nice as the one I have listed!

Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.
When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

The receiver is also coated with Teflon™ for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics.

I have maybe 100 rounds through the gun.
Must be willing to meet face to face.
