Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, RugerÂ® Mini-14Â® rifles and Mini ThirtyÂ® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14Â® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with collapsible stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

It has the Accu-Trac range finder stadia wires, & a bullet drop compensator.  This scope is in excellent condition.  The lens are clear, & scratch free.  The ring marks are minimal.

It also comes with all four bullet drop compensation dials.  If you need any information on the trajectory of each dial, we have copies of all that information, we can fax, or send you.

We can email close up photos, on request.

Shipping to the lower 48 states, will be $12.00.  Please call:  REDACTED, for a quote to Alaska, or Hawaii.

Although these Redfields were some of the best hunting scopes, ever built; at this point, they are almost 20 years old.  We can not guarantee this scope is in perfect condition.  Even if they look good, & there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them, you don't know for sure, until you mount the scope, & try it.

However, we do guarantee, there is nothing obviously wrong with the scope, we don't tell you about.

I have well over a dozen Illuminators, just like this one.  All of them have been disassembled, & cleaned; & they work good.  All of these original Redfields, should be disassembled, & cleaned, before mounting them on a rifle.  This usually costs about $60.00.  You should figure that in, when buying the scope.

We have used several scope repair companies.  The two we would absolutely NOT recommend, to anyone; are:  Iron Sights, & ABO.

We have sent a couple Redfields to Iron Sights, & it took a year to get them back, & they still had the same problems, they had, when we sent them in.

ABO, is even worse.  They either can't, or won't, fix anything properly, & they do not stand behind their work.  They are very expensive; also.  We would not recommend you send a toy scope, or a Tasco (same thing actually), to ABO; much less a prized Redfield, such as an Illuminator.

That said; there are several other scope repair companies; which are reputable; who will disassemble, & clean a Redfield.

We take all major credit cards, with a 3% surcharge.  We will also take a check, but we will have to delay shipping for a couple days; on out-of-state checks.

We are a retail store, so our items are subject to sale BEFORE they are reserved online.

If you donât see what you are looking for, please call us at REDACTED.  We can sell most scopes at very reasonable prices.

Thank you."

The rifling is in great shape for its age(bright and strong), with some dusting in the grooves; the bore is kind of dark, but not too bad. bolt is silky smooth and functions great.

Chambered for the 7.62x39mm cartridge, the Zastava Arms AK-47 utilizes a rotating bolt alongside a proven piston-driven gas operation system that has provided sustained reliability for more than 60 years. 4 magazines included with the rifle.

The Zastava Arms AK-47, each of which is manufactured in the world-famous Zastava Arms factory, features a hammer forged 16 1/4 inch barrel (1:10 inch twist rate) alongside an overall length of 36 1/4 inches. Its heavy-duty stamped receiver boasts a thickness of 1.6 mm and includes a parkerized finish to offer enhanced protection against rust and corrosion as well as increased resistance to wear caused by moving parts. Everything you could possibly ask for in a standard AK-47 is here, only improved. Laminated wood furniture is tossed aside in favor of beautiful stained maple. There is also an ergonomic pistol grip as well as traditional iron sights and a sling mount on the gas assembly. All of this is packed into a rifle that weighs just over seven pounds. 

Just so you are aware, I am not in a hurry to sell this rifle or make a trade, so please understand that I am going to sell this as a new AK, because it is new, and I want to recover as much as my purchase price as I can. If I don't sell it here, then I will just keep it for myself; the rifle is as good as a AK can get.  

So why buy from me instead of from your local store or online? Because I am eliminating taxes, shipping, and/or FFL transfer charges. Plus, I am adding two extra magazines bringing up the Mag total to 4. That saves you anywhere from $100-$150 dollars just because you decided to purchase this rifle."

Anderson Ams out of Lebanon Oregon complete rifle. 16"" 1:9 bbl with mid length gas system. It's a flat top upper with detachable carry handle. Has all Magpul MOE furniture with a MIAD grip. I have all the inserts for the grip too. Comes with one 30 round mag. Can add more for the right trade. I personally have shot about 200 rounds thru this rifle with zero FTF. It runs great. Everything is tight, clean and is very well put together. THIS IS NOT ANDERSON MANUFACTURING! 

I'm looking for either a different caliber AR or just an upper. I really want another Saiga 12 shotgun. Converted or not. A Ruger Gunsite 308. Or a nice lever gun that IS NOT 30-30 or 22. Not really looking for handguns other than a glock 42. I will consider most trade offers and I don't get offended. So fire away. REDACTED call or text"

This scope is in excellent condition. The lens are clear, & scratch free. The ring marks are minimal. We can email close up photos, on request.Shipping to the lower 48 states, will be $12.00. Please call: REDACTED, for a quote to Alaska, or Hawaii. Although these Redfields were some of the best hunting scopes, ever built; at this point, they are almost 20 years old. We can not guarantee this scope is in perfect condition. Even if they look good, & there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them, you don't know for sure, until you mount the scope, & try it. However, we do guarantee, there is nothing obviously wrong with the scope, we don't tell you about. I have well over a dozen Illuminators, just like this one. All of them have been disassembled, & cleaned; & they work good. All of these original Redfields, should be disassembled, & cleaned, before mounting them on a rifle. This usually costs about $60.00. You should figure that in, when buying the scope. We have used several scope repair companies. The two we would absolutely NOT recommend, to anyone; are: Iron Sights, & ABO. We have sent a couple Redfields to Iron Sights, & it took a year to get them back, & they still had the same problems, they had, when we sent them in. ABO, is even worse. They either can't, or won't, fix anything properly, & they do not stand behind their work. They are very expensive; also. We would not recommend you send a toy scope, or a Tasco (same thing actually), to ABO; much less a prized Redfield, such as an Illuminator. That said; there are several other scope repair companies; which are reputable; who will disassemble, & clean a Redfield. We take all major credit cards, with a 3% surcharge. We will also take a check, but we will have to delay shipping for a couple days; on out-of-state checks. We are a retail store, so our items are subject to sale BEFORE they are reserved online. If you donât see what you are looking for, please call us at REDACTED. We can sell most scopes at very reasonable prices. Thank you."

The appearance of the Model 10 BA from Savage is as radical as the extreme accuracy it delivers.
The BAâs modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting
from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods
and more. 

The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series â built for pinpoint accuracy.
The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features
a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like
no Savage weâve ever made.

The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team.Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum.

Standard features in this series include:

Oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots
Crisp clean AccuTriggerâ¢ allows the user to easily adjust trigger pull weight from approximately 1.5 â 6 pounds

This is a single shot with 30"" Barrel 1 in 8 right hand twist. I purchased this rifle to compete in 600 & 1000yd matches. Unfortunately I have never found the time to compete. I spent over a year working with a local machine shop designing and having them build a precision rest system. The base allows precision adjustments and allows the rifle to return quickly to target after firing without the use of constantly shifting sand bags. I have over $10,000 in machine shop work in the rest alone, and it works! The rifle is equipped with a Leupold VX III 8.5 X 25 Long Range target scope with 50mm objective, 30mm tube and target dot reticle. The scope also has a Premier Optics 2X converter making the scope a 20 X 50 power. The rifle comes with the base, 150 pcs. Of new Lapua brass, 58 pcs. Lapua once fired brass, 87 pcs. Lapua twice fired brass and 64 assorted loaded rounds. Also included is a set of Redding Reloading dies. The Rifle was carefully lapped while breaking it in, itâs been thoroughly cleaned after each range session. It will shoot a one hole 5 shot group at 100 yds. And I have fired a 2 5/8â group at 500 yards. I really think in the hands of a shooter with good eyesight it will do better. The rifle has had 250 rounds fired thru it and is just getting broke in. If you are interested in getting into bench rest competition or just shooting varmints a long way away then this is the set up for you. The rifle must ship to an FFL. The base and accessories can ship directly to the buyer. Buyer will pay actual shipping costs. I accept Postal Money Orders or Bank Checks. Make sure it is legal to own this firearm where you live before bidding."

A 1938 German Mauser with the â27â factory code for âErmaâ.

This mauser is 80% numbers matching SN 69xx-K the stock and bolt do not numbers match the rifle. BUT, both the stock and bolt have the Weimar Eagle acceptance stamp and are correct for the year of 1938. The bolt matches itself.

All proof marks are intact and have not been peened out. I filled them in with Brownellâs Lacquer  stick to make them visible.

The bore is clean, bright, sharp and NO rust or frosting.

this is NOT a R/C But is an early 80âs import as there are import stampings on both sides of the barrel about  2 inchâs back from the muzzle, look close.

This is a very good pre-war mauser for the collector who is looking for a pre-war rifle that is correct but will not break the bank.

More photoâs available.

Price - $875. â FIRM.
Thanks for looking."

The BAâs modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods and more.

The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series â built for pinpoint accuracy. The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like no Savage weâve ever made.

The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team. Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum. Standard features in this series include an oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots.

For full sale price I will include a set of Lee dies and 50 pieces of brass, some are loaded. I cannot ship loaded ammo with the rifle, so if not FTF, ammo will have to ship separately. Ammo shipping has to go UPS, so I will need $15.00 for the ammo shipping. This rifle will really shoot. It is shooting on at 250 yards with a 1&1/2"" high at 100 yds. I have fired this rifle about 12 times. The rifle was unfired when I purchased it. I am not interested in any trades at this time other then S&W magnum pistols. I'm not interested in Performance Center handguns, as they are priced over my head most of the time. I will ship this in state for $35.00 with two forms of I.D. one being a photo copy drivers license. No out of state shipping for now. If sold FTF, I need two forms of I.D. as stated above and cash money in hand. No checks are accepted FTF. If sold as a shipped rifle, I will accept a postal money order or a bank certified check only. Funds must be verified before I will ship this. This is a excellent rifle and scope, so you can be confident it is as described. Thank you for looking."

I have owned this gun for 20 years and obtained it from the original owner who never used it. I have only put about 10 rounds through the gun as I do not hunt. Iâve been told that this is a great walking gun because of the light weight and the 19â barrel.

It is a prime example of a pristine model 100 semi-auto rifle. They are going for $1,000.00 plus in this condition, I am blowing it out because I really donât have a use for it and would like something in the AR/M4 platform. With that being said I am open to trades.

Made in 1943 I believe.  It's all matching on the cylinder, frame butt, barrel flat, back of ejector and one grip (other not marked). Frame and crane numbers match each other as they should.  Original finish with no import marks. Bore is excellent. There are some areas of brown staining and micropitting especially on the cylinder and barrel as shown in the available pictures. Looks way better in hand than my crappy pics show.  This is a good shooter in very decent shape but it's not a pristine example.

I am interested in trading for a Polytech Legend. 
I have almost 50 pictures in total (including these) that I can send to serious inquiries only.
I have this trade listed in other areas so the person with the nicest Legend and/or package will own this pristine Python 1978 model. If you have a unfired Legend in box with everything it came with it I will make the trade straight away.
I would rather trade than sell but if you want to purchase outright the price is $2500 FIRM.
I have had several appraisals and all of them have said that a Python in this condition is worth up to $2500 so since I'd rather trade then thats how much it will cost you to buy it. 
If you want it cheaper find yourself a Polytech Legend for a good price and trade me. 
Thanks for looking!"

I've only ever had issue with American Eagle red box stuff, but I'm not surprised because my 10/22 chokes on that junk too.

It's a great reliable 22LR semi-auto pistol, but I've become bored with it.  It's really accurate and includes 3 dot white adjustable sights (allen wrench included).  It also has a threaded barrel.  However S&W does not include a cap wrench with the pistol (like the full size M&P 22), so I've never had the thread protector cap off.  It also has an ambidextrous manual thumb safety, right handed but reversible magazine release switch, and an internal safety (keys included).

This was the first gun I ever purchased. Its a Perfect 1st gun since it is a Single shot and you Hand feed it one at a time. So, it is about as safe as you can have for teaching etc... It shoots and Ejects ANY .22 shell you put it in Perfectly. Never have I had a Misfire nor any eject problems with this gun. I have been shooting a lot of ""No Powder"" cartridges in the yard and it is a Blast =0)
It does have some type of Mounting Groove, but I have never mounted a scope on it. 
The gun is MISSING Rear Sight RISER, but if you try you can probably find or even make one; I just put a penny under it. Text me if you are interested 770 54zero 4nine34.
I really dont ""Want"" to sell it, but for $100 CASH, I will let it go  =0(

I will be happy to throw in a Few  boxes of .22 ammo as well; .22lr, shorts and some of those quiet ""No Powder""  shells. That's get you shooting right away!
Thanks,

This rifle has matching numbers (force matched) as can be seen in the pictures.  The bore is in great shape and is not counterbored.  The stock is in good shape and not beat to death.  I bought this just before Christmas for $160 plus tax so I'm asking $160.  That means I'm losing what I paid for tax, but I figure it was worth that much to take to the range for a day.  I just found a Finnish M39 so the wife doesn't see the need for me to have both.  I have taken this to the range once and it performed well.  It does shoot a little high like every Mosin ever built.
