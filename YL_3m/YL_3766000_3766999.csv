The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward. This is a special order item and IS NOT STOCKED IN OUR STORE.

I will not be asking for new in box prices for used guns. However I expect a reasonable market price then we can both agree on. 

I have:
Classic 1950's Walther PP's in 22LR, 32 ACP, and 380.
The 1970 Marlin brace set of 1000. Matching brother set in unfired Mint cond.
Multiple 357 revolvers: Taurus 608, Smith 686.
Multiple Rem 700 in 308 with some beautiful scopes. 

If interested, serious offers only. I know a fair amount of guns and their values. Please no lowball offers. 
Thanks for looking!

(1) Colt 6721 Upper receiver ($500)
          Bought from a prior owner who had fired only 200 rounds through it. He was prior enlisted so I the gun seems to have been well maintained. Reason for the sell is because Maryland State Police told me that I can not own a lower receiver unless I am 21. So I have no use for the upper receiver. I have placed some CLP on the moving parts and will add more upon shipping or do the complete opposite, whatever you prefer. I have not fired any rounds through this yet (minus what the previous owner shot), so it has yet to even be broken in.

(1) Spike's Lower Receiver Parts kit ($50)
         Original price is $66, but I doubt anyone will buy it for that price so I am taking $16 off of Bud's price. All necessary components are their to put into a lower receiver, minus the buffer, buffer spring, and buffer tube. Original seal is broken, but that was just to make sure all the pieces were there, once again I did not use the part kit in anyway.

(1) Advanced Technology (ATI) AR-15 Military Assembly $30
        Here is a never touched kit to finish off your lower receiver. Contents contain a buffer, buffer spring, and a buffer tube to pair with the Spike's lower part kit. Never used kit and original price on Bud's is $46.68 so you save a bit.

XM855 American Eagle 5.56 ammunition $60
   Bought this stuff at Wal-Mart for $70 impulse purchase as I thought I would be owning an Ar-15. 

(2) CAA 30 round AR-15 magazines 
        Never used magazines, however I did load both to kind of get a feel for how they would load, not to mention I was expecting to use them. Both for $30.



All parts are at a reduced price so I can just sell these parts. I have no use for them as I can not purchase a rifle in pieces, which make no sense to me whatsoever, but I digress. Please take these parts off of me as I am a college student who thought he was getting a deal building his own AR-15. I guarantee you, that there is nothing wrong with these parts. I am hoping to sell everything together, but will consider selling items separately."

The rifle itself has less than 300 rounds fired.
 I did some upgrades and swapped out the basic handguards for 13 inch YHM handguards and had a gunsmith install a YHM low profile gas block. I added an adjustable Magpul CTR stock. The basic birdcage flashhider was replaced with a YHM flashider. A new trigger spring kit was added, making the trigger light and smooth. Finally, I added a Badger Ordinance tactical latch and dual single point sling adapter.

The PM9 is Kahr's premium line.  It has a very nice match grade barrel with polygonal rifling.  It's a striker fired pistol.  It is perfect for concealed carry.  The trigger pull is a little long, but extremely light and smooth with a clean break.  The feed ramp has a mirror polish on it.  It includes one 6rd flush fit mag and one 7rd extended mag + plus a lock for the trigger (all in the original plastic box).  These have a MSRP of $786.  I was super excited to get my hands on this, but then had a chance to get a Sig P938 just a couple weeks later.  I spent a lot of trigger time behind both of them over the holiday.  The Kahr is more accurate, and with a better stock trigger than the Sig.  The thing that won me over if the fact that I can tweak the Sig to my preferences (lighten the trigger, change grips, etc...) and the Kahr is pretty much exactly what it will always be.  You won't see too many of these come across the block, because most people that get one are fairly devoted fans.  There are LOTS of sites with more information about them, and you are welcome to ask me any questions you might have.

Over the last four decades, the 75 became the most widely used handgun among police and military worldwide and ranks in the top two most copied handgun designs ever. To celebrate the anniversary, CZUB set their master engraver, Rene Ondra, to the task of creating a special pistol for the occasion. Each pistol is hand-engraved in the Czech Republic in true old-world style, with a hammer pushing the engraver’s tool through each minute detail of the art decorating the slide and frame, which are then polished and finished in a deep, glossy blue. The controls, extractor, grip screws and magazine baseplate are finished in a rainbow titanium nitride, an attractive and extremely tough finish. Lest there are any concerns about the durability of this finish, this is the same type of finish that is applied to drill bits to extend their working life up to three times those without the coating. To finish off the look, smooth, high-grade California birds-eye Maple grips are added. Dyed to match the hues of the frame and controls, the grips seem otherworldly, looking less like wood and more like a snapshot sent to Earth from the Hubble Space Telescope. Chambered in 9mm, the 40th Anniversary Limited Edition ships in a leather-bound presentation case with two 16-round magazines. Only 1000 pieces will be produced, each individually numbered and accompanied by a certificate of authenticity. We have been guaranteed 25 of the 1,000 manufactured and are accepting pre-orders. 26 of our 50 confirmed pistols have been sold as of 4/02/15.  The Shipping cost on this firearm is a flat rate of $35, so $10 more than standard to cover actual shipping cost."

- 5  Magazines ( 30rd. 7.62x39mm ) 
- Bayonet and Sheath ( Bayonet has been sharpened and pointed )
- Leather Sling 
- Leather Magazine Pouch  
- Cleaning Kit 
- I created a very simple and comfortable cheek guard for the wire stock ( purchased copper tube styrofoam insulation from home depot and cut to size, works very nicely ) 


Some information about this rifle: 

- The VZ2008 is a surplus parts kit that has been assembled by Century Arms and sold online and in store by many retailers 

- Although the VZ2008 looks very similar to an AK47, the only thing it shares in common is the caliber it fires, the 7.62x39mm ( Magazines are NOT interchangeable with AK47 ) 

- This gun is a Czechoslovakian design from the 1950's that is still in used to this day by the Czech republic as well as Slovakia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vz._58 ) 


Technical Information about rifle: 

- It is a milled receiver that is lighter and more accurate than the AK47 

- Folding wire stock makes this rifle very compact and convenient for storage and transportation 

- The gun has a bolt open feature on the last round  

- The handguard is made of a wood/polymer mixture and as such, after a few magazines tends to get hot. This can be easily modified by replacing the wood, or adjusting your grip closer to the magazine


Feedback: 

-There are many reviews of this rifle, the VZ2008 online, and I can try and provide you with a number of different sources to read through, but a simple search on youtube for VZ2008 or a google search will bring up everyone's experience

- I can tell you that the rifle I have has been 100% reliable when I have been shooting it, and while I haven't put thousands of rounds through it, I have put over 150 rounds and not experienced one problem

- First video when searching VZ2008 on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXtO7KLip9M

- First website review when seraching VZ2008: http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2013/10/04/vz2008-vs-700-rounds/




Information about this specific rifle: 

- I have taken this gun out to the range and fired 150 rounds through it to test functionality of magazines and firearm ( 30rds x 5 magazines ) It was 100% reliable, with very powerful spent casing ejecting many feet away from shooter

- I was able to hit pop cans at 35-45 yards one first/second shot with this rifle, sights are dead on 

- Much lighter than any AK47 I have ever shot, and surprisingly accurate and ate all 150 rds. fired through it with no issues ( I used Tula purchased from Walmart for the test ) 

- Folding stock took a little while of practice to get right, but now I am able to open and close it with no effort ( The stock opens and closes the same when the cheek guard is on as well )



**IMPORTANT** Starting after January 1st, 2013, Michigan Law regarding folding stocks on long guns has changed. This weapon was purchased after Jan 1st, 2013 and thus falls under the new legal terms for a long rifle. It meets the criteria set in the law which is the following: 

- The rifle is AT LEAST 26"" in over all length WITH the stock folded or contracted And the barrel is AT LEAST 16"" in length


(^What the above means is that this firearm is considered the same as any other Long gun, and what what means is it can be sold/purchased via private buyer in similar fashion, thus why this is being posted here instead of the Handgun forum)


Reason why I am selling: 

I am trying to get back what I put into this rifle when I purchased it so I can convert the cash into another AR15 purchase. I am looking for serious buyers who are willing to meet me, or be very close to the price I am asking, and as such, I would request that only serious offers within the ballpark of my request contact me. I am willing to drive within an hour of Farmington Hills to try and help the sale/purchase of this firearm.

Digital Camouflage is the outcome of applying engineering psychology with the study of visual biophysics and human visual performance.The pattern is made up of small micropatterns, optically reducing the eye's ability to detect and discern what it covers.Various digital patterns are developed and used for the U.S. Military to make more effective concealment for the men and women who go in harms way to protect our freedom.

A cornerstone model in Spyderco's Save and Serve line up is the C36 Military Model meeting the requirements of a high-performance, light-weight folder designed for hard use. Since the steel is the spirit of the knife, CPM S30V seemed the logical choice for the blade given its reputation for long-term edge retention and rust resistance. The 'Millie' has a modified clip-point blade laser cut with a 14 mm Spyderco Round Hole for quick deployment and for use with gloves. Texturing above the hole hold the thumb in contact with the blade's spine during cutting for confident control over the sharpened edge. The handle scales are Digital Camouflage G-10 with the lock's liner nested (inlayed) directly into the scale, pumping up lock strength without the addition of bulky liners. Spacers between the scales create a gap running the handle's full length exposing the inside workings for inspection and cleaning.

""The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.""

514,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3766514,For Sale:  Black Ops Tactical Sniper Pellet Rifle Professional Grade w/ Upgraded Crosman Scope,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 120,"Listed On: Monday, December 1, 2014",Air,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I bought this air rifle a month ago for $150 from Wal-Mart of all places after spending months studying different types of air rifles, brands, mechanisms, reading reviews, etc. When I bought it, it was only available on the Wal-Mart website. Now it is listed as sold out and I can't find any at local stores. However, I noticed Amazon is now selling this air rifle for about $150 + shipping. 

I was surprised by the overwhelmingly positive reviews that I read on Wal-Mart's website and was suspicious at first, considering I had never heard of the company this air rifle is sold by, ""Ignite"" or ""Black Ops."" It had a perfect 5 star rating with over 30 reviews and having just recently been introduced on Amazon currently has a perfect 5 star rating there as well. 

I was willing to spend over $200, but this rifle is better BY FAR in all categories than well known air rifles from commonly known brands in the same price range. It is a spring piston, break barrel, 1000 FPS, 0.177 cal, fully adjustable stock and bipod. It comes with a 4x32 scope that is very accurate, surprisingly so for a stock scope that probably isn't worth more than $20. 

Nonetheless, I felt the caliber (as in excellence) of the weapon warranted an upgrade. So, a week later I bought a new Crosman 3-9x32mm scope with a zoom dial allowing 3x to 9x magnification, making it perfect for hunting and long distance target practice. This scope comes with a red/green dual illumination mil-dot reticle that has the option of 5 brightness settings for both green or red. Holds zero extremely well, and is tough enough to withstand the recoil for a break barrel rifle like this but is also commonly used as a scope for .22 rifles. This air rifle is easily accurate from 100 yards+ and the upgraded scope makes that number closer to 200 yards or more. While it is listed as 1000 FPS (using quality 0.177 pellets as heavy as JSB Match Exact Diabolo airgun pellets weighing in at 8.44gr or slightly lighter pellets such as Crosman Premier Hollow Point hunting pellets) I have read reports that is more in the range of 1000-1200 FPS. If you're using non-lead pellets that usually weigh about 4gr give or take you can expect even higher FPS. I've killed multiple squirrels using this weapon, and it's so accurate and powerful I've never missed or had to finish one off. The only reason I am selling it is I am behind on court ordered restitution payments and need the money, so I'm basically selling just about anything of value I own. Will ship anywhere in the US, though it would certainly be easier if someone local wanted to buy it. If you live in the OKC area give or take 30-50 miles I am willing to drive to you for the sale. 

As I mentioned this is essentially a brand new air rifle, comes with instruction manual, upgraded scope (and stock scope if you want it as well), allen wrenches for adjustments, and I'll even throw in all my pellets including Predator Polymag pellets with sharp pointed polymer tips for maximum penetration (value $18/200 ct), Crosman Hollow Point hunting pellets (value $8/500 ct), JSB Diabolo Exact pellets (value $13/500 ct), and some Gamo Rocket Ballistic Tip pellets (value $5/150 ct) if you want them for no extra charge (all tins have AT LEAST half the pellets remaining, though 75% is more accurate. Bottom line, plenty of pellets to find the perfect match for you). 

As for the price, considering it is basically brand new with original box, manual, less than 100 pellets shot and based on the only other two I have seen sold online I value the stock air rifle (without upgraded scope) at $125 and considering the value of the upgraded scope which is listed at over $70 (but was purchased by me for slightly less), I'd value the entire package (rifle, upgraded scope, all original packaging) at the base price of $150. That said, I need to get rid of it within a couple months so the price is $120 + shipping (if not a local sale).

The MidwayUSA Scoped Rifle Case is a heavy-duty solution for anyone looking for a rifle case. These cases have been engineered with an internal, adjustable retention strap to provide exceptional protection for rifles. These cases are constructed with an advanced dual density bonded padding system that provides superior impact protection compared to basic foam used in other cases. The heavy duty padding is over 1"" thick on both sides to protect your rifle and optics investment from rough handling in storage or travel. Other enhanced durability features include heavy duty, 600D high-abrasion resistant ballistic fabric construction, and oversized self repairing coil zippers with sewn pull tabs. Lay flat construction allows this case to stay open on the shooting bench for ease removing your rifle, or as a padded surface to lay the gun on during breaks in the action. The fully wrapped webbing handles, reinforced seam stitching, metal hardware, adjustable shoulder strap and snag-proof 600 Denier lining fabric make the MidwayUSA Scoped Rifle Case an excellent choice for transporting your sporting rifles.

It was made in Bejing, China and is a pre-ban weapon. Purchased in 1988. I suspect that if you are looking at this ad you probably know the significance of this rifle. It is widely considered the cream of the crop in AK circles.
This one has been lightly shot and is in great shape, as the pictures attest to. I do not have the box anymore but I did manage to keep the manual. It has all original furniture and accessories with it...bi-pod, bayonet, sling, 2 Polytech magazines w/coupler and bayonet scabbard. The snap on the scabbard is broken and there is a very small bit of light rust on the butt plate. (could probably be buffed out easily)  Other than that it is good to go.

The XD® 5” Full Size is designed to put the most into your hand when you need it. Built on a full size frame with a 5” barrel, this is the XD® that delivers the most in performance, capacity and controllability.

The XD® 5” Full Size has all the same features found in the standard XD® line in a tactically-sized package. This XD® is as easy to shoot as you would expect it to be. The 5” barrel brings you a longer sight radius and decreased shot-to-shot recovery time. The advantages don’t stop with easy shooting, though – the XD® 5” Full Size includes everything that makes Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block give you the safety and usability that you expect in a Springfield Armory® XD®.

It has preformed flawlessly through two two iterations of 1000 rounds a piece. It is built on a stealth PSA. It comes with an Aimpoint M3 for an extra $350. It also comes with 1000 rounds and a brand new pelican case that has not been cut yet. This will give you the freedom to cut it for your carbine and pistol or just your carbine and accessories. It also comes with 5 30 round mags. I am selling this, but will entertain small trades with a cash boot. The rifle with the ammo, mags and case is $1150. If you just want the rifle, it is priced at $700. The case alone is $289.00, and 1000 rounds of Federal is going for $359, so you can see, the package deal is greatly reduced."

The PWS rifle is revolutionary in the AR15 world. It was the first AR15 to have a long-stroke gas piston system. The piston system is very AK47-like, so the reliability is 2nd to none. The bolt carrier group and pistol rod are nickle boron, so they never need lubrication. This rifle is chambered in .223 wylde, which will accept .223 AND 5.56, but will provide more accuracy for .223 compared to shooting .223 out of a 5.56 chamber. The PWS gas system is adjustable for different settings/conditions. The Keymod rail on the rifle allows for multiple attachments. Has magpul flip-up sights. The PWS muzzle break that's pinned and welded on the rifle cuts all recoil from the rifle. Comes with box, manual, gas adjustment tool. Comes with box, manual, lock, warranty car and one 10 round magazine.

 A favorite of many hunters and shooters, the Short Rifle was fast to the shoulder, quick-swinging, lightweight and a pleasure to shoot. It was a favorite of the range rider who could snatch it from his saddle scabbard and fire faster than prairie lightning. The new Winchester® Model 94® Short Rifle has a compact 20"" deeply-blued round barrel and a straight grip walnut stock. It has a rifle-style forearm, black grip cap and a full-length magazine. It’s drilled and tapped for scope mounts, and a hammer spur extension is included with the rifle. The sights are traditional with a semi-buckhorn rear and a Marble Arms® gold bead at the muzzle. With the new Short Rifle Model 94 there’s a lot of fun waiting in the saddle, in the field or at the range.

For sale : Ruger M77 MKII Target Rifle in 204 Ruger . This rifle is capable of driving tacks at 200 yards. It’s had shy of 100 rounds down the tube, the wide target foreend has been slimmed down a tad (not quite sporter thin) and a second sling stud has been added for a bipod.
The rifle has a matte stainless steel finish that resists corrosion. The heavy contour, hammer-forged barrel with target crown provides long-range accuracy. With a one-piece bolt that has proven to be one of the strongest on the market, integral scope bases which can never shoot loose, and a diagonally angled forend screw that adds accuracy by securely pulling the barreled action down into the stock for accurate shooting.
5 round capacity - 6 grooves - 1:12"" RH twist -13.5"" length of pull - Black laminate stock-Matte stainless finish-Target crown - Hinged, solid stainless steel engraved floorplate - Non-rotating, Mauser style controlled round feed extractor.
The scope is a Mueller Eraticator 8.5 – 25 X 50mm with a micro-fine crosshair with illuminated micro-dot, the micro – dot covers less than 1 inch at 200 yards, which means you can still see a half inch ring all the way around a 2 inch circle target at 200 yards. The illumination dial has 11 dot reticle brightness intensity settings, and 1/8-inch fine-tune, windage and elevation adjustments with audible click stops and easy fingertip turrets; no tools required.
Scope is zeroed at 200 yards.
I have both of the original gun and scope boxes.
I figured the rifle’s value at $675.00 and the scope at $175.00, but I will NOT separate them.

For sale I have a complete AK-74 package.

Rifle shoots excellent and functions flawlessly (as AK's are known to do) The only reason I'm selling is I'm looking to get a M1A and I already have a Couple of AR's that will fill the same role as this rifle.

Breakdown of whats included.

AK-74 built by Waffen Werks purchased last year and has 180 rounds through it.

From The Website:

These high quality AK-74 rifles are built from all matching Bulgarian AK-74 parts sets. Rifles are built to exacting standards on a new U.S. made Waffen Werks receiver. Each rifle features a brand new chrome lined U.S. made barrel properly chambered for the 5.45x39 round. They have been extremely accurate.

Rifle features a Tapco G-2 trigger set and a U.S. grip and is fully 922r compliant with all AK-74 mags regardless of country of origin. Rifles also incorporate a side rail for easy installation of scope rails or accessories.

New $619.

AK-74 Accessory package, 4 30rnd parts kits, mag pouch, bayonet and oil bottle. $169

2 Tapco 30rnd parts kits $24

900rnds 7n6 ""banned"" ammo. Full case $240 Since its a partial case I'll value it at $200

AK ergo grip, so you can actually hold the rifle. $20

Kvar O.D. green ""NATO"" length stock, A inch longer to fit us decadent capitalist pigs in the West. I have both the original stock and grip that will go with it. $47

""Venezuelan"" PK-A red dot. A excellent red dot that was built for the Venuzualian Army by the Russians. The great thing about this particular sight it that it uses a regular AA battery and it sits low enough to co-witness the stock AK sights. It also allows a proper cheek weld on the rifle a huge plus. $400

Total price if bought separate $1479

My price $1200. Non negotiable!

No Trades unless your looking to trade a M1A Loaded with a stainless barrel.

I will not break up the package it's all or nothing, sorry I just don't want to deal with all the hassle. I'm in no hurry to sell, I really have no need to sell just trying to diversify my collection so the price is the price. Don't bother contacting me saying ""I found all this stuff at the gun store for $30."" If you did, great, buy it. Don't bother telling me.

You want to do the Dealer thing you line it up, and cover the fees.

I wont travel out of the Denver Metro area so I hope your local or willing to travel.

Sorry to come off like a dick, but I think we all know how this site can be sometimes."

I have removed the factory installed thread protector and installed a proper M92 muzzle device with detent. the gun shoots surprisingly tight groups at 50 yards and never had a FTF or FTE, low round count around 200. comes with 2 magpul ak mags and 2 tapco all 30-round. I sanded and oiled the handguard for a nicer look and feel and installed a magpul pistol grip. this is a solid, accurate, well made gun and is a absolute blast to shoot. you won't be disappointed! also comes with a 29"" tactical case that fits it perfectly. the price reflects cost of parts installed and no low offers please.

This sale includes the rifle, all upgraded parts listed ( sight in picture does not come with it ) and 2 magazines.

Troy Industries Modular Combat Grip ( 70$ grip )
Single Point Sling + Single Point Mount ( 75$ )

The rifle itself is a 1000$ rifle ( I actually paid 1100$ but have seen them at 1000$ before ).

I've also replaced the gas piston with one from Tapco USA. This does have the original sporting-configuration trigger group. Comes with four 10-round magazines: 2 AGP magazines (1 pictured), and 2 Pro-mags. I also have the original 5-round Russian magazine that comes with it. I've put about 250 rounds through this, mostly game loads.

Will trade for a Sig P938 (Scorpion or Rainbow preferred), Sig P238 (Scorpion or Rainbow preferred), or Sig full-size (government) 1911 with rail, ambidextrous safety, and night sights, Scorpion model preferred but will consider others. Will also consider government-size Springfield 1911s (MC operator model preferred) with the same requirements as Sig 1911s (must have rail, ambidextrous safety, night sights).
