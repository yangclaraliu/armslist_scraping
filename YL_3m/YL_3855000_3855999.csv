Let's get that out of the way. 

First up, Remington 870 20 gauge. Gun is like new. I think it's had 100 rounds through it. $235

Second, is a PTR 91. This is a fantastic rifle...made to HK specs on HK tooling. This is the GI model with should eat any 308 you throw at it. I've seen recent production versions where the finish on the metal parts didn't seem to match. This one was made in 2011 and finish matches well throughout. I've shot probably 50 rounds through it. It's basically as new. It comes with all the paperwork, factory hard case, factory magazine, & I'll throw in 4 additional mags. $950

Last up, is a 1943 Tula 91/30 Ex sniper. Excellent bore, and no counterbore. Matching numbers. Come with numbers matching bayonet as well. (should be able to notice the scope mount holes on inner receiver picture) Great candidate to turn back into a sniper, or leave as is as a collector. $190"

The On Duty combines the qualities of the Undercover Lite and the Off Duty but with a convenient twist—a unique hammer block design.

This allows single-action and double-action operations while minimizing the risk of snagging the hammer on your clothing.

Constructed of heat-treated aluminum, this 5-shot .38 Special features a 2” barrel and weighs only 12 oz.

Comfortable and versatile the On Duty is a great choice for conceal and carry use.

Plus I will include a Blackhawk pocket holster and a Blackhawk check six molded holster. I also have the original case and all paperwork. If full price is paid I will include 40 rounds LRN, 15 rounds of Federal Premium 125 gr NYCLAD HP and 25 rounds Hornady Critical Defense. 
Everything included was over $750. Less then one year old and less then 100 rounds through the gun.

Description from their website:

CVA Electra .50 cal Black Powder Rifle. The Electra is the most innovative muzzleloader to ever hit the market. This is the gun that will revolutionize muzzleloading. It is the first of its kind to use an electronic ignition, making it the most-reliable, fastest-loading and easiest-to-clean muzzleloader ever made. The patent-pending ARC™ electronic ignition eliminates the need for a primer. The ignition is completely sealed from the elements and requires no flash hole, ensuring superior reliability no other muzzleloader can duplicate. No parts other than the barrel ever have to be cleaned because of fouling. The ignition is instantaneous, and since there is no pressure explosion, as there is with primer ignitions, there is no accuracy-robbing displacement of the charge. This allows a full, consistent burn of the powder charge at the bottom of the barrel. The trigger pull is incredibly clean because the trigger is actually an electronic switch. One 9-volt battery will reliably fire the rifle at least 500 times. All Electras are equipped with a premium Bergara barrel for tack-driving accuracy. Includes a 3x32 Bushnell scope with base and rings.

the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

***** SOLD *

1938 (pre-WW2) Izhmash round receiver Mosin Nagant 91/30.  All original with all matching serial numbers.  

The rifle is a shooter.  It is ""salad plate accurate"" at 200 yards with spam-can surplus ammo.  It is a great gun for someone with only an FID card or someone just entering the world of centerfire shooting. 

There's NO RUST anywhere. The stock's in decent shape. The bore is a bit dark but has STRONG rifling.  I've put several hundred rounds through the pipe and never had a failure to fire.  Since I've owned the gun, it has been meticulously cleaned and stored.

Asking $150 for the rifle and accessories.   Included are bayonet, oiler can, bolt adjustment tool, cleaning rod guide, and ammo pouch.  For an additional $100, I'll include a 1970's spam can (440 rounds) of 148 grain silvertip ammo.  I can sell this rifle via eFA-10, or transfer at an FFL (Hitman Firearms, Four Seasons, or Blue Northern) on buyer's expense.  Serious buyers are welcome to test fire the rifle. 

Thank you for looking."

The serial number verifies the manufacture to be circa 1920.  The rifle operates great and shoots true, a pleasure to fire.  The wood is inlaid with unknown materiel and design; but rather unique. The rifle uses a rotary magazine to hold the cartridges. The rotating magazine uses a spring-loaded spool with grooves to hold the cartridges. The Savage 1899 took advantage of the spool to include a counter to indicate how many shots are left.  Another novel safety feature is that upon cocking the rifle, a small pin protrudes above the top receiver to indicate the rifle is cocked and ready to fire. Asking $650.00 obo."

Here is the description from Remington's website:
OVERVIEW:
The most durable hunting rifle ever built. Featuring our TriNyte® Corrosion Control System, the introduction of the Model 700 XCR in 2005 stretched the previous durability limits of stainless steel. And for 2010, the Model 700 XCR II is redefining its looks as well. The stainless steel barrel and receiver are now coated with matte black TriNyte for a more classic look with less glare for superior stealth. It's every bit as impervious to extreme conditions, with the same proven track record in accelerated saltwater testing that opened the world's eyes to the power of our patented technology. Simply put, TriNyte delivers scratch and corrosion resistance dramatically superior to standard stainless steel as well as any protective coating by any other manufacturer.

Visit the NEW Remington 700 Network website

The Model 700 XCR II is also optimized for sure handling in adverse climates. Its feature-laden olive drab green synthetic stock is a technological marvel that looks and feels the part with patented Hogue® rubber overmolding featured at the grip and fore-end areas. These revolutionary enhancements give you a positive grip in the slickest environments. And shots are made infinitely more comfortable with our SuperCell™ recoil pad - the most effective on the market today. Our X-Mark Pro® Trigger System gives you a level of crispness and shot control once only available through high-dollar customization. Choose from a wide range of hard-hitting big-game cartridges, all delivered with the track-driving accuracy only a legendary Model 700 barreled action could produce.

KEY FEATURES:
Proprietary TriNyte Corrosion Control System provides unprecedented corrosion resistance
Stock features patented rubber overmolding technology from Hogue on grip and fore-end

For sale today is a Marlin Glenfield 75c in excellent condition!  This is a .22LR semi-automatic rifle with manual safety and a high 14+1 capacity tube magazine.  It's very similar to the Model 60, but it has a shorter barrel.  This rifle includes the remainder of a 325 round box of round-nose 40grain ammo.  I believe a little more than 300 rounds remain.

This is a great shooting rifle!  The first time I took it to the range with a paper target, most of the holes had at least two bullets through them.  It's very accurate and fun to shoot.  Takedown is very simple, with just two screws to loosen to take the barrel off and one pin to pull by hand to take the action out.

This rifle has a BRAND NEW buffer installed, and the action assembly was reassembled and tweaked to improve the feeding system.  It hasn't given a single malfunction since then.

The stock is in very good condition, showing only a couple of very minor superficial scratches.  The action and barrel show hardly any signs of wear at all.

With the included ammo and new parts, this rifle is for sale for $199 or best offer, or make a trade!

Thanks again for looking, and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask!"
