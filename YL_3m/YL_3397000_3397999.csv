This gun has everything from the factory including Trijicon Night Sights
The 3” Sub-Compact from Springfield Armory® is designed to bring you the most in a concealed carry pistol. Its superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and astonishing capacity combine to put more into a concealable pistol than you will find anywhere else. When you add Trijicon® night sights, it’s ready for anything.

The XD® Sub-Compact has all the same features found in the standard XD® line, but in a smaller package. The barrel is 3” and the frame is a short, compact size that will let the pistol nearly disappear when you carry it. Like other XD® pistols, the 3” Sub Compact gives you great versatility when it’s used with X-Tension™ magazines. Enjoy 13+1 rounds of 9mm with standard flush-fitting magazines. Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 16+1 rounds of 9mm. You’ll find everything on the 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield XD™s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®. Trijicon® 3-Dot night sights give you the peace of mind that even in low-light conditions, acquiring a sight picture will be no problem.

If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for a 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range. With Trijicon® night sights, it’s also at home on the night stand.

Hey all,

I have a really old German Mauser 25 auto pistol that I picked up in trade. I got it with the intent of doing some work on it and having it be a new caliber, but I have had some things come up that will be eating too much of my time. So, i would rather pass it along and let someone else enjoy her themselves. It is a model 1914 Mauser 25 acp. The serial number dated it to around 1916-17 (best i could tell at least). It is actually a comparatively low serial number (5 digit serial). It is in average/decent condition for its age but not “terrible” compared to what I’ve seen elsewhere. Has heavy bluing wear, dings, and a crack in grip, but is still a decent looking gun. The main issue this one has is that it jams up feeding/ejecting almost every shot. It is possibly as simple as replacing a spring or giving it a really good polishing on the feed ramp/throat. It could even be that the only 25 auto ammo i had to test her with was some cheap/older blazer stuff, which i have had some issues with in other guns. Either way, I simply don’t have the time to get her “fixed up” or i would and then keep her (or sell for double! haha). I know that in this condition and shooting fine they sell for substantially more than what I am asking. Also, I have found most replacement parts online from normal places, so this could be a fun and easy little project!

I would also consider trades for most any gun. Mainly looking for a 12 gauge pump (prefer moss berg, but will consider others) that I can “modify” and turn into a “tactical” shotgun (i know, i know). Would also trade for 7.62x25 tokarev pistols, Kel Tec carry pistols, nagant revolver, or even 44 magnum ammo or a lot of 7.62x54R or 6.5x55 swede ammo. Honestly, just shoot me an offer and we can go from there. Worst i can say is no!
Thanks all and happy hunting!

The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability.

You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

Will do straight trade or can add cash for the right trade or cash on your end. For the people that don't like Taurus witch I know there's a lot lol.

This is a  Maadi AKM imported by century arms, it's not exactly in the best condition so I am selling it for a low price. It comes with one 30 round magazine three 40 round magazines and one 5 round magazine. It does not have a threaded muzzle or a muzzle brake  though as far as I can tell the sights or gas block are not canted, the wood furniture on the rifle is pretty nice. The biggest problem the rifle has is with it's trigger, when you pull it back straight forward it will not release the hammer, it will only make a click sound because it keeps catching the hammer, unless you pull it in a specific way, it is likely in need of a new trigger. There is no mag wobble in this rifle either."

The XD® pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for polymer pistols. The XD® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD® 4” Full Size is the original XD® offering from Springfield Armory®, and the most basic XD®. This is the XD® that started it all. If you’re looking for a pistol that maximizes your pleasure on the shooting range, you can get the XD® 4” Full Size with Springfield’s V-10 porting.

The XD® 4″ Full Size has a four inch barrel and a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and accuracy you’d expect from a standard sized pistol. All Springfield Armory® XD®’s have several features that make the XD® easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator let you know without a doubt, by touch and by feel, whether or not the pistol is loaded and cocked. The grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, and the firing pin block safety combine to prevent accidental discharges. V-10 porting reduces muzzle flip and perceived recoil to such an incredible extent that you won’t believe you’re shooting a centerfire pistol.

Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See how it all started and check out the XD® 4” Full Size V-10 Ported. Where you point is where you shoot.

It did develop a tiny bit of rust on the bolt handle's checkering at one point, but that was quickly caught and dealt with.  This gun has been used, and as such has a few imperfections, but all are mild, and I absolutely love to shoot it.  Just decided it was time to move up to a bigger caliber, and am selling this one to fund the next.

You WILL NOT GET ANOTHER F'n red Penny from me or my friends, nor will I ever send one more person to your store. Not becuase of your quality, or prices.. Just for shear NASTY ATTITUDES you perpetuate there.. 

 I have been a customer of yours since your 1st shop by the bridge, have sent many customers to you, and refered many to you, and we have all boughten many items, and ammo in your store, to support local buisness... and never had an issue.....
  Well,,,, NO MORE.....Appearantly you have forgotten how you got where you are... But, I am pretty sure your NASTY, DEGRADING, PISSY, CAN""T BE BOTHERED ATIITUDES, will keep you in buisnesss... But as a buisness owner myself, I would NEVER talk down, or ignore, or make a customer or potential customer feel unwanted for any reason, or make them feel they are bothersome for asking a question...But, I guess now that the wife is riunning the show, it's OK to treat your customers like shit, even though they, their friends and their referals have spent thousands of dollars in your stores...Seems like the only people you have time for, is the ones that sit around your store all day acting like they know shit, with the same shitty ATTITUDE AS YOURS! Well, I will make the extra travel to be treated right somewhere else now, even if I don't buy something on that day.... So you, your wife and the rest of your SHITTY crew can take a flying leap, and I would be guessing, if your SHITTY way of treating people doesn't improve, you may not be in buisness very much longer.... Good luck with that....Because I am sure not the first to say it. My LAST trip there about 2 weeks ago, your employee had done the same to a group from NJ, and when they left they were talking about it out at their car. parked next to me..the statement was, I don't know how the firing range can be so different in attitude from the store, but probably will be looking for someplace else next time around....Nice job 707 Gun SNOBS..

 You have become EXACTLY what you told me almost 10 years ago, you didn't like about other gun shops! SNOBS!
