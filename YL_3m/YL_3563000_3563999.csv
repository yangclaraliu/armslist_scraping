FYI this will be a great tack driver with the Night Sites and Laser it would be a perfect bed room gun as I say why shoot 2 times with 45ACP all you need is one round they don't get up.

I am always open to trades but I will only value your gun based on Gun Blue Book not what you paid for it new so if you have any high end Sig's Kimbers AR's (Bushmaster of DPMS Oricales) let me know all I can say is no thanks!!!

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...). You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. Taurus also makes a small caliber tip barrel design, but has a much heavier trigger (due to being double action). The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $155 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven."

They are both brand new in box and have yet to be fired.
The first is a Smith and Wesson M&P Bodyguard. This is the new .380 Bodyguard that was released this year to replace the old model. Has two mags, one with a flush baseplate and the other with a finger extension. Comes with original box, soft carrying case, and a box of Sig Sauer Elite Performance hollow points.
The second is a little interesting, a Zastava M70a. Essentially, it is a modern manufacture Yugo M57 Tokarev chambered in 9x19mm. These are not old beater surplus guns but brand new CNC manufactured pistols made by Zastava in Serbia. You get the looks and function of a Tokarev in a brand new pistol that has a functional slide safety and is chambered in a cartridge that is readily available. This comes with a nice hard case and two (8rd) magazines.
As I said, looking to make a trade with these two pistols for a Sig Sauer P938. Would prefer a rosewood or blackwood model, but finish is not a big deal as long as it isnt something outlandish.

Nice Glock 34 gen 3 (9mm) with Crimson Trace laser, upgraded trigger, and an extended slide release. Gun comes with 2 mags.

All upgrades completed by a certified Glock gunsmith. Trigger is very smooth and crisp, and noticeably lighter than standard Glock 34s. The upgrades make this gun an incredible shooter. I easily wear out the center of targets with the gun.  No issues with it ever, just looking for something different. 

Prefer to sell. I will consider good trades though. Over $300 in upgrades. Asking $600.

Price is $1575. That is a fair price for the extras and what it took to built this brand new (1700). If you're looking for a DPMS, Bushmaster etc, this isn't for you. If you want a quality AR you will never have to get rid of and will last you for years to come, this is it. BCM lowers do not come on the market often and when they do, they are snatched up quick. BCM barrels are rated for 20,000+ rounds so it's at 99.7% right now haha.

Any questions can be directed through text or call at 740-358-6one87. Text preferred but calling is fine. 
**Will only sell to those 18 years of age and older, valid DL and non-felons.**

Ultra-fast. Ultra-reliable. Ultra-lightweight. It's no wonder the 85s are our most popular family. We pack them with a combination of customer-requested features and pair them with the .38 Special +P ammo making them powerful, easy to carry and lightning-quick to use. To many of our friends in Law Enforcement, these are must-have revolvers.

Plus P
Plus P rated for duty use. This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications.

Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

The price is firm. This weapon is perfect for Home Defense. With the 18 1/2"" barrel you can maneuver around the doors and hallway of your home. Protect Yourself. Don't expect anyone else to protect your home, property or family in a break-in situation, as the response time for assistance takes too long. I very recently had about $1000 worth of stuff stolen by my garage. I figured I would just call the insurance company and they would take care of my loss. NOPE, The theft deductible is 1% of the value of your home. So if you have a $200,000 home, the 1st $2000 comes out of your pocket, so I got nothing back for my loss. I will tell you that now if someone breaks into my home or steals from me, I will shoot to kill....not shoot to wound. I don't want them coming back later. A shotgun shell is less than 50 cents and that is now my new insurance policy in addition to my homeowners insurance against theft.

The Ghost Ring Sights model runs an additional $35.00 + over the bead sight model and is favored. This model is not carried by Walmart as they only sell the cheaper model. Be legal to buy a shotgun and have your FL drivers license with you. I will fill out a bill of sale.

Also included with the pistol is a hard case, one 12 round double stack magazine, 200 rds of Sellier & Bellot 95 gr FMJ brass case ammunition, and an additional 16 lbl recoil spring made by Wolff.

When the hammer is cocked, the pistol will reset to double action mode after the trigger is squeezed about 50% of the time. While it does still fire without fail in double action mode, it would not be accurate to say this pistol is fully functional while this issue is still present. I have seen that resolving this could be a simple matter of replacing a worn trigger sear, but I do not have the know-how to do so.

This unit is a CA Model. The only difference is it comes with a 10 round magazine and a bullet button. If you do not lice in CA this could be changed for less than $30.
The new Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, V9  Strength to Weight was designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications.  The DDM4v9 S2W is equipped with an 18” S2W profile Cold Hammer Forged barrel, covered by the DDM4 Rail™ 15.0, gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing overtravel when swinging between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick but precise rapid fire.  The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

Manufacturer’s Description: 
By combining all the features of the Ultra CDP II™ with a full-length grip, the Ultra+ CDP II™ .45 ACP is the ideal carry pistol for shooters with large hands. Built entirely in the Kimber Custom Shop,™ features like night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety and 30 LPI checkering on the front strap and under the trigger guard are standard. The 3-inch match grade bull barrel is ramped, has a match grade chamber and is fitted directly to the slide. A Carry Melt™ treatment rounds and blends edges so they do not snag clothing or holsters, and the ejection port is beveled at both front and rear so ejecting brass clears easily. Other important additions include a match grade trigger, stainless steel small parts, checkered front strap and elegant double diamond rosewood grips. Adding these features while the pistol is being built reduces the price by over $500, making it an incredible value. Quality, dependability and power are everything in a carry pistol. The Ultra+ CDP II adds additional control to that equation.

Item G-I-7526

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.
The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand.

This unit is a CA Model. The only difference is it comes with a 10 round magazine and a bullet button. If you do not lice in CA this could be changed for less than $30.
The new Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, V9  Strength to Weight was designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications.  The DDM4v9 S2W is equipped with an 18” S2W profile Cold Hammer Forged barrel, covered by the DDM4 Rail™ 15.0, gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing overtravel when swinging between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick but precise rapid fire.  The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

I have a Norinco SKS with a 30rd mag. Pretty much stock with an upgraded Dragunov stock installed, buffer and quad rails as extras.  Stock is worth about $80+, 30rd mag was $20, buffer was $10 and quad rails are $20+ so that's a good amount of extras for $400.00. It is accurate and doesn't feature the infamous canted sights, its FUN and range-ready. I will also admit its a older firearm so please don't expect a fully-restored or brand new SKS.

It is an all matching 1953, blueing is excellent and so is the wood. No major scratches or dings. Bore is dark but lands are very visible. I bought the rifle about 3 years ago, put 20 rounds through it and it has been stored in my closet ever since. Muzzle has slight wear from opening bayonet I'm assuming. Will come with sling. I see these getting bids on Gunbroker for $500+ so this is a very reasonable price. Do not email me saying that it is worth $250 because you see russian ones for that price, once again this one is Polish and much harder to find feel free to do some research yourself.
