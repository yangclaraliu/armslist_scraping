This pistol is in solid 95% shape, which is incredible for its age. The internals are even better, looking like it has barely ever been fired. In addition to be a must have for any serious HK collector, the small size, light weight and fixed barrel accuracy makes this a very viable option as a carry pistol.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY, IMPORTANT INFO & DETAILS BELOW:

This Rifle is basically a HK-91 with a different name on the receiver, it was originally a C91 Sporter imported by Century Arms, it always performed great and reliably but i became obsessed with it & wanted it to be perfect with all HK parts so everything except for the receiver has been replaced with genuine HK parts from Germany with HK Parts Kits & several nice upgrades including the HK Machine Gun Buffer Assembly, properly mounted HK Muzzle Brake/Compensator, a great buttpad that was $100 extra and all of those items significantly reduce recoil. The Trigger Group has been professionally tuned by a HK Expert and has a great trigger pull resulting in greatly improved accuracy, plus the complete trigger housing and selector has been upgraded to the Navy Spec Version.  The only reason the reciever wasn't replaced is because it's the much stronger version and in perfect condition. The gun has 5 Magazines and an extra Ammo Can full of extra parts, all HK Stuff- plus it's already got the scope mounted and sighted in plus you can still use the iron sights if you want, they're adjustable from 100-400 yards. The gun has been treated with great care and has been used mainly to shoot at local competitions averaging about 60 Rounds fired per month. Its a solid, reliable rifle and is basically the same thing as getting a HK-91 for a fraction of the price, the main difference is that it doesn't have Heckler & Koch stamped on it, but it's HK on the inside where it counts. The barrel is very nice and the rifling is in great shape, it's ready for thousands and thousands of rounds to be fired through it ACCURATELY. It would be hard to find another one like this out there that has all of these improved & upgraded parts that have been meticulously installed with such attention to detail. This is an excellent rifle in every way, everything is smooth, tight, and it's a great shooting rifle that shoots tight groups and is great for both close range and long distance shooting with the iron sights and scope both ready to use whenever you want,  It's easy to seamlessly transition from the scope to the iron sights. The Ammo Can that included is full of extras including an extra stock & handguard, trigger housing and selector, recoil buffer, new firing pin assembly with spring, etc sealed in package from HK, a New set of Rollers for the action sealed in plastic from HK, along with a Book that's a Complete Guide with everything you could want or need to know about the HK Rifle System, it's very informative with lots of pictures. I am also including a Heavy Duty Tactical Bag that holds the gun plus has extra storage space and 4 Magazine Pouches(not a cheap bag). The Rifle has 2 Picatinny/Weaver Style Rail slots to mount a light, laser, or whatever you desire. This Rifle is Top Quality and is as close to an authentic HK-91 without spending $2500-$3000, and it's basically the same thing with a different name on the receiver, full HK Internals with several upgrades,  be confident about this rifle because it's an awesome weapon with no issues. No Expense Spared, all Top Quality HK Parts with Upgrades & Custom Tuned Trigger & much more, i have $2000 Invested invested in this setup but I'm only asking $1250 and I may negotiate some in person with cash, it's is a great price considering what you get (Precision Built Rifle with HK Parts & Extras) and how much is invested. I had planned on keeping this forever but need a .308/7.62 AR for competition reasons due to changes in the rules for 2015, otherwise I would keep it but i can't afford a .308 AR right now so my loss is your gain. So my asking price is $1250 and i prefer to sell it but will trade for a nice AR Style Rifle in .308/7.62 and would possibly trade for a good AK47, AR15, Nice Pistol in 9mm/.45; ACP with cash.

For the right rifle,I have some items to trade if necessary and may add some cash if necessary but not a large amount.

The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer"

This pistol has been getting rave reviews since it's debut a couple of months ago. I read it had one of the best striker fired triggers on the market and after finally getting my hands on one, I will attest to that. The trigger is right up there with a PPQ or VP9; no creep and a very smooth break. This is a very high quality pistol and you are getting a lot for the money. I definitely want to add one of these to my collection.

Since these are not being imported anymore so they will become rarer to find and will only go up in value. 

Info: Saiga rifles are developed at the Russian Izhmash factory. Saiga’s, share its design with the AK-47 and is a great hunting gun. They were originally intended for hunting medium and big sized game. AK47 IZ-132 rifles are great rifles to do a custom build and can be converted to a higher end AK47.

Finish on the stamped Russian Izhmash receiver is matte black, as is the rest of the metal work. They do not use standard AK mags but it is super easy to make them fit or they will work with the Sure Fire 30 round magazines.  Lots of YouTube videos to show how easy it is to convert it to accept the standard AK 30 round mags or to convert it to a higher end AK47.

The gun is about 4 yrs old, with under 60 rounds thru it, (I'm the original owner.) It has the Knoxx Ultra-Light recoil stock done by the gun shop, not myself.
That is not a suppressor on the barrel, but rather a clamp on muzzel brake with a screw on flash hider. It's made by Grizzly Gunworks and it DOES work as advertised. It completely quashes all the blast from the brake itself so the guy shooting next to you will not be bothered. It could be modified into a suppressor BUT YOU MUST DO YOUR PAPERWORK BEFOREHAND. Now that I've protected myself from legal issues, you can see these at grizzlygunworks dot com,
I will sell the gun without the brake for $700 FIRM, as the price for the gun alone is $658, plus $40 background, and $260 PLUS install for the Knoxx stock. I don't mind keeping the muzzle brake and flash suppressor as it will work with 308, 30.06, etc.
Will consider 30.06 trades. Will also trade for a Chiappa 357 5 inch (no 2 inch).
Will also consider the Taurus 357 608 8 RD  model + boot.
I also have quite a bit of 300 win mag ammo, good stuff that I will sell for chep as part of a deal.

I also have a full starter supply of BRAND NEW top quality .380 practice and personal protection ammo that I'm selling separately. Inquire if you're interested, as I'm willing to sell all of the ammo together with the handgun as a package deal.

This is a new in box gun. Dealer's description and details: 


The new Browning AB3 Composite Stalker gives hunters legendary A-Bolt accuracy and performance, only in a value packed platform. The AB3 Stalker is a rugged, high performance hunting rifle that won't blow a hole in your budget. This rifle features a free floating barrel to eliminate contact interference from the fore end, to provide consistent and repeatable accuracy. A hand reamed chamber increases accuracy even further, and the 60 degree bolt lift is lightnin fast. An Inflex technology recoil pad utilizes directional deflection to bring the stock away from the shooter's face during recoil, which virtually eliminates flinching.

Pictured Bi-Pod NOT included

I bought this new a couple months ago, and have only shot 40 rounds through it.  All ammo shot through it was Federal Gold Medal Match 168gr SMK's.

Accuracy was very good.  At the time I was shooting with the stock trigger, which was standard milspec.  I have since put a Rock River 2 stage National Match trigger in it, but have not taken it to the range since.  It is a great trigger, and should tighten up groups nicely.  The pic of the two groups was 100 yards on the bipod, BEFORE the new trigger.  This is a very nice rifle.  

Only trade I would be interested in would be a SCAR 16 in FDE  or something similar (No AR15s). Otherwise, looking for cash only.  865-712-1656"

It sat in my bag for a while till I bought a new battery and after that I never used it or went to the range at all. The black wear of the paint at the bottom is normal because as I said I mounted it on the upper receiver so it's normal. It was out of the box but it's still in new condition. It works just fine without any issues at all. I tired to sell it to local gun shops but the already have some used scopes and sights so they didn't want more to be added to their stock, so I'm giving a shot here. It's really a good deal for never used sight and it's cheaper than if you buy it from a dealer or even from the website itself. Its for 95.00 $ check the retail price on the sightmark website .
