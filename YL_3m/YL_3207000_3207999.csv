-Daniel Defense 14.5"" CHF 1:7 carbine barrel
-BCM blemish upper receiver
-Colt carry handle rear sight
-VLTOR Gunfighter Mod.3 CH
-KAC M4 RAS
-Colt sling swivel
-FN flash hider

The legit ""been there done that parts"" are the Colt carry handle, KAC M4 RAS, FN A2 flash hider, and Colt sling swivel.

The BCM upper, and VLTOR Gunfighter CH were new parts that I ""fauxed"" by hand.

The Daniel Defense barrel was new, and I didn't have the heart to ""faux"" it, so it's unmolested :)

The A2 FH was a practice piece for pin welding with a shitty arc welder. The barrel, however, was NOT drilled, or welded on, etc. Virgin barrel, and NOT pinned. All NFA rules apply. (I have an extended A2 flash hider available for another $25)

Barrel nut *properly* torqued to 42 pounds using Aeroshell 33MS. Feedramps line up perfect. FSB is nice and straight. KAC M4 RAS is LOCK-SOLID with no wobble whatsoever.

The upper was test fired with 90 rounds of M855, and functioned flawlessly with an H2 buffer. Damn accurate barrel. I chose the DD CHF over the standard Colt to be able to handle a bit more piss & vinegar type shooting. This upper you can confidently throw across your driveway and not feel bad about it. Includes three KAC rail panels as pictured. This would make an ideal upper for a truck gun, ""loaner"" gun, clone piece, paint/cerakote project. Or part the thing out and make some money..."

 * Previously offered only in a set of two- I have a one of the very limited Custom Grade rifle in 405.
  * Theodore Roosevelt – hunter, naturalist, rancher, adventurer, President, Nobel Peace Prize winner – was not only a man of action who changed the world with his farsighted vision. His view of conservation has become the foundation for all great conservation efforts world-wide and his legacy is as strong today as ever.
  * This Model 1895 Winchester rifle set honors this legacy -- 150 years ago marks the birth of Theodore Roosevelt on October 27, 1858.
  * This Custom version has grade 3-4 walnut, beautiful engraving on a blued receiver with extensive gold plating embellishment, extreme polish, tight fits and finishes and more. All coordinated between Winchester Repeating Arms and our custom embellishment partner, Baron Engraving of Connecticut. The High Grade version features similar engraving with a nitride (gray) finish with elegant gold enhancements and grade 2-3 walnut.
  * Rifle is supplied with a complete collector’s package of full color box sleeve, special edition hang tag, special owner’s manual and a Theodore Roosevelt commemorative brochure detailing this rifle as well as Roosevelt’s amazing life of accomplishment.
  * The rifle is engraved with many of the North American game species which he pursued as a hunter and studied as a naturalist.
  * The Custom Model has the added complement of a matted barrel (along the top) patterned after one of Roosevelt’s 1895 rifles on display at the Cody Firearms Museum in Wyoming.
  * Of course, chambered in 405 Winchester.

Hate to see this go but need to finance another project. FTF in Stafford with bill of sale.

Edit: a lot are asking about the finish. It is very hard for me to place a % of finish left as some areas are blue and some spots turned patina (back strap). I do not know if previous owner(s) re-blued the gun before, I have only owned it for a few months. The grips are wood but have a slight different color tone to each one. This is a shooter not a high polished collector.

Also, this is the Official Police, not to be confused with the police positive. This has the larger and stronger frame used by colt on their magnums and can handle +p ammo. The colt Stallion is still visible."

Not interested in any trades at this time, thanks.  I live in the northwest suburbs of Milwaukee and will drive up to 30 minutes to help make this happen.

Face to face, cash, you're able to legally own a handgun and willing to sign a bill of sale.

Price is $450 firm which is VERY competitive for a pistol of this quality with the upgraded grips and the extra mags which run $35 each.

Would just like to say this is the only one ive seen in person and only pictures of a few on the internet, dated pre 70's. So, I dont feel saying its rare is a stretch. This is a all matching numbers makarov, EVEN the magazine matches which to me is shocking. Gun and bore is in great shape with finish wear appropriate for bring back. Has a tiny bit of pitting at the muzzle  and some on the safety/ decocker. Bore it good as welI. I have researched this firearm, had to go to a russian website and translate to verify the subtle changes between the years on the makarov. The main things that verify its age is the two dimples under the safety and the early style magazine. Please see pictures and email if you have more questions and I can provide more detailed photos. Listed pics are from when I brought it home and stripped and cleaned. Just some basic remoil and cloth. I will ship this through my ffl via priority 2-3 to your ffl fully insured. Shipping will run around 60 with insurance I would imagine but I'm not sure, figure that out if the time comes.  Payment by Certified bank check ONLY, and only through the major banks please. Shipping may take awhile as I will have to schedule shipping through my ffl and he has a day job.

26 rounds of CCI Standard Velocity 40gr 1070fps
500 rounds of Remington Cyclone 36gr 1280fps
The reason the CCI Standard is a box of 26 is because I put 20 rounds down range to play with the laser sight and zero it in. When I got home I disassembled the rifle completely to clean it and oil it. After I reassembled I took it back out to H&H to shoot some more and it had 4 hangfires in a row. The gunsmith at H&H thinks the barrel isn't seated all the way to the rear which is causing a light strike, he said around $50 for them to look at and fix it.
As fun as it is I just never took it out as often as I thought it would. And I've never gotten around to taking it to H&H to get it fixed.
Have $850 in to it all, not including sales tax obviously. I'd like to get 600 obo for all of it. Would also trade for another handgun or rifle depending on what it is."

Has full auto, semi-auto and safety. Metal gearbox, hop-up adjustment. excellent for tournament or just plinking. Pictures available upon request.
I recently bought a brand new 9.6V 2000mAh NiMH battery (doesnt need to be fully drained before recharge like the old ones), hi-cap magazine and a smart charger. Spent about $70 on all that stuff and have used it twice in the last few months so i figure i should just sell it all.
I keep the gun inside and well maintained. It is missing the buttstock/battery cover thing, but you can probably find one on ebay for $5 if you wanted to. The battery stays charged above 80% to prevent it from going bad. Comes with a fair amount of match grade .20 BBs, probably around 1000 of them as well as some .30s.
The charger is adjustable and universal so you can use it on other batteries if the plugs fit. Has 2 sizes.

I thought I'd have a use for it as a smaller carry gun but it turns out I don't and I can't justify keeping it if it's just going to sit on the shelf. I've put less than 500 rounds through it without any issues. It is in ""like new"" condition. 

It comes with everything that came from the factory (holster, mag carrier, 2 standard cap mags, lock, case, interchangeable backstraps and green/red fiber-optic replacement inserts).

On top of that, I'm also including a Crossbreed IWB holster ($90 new), an IWB mag carrier ($25 new) and an extended 9 round magazine ($45 new). The Crossbreed holster is very lightly used but still in excellent condition. I use a Crossbreed for my daily carry gun and LOVE it. These are some of the most comfortable IWB holsters in existence and the XDs conceals EXTREMELY well with it. This is a GREAT CCW package!

I'm asking $580 for the package. I'm willing to entertain reasonable offers but please understand what is included. Buying all this new would cost you right around $630. 

Must be 21+, have valid Ohio driver's license and CCW preferred. It should go without saying but you have to be able to legally own a firearm. If no CCW I'll do the swap through a local gun shop (you pay the transfer fee). 

I may be willing to split it up but I'm not interested in trades.

*Note: This is a pre-recall XDs that has been sent back to Springfield for the upgrade. I have paperwork to verify if needed."

580,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3207580,"For Sale:  100 rounds - 7.62x39mm - Wolf Performance, Bi-metal Jacket","NE Portland, Portland, Oregon",$ 28,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 3, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello,


     My name is Thomas Emard. Some of you Armslisters may have dealt with me regarding Mosin-Nagants or SKS rifles. I have started up my own ammunition company, Vexxer Munitions, and I decided to give my local Armslisters first grab at the ammunition. My selection is limited at the moment; I thought it better to keep a few types of ammunition in stock, rather than buy a bit of lots of types.

    This ammunition is very solid. I won't say it's amazing, because let's face it, Wolf will never be a 'performance' round. But that being said, I've fired well over 10,000 rounds through my various AK's and SKS', and not a single one misfired or jammed.

    Up for sale is 100 rounds, for $28. I have 10 in stock at the moment. A discount will be offered for bulk purchases. If you need some cheap ammunition for a shooting trip, or you're a prepper and you want to start stocking up on the world's most common bullet, this ad is for you!


    Contact me anytime with questions, and do make sure to check out my other ads. At the moment, all I'm offering for ammunition is 7.62x39mm and 7.62x54R, but I do have quite a few rifles and shotguns lying around for sale or trade.

    I'd also like to take a moment and thank you personally, Armlister. You, and hundreds like you, have kept Portland's gun community strong. My first ad on here, I asked for Mosins. I was expecting a dozen, perhaps. I was stunned with the results; over the course of 4 weeks, two HUNDRED Mosins were offered for sale. So, thank you for using Armslist instead of your local gun dealer. The stronger the community becomes, the farther prices drop and the more selection we get. It is this fact that convinced me to post this ammunition for sale here, weeks in advance of my proper store being opened to the general American public.

As my business grows and I am able to place larger orders, the price will drop. Significantly. As it stands, I am making mere pennies on each order of 100 rounds, but I'd rather make tiny profit than have these rounds sitting around waiting for someone desperate enough to pay 'scalper' prices.


Regards,
     Thomas"

As the title states, I have for sale or trade a Gen 4 Glock 21 plus extra's.

The Glock 21 is in [U][B]mint condition[/B][/U], as it is a night stand gun and was only carried 2 times at the range. The gun has 200 rounds through and it runs flawlessly. It has standard sights and will come with all the usual items Glocks come with. The Glock was purchased last year and I am the original owner. As you can see from the pic below, the Glock has no wear marks what so ever, it looks like it has never been shot.




The Glock will come with everything it comes with from the factory, a Blackhawk double mag pouch and 2 extra 13 round Glock magazines (for a total of 5 mags). The mags have Vickers Tactical floorplates on them in FDE that matches the FDE on the Glock. The original Glock baseplates will also be included. 


(I will include 2 magazines worth of ammo) 



I am looking to get [B]$550 FIRM[/B] for everything. I am looking to get out of shooting .45 ACP, that is why I am selling my only .45 pistol. 

I also have 2900 rounds of .45ACP for sale as well.

Will trade for a:
SigP226R/P229R --  depending on what model you have I would be willing to add a case of ammo on the trade -- 1st preference

M&P 9 -- CORE or Pro Series models only-- 2nd Preference

As far as the M&P's go, I am [B][U]NOT[/U][/B] interested in a model that has a thumb safety or a magazine safety. M&P should be in similar condition to my Glock.

I will add cash depending on what you have to trade (would be interested in holsters, extra mags are a big plus)

If the gun is sold, buyer is responsible for transfer fee's. If traded, then we will be responsible for our own transfer fee's.

Looking for a FTF at a FFL in the Allentown area only.

And my bills came (ouch) and my niece is getting married (and she's anti-gun so I can't just give it to her), so I might as well get what cash I can from it.

The only things wrong with this gun are cosmetic: there's a slight scratch in the finish of the stock (which might not show up too well), the folding leaf rear sight is broken off, and now there are a couple ugly but not fatal scratches on/near the sight from where I tried and failed to install a replacement  as shown in that photo. I figured out how to avoid scratching it again but not how to get the flimsy little plastic thing on without breaking it; then again the forums lead me to think a lot of folks buy yourselves niftier sights or install a scope anyway so instead of going through that again I'm just asking less than I'd planned. The rear folding leaf is $7.99 plus $7.95 S&H from Brownell's if you'd rather do that and can get it on without breaking it, I do still have the little sight extender thing.   

By the way, this booming slugger does have a cross-bar safety. It also has a Micro-Grooved barrel so factory ammo works fine, but I read on the web someplace that home-cast bullets have to be a tiny bit bigger around to aim well. 

I'll listen to suggestions about a partial trade, but as previously noted there's got to be enough cash involved. Sorry about that."

Comes with papers and box. Been in the safe for a long time and have no need for it. Maybe shot 50-75 rounds like brand new. The best part is that you could still get 15 round magazine for it. Some trades depending on what you got. If you search around ArmsList they are going for $2000 and up!!! for the rifle alone.  I am just asking $1700 obo dont need to get rid of it but rather have cash then have it sitting in the safe taking up space. I ALSO HAVE 1 HK 30 ROUND MAG KITS and 2 HK 15 ROUND MAG KITS for the right price.

And my bills came (ouch) and my niece is getting married (and she's anti-gun so I can't just give it to her), so I might as well get what cash I can from it.

The only things wrong with this gun are cosmetic: there's a slight scratch in the finish of the stock (which might not show up too well), the folding leaf rear sight is broken off, and now there are a couple ugly but not fatal scratches on/near the sight from where I tried and failed to install a replacement as shown in that photo. I figured out how to avoid scratching it again but not how to get the flimsy little plastic thing on without breaking it; then again the forums lead me to think a lot of folks buy yourselves niftier sights or install a scope anyway so instead of going through that again I'm just asking less than I'd planned. The rear folding leaf is $7.99 plus $7.95 S&H from Brownell's if you'd rather do that and can get it on without breaking it, I do still have the little sight extender thing.

By the way, this booming slugger does have a cross-bar safety. It also has a Micro-Grooved barrel so factory ammo works fine, but I read on the web someplace that home-cast bullets have to be a tiny bit bigger around to aim well.

I'll listen to suggestions about a partial trade, but as previously noted there's got to be enough cash involved. Sorry about that."

I shot 320 rounds of noncorrosive ammo through it and the only issue I had was slamfiring (which I fixed).
The rear receiver cover was rusted when I bought it so I replaced it with a new one that has a scope mount (can be seen in the pictures). With the mount came a AIM Sports 4x32 scope which is securely mounted with thread-lock. To fix the slamfires, I replaced the firing pin with Murrays Improved Firing Pin (linked below) and it cannot get stuck anymore, so there is no worries about a runaway gun. 
If you are unfamiliar with the SKS, the mounted bayonet swings forward and hooks around the crown of the barrel. All parts have matching numbers (the receiver, magazine, bolt, stock and receiver cover). I took good care of it while I've had it and cleaned it after every use. With the rifle I am including 640 rounds of 123 grain WOLF WPA hollow point, steel cased ammo, both receiver covers and the scope. Below is the firing pin that I have in the rifle. Unfortunately, I do not remember where I bought the receiver cover. 
Also, I'll throw in an old hard case that missing most of the padding. It kind of works.

I shoot Sigs, mostly SAO sigs.  I could not get used to the ambi slide release.  Being a lefty, classic sigs do not have this.  I don't want to deal with having to change my grip after years of shooting Sigs and I don't want to void the warranty by cutting it off.

These are hard to find right now.  It has a GREAT trigger for being a striker fired gun."

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and Exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, another firearm, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I do not need anything in trade right now, but will trade if it makes sense on my end.

Same on your end, if you have something of higher value let me know what you are looking for on top.

FN SCAR 16 and 17 or AR uppers (or completer rifles) in .450 Bushmaster, maybe .50 Beowulf, would like to try H&K USP or prefer larger like the Tactical or Expert models, that's about all I would not mind trying right now.

Firearm is brand new. This sale will come as a package deal, but will consider parting under the right conditions. 

This includes the pistol itself, and three 20rd magazines; as what comes with the handgun from the factory. It shall also come with 500 rounds of the rare SS198, Hollow Point ammunition, which are the Civilian Restricted rounds (legal to own/purchase/etc, but FN does not allow dealers to sell this to civilians, only Law Enforcement/Military). These rounds will go through a bullet proof vest. 

In addition, I will include two (2) new FN Five-Seven 30 Round Extended Magazines, which are hard to come by and are expensive as well. 

If you are looking at this listing, then I am sure I don't need to explain much about the gun. The round that this pistol shoots, is the same round that the P90 / PS90 uses. The same gun that protects our president. This round is probably one of the most underestimated rounds out there. If you do your research, and actually really dig into it; you will know just like anyone else who has deployed it or tested it, it is capable of things that no other round can even come close to. Ballistics, penetration, expansion, all of it this round is highly unmatched. Considering that this is the primary weapon/round that protects the president, I think that says something in itself.

I will consider trades if it happens to fall into one/some of the things listed below, that I am interested in:

-Nightforce 1-4x24 Scope / Optic
-Aimpoint T1 / H1
-ACOG Mini
-5.7x28 Rounds (Elite Ammunition rounds, especially)
-Desert Tactical SRS Covert, or parts/accessories for such.
-PS90 Short-Barrel
-Viridian X5L
-Trijicon RMR (Preferably RM06 but any of them is fine) 
-PS90 Accessories
-.45 ACP rounds

I do not mind shipping to FFL also. We can do that, or we can do a private sale locally. I also do not mind driving a good distance to meet and conduct the transaction. By contacting me you agree that you are a lawful citizen to own, operate, or possess a firearm.

Prices:
$1150 - Just Five-Seven W/ factory options and accessories (Pistol, case, & three 20rd Mags)
$1850 - Package Deal - Five Seven, 500rds SS198 Hollow Points, two FN 30 Round Extended Mags, & three FN 20rd mags.

Comes with Magpul furniture, Primary Weapons Systems flash suppressing compensator, Daniel Defense rear sight aperture and Magpul B.A.D lever. This is the perfect fix of all the AR's short falls- the lack of knockdown power with the standard 5.56 or .223, the reliability issues with the standard gas impingment design. So you get the best of both worlds, rugged AK like reliability and 7.62 like knockdown power with AR adaptability and world renowned accuracy. Oh and the undiniable sexiness of the black gun.

It has 30"" barrels and is chambered for 3"" shells. The wood has great character but appears to have had the high gloss finish stripped off. The finish could use a little work to bring back the shine but there are no cracks, dings, or gouges in the wood. The lockup is nice and tight and everything functions properly although it could probably use a thorough cleaning. It comes a Berretta branded leather gun case, two extended choke tubes (IC & Skeet) and two flush chokes."
