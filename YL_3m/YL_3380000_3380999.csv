The MRP upper features two locking bolts that when removed, allow the operator to simply pull off the barrel and replace it with any LMT MRP barrel such as .223/5.56, .204 Ruger or the 6.8 SPC round. All of the mentioned calibers use the same bolt/carrier and magazines. To lock the barrel back into place you simply tighten the locking bolts to the appropriate strength using the included torque wrench.

The upper itself is in great condition and was only used as a range rifle. Shell deflector is testimony to how gently used it is.

It's in great condition only carried a few times and shot around 200rds. Its a great little pocket gun that my fiancée was supposed to carry but ended up stealing my glock 27 so It just served as a once in while carry and a surprisingly accurate range toy. I did paint the front sight hot pink to help with visibility when aiming (originally it was unpainted and hard to see), it can be removed with ease as it's just nail polish. I'm asking $220 and I'm pretty firm on the price because I've got more in it that that but just tired of it sitting in the safe and not being used like it should. I have attached a stock photo but mine looks just like it, I'll get actual photos when I get home from work."

All stainless and in great condition. I am second owner of it, original owner never fired gun was NIB when i got it. I have been shooting it in private Competition and have out shot every 1911 in the same price range as this weapon. It has approx 200 rounds down range and has been cleaned after every outing. At 10 yards it holds a consistent spread of 4 inches hand shot. This series is pretty Rare as it hasn't been built since the 80s and was built to compete with all 1911 frames. Very solid gun and priced to sell.

I have a Kel Tec SU-16CA that I'm looking trade. It's a straight shooter and very reliable. I bought it to try out shooting a 5.56/.223. I don't really like 5.56/.223 much, so it's gotta go. It shoots 5.56 and .223 reliably. It comes with two 10 round mags, a KAC foregrip, a YHM muzzle brake, and 20 rounds. This is a cheap way to get into 5.56, it's just not my thing. I should also mention that it takes all AR mags. I just don't have any for it.
 It's used, but it's in good condition and accurate. The previous owner changed the bipod handguard for AR-looking ones. I don't have the bipod handguard.

Size is large.

This is the carrier only, in other words, no soft armor panels, which can be purchased online at https://www.uspalm.com/products/armor/armor/armor-panels.html at $99/each panel. This carrier is in a gray color, which I really like, the all back and camo patterns always seemed too tactical for me (a suburban dad).

You can buy these with both front and back armor panels at MidwayUSA at http://www.midwayusa.com/product/REDACTED/us-palm-molle-defender-series-soft-body-armor-level-iiia-large-front-and-back-panels-500d-cordura-nylon, but out-of-stock right now.

I had purchased this carrier as a spare, but had not gotten around to adding panels to it yet. Now I'm dealing with a house move and would like to find a new homes for half-finished projects, like spare armor.

Asking $50 cash FTF.

If your home body armor solution isn't quite squared away yet, don't miss this opportunity to pick up a very nice carrier at a deep discount. Just add panels!

Low round count, maybe 500 rounds. I should have all of the original trigger parts, the gun was originally Variant 3.

FULL disclosure, i did some light stippling to the grip area. I can send all sorts of photos, it's done just in the factory grip area. If you read much about these pistols one of the biggest gripes is the slippery frame, lots of complaints that HK didn't go with the ""Spiderman"" grip that the full-size HK45 wears or the P30. 

I may be interested in a Glock 19 or 23, maybe even an AR/AR parts. I have about $1300 into it, I'd like $1100.

This is a CMP service grade rifle.  The barrel has a lot of life left in it with muzzle wear (1) and throat erosion (3) being well within spec.  It has a very pretty walnut stock with the usual dings/dents for a 70 year old combat rifle.  The metal has the Greek black parkerization.  The hand guard has one crack in it that was repaired at the CMP.  It has been fired approximately 20 times since it came from the CMP.  It has functioned flawlessly and is accurate with my 168 gr BTHP hand loads.

The 21"" barrel adds to its superb maneuverability, and the Turkey Extra Full Rem Choke channels maximum payload to the sweet spot. Mossy Oak Obsession coverage on the stock and fore-end keeps you concealed.

I had this rifle built with hopes of shooting long range but other things have come up and need to sell. I have shot this rifle with 40rds of Black Hills 190gr Match and was getting under an inch groups at 100 yards and I know it will shoot better once broken in and with a better shooter. Recoil was mild, my wife didn't mind shooting it. If you were to collect all the parts and have it built it would run you around $3,500 or more depending on the labor cost. I think my price is fair. I also have some brass I will throw in with the rifle its just a little over a 100 pieces.
I will need a bill of sell and proof of CCW or meet a dealer for a transfer. Thanks for looking and if you have any question please contact me.  Make me an offer worse I will say is no Thank you. 

I am willing to break this rifle up and sell the barreled action with trigger, muzzle brake, and scope base. I will sell it for $1,400 and can throw in some once fired brass to sweeten the deal I think I have around 100. I will not sell the stock or mags separate until the barrel action sells. The only Trade I am looking for would be a partial trade for an Eotech G33 magnifier, I would like black but I could do Tan. Thanks

Countless law enforcement units swear by the G21SF pistol, and that's why this powerful, lightweight, all climate workhorse is standard issue from the North to South Poles. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control-especially for shooters with smaller hands.

We still have 5 pups left as of 8 -12- 2014 but they are going quick (4 boys and only 1 girl). They are a cross between three amazing livestock guarding breeds. They are 1/2 Great Pyrenees (which is calm, well-mannered and somewhat serious. Courageous, very loyal and obedient.) 1/4 Kangal (which is known for their protectiveness, loyalty and gentleness with small children and animals and guards them with extreme devotion) and 1/4 Anatolian Shepherd (Which is known for its independent and forceful, responsible for guarding its master's flocks without human assistance or direction.) All puppies will come with their first rounds of puppy shots, and de-worm. They are wean and ready to go to their new home. Since they are not wean we are accepting deposit of half to hold your puppy (which the deposit is 125.00) which is non refundable if you change your mind. We have both parents and grandma on sight and can answer any questions you may have. Again these are working dogs who have been bred to guard your family and livestock. They have been with goats, chickens and farm cats since day one. The pups are already bonding with the baby goats we have here and snuggle up with them at night. They are very protective already and guard the house and goats with all their little might. Please feel free to text or email me. Calling is a little tricky as we live in a hollow and I get horrible service but you can try. (918) 809 3742.

The ISR takes advantage of the best characteristics of the 300BLK by integrating key components into one package, eliminating the need for two separate tax stamps.  While the rifle utilizes a 10.3” barrel, it is not classified as an SBR (Short-Barreled Rifle) because the suppressor is permanently attached.  The DDM4ISR 300’s sound suppressor is threaded and welded to the proprietary ISR Integrated Gas Block, bringing the barrel length to 16.145”.  While the rifle is at the 16” legal limit, the ISR’s integrated suppressor will require an NFA tax stamp.   This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.
Using the tool provided, the ISR’s baffle core is removable for cleaning.  With the inclusion of the Daniel Defense Modular Float Rail (MFR) 12.0, it provides the shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability.  This rifle can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube.  In addition, the 3” Modular Picatinny Rail sections allow the end user to customize the rail set up.

The only trade i will be open to is a .338 Lapua. I ordered each part of this gun individually, and no expense was spared. I went all out to make a highly dependable, unique rifle. I've only sent about 20 rounds downrange with it, but am ready to part due to a growing interest in the .338 realm. Some of the specs include: Nickel-Boron bolt (wipes clean with a cloth, no scrubbing necessary), three-stage compensator (sounds beautiful), 18"" fluted barrel with 1/8 twist, harris bipod and adapter, ambidextrous charging handle by Spectre, Rock River two stage trigger, magpul trigger guard and magpul buttstock. It was assembled professionally, and shot/cleaned/cared for by a U.S. Marine. The rifle is almost brand new, and has sat in an ""everything proof"" case that I used in Afghanistan to hold a SASR. I have (1) 10-round mag, (1) 20 round mag, and (1) 30 round mag to go with it. I paid top dollar, and if you were to purchase a rifle like this from any dealer, you'd be spending much more than I'm asking for it! It's coupled with a Leupold Mk-4 mil-dot 4.5-14x40 scope mounted on Leupold rings. I'm not trying to sell it with the rifle, I intend on swapping it over to a .338. If you notice in a few pictures that the trigger guard is missing, it's because it came in the mail late. It's installed now. Call or text REDACTED, email is fine too"

It's large in size measuring 30""x9""x3"" and is surprisingly heavy. No shipping at this time because of the fragility of the item. There were only 500 boxes made and 1847 obsidian knives made. Here is a a little more info:

""Tashunka Witko,"" Oglala Lakota Sioux Warrior. Crazy Horse was born around 1845 on the Republican River that traces the Nebraska-Kansas border. He was raised with tribal traditions of generosity, courage and self-denial. He ordered the attack on Lt. Col. George A. Custer's Seventh Cavalry and never surrendered the lands claimed by his people. When asked where were his lands, he replied, ""My lands are where my dead lie buried.""

The Crazy Horse knife sports a handle made of wood from a grove of aspen trees, which grew on the sacred Pine Ridge Reservation land in southern Nebraska. The Aspen is revered by the Sioux Nation as the ""Tree of Life."" The 4 1/2"" x 1 1/2"" blade is made from knapped obsidian, a hard volcanic glass. Its color is variegated rust black and is affixed to the hilt with leather strips. Horsehair tassels dangle from brass cones, threaded with bone beads lashed to the leather binding. Four brass tacks represent the four seasons. The fringed buckskin sheath is brain-tanned, hand-made and beaded with a familiar Sioux pattern.

She does not like to pump the gun.  Other than that she really enjoyed this little gun.  This thing is very very light to carry.  Fiber optic sights.  I also have several different chokes that go with the gun..  AWESOME GUN MUST SEE VERY VERY CLEAN..  FUN TO SHOOT

The only other thing wrong with the gun is that under the trigger guard the curved metal spring was snapped.  This spring returns the trigger forward. I still have the spring so it can be matched up or a new one made. I was going to sell for $250 when it was fixed but I need the money so I'm asking $200. Located in Arden. Brad @ REDACTED.

Check out the pack online do some research because its truly an amazing pack, I put my Marlin 336 30-30 in the scabbard to give you an idea of how big is it. 

I'm asking 325 for it, retails for around 450 + shipping...maybe a little less if you can find a promotion on it. 


Text me anytime! Call anytime before 11pm, thank you!
