When can you use force to stop an attack? What kind of force can you use and when?  Under what circumstances are deadly force justified, and when does the law require you to use a lesser degree of force?

This course has been requested by many students due to current events, and it is designed for those people concerned about learning Colorado Self-Defense Laws. In recent times the news has carried stories about individuals using deadly force in self-defense. Some have been acquitted, and some have been convicted. Although these cases have arisen in other states, you need to know the law in Colorado, so hopefully you will not be subjected to civil and/or criminal litigation with its accompanying costs and consequences.

The Deadly Force for Self-Defense information is difficult to find and understand, and although nobody, including us, can give you a guarantee that you will do everything correctly and avoid trouble, we can help you navigate the laws for a more clear understanding, so you can better appreciate the issues involved.

This is a great seminar for the Concealed Carry Permit Holder; but is also very important for those concerned with self-defense in general.  Whether you have a firearm for home defense, defense during travel, or at work.... this seminar can help you prepare for the worst.

Included in the Seminar will be discussion on the Use of Force Continuum, Disparity of Force, and the Colorado ""Make my Day"" law.  There will be a Q & A session with Mr. Barry Meinster & Mr. John Duran where you can ask the tough questions and get informative answers.  There will be discussion and handouts on environmental awareness, combat mindset, and the moral/eithical question of using Lethal Force to stop an attacker.  There is a real valuable wealth of information in this course that you will not see in other courses offered in Colorado.

There is ample parking and seating for 25.  You must purchase a ticket to reserve your seat in advance.  Seating is first come first served.  Drinks and snacks will be provided and there are scheduled breaks during the seminar.

The cost for this informative training is $75 per attendee and seating is limited, so please make your reservations early by purchasing tickets through this online flier.

For further questions please call John Duran at REDACTED or email REDACTED

1992 Camaro RS V8 (350 not 305) with a 5-speed Manuel tranny.

Runs and drives fine. Also has flowmaster exhaust. Sounds mean as hell.
Only problem (besides the paint) is that there is a random knock. This does not effect the way the car runs or drives, so I do not believe it to be a serious mechanical problem, although we are unsure. The car drives and starts fine. It just made a drive to Orlando without any issues.
Paint deff needs some TLC, but looks cool as is.
$1500 cash or Trade for a 600cc sports bike (preferable year 2000 or newer) and if the bike is right, I will add cash.

No other trades than sport bikes. I also have an ar-15 I could throw in to sweeten the deal if needed.

The BK-series knives are very high quality and highly popular. They're made by Ka-Bar in the USA, out of 1095 cro-van high carbon steel, with full tang, and based on designs by Ethan Becker. The BK-7 is surprisingly light and well balanced for a large knife.
I only used it last winter, sitting on the living room floor splitting some small pieces of cedar into really thin pieces, for kindling.  Cedar is very soft, so I just used the heel of my hand to tap the spine of the blade and push the knife through the wood pieces, no hammering on the spine with a log or anything. There are some very light marks on either side of the blade, but not even close to breaking through the finish on the knife, they're very superficial.
 Other than that, the knife and sheath are pristine, is very sharp and still has the factory edge. 
I had my brother take a photo and e-mail it to me, but it's too dark and looks like crap, so I'm just posting a couple off the web.
Asking $60,firm, which is less than I paid a year or two ago. Last I checked, they were running $80+.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

I shoot competition and i was very surprised with this guns performance. I'm building a race quad so some of the extra bang makers have to go. I'll toss in the Blackhawk Holester, and night sights that are mounted, comes with 2 magizines one being 7 round other being 6 and I'll fill both up with hallow points. Comes with box, manuals, and everything else it came with. I will need a PHOTO ID for my records . I just paid $450 for this gun. And bought another $100 in accessories  and I'm giving  you $20 in ammo. $400 is pretty firm.

These firearms offer a variety of enhancements and tuning yet still remain true to “stock”. Bringing competition specifications and features in factory models, the Pro Series offers that ready-to-go package while still maintaining production line integrity.  This Gun is absolutely MINT, take notice in the middle photo how the barrel hood and locking lugs show absolutely no abrasion marks or wear.  $525 or best offer.

At the same time he decided he also wanted 28 and 410 ga bbls to go with the set so he had original Perazzi barrels custom fit to this reciever and the barrels are re-serial numbered to this gun thus the extra set of stamped serial numbers on the barrels.The 410 barrels are choked Skeet and IC and the 28 ga bbls were Briley choked to add hunting versitility to the 28ga,five tubes come with the 28ga bbls AND THE 28ga BARRELS ARE MID-VENT STYLE.The 12 and 20 ga bbls are choked IC and Imp.Mod I believe, the Perazzi choke code is 4 circles on bottom barrels and 2 circles on top barrels.The condition of all the barrels is excellent,i would rate the barrels at 99% and all lock up to the reciever very tight. My friend who was the original owner hunted with the gun very little and he is not a skeet shooter so the gun has been shot very seldom,and has spent most of the time in hs gun room.I would rate this gun overall at 98%on the wood and 99% on the barrels.The stock and forearms on this gun are outstanding wood and match very well,the stock and forearms do have a few scratches but nothing major no cracks or splits anywhere and nothing that really detracts from the overall look of the gun.The stock also has a very nicely fit old english pad."

Completely ambidextrous and capable of converting to 7.62x39 with only a few interchangeable parts. I encourage you to check out the video ad SIG put out of the rifle for a better description if you haven't already seen it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdTuJ27vEeQ

I purchased the rifle new a few months ago and have put about 200 rounds down the barrel. Very accurate, easy to operate, and reliable.

Uses a 16 inch barrel w/ 1/7 twist
Swiss style folding stock w/ removable cheek riser
Folding back up iron sights
Uses standard AR/M16 GI mags
Gas piston operation--feels like a perfect marriage of the best of AR and AK attributes.

As a side note, one of the torx screws on the top rail is slightly stripped due to me being dumb upon initial disassembly and using the wrong sized wrench. I later found out that this screw (1 of 4) doesn't do anything but hold the top rail on and isn't even a part that needs to come out unless you are doing serious mechanical work on the rifle (i.e. gunsmithing). Easy fix (10 cents maybe?), I just haven't got around to it.

 I'm offering you a chance to come down and try out one of the biggest badass rifles made!!!
 with the Muzzle brake on this rifle it has the kick of a .243 hunting rifle, even a 7yr old could shoot this rifle!!!!
 I'm disabled and had to sell my Barrett because it beat me up to much, this rifle cost me double what the Barrett cost. I have over $11,000.00 invested in this rifle set up, and it is still new mint and why I'm not to sure how long I'm willing to offer this chance of a lifetime to those firearm collector/shooters that have never tried a big bore rifle.
 So here is my offer....
 I'm willing to meet down here by my farm to take you out to shoot up to a 1000yrd shot
 will cost $125 per person for 3rds down range,
 will do a full mag of 10rds for $200 per person
 will do up to 5 people in a group, with minimum 2 shooters.
 also will consider kids from ages 10 up who have gone through gun safety....
 or for $50 per person I will do a about hr long safety class with them first before going out. to make sure they understand firearms and how Dangerous or Fun they can be if handled properly.
 it takes me over 2hrs to tear down the rifle and clean it, and hr to put it back together
 this doesn't include ware on rifle from shooting, this is over a $9k rifle set up
 so only will to see how this plays out if I keep doing it.......
 if you want, we can go to one of the only gun ranges that allows these rifles you will cover the range fee's, is located in Rochester. I live Southbend/Raymond Area
 but I live out in the country and we can legally shoot in the woods where we have a mountain as a back stop because of how far this rd will travel..
 we always take safety first!!!!
 not many people will offer you to come shoot a $9,000. rifle for kicks and bragging rights so this might not be up long will see how it plays out....
 *First and for most no one who can NOT own a firearm will be allowed to shot this rifle.
 THIS MEANS...
 NO Felony's OR PENDING....
 NO DV Cases OR PENDING....
 NO Restraining orders Against you! OR PENDING....
 and last if you have been declared with a Mental Illness...

 if you Carry a *CWP/CPL this is a plus and I won't have to have your name ran by the Sheriff's before going out to shoot.
 *Warning* if any of these apply to you understand it is against the law and 1 yr in jail for being around/shooting/owning firearms when you can't.....
 don't want anyone to get in trouble so warning you in advance not to write and try to shoot this rifle. because the Sheriffs will have your info and will deal with it, so best just not write...
 ok now that we got that out there...
 I will also do part trade part cash 1/2 & 1/2 for other firearms/rifles
 just ask most I can do is say no thank you...

 **minimum of 2 shooters to bring this big rifle out.**

 I also have AR/AK or a Siaga 12g 20rd barrel drum -we can talk about if that is one you want to try out...

 **also for anyone who comes to shoot the rifle I will give them a yellow tip .50BMG Russian Armor pricing rd to keep as a keepsake memory of shooting the rifle....*** 


Will trade for:
Firearms/high end scope/ACOGs(Trijicon,Leupold,Nikon)/ammo.... Gold/Silver coins/Bullion... or???"
