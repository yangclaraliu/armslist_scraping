 ""Efficient, Tough, Exceptional."" Words that describe the men of the U.S. Army Special Forces and the knife designed specifically for them.

 This knife is known to the U.S. Army Special Forces as ""The Yarborough"" and to everyone else as ""The Green Beret Knife"". It is a no-nonsense, hardworking tool, designed by renowned knife maker and designer Bill Harsey, with function and manufacturing input from Chris Reeve. Made in Boise, Idaho by Chris Reeve Knives, the Green Beret Knife is a using knife that, just like the men for whom it was designed, is efficient, tough and uncompromising. 

 Without the name ""Yarborough"" and non-serialized, the otherwise identical knife - The Green Beret Knife - is available from Chris Reeve Knives. The Green Beret Knife is offered with either a 7” or 5.5” blade; the handle is the same size. The handle is made of extremely durable, textured, black canvas Micarta. When the handle is wet, the canvas fibers swell which increases grip. If the handle becomes dirty, it can be cleaned with a brush and a household cleaner like Soft Scrub."

 This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. 
 Features: 
 ** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
 ** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
 ** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. 
 ** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
 ** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
 ** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
 ** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
 ** Hogue® Tamer grip helps reduce perceived recoil.

This fills in this semi circle that your pinky normally falls on. These are for the NEW STYLE drop free magazine with square notch. These won't work on the stock gen 2 magazines. If you have a gen 2 glock and are using gen 3/4 magazines then you should get this!! These are $10 a peice plus shipping online-  (cost about $28 to my door) will sell both or $10.

I built this as a project and now that it is complete I want to sell it so I can fund other projects.

The thrower is a standard string operated single clay launcher from Dick's Sporting Good purchased a couple of months ago. The remote is a 1 channel single button relay operating a super tough linear actuator (for automatic car door locks). Push the button and the remote triggers the actuator, and the actuator pulls releases the throwing arm. The electronics are housed in a conduit box with a removable face plate to give access to the mount and relay.

The project it 99% complete, it operates perfectly and safely. If someone were to come up with a better setup for the release point it could be a little smoother in the ""arming/loading"" phase of operation. However, it works just fine as it is.

I'm including the thrower ($35), the remote relay/actuator/trigger (over $40 for parts/mounting hardware), the spare tire that the whole setup is mounted on ($40), and 2x 6v batteries (used in series for 12v). All for $100. I'll also give you whatever random odds and ends (misc hardware in 3/8 hex and 1/16 hex) I ended up with at the completion of the project if you want them. The setup is SUPER simple, hook up red to positive and white to negative and push the button to fire. The tire stabilizes everything and in my field tests doesn't move at all. Stakes in the pictures are part of another project and not included.

394,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3458394,For Sale:  1978 Ford F-250 Camper Special,"Monroe County, Macon, Georgia","$ 4,500","Listed On: Wednesday, September 3, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have my F-250 Supercab for sale.  This truck is an awesome piece of truck history. The truck is in great condition for its age, and it has great bones for an enthusiast who wants to restore it to its former glory.  Why bother with a rusted out piece of junk, when you can go straight to painting and interior work?  You can save thousands just from not having to fool with the rust.  This truck only needs a paint job, very minor body work, and an interior overhaul to be ready for the road.  The tires are older but have lots of tread and have held up to me driving it on the interstate several times this summer.

There is only one rusted through place on the entire truck; over the DS door, on the cab, there is a rusted out place about an inch wide and 10 inches long.  I have no idea why it rusted here and not the cab corners, etc.  The rockers, fenders, bed, hood, and floorpans are all in great condition.  There is a small dent in one of the fenders, and there is a small cut/dent in the tailgate leading edge.  I will post pictures of all of these areas once I have time to take them.

The interior rubber floormat is in very good condition, and the vinyl seat covers for the front and rear seat are, as well, albeit a bit dated in color.

Here is the story:

I purchased from a guy who had it since 1982.  He drove it daily from S. Bibb County to RAFB until 2000 or so.  He spent thousands replacing the engine and multiple components then (radiator, hoses, etc.)  But what he did not do was replace the distributor.  Also, whoever installed the engine got the vacuum system all screwed up.  As a result, he never got it to run right.  The timing advance was inoperative, so at speeds above an idle it would act crazy.  Mileage since engine change is approximately 13,000.  Total mileage on truck is estimated at 163,000.

Since March of this year I have done the following:
new distributor
new spark plugs
new plug wires
new PVS's and vac lines
new belts
new battery and positive cable from battery to voltage regulator
new ignition module
new windshield wiper switch handle ($19!)
new front brake pads
new wheel front wheel bearings
new front brake rotors
new front flexible brake lines
new master cylinder
new brake booster
new rear brake flexible line
new rear 3"" brake shoes (optional with Camper Special edition)
new rear brake wheel cylinders
new rear wheel seals
drained and replaced rear differential oil
fresh engine oil change
removed both fuel tanks, flushed and lined
new sending units for both tanks - gauge works for both tanks, but very accurate
new fill hoses for both fuel tanks
new flexible fuel lines from tanks to tank selector and from hard line to fuel filter and carb
installed new door seals
replaced center duct for A/C system (needs driver side patched) and now it blows strong
replaced FRONT and REAR sway bar bushings - drives tight on curves
topped off R134 in A/C system - system converted at some time in past prob 2000 - no leaks.

I have dozens of receipts showing work done since 2000.  No second guessing on what needs replacing.

Other features:
351M - all original and stock except for air breather and minor vacuum modifications.  EGR is still hooked up.
C6- bulletproof 3 speed automatic, shifts great, no slips, no noise.
REAR AXLE RATIO: 3.31 known as the mileage maker on a DANA 61. Rear Axle Code is 23.
This is a rare combo for this year model.
http://www.fordification.net/tech/vin_axle-rr.htm  
The truck should get much better fuel economy than most of this vintage.

What is needed:
1.) The truck is missing interior door panels; however, the good thing is you can see how solid this truck is.  There is no rust in the doors.   
2.) The seat covers are not worn, but they are ugly.
3.) The DS air conditioning vent needs to be re-plumbed.  I replaced the middle duct and the center vents blow strong, as does the PS vent.  I have not looked into the DS duct to see if it can be repaired or if it requires replacing.
4.) The carburetor is leaking down overnight.  I am thinking about replacing the carburetor prior to sale.
5.) The A/C is slightly over charged and is not functioning to specifications.  I may go ahead and have that addressed also.
6.) The exhaust system needs some work.  If the truck doesn't sell within a reasonable time frame, I will have this addressed soon.

So, look around for a project truck that could be a comfortable, one of kind, fix up any way that you like, kind of truck.  Some guys are taking the better specimens of this vintage and dropping 460's in them and a 4WD system.  There are no factory combinations of Supercab 4WD with 460's for this year.  After you look at the junk that has been sitting out back with trees growing through the engine compartment and rust galore, come back to mine and pick up something that you can drive home with confidence.  I have worked on several trucks from the frame up, and I can tell you the hard part of this build has already been done.

I require the buyer to either have a Permit to Purchase, or CCW. 

The following is information from the manufacture on this pistol: 
The first of the many recent additions to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 and incorporate features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” model.

A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.
Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines."

520,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3458520,For Sale/Trade:  AK47 Pistol Zastava PAP 7.62x39 Trade,"se okc, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 600,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 3, 2014",Handguns,Century International Arms,no type,no type,no type,"fired one bullet through it after purchase to function test then put it in the safe. The hand guard and gas tube cover are stained a dark walnut color and I added an original AKM brown/red bakelite pistol grip and leather sling. I also installed the correct krinkov style flash hider and magpul single point sling attachment. The magpul is much higher quality than the cheap ones that mount under the pistol grip and cause your barrel to point backwards. I had to drill 3 holes in the trunion to correctly install it and as the gun hangs it points the muzzle slightly forward as it should. Being a century AK, the front sight was terribly canted out of the box, I removed the pins and straightened it - verified center with a bore sight - then reinstalled everything correctly. I have a lot of time invested in the gun making it right but just want to get my money out of it to fund a different project. This gun has been upgraded with top quality parts and tastefully modified to make it stand out in a crowd. It is in better than new condition. comes with 1-30 rd magazine, original box and paperwork.

 A model developed after the M4 pattern rifle, the PWS MK114 Rifle has quickly become the crowd favorite for those wanting a compact package without the NFA paperwork associated with shorter barrels. The MK114 retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with varying types of ammunition and boasts a permanently attached FSC556.

 Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK114 uses a mid length gas piston system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15 handguard and free-floated barrel.

 The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

 Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, MOE stock, and MBUS2 sights.
