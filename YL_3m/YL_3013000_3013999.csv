It comes with the Troy fixed battle site. The site has the large and small flip aperture for short and long range shooting. Troy Industries makes great iron sites, and it's a perfect fit for the carbine style rifle. The only thing you'll need to start shooting is a bolt, charge handle, and complete lower. This is a great way to get a quality AR 15 for a cheaper price. You'll save time and money buying this instead of buying from Palmetto's site."

It weighs about 4 pounds, and has a Japanese Tasco 4x scope on it. It also has flip down iron sights.

This is a youth sized ""boys rifle"" although it was shot by my daughter. I bought it this year and we have put maybe 100's of rounds through it. 

This rifle is nothing short of beautiful. I get compliments on it at the range all the time. I have removed the stock and found no sign of rust. We have not had a single problem with the gun. I can easily hit the steel at 50 yards at the range with irons. My daughter keeps it in the 10 ring on bags+scope at 15 yards.

Knowing we are in an ammo shortage, I am offering up 525 rounds of golden bullets for the full sale price (retail value $23.99+tax) . That's a lot of shooting in a single shot rifle. If you want the rifle for less, it's likely to come with less ammo.

""The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

The barrels are lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).

The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.

Comes with a 6-position Magpul MOE Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies. The lower assembly has the proven Geissele Two-Stage trigger."""

I still have the factory box and all accessories that it came with when I purchased it.  I'll even throw in a box of 25 Hornady Critical Defense rounds with the gun.  If you have any other questions feel free to call or text at REDACTED.  Thanks again for looking."

I am also including a 3x9 green/red LED scope along with a flip up rear sight. 

I WILL NOT ship.  Please contact me for any other details."

Item Description:

This is a brand new in box LWRC Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle, or REPR, LR-308 architecture semi-automatic rifle chambered for .308 Winchester. This REPR features a distinctive and practical Flat Dark Earth cerakote finish on the receivers and handguard. The unique LWRC REPR is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm rounds on target in a variety of roles. The REPR rifle utilizes LWRC's patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

This rifle features a unique Spiral Fluted barrel. The spiral fluting reduces weight, increase heat dispersion, and relieves longitudinal forces that can reduce accuracy in conventional linear fluting. LWRC rifles and carbines utilize cold hammer forged barrels made out of 41V45 steel alloy and treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology. Cold hammer forging takes an oversized barrel blank, and using high pressure rotary hammers, compacts the barrel blank over a mandrel. This forms perfect rifling devoid of tool marks. It also compacts the molecular structure of the metal making it denser and stronger. These barrels can take a lot more use and abuse than a standard barrel before any degradation in accuracy or loss of velocity. NiCorr surface conversion has proved more lubricious, harder wearing, more heat and corrosion resistant than the hard chrome normally used in the bore. LWRC claims their barrels can handle 20,000 rounds before replacement, as compared to 6,000-10,000 rounds on a standard M4. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24, making it compatible with most .308 muzzle devices, and a birdcage-style flash hider comes equipped.

A Magpul pistol grip and B5 SOPMOD adjustable butt stock are fitted, ensuring comfortable configuration choices for any operator. LWRC BUIS and a 20 round PMAG are included.

More so testing the waters. Firearm is currently in original wood stock. Please excuse poor iPhone pictures. Happy to get you more pictures if you want.

I have an all-numbers-matching Sino-Soviet SKS. These are on the rarer side of things as far as SKSs go. Check this website for SKS info: http://yooperj.com/SKS.htm . My Sino-Soviet has ALL numbers matching (low, I1### serial number; most are in the millions), including original wood stock, and a chrome bore that is the most flawless bore I have ever seen on an SKS. The firearm and original matching wood stock have been cleaned of cosmoline (the stuff mil-surp firearms are packaged in; a burden to clean) and is in perfect working order. I have put roughly 200 rounds down range without a single problem. The rifle shoots straight. I also have a Combat Exchange / ATI side folding stock (uses original magazine or Tapco duckbill magazine) to sweeten any deal. There is a sling attachment and storage compartment on the underside of the grip. Plus, I could add ammo to any deal as well. Maybe even some cash if the offer is right. 


I am looking to trade, or possibly sell if the money is right. And it must be if we are doing a cash deal. Again, no hurry to get rid of the rifle, just seeing what is out there. 

Will answer any and all questions about the firearm, just contact me through Armslist. I am happy to accommodate.

(Brown Enhanced Automatic Rifle) models from Adcor Defense feature a patent-bearing, gas piston system with a free-floating barrel for increased accuracy. This is due to the piston's incorporation into the upper half of the forward rail system - so it never touches the barrel. Extremely close machine tolerances eliminate the need for piston rings. With a tool-less field strip design, a B.E.A.R. requires nothing more than a firing pin to disassemble, yet remains strong. The piston's cyclical rate for a controlled rate of fire adjusts with a turn of the gas plug located in the front piston assembly. Because diminished heat reaches the upper, hot gases and carbon particulates are prevented from entering the receiver, lubricant lasts longer and maintenance is simplified. Due to superior design, the B.E.A.R. has no carrier tilt and low fouling of the chamber and action. The ejection port wiper prevents the entry of dust, sand and other debris by moving into the ejection port opening flush with the inside geometry of the upper receiver. The spring-loaded shield allows the bolt carrier to return to ready position. Being made of a highly-durable, self-lubricating polymer helps the shield withstand temperature extremes. The B.E.A.R. Elite series features a few upgrades, including a Magpul MOE rifle stock and Magpul MOE ergonomic rifle grip with aggressive texturing for a sure grip. The chrome-lined barrel from FN Manufacturing has 1:7 twist and is hammer-forged with a M249 rifling profile for long life and exceptional accuracy. It also has a forward-placed, ambidextrous charging handle. It has a two-piece key-locked, highly-rigid quad-rail system made of aircraft-grade 7075-T6 aluminum alloy that seamlessly mounts to the upper receiver made from the same aircraft-grade 7075-T6 aluminum alloy. The upper and lower rails separate with the push of a button - no special tools required.

Numbers Matching
counterbored

dark bore with some pitting, but still good rifling

good accuracy at 100 yards, i'm decent, but another guy at the range had good groupings with her.
Shellac is flaking off and cracking, I didn't have the heart to re-finish it. I kind of liked the originality of it being numbers matching at all.

I'd rather bubba up one in worse shape than this. 

Comes with cleaning rod, tool kit, ammo pouch, sling and choice of one or two compartment oil bottle. Also comes with a non-matching bayonet that needs some filing to fit properly

I can add ammo/stripper clips for extra negotiated funds.

Can sell the brass stacker scout mount for an extra $50 with it.

I have never had any issues but I'm sure repairs wouldn't be a problem. I paid $140, selling for $115, sold the gun an have no use for it.

Let us examine first though because I DO BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION (even though you were flippin Wally World .22LR at DOUBLE THE PRICE) as of March 31st....because you DESPERATELY needed the money for the rent (but didn't post until the 31st?). So let's see what STORIES do we have with this one:

**Oh and by the way folks, he tried to take down all of his previous SCAMS after I exposed him on his 2nd attempt, but HAVE NO FEAR, they are cached and I will provide a link to his greatest hits here (in which I received DOZENS of emails from folks THANKING ME FOR WARNING THEM OF VULTURES LIKE YOU, I warned you to take your crap to Craigslist as you and your BS stories DO NOT BELONG IN THIS COMMUNITY). Greatest hits collection:

There were MORE, but this was a pretty lengthy reply as it was and highlighted enough IMO. Take particular notice that ALL of his posts posted over about a 6 week period, and at the SAME TIME that he needed money to ""PAY RENT"" or ""FIX HIS TRUCK SO THAT HE COULD MAKE IT TO WORK AND FEED HIS FAMILY"", his previous 8 or so posts were headlined with ""$$$$CASH FOR YOUR .22LR FIREARM$$$$"" meanwhile posting his most awesome TACTI-COOL AR-15 for $1700.00 I think it was. Anyways it is included in the links above, ALL OF WHICH WERE POSTED BY THIS JOKESTER.
But let me not judge too quickly, let's see what you got here:

""9mm CZ 75 P-07 Duty. Comes with factory carrying case, a Fobus paddle holster, 2 mags, a manual safety lever (so you can use a de-cocker or safety so you can carry cocked and locked) a Hogues universal slip on grip, and 100rds of 9mm Federal.
Its in great shape.""

Oh well it is good to see that things must be going well for you now, that's good. Found a buyer for all that .22LR did ya? Perhaps it was the AR-15?

What else do we have here:

""I've only owned if for 3 or so months...I Will entertain trades.""

Let's see 3 months...today is May 1st, March 31st you didn't have enough money to pay rent, remember when you said this in that post?

""Well, I hate to do this... But I need the money. I apologize in advance for having to ammo gouge. This kinda crap usually pisses me the F**K Off!!!I do NOT do this to make a living like half these clowns, I have a full time job and make an honest living... I usually keep my rounds too shoot but I'm short on rent this month and I either sell my ammo, or my gun. So my ammo is on the chopping block.""

Okay back to this CZ at hand here....so we went back 2 months into March, lets see you say 3 months ago so lets look at April shall we? Ahhhh....here we are:

""WTS/WTT Custom AR-15. Smith and Wesson M&P 15, Mil-Spec, .556, Moe Edition and More!""

""WTS/WTT --- Smith and Wesson M&P 15 MOE Edition / .556 / Mil-Spec. Retail for this AR-15 is $1,297.00 (Not Including Tax) This is a great rifle!""

A ""great rifle"" huh? Best not ever have a look at my collection of AR's, however I digress. Let us continue:

""The only reason I'm selling it, is because I need money to fix my truck.""

Oh REEEEAAALLLYYY, but....but...you have ""FS/FT"", I mean if my work truck was broke, I......DON'T THINK I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN A FOR TRADE, I mean you need $$$ to fix a truck right? And to continue on:

""I've owned this rifle for about 2 years and I've got about 500 rounds through it TOPS! I've never had a jam, stove pipe, or anything along those lines. It chews up and spits out anything I feed it. All in All its truly a great gun!""

And then he lists all his ""killer parts"" on it. News flash, UTG is NOT Daniel Defense, Troy, VLTOR, YHM, Midwest Industries, etc...  $1600?!? Oh yea it was because you needed to fix your truck, my bad.

BUT WAIT!!! THAT WOULD PUT YOU AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT YOU WERE OUT BUYING THIS CZ-75 P07 YEA? SO WHICH LIE IS IT DUDE?!? HUH? WHICH LIE, OR LIES ARE WE EXPECTED TO BELIEVE? I WARNED YOU ONCE but apparently (oh and I KNOW YOU SAW IT) you deactivated everything I called you out on, waited a couple of weeks, then tried it again...I BUSTED YOU AGAIN, and now here you are.

FOLKS, BE WARNED OF DOING.....ANY TYPE OF BUSINESS WITH THIS PERSON WHO OBVIOUSLY LACKS MORALS, CHARACTER, & AND JUST PLAIN DECENCY! YES I DO BELIEVE IN....REAL CAPITALISM (something he tried justifying himself with after he got caught, but what he was justifying was CRONY CAPITALISM).

IT IS NOT GETTING YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE EXTENDED FAMILY/FRIENDS UP BY 0730 HITTING WALLY'S WORLD WITHIN A 10 BLOCK RADIUS CLEANING THEM OUT OF THEIR .22LR ONLY TO COME ON HERE AND FLIP THEM AT A 50-100% PROFIT!!!

Hey Mr. KLJohns9219(at)gmail(dot)com
Text or Call - 520, Four99-Four82Four
If I do not answer, LEAVE A MESSAGE or I WILL NOT CALL BACK.

If anyone has exchanged emails with this SCAMMER, please feel free to forward one to me so that I can track down his IP address please. And YES I work for the gubberment, BUT THIS IS A PERSONAL MATTER BECAUSE I CARE MORE ABOUT HUMANITY AND MY FELLOW BROTHERS & SISTERS IN ARMS, AND WE DON'T NEED LYING SCUMBAGS SUCH AS YOURSELF MAKING A BAD IMPRESSION. IMO EVERY HOUSEHOLD SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST ONE AR-15 IN IT!!

Sorry for the long reply, but duty called and I warned this guy TWICE now about trying to RIP PEOPLE OFF ON HERE. I will NOT stand by and let it happen!

If you cannot find anything that you are looking for on here, I recommend:

2nd Amendment in Tucson (I know I have heard some folks say that they had a bad experience when they went there, but the FEW times that I have went all of my experiences were good, the people were over the top nice, their wallpaper are GUNS, and you know that saying, you can't please all of the people all of the time.)

I like using the Gun Genie that I linked above. It is an AWESOME tool (which by the way showed that there are CURRENTLY 31 CZ-75 PO7's IN STOCK ON THE SHELVES right now amongst 7 or 8 dealers, I just gave 3 random prices that they are asking...ALL BNIB).

High Country Guns & Ammo for those that live out towards the Benson, Whetstone, Tombstone, Huachuca City, & Sierra Vista. YOU WON'T FIND BETTER PRICES ON MANY GUNS & AMMO, PERIOD!

Here RIGHT ON ARMSLIST is perhaps THE BEST guy THAT DOES NOT, NOR HAS EVER GOUGED ANYONE (even during the panic of last year, if he ran out...which is RARE, then he ran out), some of the BEST BUSINESS ETHICS YOU WILL FIND ON HERE:

http://www.armslist.com/posts/2883567/tucson-arizona-rifles-for-sale--billet-side-charging-ar-15-s---825

Note: Click to see all of his listings, and if I am not mistaken I believe that his prices INCLUDE THE TAXES ALREADY IN THEM! But be sure to ask just to make sure as I do not want to do you or him wrong in saying something incorrect). He should have been listed at #1.

And the MANY individuals that I have done business with on here on a personal face to face transfer, I have to say that I have had met NOTHING BUT FRIENDLY UPFRONT FOLKS (except for one, but that is another story), so I would say that 99% of the Armslist transactions I have either bought or sold (I mostly buy, but need to start selling or I won't ever get out of the dog house with the wife) YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN GREAT! That is why I took a good 45 minutes of time out of my day TODAY to call this guy out again because if we do not look out for each other, who we got?

922,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3013922,For Sale:  Brand New Tac-Con 3MR Trigger - Discounted,"Bellevue, Seattle, Washington",$ 450,"Listed On: Thursday, May 1, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for grabs is a brand new Tac-Con 3MR 3rd Mode Drop-In Trigger. I have two of these, one new and one used, but I'm keeping the used trigger, which I'm currently using in one of the rifles I'm keeping. I received the new trigger as a gift in late March but as I already had one, I never got around to installing it and now I'm selling much of my collection due to a growing family. These triggers are very easy to install without a gunsmith or any tools.  The Tac-Con's semi-auto mode competes with any competition single-stage drop-in trigger with a 3-3.5 lb. pull weight.  The third mode on the other hand allows for lightening fast rapid fire at a rate of roughly 600 rounds per minute.  

The technology enabling this rate of fire is a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable pull weight of roughly 3.5 pounds. 

The link below directs you to the Tac-Con homepage and provides a short video highlighting the trigger's capabilities.
