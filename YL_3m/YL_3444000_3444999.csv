Each unit is in perfect working condition just as it came from the factory. Most are dated 91/92 manufacture dates. Each unit will come with most items factory wrapped, sealed and new or like new. This offering is for the finest of the units ever available. We have never seen this nice of units in all of the years of offering the Z51 units. Get them while we have a limited supply. The only item that has any wear or storage marks that we can tell are the factory shipping cases as one could expect. These are the best units EVER FOUND LIMITED OFFERING WHILE SUPPLIES LAST!
Each unit comes in the factory aluminum green hard case. Most NV units are new in the wrapper and never used or unwrapped. We only cut a slit in the main unit plastic packaging to install C cell batteries to test that they turn on and function. Other than that they are factory sealed as we got them. We have been told these were un-issued and the last of the FERO units to be offered. Each unit comes as pictured showing each item factory sealed and serialized. Unbelievable condition and a true collectors addition.
The Z51 is a passive Night vision scope (comparable to Gen 2) with various mounts to fit several applications one of which will fit the 90 series of rifles such as the HK 91/G3 or 93/33.
The Orion 80/I made by Zeiss/Eltro & features a high-quality starlight night vision scope made for the German Bundeswehr (German Army).

When the first all-steel small frame (J) revolver was introduced in 1950, it became an instant success. Originally named the Chiefs Special by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, it has become the first choice for those who insist on an all steel, small frame revolver with greater recoil control and proven performance.  The Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular small frame personal defense revolver on the market. With decades of reliable performance to its credit."

It has been sent to the Springfield Armory Custom Shop for thier ""carry package w/night sights.""  The carry package consists of Trijicon night sights (green dots) and a combat action/carry trigger job. The trigger is set at 5lbs.  

The weapon will come with the factory case and all the accessories inside: 3 16 round magazines, 2 additional back straps, cable lock, holster, dual magazine holder, speed loader tool, bore brush, manual, safety notices, warranty card, test fire brass and copies of the invoice for the original purchase and the upgrade work from the manufacturer.  The pistol also comes with 150 rounds of 165 gr. factory reloads from Dona Ana Munitions company and 150 rounds of Winchester Ranger 165. bonded hollow points.

The upgrades were performed by Springfield armory at their custom shop.  All parts and labor are covered under the lifetime warranty on the pistol.  The Springfield shop uses powder river precision parts for the trigger upgrade.  The XDM has ambidextrous controls for the magazine release from the factory and comes with three replaceable back-straps to fit different sized hands.

This pistol is in like new condition.  It has been fired 150 rounds since new, and has never been carried outside of the range.  It has only seen duty as the night stand pistol.  The upgrade work was done November of 2013.  The night sights are bright.  The pistol has never had a malfunction and is very, very accurate.  The trigger travel is very smooth, short and with a crisp break.  The trigger rest is very, very short.  Quiet frankly, it is the best trigger I've ever felt on a striker fired pistol. 

 The pistol is pictured with a streamlight TRL-1 mounted, which is NOT included at the listed price.  There is also a left handed safariland 6287 belt holster for the weapon with the light mounted.  It is also NOT included, but if someone is interested in either item, we can negotiate. 

Sale will be documented on a bill of sale, with a copy for both the buyer and seller.  Sale will also require a Texas ID, or a military ID with PCS orders to Texas.  I will retain a copy of the ID and/or orders.  I'm also willing to sell to a buyer in Las Cruces, but the transfer will have to be via an FFL in New Mexico, at the buyers expense.  I will accept cash or an official check from a local bank.

I want something smaller but don't have money to justify buyimg an additional gun at this moment, just so I can have something smaller. But regardless, this gun does have minor holster wear that can actually probably be buffed out. Haven't been too worried about it honestly, it's not like the blueing is coming off. I'd say about 500 rounds through it. I shot steel out of it one time just to see if it would eat it....and it did. Haven't found an ammo it won't take. Deadly accurate. Shot a few mini steel plate comps at the NRA range when I was in Virginia. 
Included with this gun is 1 safari land iwb leather holster, black kydex iwb, and 1 coyote kydex owb holster. Hogue black wrap around grips and original walnut grips. 2 factory 7 round mags, 1 eight rd mag (believe it's chip mccormack) and a 10 rd promag. Upgraded combat wilson recoil spring and shok-buffs added. All the internals of this gun have been sanded and buffed for super smooth functioning and cycling. Super light trigger weight. I don't have a scale to measure but I'd be willing to say a hair under 3lbs. Roughly 20 rounds of horndady 185gr critical defense hollow points. And between 250-300 rounds of 230 fmj.

I am literally open to ANY offer. I love guns and will not be upset if you offer something besides a cc pistol. If you have a low or mid end gun I would be willing to do any type of trade (I.e. If you have two inexpensive guns I would trade mine for those. Or if you wanted to do a gun plus cash). Please send me an offer and hopefully we can work something out. If you havw any questions about Gun or work also please feel free.

Its an ultralight model with the 20 inch stainless steel barrel and black synthetic stock. In good shape with some scratches but overall pretty well taken care of. I have Always stored it in soft case which comes with gun. Cleaned after each use. and for an extra 50 it comes with a Swift 4-20 matching scope and bipod in picture which makes it a very stable shooting platform. With the .204 ruger blistering speed of over 4000fps and super flat trajectory its accuracy is better than any comparable .223 .22-250 .243 or similar calibers. Just research the 204 and you will be impressed. With the 20 inch barrel it is on the shorter side but still fits well in an adults arms. Good for beginners and kids but still packs a punch. One of the best calibers for varmints.if legal in this state it Can be used for deer if you are a good shot and I have heard of people taking black bear with them. Although the guns in this caliber are rare the caliber itself isn't and is found at most stores that have a decent selection. 
     I am selling it for $500 gun only and $550 with scope and bipod.I am looking for a 357 mag revolver so if you have one and wanna trade let me know."

General Specifications
Caliber:7.62x39mm
Overall length 35.1 inches
Barrel length 16.34 inches
Weight with empty magazine 8 lbs 4 ounces

All MAK-90 rifles have stamped sheet metal receivers except a small lot of rifles imported (by China Jing An - C.J.A.) that had receivers milled from a solid block of material. These receivers were manufactured by Chinese State Factory 386. They were all designed for the typical AK 7.62x39 ammo. The stamped and milled receivers can be easily distinguished from one another because the stamped receiver has rivets holding it together and the milled receiver has only one rivet at the front of the receiver, and is obviously milled instead of dimpled.

The letters/numbers MAK-90 stand for Modified AK-1990. The MAK-90 is a Chinese factory built AK model exported to the USA from China from 1990 through 1994 by Norinco. Following the import ban in 1989, the Chinese developed an AK which met the ""sporting purposes"" clause. (The earlier AKs were banned because of their ""evil"" features: pistol grips, folding stocks, threaded muzzles and bayonets.) The new model was basically an AK with a wood thumb-hole stock and no bayonet lug.

The model name was ground off (or lined through) and the new model name MAK-90 was stamped. They were named ""Sporter,"" to make them seem more like hunting rifles.

The stamp 386 on receiver and butt stock is the factory stamp for Polytech and this rifle includes the original sling and 1 magazine."

1. Sig Sauer P938 - Blackout Edition (938-9-MGE12)
This is similar to the BRG version, but harder to find and cooler, with the additional serrations on the front end of the slide. Night sights round it out in a 9mm version of its younger brother, making it the perfect concealed carry piece.

Listed asking price covers the above firearm and 2 mags. We can negotiate cash or ammo trade to work in the below, if interested:

2. An additional 7-round extended mag.

3. The best part of the package is this tuckable, custom molded leather IWB holster from HBE Leatherworks. Read some reviews online; he does fantastic work. This model is the Pro TL (for ""Thin Line""; the metal clip is offset from the body of the gun, making a VERY flat package to stuff inside the belt. Leather work is remarkable, clip is strong, and retention is excellent. I forget I have it on, it's so thin, and doesn't print at all. I paid $110 for this holster.

4. I was surprised at how much I took to the Galco Ankle Lite holster, which is fantastic for anytime you're in pants. The sheepskin on the inner side makes for a very soft ride. I've loved it. MSRP is $78.95, I'll include it for much less than that and throw in as a bonus a brand new, unused Sticky Holsters MD-1 ($25), which is great for pocket carry or even IWB.

All items are in lightly used condition. My wife carries a P238 in .380 and I've decided to simplify and downgrade to the same so we can share mags. This P938 has been broken in at exactly 220 rounds, and cleaned after each trip to the range. It's in great condition and been taken care of well. Comes with original hard case plus paperwork.
I'm active duty military. Buyer must show ID (ccw preferred) and be willing to sign bill of sale. Face to face only; can meet in Hampton Roads or Virginia Beach areas; also frequently in DC.

Happy to answer any questions; God bless."

While the gun may bear some resemblance to other guns on the market, Skyy is plowing a lot of new ground with this gun.The CPX-1 is only offered in 9mm. The CPX-1 is very compact and nearly identical in size to a Kel-Tec P-11. This is a good size for a concealed carry piece—large enough to shoot well, but small enough to carry easily. The gun has a concealed hammer, as opposed to the striker-type action seen in many modern DAO guns. The magazines hold 9 rounds, so with one in the chamber, you can carry a full complement of 10 rounds."
