Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.

The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

The Ranch Hand's 12"" barrel complies with federal regulations, and features a brass bead front sight with an adjustable buckhorn rear sight and an oversized loop lever.

It has a matte finish that does have some imperfections, but it very durable. Solvents will not affect the finish unless soaked in them for hours. A lightly oiled rag over the rails and receiver will smooth out imperfections.

I build my rifles to be reliable with any ammo, even the cheap stuff. The barrel is a Dez Arms 1/9 twist (best for 55-62 grain bullets, which is most common). The barrel also has the Nitro-Carburizing upgrade. It's a carbine length gas system with full auto bolt carrier and heavy H1 buffer to soften recoil. The Seekins tri-point flash hider tops it off.

Receivers are Palmetto State with feed ramps and Bolt carrier is Nickel Boron with Palmetto phosphate premium bolt.

The free floated midwest modular handguard comes with three pieces of picatinny rail sections that you can place where you want for lights, lasers, forgrips, etc., or leave them off for comfort. Sights are palmetto metal flip up, fully adjustable and dual aperture. Houge rubberized pistol grip and Fortis QD sling adapter. The Spikes nickel boron single stage battle trigger is quite nice for a mil-spec trigger. 
All parts are Mil-spec.

The oversized Seekins bolt catch rounds this baby off! 

Comes with a nice black hawk case and two 30-round magazines.

$700 gets you the flat-top rifle, Magpul grip, and 2 Thermold mags.

For an extra $400, I'll include the bipod, bipod adapter, scope, and scope mount. This is a steal for all of these accessories. This is a 6-24 power Weaver optic. This optic is lightly used and comes with flip up scope covers. I bought this scope lightly used for $350 (I believe brand new, these scopes MSRP for at least $600), attached it to this rifle, and have barely used the rifle at all. The scope mount is a Burris P.E.P.R. and I paid $80+. The bipod is a Harris - telescopic legs and tilt base. I paid over $100 for the bipod + the adapter. This is easily $500+ worth of extras that I'll throw in for $400. I'll also throw in a couple boxes of ammo.

$1100 gets you a loaded long rage rifle that is sighted in and ready to go.

There are less then 100 rounds through this rifle. It's a great rifle, but I don't use it as much as I thought I would and need to sell. You can text me at 330-808-zero-nine-nine-three or call me anytime after 5 if you have any questions. I am located in the Sugarcreek area.

The 5.56 Midlength Evo Ultra Lite 14.5"" Upper is a .625"" lite profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.With the combination of the .625"" ultra lite pencil barrel, the Samson Evolution rail, amd the new ultra lite .625"" gas block, we not have the lightest dedicated piston upper on the market. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

Comes with Custom Walnut Grips,  factory grips, 2 hi-cap mags, hard case, child proof lock and original shipping box. This gun is very concealable but not too small to shoot accurately.
The CZ 83's combination of small size and moderate weight easily handles the new generation of high-performance defensive ammo that has become available for 'pocket' pistol calibers from leading ammo manufacturers. The DA/SA trigger mechanism operates in the same manner as the CZ 75. The 83 can be carried 'cocked and locked' with the hammer back and the safety on for single action operation, or it may be manually decocked for hammer-down carry. When carried in the decocked position, the safety lever does not need to be de-activated, but instead the first shot is double action and subsequent shots are single action. The CZ 83 features an ambidextrous manual safety and magazine catch."

Chambered for .30WCF (.30-30) the rifle was made in 1919. It has a saddle ring on the left side of the receiver, and a 20” round barrel ( we think the barrel has been cut down). The rifle has seen a lot of use during it’s long life, and that is reflected in the condition. Most all of the original blue finish is gone, the rifle has lots of ptina, freckling, and even some mild pitting on the barrel. The wooden stocks have been sanded, and they look pretty good – overall, the rifle rates about 70-75% condition. The bore has strong visible rifling, however there is also some pitting. The lever action works smoothly, and trigger pull is smooth as well."

I just purchased this gun and have decided to go another direction.  

I am OCD and meticulous about my firearms to the max.  This gun was purchased and I put Talley Medium Height Lightweight Rings with a Vortex Viper HS LR 4-16x50 scope with Dead Hold BDC reticle.  The rings were lapped for accuracy and the scope has been laser leveled.  The barrel was cleaned before shooting and went through a precise cleaning process after it went to the range for break-in.

All screws have been torqued to manufactures specs.

I have put exactly 40 rounds down the pipe with great results.  All shots were under 1 MOA at 100yards with the best group being Winchester BST 130gr at .535"" group.  

I am selling the rifle with original box, papers, manual.  The scope comes with original box, papers, manual, cleaning cloth, etc.  Everything that a new scope comes with.  I will also include a partial box of Federal Premium Ammo.

I will ship with proper paper work.  I travel extensively throughout IL, IN, and MO so I can also meet people if necessary.

There are hundreds of instructors in Illinois certified to teach the basic CCW curriculum. However, not all training is created equal. Only a handful of instructors are qualified to teach at an expert level. Protection Resources International’s concealed carry classes are approved by the Illinois State Police and have been carefully crafted by nationally certified instructors with extensive NRA law enforcement and civilian training.

In addition to the Illinois Concealed Carry course,we also offer NRA-certified pistol, shotgun, or rifle courses, and, for those already proficient with a firearm, advanced tactical classes. We are certified to teach the Utah Conceal Carry Permit course, as well. This permit allows an individual to legally carry concealed in up to 34 states. (Please note, Illinois is not one of them.)

Everything is near mint condition, this setup was mounted on my piston AR two or three indoor range sessions. I live in the city and don't have any opportunity to shoot it outside so now I'm selling it. The Idea was to put together a reasonably priced mid-long range optic package for my AR. Details below:

Scope: Burris model 200322: 3x-9x-mm  w/ Illuminated ""Ballistic Plex"" reticle. It comes with the original box and papers.  Suggested retail is $445, I paid about $300 for the scope. 

Mount: LaRue Tactical QD LT104 tactical SPR/M4 mount.  If you know the LaRue name, you already know... exceptionally light and strong. This quick detach mount is known for reliable return to zero when removed and re-attached.  comes with Alan wrenches- I paid LaRue $230.00

Vortex Bubble Level Anti Cant Device: a must for long range shooting. I paid $40.00

Butler Creek Flip-Up caps, rear has quick release switch. I paid $30.00

I've invested over $600 on this optics set-up (shipping and taxes too).  You can have it for $340 out the door.

Sig Sauer Mosquito .22 was something the old lady picked out at gun show. She went to range and put maybe 100 through it that day and it has sat in the safe ever since then. Selling because it doesn't match the rest of my guns! If I remember correctly the gun failed to feed 9 or 10 times out of the 100 she shot through it but it could have been because of cheap bulk 22 ammo, not sure , never really looked into it   $200 o.b.o. for asking price will include 150 rds of 22 lr.

That is the Barrett M82A1 CQ. If you are looking at this post you most likely already know what it is. The gun is about 1 year old. It is the CQ model which has a 20' fully Chrome Lined Barrel. Its supposed to be more accurate and obviously more compact. It has about 150 rounds through it and shoots like a dream.  I have never had a single malfunction of any kind with this gun.

It also comes with a Nightforce NXS 12-42 scope Mounted with a Nightforce Magmount. It seems to me to be the perfect scope for the Gun. I have all the original packaging and paperwork for everything.

This is truly the funnest gun I could possibly imagine. The recoil is similar to a 12 ga with bird shot(seriously). The Concussion however is a whole different story. All in all this package cost me over $10,000 and I really don't want to sell it, However I am having some Financial problems so it is up for sale. If you are actually interested in this gun and actually have the money to buy it please contact me with any questions.

Note: The Picture I used is the one used by the company I bought it from, I can take pictures of it now in my house if you would like, however I only have a iPhone camera and felt they wouldn't do it justice."

As indicated by the trigger and paddle-esque hammer this is in fact the Light Double Action, and it is indeed light with a defined, crisp breaking point. For a double-action conceal carry pistol, you cannot get any better. She has a highly polished feed ramp(it's like glass, pictures don't do it justice), three-dot sights, replaced magazine release with a metal one. Para originally shipped them with plastic ones for some absurd reason. She has super slim plastic grips, a big comfortable beavertail, and carries well. She is also amazingly accurate for a 3.5-inch barrel, I can keep about the same groups at 20 yards as my father with his full-size Para.
