I have several of these and only selling this one for Holiday money.

The USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 45 ACP. Based on the full-size USP models, this handy pistol combines compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. 
The USP Compact is smaller and lighter than large frame USPs and the reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact pistols that use a difficult to shoot two-finger grip frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability. This variant of the USP Compact has a modified contoured slide and frame for effective concealability and also has a no snag, bobbed hammer. external safety and de-cocking lever.  The extended slide release is contoured to reduce wear and tear on clothing when the pistol is carried concealed.
Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high energy +P and +P+ loads. Has convenient safety/decocker and new Tritium sights.
Includes original case, H&K gun lock and one 8-round magazine."

I have a Glock 19 Gen 4 in great shape and very little use with under 200 rounds through it. No holster wear or marking on firearm. It will come with all the factory goodies and 4 backstrap options. I am looking to trade it due to me preferring my Gen 3 19 that I have carried for years. I am not looking to sell the 19 at this time. Below are a few items that I would be interested in. If firearm offered is of different value cash/items may be offered or expected.

It was rearsenaled after the war and was in storage until I purchased it from the CMP.  The gun has the early greenish parkerized finish and a nicely figured stock.

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 

The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

I know this gun is more expensive than your bog-standard 91/30, that's because this is a collectable Mosin in perfect condition.  Polish M44s are rare, rarer still in this condition.  This was made at the Radom plant in Poland.  These were post-war rifles built for rear eschelon troops, the gun never saw service and was put away in storage.  It sat there until Poland dusted the guns off and sold them out of surplus.  The gun is totally perfect, there's no metal wear or issues with the good, it looks like it came off the assembly line yesterday.  There's no pitting or rust, no cosmoline gunked everywhere that needs to be cleaned, the trigger is far better than any Russian Mosin and the bore is perfect.  Frankly I don't think this rifle has ever been shot.  Still has it's folding bayonet that's characteristic with the M44s.  If you collect Mosins or you just want a really nice gun that shoots really cheap ammo, this thing's your ticket.

The A2 LED Aviator is a compact dual-output flashlight that provides two distinct beam types. It uses virtually indestructible power-regulated LED emitters and a precision micro-textured reflector to produce a spot beam in white and a flood beam in red. The Aviator's tactically-correct two-stage pushbutton tailcap switch lets you instantly select an output level: press for a momentary-on 10-lumen long-runtime red flood beam for general night use, close work, or where you need to preserve your night vision; press further for a momentary-on 120-lumen white spot beam—six times the light of a big two-D-cell flashlight; twist for constant-on low beam, twist further for constant-on high beam. 
Features 
•Primary LED generates brilliant white spot beam, secondary LEDs produce red color flood beam
•Precision micro-textured reflector creates smooth, optimized beam
•Coated tempered window resists impact, maximizes light
•High-strength aerospace aluminum body, Mil-Spec hard-anodized for extreme durability

The 5.56 Carbine Base 11.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system.

The 5.56 Carbine Base 11.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system. Because the piston chamber is the same size as the chamber on the rest of the Adams Arms gas lengths this 11.5"" upper now has the proper dwell time to get cyclic rate and bullet velocity needed to make this a viable short barreled option for any CQB scenarios. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper.

The 5.56 Carbine Base 11.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system. Because the piston chamber is the same size as the chamber on the rest of the Adams Arms gas lengths this 11.5"" upper now has the proper dwell time to get cyclic rate and bullet velocity needed to make this a viable short barreled option for any CQB scenarios. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper.

It also has a nice engraved plaque saying the movie's name. It's pretty big probably 1 1/2 feet tall by 2 feet wide i'm guessing maybe a little bigger. I'll measure it exactly when I get a chance. It looks very classy in a Black wood frame with a Glass front. Built very solid.
It's signed by Quentin Tarantino ""Mr. Brown"", Michael Madsen ""Mr. Blonde"", Harvey Keitel ""Mr. White"", and Tim Roth ""Mr. Orange"". This is a piece of Cult Classic movie memorabilia and would look great hanging on your wall like it has on mine for many years. Perfect for that Movie Buff.
