It comes apart fine, the hammer cocks back and releases when you pull the trigger, you can see the firing pin move forward when the hammer hits it, but the trigger seems to be lacking a return spring.

Will people still loan guns to friends and family? Especially when they have an arsenal of unregistered pistols and rifles? Will you loan your brother (blood related or not) a sidearm for bow hunting etc...?

 I WILL! YES, you read that correctly!!!!

It's my right as a citizen, a CPP holder and as an AMERICAN CITIZEN. I'm not quite sure how these fat, ignorant liberals think they have the right to re-write my Constitution and Bill of Rights...Now these fucktards want to go National with this?

I say FUCK YOU.

I WILL transfer firearms, I will loan and trade and SELL to people in ""my circle of trust"" and nothing will change as I am a law abiding citizen who insists on exercising his rights. Let's face it, these idiots have no way of enforcing/finding/tracking firearms that are already out there. If I'm not mistaken, I think there are some guns floating around out there unaccounted for.....EVERYWHERE. 

In closing I ask you this...

If you're some nut ball, meth head or just angry who finds out his wife or girlfriend is cheating or whatever, and want to kill her, does it have to be with a gun? 

Do we not see guys taking blunt objects to beat people to death? Women stabbed 67 times? Or something crazy like this in a heated/drug induced/love struck rage? So we know good and well that if someone wants you dead, most of the time they just need to SEE YOU or KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR. 

If the Liberal Maggots can find some magic dust to make these women invisible, that might work. Otherwise, some love struck, angry/rejected guy is going to find you. I ask this...would you prefer to be shot, stabbed or beaten to death...? Huh?

It would be smarter to ARM women and TRAIN people to help understand a gun is a tool no different than a fucking hammer. It's a tool, it can be used to hang a pic or bludgeon someone, your choice.

I hope these people realize that this gun control has worked so well in California, Chicago etc...yeah, it's really working I tell ya. Just ask that halfbreed Alfred E Neuman in the White House and he will tell you it works, just look at their crime statistics.

When Washington is a lawless shit hole with increased car jacking and violent crime, towards ANYBODY, maybe then they will realize they've let the criminals now were unarmed, generally, and it will be a hay day for them....ON YOU.

Good luck out there folks. If you wanna respond with something neat that's fine.

 Don't be a douche or I will post your email on some faggot forum or in turn send you a virus. I'm feeling a little annoyed, so think before responding.

If someone tells you that voted yes on 594, please give them a high five today...in the face...with a chair."

As everyone knows the Hog Hunter has a 20"", free floated, threaded barrel.  It has an oversized bolt handle and an adjustable trigger.  The barrel has a set of tall Iron sights to see over a suppressor if one is attached.  I decided to get back into long range shooting and this is a lot of rifle for the money.  I mounted a 20moa sloped base and an American Made Redfield 3x9 mil hash scope with target turrets on top.  I put a scope level on the scope and attached it to the rifle with Leupold QRW rings.  I also added an A2 flash hider to the barrel.  Total round count is 50.  Using 77smk factory ammo I have come ups out to 600 yards and was ringing 12x12 steel plates at that distance.  I can throw in a box of 50 rounds of this ammo to the buyer.

The buyer gets my log book.

the rifle also has a Harris tilting bipod(6-9"").

This is a ready to go precision rifle. 

I will separate the scope amd or bipod from the rifle if the buyer doesnt want them and adjust the price.

Family owned and passed down the current owner isn't a hunter anymore.  He's looking to move over to 3 gun. Serial Number dates this Rifle to 1950. 63 rounds of ammunition come with this rifle. 

The 99EG, although Savage states that the R’s were the most produced 99’s the model 99EG seems to be the most common. It is basically the same receiver and 24” barrel with ramp front sight as the R and RS.  The EG is the most used hunting gun in the bush when it comes to the 99, most deer hunters will swear to the end of their days that the 99EG in 300 is the deers worst enemy and some would go so far as to say it’s killed more deer than the Win 94.

Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

This Pistol has no miles on it whatsoever it is a cream puff to shoot, Made In Germany the design with no sacraficing quality is really on point. The only reason in the world im getting rid of this pistol is because i am a 9mm guy thru and thru i cannot change ammo supplies on one gun so unfortunetly this great HK must go this gun lists without Night Sights for 811.00 i would like a quick cash sale so here now your cash price for this AWESOME WEAPON is 675 OTD!!

Factory correct 20 inch carbine barrel with integral front sight ramp, bore is sharp and mirror bright. The barrell and magazine retain 95% original blue. The receiver is mechanically fine, feeds, fires and ejects smoothly. Headspace is perfect. Receiver has the typical mottled finish from this era, the carbona blue just never held that well on the nickle steel Winchester used in the receivers. It has the Lyman 56 receiver sight which was a factory option. The wood is solid and tight, nicely grained black walnut that has a few very minor handling marks but no chips, cracks, extra holes or bad dents. This is a fine vintage Winchester that has that ""slick as glass"" feel when you cycle the bolt. A rare model 64 factory carbine from an era of fine craftmanship we will probably never see again."

One of the Best, if not The Best, All Time Target Rifles. This Winchester Target Rifle was manufactured in 1949, but looks like it was just out of the box yesterday. When Grandpa passes, some of his favorite toys just lay around and collect dust. The target rifle comes with a Vaver fully-adjustable, receiver-mounted aperture rear sight and a Lyman-like collared Match Globe front sight. But that's not all. It comes with the original target scope. The same scope sells on eBay for over $500.
Overall, the bluing is between 95 - 99%; the stock is perfect, except for a few dings; the action is remarkably smooth;  the sights and scope are as good as new, except the scope spring is missing. More photos upon request or, if in the Derby, KS area, stop by and visit with the old Dutchman and look at this beauty for yourself.

The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Scope TA01NSN w/ Amber Center Illumination for M4A1 fits AR15/M16 flat-top rifles and modifications include an integral rear ghost ring aperture and a tritium glow-in-the-dark front sight(Amber Illumination) for close-combat/back-up sighting.image The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Rifle Scope was designed specifically for the US Special Operations Command SOPMOD M4 Carbine and features the reticle bullet drop compensator and range finding stadia lines that are based on the trajectory of the 62 grain bullet from a 16 inch M4A1 barrel. The black, daytime reticle of the Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Hunting Scope glows red at night and in low light due to its tritium composition. Unique to the Trijicon ACOG sights is its internal adjustment capability - only the prism housing moves - making this the most rugged scope available. This rifle scope by Trijicon will withstand exposure to temperature extremes, salt spray, fog, fungus, humidity, sand, dust, shock vibration and a free fall drop onto a hard surface. Aerospace seals make Trijicon riflescopes waterproof to depths greater than 500 fee and a hole through the M16 integral base permits use of the iron sights without removal of the scope. This Trijicon ACOG 4x32mm Tactical Rifle Scope can be attached to the carrying handle with one or two screws (2nd screw is optional) and the user does not need to make any special adjustments between shots at different ranges.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

I also have 620 rounds of .223 target ammo (PMC 55-gr. FMJ-BT). I would toss it into the deal for an extra $180. That would make the entire package $880. The market value on this being new in box is with ammo and clips is $1052. Buy here and save a $172!!!"
