 Intratec rebranded a variant of the TEC-9 as the TEC-DC9 from 1990 to 1994 (DC standing for ""Designed for California""). The most noticeable external difference between the TEC-9 and the later TEC-DC9 is that rings to hold the sling were moved from the side of the gun with the cocking handle, to a removable stamped metal clip in the back of the gun. The TEC-9 and TEC-DC9 are otherwise identical.  In 2001, the company went out of business and production of the AB-10 model ceased.

This listing is for THREE Magazines; Buyers, however, may take any number of additional ones at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Here are genuine factory Glock magazines to fit the Model 22 Pistol in .40 S&W Caliber. They will also fit models 23 and 27 with extra capacity but some protrusion; and of course they work just fine in the Glocks 31, 32 and 33 chambered in .357 Sig caliber since the case heads are the same for the two calibers. These magazines free-fall like they’re supposed to; lock the slide back like they’re supposed to; and most important, feed reliably. Manufacturer is Glock gmbh of Deutsche-Wagram, Austria. Importer is Glock, Inc., of Smyrna, GA. Construction is classic polymer body with steel inner lining, and visible loading ports so the operator can check round count.  Each magazine holds 15 rounds of .357 Sig or .40 S&W Caliber Ammunition. These are Third Generation magazines, and they will not work in a Generation 4 Glock set up for a Left Hand shooter. They will work just fine on any Glock set on Right Hand Shooter. Some of these are LE Marked, manufactured prior to 2004 when a certain Federal Statute sunset. Most of the parent pistols were manufactured in 2007. They served and protected our fellow citizens in Massachusetts with Lynn Police Department. Insertion and ejection streaking is moderate, and all of them are well maintained. Replacement pricing  on these in our area is upwards of $40 apiece, and many times they’re hard to come by even at those prices. Our Single Mag price is $25. We’re offering these excellent magazines, however, in lots of 3 or more at only $19 each. Own 3			for only	$ 57.00.	Not for sale to civilian residents of California, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, or any other jurisdiction where 15 round magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement only.

At this price, 2 magazines in each caliber, free shipping.  OEM manual included, and ""tool kit"".

""Close"" offers considered .  Also one P240 frame only can be made available (no upper section) is available, which can be used with the complete set to end up with 2 simultaneously useful guns.

The gun or gun and extra frame are available with the ""solid"" drip original to the gun shown, or with a number of other fixed and adjustable grip options, or a fixed LH grip (size L).  In general, the non-adjustable target grips are better, and the one on the gun is perfection in reshaping, if it fits your hand.  Grip can be selected from other fixed grip sizes to fit, or an adjustable one in NOS condition provided.

This gun is NOT NOT NOT for someone who ones a ""pinup"" to place on a self and never use.  It has use marks, the .32 upper section is NOS but has some scratches thanks to US customs, and the .22 section (no serial number) has some minimal wear from the proof testing (most likely).  It IS IS IS for someone who wants accuracy in the 38 that is better than the more recent P240 upper sections, and accuracy in the .32 and .22 upper sections that is the equal of the more recent guns. It also is for the collector who wants the EARLY version of the P240 (see below).

The .38 upper section (SN matched to the frame) is one of the very rare early guns, with a large interlocking key welded onto the barrel, for more precise and tighter lockup with the upper section and frame.  Due to manufacturing expense, this was dropped in the later models and the Sig Sauer pistol line in general.  It does give superior accuracy however, especially as the gun warms up after the first 5 shots.

The .32 upper section is typical accuracy for this gun.  These are excellent but not as accurate as the SAKO due to a slower twist rate.  Upper sections and magazines NOT sold separately, but complete .32 guns with matched SNs are available, with or without box.

For those preferring a gun of similar accuracy but lower price, the GSP in .32 is an excellent alternative.  I have several available.  For those wanting higher quality and higher price is ok, a SAKO TriAce also is available in .22/.32.

For a more complete catalogue raisonne (selection guide and discussion as well as availability catalog), please email.  The SAKO is not in the catalogs, so inquire separately about that one.

The grip on this gun is fitted to absolute perfection for hand size 3.4-3.5"". It can be enlarged slightly, or adjusted for shorter fingers by additional cutting. The current fitting on it, however, is one of the most precise and expert that I've ever ever ever seen. Even the left panel has been sculpted to match the right side artistically, or perhaps for 2 handed use."

From Les Baer website.
https://www.lesbaer.com/ShootingUSA.html

I have up for sale a used Les Baer Shooting USA .45cal 1911 style pistol.  This pistol is used, but still veeerrry tight.  I acquired it in a trade and took it apart to clean it.  It was very difficult to break down due to the close fit of the parts.  It was almost impossible to get the barrel bushing off without a bushing wrench.

This gun has a low serial number and comes with 5 -8rd. magazines.  2 are Nighthawk Custom mags, 2 are Kimber Kimpro mags and 1 has no brand or maker stamped on it.  One of the Kimpro mags is missing a screw on the floor plate.  It also comes with a Safariland nylon pistol case that has a pocket for 2 handguns and external magazine pouches.  It has very thick padding as well.  It also has the Les Baer patch, DVD, Sigarms 1911 plastic paddle holster, & original wood grips.  The grips on it now are black G10 type grips with torx head screws.  The knurling on the front and back straps is 30LPI and is very well done.  Everything about this pistol says quality.

The trigger on this gun is outstanding and the adjustable sights are as well.

I will accept cash, check, or money order.  Anything other than cash will have to clear before I release the pistol.  All Illinois residents must have a FOID card, pass the mandated state background check, and wait the required 72 hour waiting period from the time the deal is made.
Any questions please email me or call me at REDACTED

I already own a TRP Operator with a rail. If I didn't use the rail, I would definitely be keeping this custom shop pistol instead!

Springfield Armory Custom Shop 1911 - ""Special Cavalry"" - Custom Carry 1911-A1.
The pistol is basically a cross between the FBI's HRT Pro model and a TRP Operator with some very minor changes, most noticeably from the Pro, the addition of the lanyard loop on the MSH and the undercut triggerguard.

-Full size 5"" 1911 built off a National Match frame and matching slide
-SS match barrel and bushing.
-20 LPI checkering on the front strap and MSH
-""Colt Style"" high undercut triggerguard
-S&A magwell MSH with USGI-Style lanyard loop
-Wilson Ambidextrous Safety
-Novak brand (not SA ""knockoffs"") low-mount night sights with Trijicon tritium
-4.5lb trigger pull
-Custom Shop ""memory bump"" grip safety
-Mag well blended to Frame
-Armory Coat
-GI Guide Rod/Recoil System
-3 wilson 47D Mags

Markings:
Springfield Custom engraving (right side slide)
""Nancy Jane"" Pistol's name engraving
""SPECIAL CAVALRY"" ""model"" name engraving

This pistol is truly unique and she shoots beautifully, as you'd expect with a professionally built custom shop gun. Very few rounds fired through this pistol (250 - 50 from me, and 200 from the previous owner) - there is a marks from being dropped once (d'oh!) on the end of the rear sight (see picture) but no [typical] idiot mark or holster or hard use wear. I will also include a spare Novak cut rear night sight should you feel so inclined to swap the rear sight.

The HRT Pro model typically sells for $3,000 and the Custom Carry 1911-A1's generally go for a little less. This is your chance to get a custom shop pistol for slightly more than you'd pay for a TRP Operator. Invoice on this pistol was ~$2200, and custom shop builds have gone up in both price and wait time since that time.

Gun History:
Late WWII Nazi pistol produced for the Waffenamt (German Army Weapons Agency) at the CZ factory in Prague, probably around 1944. The Modell 27 was adopted by the Czech military in 1927 and continued in production until after the war. Waa76 is the Third Reich inspection mark for the CZ factory. The eagle-over-swastika stamp is a Nazi military test proof. ""fnh"" was the German ordinance code for the Prague factory where it was produced. Those obviously date it during the war after German conquest of Czechoslovakia, but before the Russkies kicked them out in 1945. And the serial number suggests late in the war, because they continued to make these post-war, starting with the serial number 476XXX.

This specific guns serial number being 429703 makes this one of the last being pumped out of the factory as the German's were losing the war. The last ditch effort is shown on it's rough slide.

If you’re looking for a versatile carry pistol that is packed with features, has amazing capacity, and performs flawlessly, look no farther than the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is the smallest of the XD(M)® line, but it’s by no means the least. It boasts the same superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make larger XD(M)®’s easy and intuitive to use in a slightly abbreviated package. And you’ll be amazed at how fun it is to shoot.
The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact has a 3.8 inch barrel mated with a shortened compact frame. When combined with the versatility of XD(M) Gear® X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazines, the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is ready for daily carry or a day on the range. Put in an X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazine, and you have a 19 round full-sized 9mm pistol (16 rounds in .40SW, 13 rounds in .45ACP). Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact (11 rounds in .40SW, 9 rounds in .45ACP). Like all XD(M)®’s, the XD(M)® 3.8″ Compact comes with three interchangeable backstraps, dovetail sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel.You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M)® a safe pistol in responsible hands.
If you want a gun for daily carry as well as a trip to the range, but you only want to buy one gun, try the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. You’ll be amazed at how controllable it is to shoot and how easy it is to conceal. It’s two guns in one.

Sighted in at 200 yards and has done me well but I decided to get something in a bigger caliber. Paid 300 selling for 180 because this model needs to be cleaned and treated well after you fire it. Has some light rubbing on the barrel but no pitting. I have noticed that without proper maintenance or lubricant the bolt will not release fired shells without some serious pulling on the bolt. So cleaning is more of a hassle with this firearm but it makes for a good first rifle or truck gun. Again only 180

This predecessor to the P220 was issued primarily to plain-clothed law enforcement, the Sig Sauer P245 quickly acquired a reputation of dependable accuracy, functionality, and ease of concealment.  

The P245 you see here is in perfect working condition and was my primary EDC pistol until recently.  There is holster wear on the slide and a small nick in the anodozing on the beavertail, but other than that it looks great.  The pistol was maintained by a DOJ armorer so the functionality is flawless.

It has been upgraded with Trijicon night sites and two extended magazines.

Also included are two compact magazines, two additional extensions, and a Gould & Goodrich 807 leather concealment holster.

The dimensions are the same as the P220 so you can use P220 grips, magazines, holsters, etc with no loss in functionality.

    **NOTE**  Don’t get sucked in about how bad Counter Boreds are. When done
                     properly, they are as accurate as Non- Counter Bored, and these 
                     were  done correctly. Collectors do not want a rifle altered in any way
                     from original specifications. This is why Counter Boring has a bad rap. 

    **NOTE**  Not pictured are the front end of the barrels. The proper front sights,
                     Bayonets (T53 ONLY) and Cleaning Rods are mounted on each rifle.

    **NOTE**  Don’t get sucked in about how bad Counter Boreds are. When done
                         properly, they are as accurate as Non- Counter Bored, and these were 
                         done correctly. Collectors do not want a rifle altered in any way from
                         original specifications. This is why Counter Boring has a bad rap. 

    **NOTE**  Not pictured are the front end of the barrels. The proper front sights,
                   Bayonets (T53 ONLY) and Cleaning Rods are mounted on each rifle.                                  

    **NOTE**  If you are looking to chop-up a rifle for an Archangel Conversion Stock,  
                         PLEASE only buy #3, or #4. Numbers 1, 2, 5 and 6 are far too good for 
                         that CRAP!!!!! There is very little difference between a T53 & M44."

Let me begin by saying that I don't care if this pistol goes or stays.  I love carrying it, and REALLY love shooting it, so needless to say, I am in no rush. 

This is a near new HK VP 9, HK's new striker fired beauty. The serial is VERY low, and the pistol is as close to new as you can get. I put 200 rounds through it, all flawless. This pistol comes equipped with HK proprietary luminescent sights, all back straps, and two mags. There is no wear or blemishes.

A Luger specialist said to expect 25 to 30% below high retail from a dealer, making it $2,800 to $3,000.  I am asking $2,500.   One thing that makes this more rare is that there is NO EAGLE marking on it, meaning it was only sold in the German market and thus quite rare in the U.S."

Also have a Bianchi #5BH leather holster and a leather gun belt with cartridge holders (38 Small - I'm waaaay too fat for this thing).
