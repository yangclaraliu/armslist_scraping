Product Description:

At 5″ tall with a barrel length of just under 4″, the Compact model shaves a little more than 3/4″ off the length and about 1/2″ off the height of the full-size CZ 75. Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line."

I pulled this off my new DDM4v5 shortly after purchase.  It's seen three trips to the range.  It will come with all mounting hardware, the three ladder rail covers, and the Danny D marked forward grip. (The barrel nut bracket isn't pictured, but it will come with the rail).  It has QD points on front and rear of both sides, and is in PRISTINE CONDITION.  

This is the same rail as the Daniel Defense AR15 Lite Rail II™ 12.0 (Rifle) rail, with the only difference being that they label the rails that come on their factory rifles differently than the ones they sell commercially.    Here's the link for the identical rail off their site:

https://danieldefense.com/rail-systems/ar-15-lite-rail-2a/ar15-lite-rail-iitm-12-0-rifle.html

Retail on this rail is $399.  The guys at Guerrilla had one in stock a couple weeks ago for $369 or $389 (can't remember which).    I'm asking $290 cash, and am not interested in any trades, unless you have a Benelli M2 or a Beretta 1301 Comp, both in 12 Gauge that you're looking to part with.  I will of course make up the difference in price.

Cliffnotes Version:  Awesome Rail, America, 26% under best price you'll find, America, $290 it's yours, America, Pristine Condition, America, No trades unless you have two specific models of shotguns that I'm interested in (Unamerica, because Italians seems to make better shotguns than we do).  True story, I've got the busted shotgun to prove it.

I sold off all of my 7.62 x 39 and switched to 5.56. I now need the money for other reasons. Literally everything I have is brand new and has never been to the range. It's been sitting in my safe for the past 2 weeks since I made the switch. I can't sell it for retail price even if it is new, which is why I knocked the prices down. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask, I need the money so please don't offer trades. Thanks.

I found it here in Tucson in August of 2006. The previous owner was selling this 20 gauge Skeet model and an original Model 21 Skeet model in 410 bore, both of which were left to him by his father. The father bought both guns from the original owner here in Tucson on December 16th, 1976. The original owner had ordered both 21's through Mathews & Boucher in Rochester, New York on February 7th, 1952. The guns were built to his specifications and finally arrived at Mathews & Boucher where they transferred to the original owner on September 24th, 1952.

Once I took possession of the gun, I decided to send it to Connecticut Shotgun in New Britain, Connecticut to have the barrels and receiver reblued. There were a few spots of missing blue on the trigger plate, possibly from a few drops of blood, and some fine scratches on the barrels from what I assumed was from use in the field. The buttstock and forend wood were and still are just about perfect and needed no attention at all.

After about six weeks, Lou in the gun room at Connecticut Shotgun sent the gun back to me. His work on it was exceptional. It hasn't been fired since.

The length of the raised matted rib barrels is 28 inches. The left barrel is choked WS-2 and the right WS-1. The front sight is a Bradley red bead and the middle is the 94B Winchester white metal sight. The safety is non-automatic. The trigger is gold plated. The ejection is selective. Bore diameters by my CPS bore gauge are .616 for both barrels. The choke constriction on the left barrel measures just shy of .602 and the right comes in at .603 so in fact, the chokes run closer to modified. Quoting from Schwing's book on the 21 regarding chokes, it states on page 95 ""Where constriction was slight, in the case of Winchester Skeet #1 and Winchester Skeet #2, choke diameter would vary with the bore.""

The stock is the straight English style with the later Diamond pattern checkering on the slim beavertail forend. DAC is 1 5/8ths of an inch and DAH is 2 inches. LOP is 14 inches to the center of the checkered butt. The cast is neutral and the overall length is 44 and 5/8ths. It has ""select nice wood"" and a ""medium comb - leaning to the thin side"". Although the gold oval name plate is supposed to be engraved with the owner's initials according to the build sheet, there are no initials present. The oval is still slightly proud of the stock, so I think that he must have changed his mind about that. Weight is approximately 6 and 1/2 pounds. 

I'm not a dealer but I can go through a local dealer if needed at an additional cost to cover his transfer fee. The gun will be carefully packaged and shipped in a hard case. 

One like this doesn't come along often. I have been very careful to represent this desirable 21 as accurately as possible. As stated previously, this gun was reblued and serviced by Connecticut Shotgun and has not been fired since. It is in perfect working order if you choose to actually shoot it."

I found it here in Tucson in August of 2006. The previous owner was selling this 20 gauge Skeet model and an original Model 21 Skeet model in 410 bore, both of which were left to him by his father. The father bought both guns from the original owner here in Tucson on December 16th, 1976. The original owner had ordered both 21's through Mathews & Boucher in Rochester, New York on February 7th, 1952. The guns were built to his specifications and finally arrived at Mathews & Boucher where they transferred to the original owner on September 24th, 1952.

Once I took possession of the gun, I decided to send it to Connecticut Shotgun in New Britain, Connecticut to have the barrels and receiver reblued. There were a few spots of missing blue on the trigger plate, possibly from a few drops of blood, and some fine scratches on the barrels from what I assumed was from use in the field. The buttstock and forend wood were and still are just about perfect and needed no attention at all.

After about six weeks, Lou in the gun room at Connecticut Shotgun sent the gun back to me. His work on it was exceptional. It hasn't been fired since.

The length of the raised matted rib barrels is 28 inches. The left barrel is choked WS-2 and the right WS-1. The front sight is a Bradley red bead and the middle is the 94B Winchester white metal sight. The safety is non-automatic. The trigger is gold plated. The ejection is selective. Bore diameters by my CPS bore gauge are .616 for both barrels. The choke constriction on the left barrel measures just shy of .602 and the right comes in at .603 so in fact, the chokes run closer to modified. Quoting from Schwing's book on the 21 regarding chokes, it states on page 95 ""Where constriction was slight, in the case of Winchester Skeet #1 and Winchester Skeet #2, choke diameter would vary with the bore.""

The stock is the straight English style with the later Diamond pattern checkering on the slim beavertail forend. DAC is 1 5/8ths of an inch and DAH is 2 inches. LOP is 14 inches to the center of the checkered butt. The cast is neutral and the overall length is 44 and 5/8ths. It has ""select nice wood"" and a ""medium comb - leaning to the thin side"". Although the gold oval name plate is supposed to be engraved with the owner's initials according to the build sheet, there are no initials present. The oval is still slightly proud of the stock, so I think that he must have changed his mind about that. Weight is approximately 6 and 1/2 pounds. 

I'm not a dealer but I can go through a local dealer if needed at an additional cost to cover his transfer fee. The gun will be carefully packaged and shipped in a hard case. 

One like this doesn't come along often. I have been very careful to represent this desirable 21 as accurately as possible. As stated previously, this gun was reblued and serviced by Connecticut Shotgun and has not been fired since. It is in perfect working order if you choose to actually shoot it."

I found it here in Tucson in August of 2006. The previous owner was selling this 20 gauge Skeet model and an original Model 21 Skeet model in 410 bore, both of which were left to him by his father. The father bought both guns from the original owner here in Tucson on December 16th, 1976. The original owner had ordered both 21's through Mathews & Boucher in Rochester, New York on February 7th, 1952. The guns were built to his specifications and finally arrived at Mathews & Boucher where they transferred to the original owner on September 24th, 1952.

Once I took possession of the gun, I decided to send it to Connecticut Shotgun in New Britain, Connecticut to have the barrels and receiver reblued. There were a few spots of missing blue on the trigger plate, possibly from a few drops of blood, and some fine scratches on the barrels from what I assumed was from use in the field. The buttstock and forend wood were and still are just about perfect and needed no attention at all.

After about six weeks, Lou in the gun room at Connecticut Shotgun sent the gun back to me. His work on it was exceptional. It hasn't been fired since.

The length of the raised matted rib barrels is 28 inches. The left barrel is choked WS-2 and the right WS-1. The front sight is a Bradley red bead and the middle is the 94B Winchester white metal sight. The safety is non-automatic. The trigger is gold plated. The ejection is selective. Bore diameters by my CPS bore gauge are .616 for both barrels. The choke constriction on the left barrel measures just shy of .602 and the right comes in at .603 so in fact, the chokes run closer to modified.

The RAP4 LE the world's first paintball marker that is identical to the legendary M4 rifle used by SWAT Teams Special Operation Groups and the U.S. Military. The M4 carbine the U.S. Military's primary weapon of choice is known for its solid construction durability and sustained reliability and things are no different with the RAP4 LE. This marker is designed to replicate the look feel and action of the real M4. With features that mimic the M4 such as shell ejection after every shot magazine fed paintball rounds and the option of a collapsible or solid stock housing and disguising the CO2 cylinder.

The RAP4 LE shoots .43 caliber paintballs which are loaded into alloy or biodegradable plastic shells. The latest improvements to the RAP4 LE line improve accuracy range and overall precision of the marker not to mention the added realism of real-world functionality. RAP4 LE key features include: - Adjustable for semi- or fully-automatic fire - Shell casings are ejected after each shot - Clip-fed 20 round magazine - Can be fully submerged in water - Velocity of 350 fps to 450 fps (adjustable) - All metal construction - Air power source hidden inside the butt stock - Simple to operate and easy to maintain Weight: 6.14 lbs Length: 32"" Width: 3"" Height: 11.5""

This paintball rifle was given to me as a gift about 10 years ago, purchased new for $750 + tax. Two years ago I was offer $600 cash for just the rifle, but at the time passed because I planned on using it again, but now i'm getting ready to move & need the cash so i'm auctioning it on here. I used it for scenario & tactical paintball training a few dozen times, the put it into a case & it's been sitting in storage mostly since. A couple years ago my friend dropped it & caused the handle to crack, so I removed it, but have never gotten around to ordering a replacement. Also I've never been a fan of the stock, it's a little loose so I used to use it with an AR stock & an external tank (not included), included is the original OEM stock with the tank that fits inside (can be refilled easily with co2) But otherwise it's used in very good shape, I hooked it up to a full co2 tank it purred on auto fire & fired great on semi. I don't have any paintballs to test it but as far as I know it is in fully working condition once you replace the handle.

An improved solid butt stock for this rifle is available RAP4 the manufacturers for $33, it's a newer gen design that fits this LE model. Also a replacement handle/grip for the LE model is available new from RAP4 the manufacturers for $20. I can send links to the buyer.

This is also a very popular rifle for use as a movie prop; when you use red paintballs loaded into the aluminum cartridges/brass, the effect looks like you are shooting real bullets & the red paint makes for realistic wounds on film, especially on lighter colored clothing.

***JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR, THIS IS AN ALL METAL REPLICA OF AN M4 THAT IS NOT A REAL FIRE ARM. IT DOES NOT SHOOT REAL BULLETS, IT SHOOTS PAINTBALLS, LOADED INTO CARTRIDGES, PROPELLED BY CO2 FOR TRAINING/PROP USE.***

Selling it for that reason, I moved. Where I used to live I shot on a 'tactical' league once a week and had access to a shooting facility at will. My new job and location don't let me shoot as much as I used to and it's just collecting dust in my gun locker now.

I think I need to sleep on it but I might as well write up the ad anyway. 

I built this rifle out of frustration that no one offers it as a complete rifle, and it wanted very specific things because I am a pain in the ass.  I wanted  a do it all , and do it exceptionally well, all around AR-15. This rifle will shoot 1in groups or less with any weight or manufacturer ammunition you care to put in it, has never once malfunctioned in the 600 rnds I have put down range. I built this rifle using only top end parts, I built this to be my one and only AR and spared no expense on the hardware. 
The M16-a5 is a 20in rifle, using. Rifle length gas system, flat top receiver and a collapsible stock. 

BCM 20in flat top complete upper
Spikes tactical MPI/HPT bolt carrier group
AERO precision lower 
VLTOR A5 receiver extension kit specifically designed for the rifle length gas system
-utilizing a rifle spring. A5 buffer and the extension tube is longer than an M4 tube
This setup makes for an incredibly soft recoiling rifle, it is like shooting a .22 rifle, just much louder.
Magpul MOE rifle handguards 
Magpul pistol grip
Magpul MOE buttstock
Magpul MBUS rear sight

The optic is a Vortex Sparc it was meant to be a place holder until I could manage to purchase a Leupold VX-R to complete this gun as a DMR/do it all rifle. I actually love this little optic and it is an amazing piece of kit for the price - comes with the gun for the asking price, it comes with the 2x magnifier and all the extra mounts. It is sighted in on the rifle for 150 yards. Also included is a 3x magnifier specifically for Eotech holographic sights incase you have one of those to mount on it.

I don't know why I m listing this rifle, I have probably lost my mind but I figure it never hurts to test the waters. You probably won't find anything else like it, unless you built it and the you will see that the price I am asking won't cover building a new one. 
I have now switched gears on what I want. Really want a piston AR or a 14.5-16in mid length rifle to play with. Would rather have the cash to build my own unless it's a complete spikes, BCM or other top tier rifle.
