Product Information
Shop more AAC products
The AAC Brakeout Flash Hider Muzzle Brake combines the best features of AAC's Blackout flash hiders and Blackout muzzle brakes into a single, high performing unit. The Breakout's rear muzzle brake chamber is open on both sides and on the top for reduced perceived recoil & muzzle rise, yet closed on the bottom for minimal environmental disturbance when shooting from the bench or prone positions. The 3-prong front end incorporates elements of the Blackout flash hider's effective design to minimize muzzle flash. All Breakout flash hider muzzle brakes are machined from high strength aerospace 17-4 stainless steel alloy and coated in a hard, durable, corrosion resistant SCARmor finish.
This 51T Brakeout works in conjunction with AAC's improved ratchet mount sound suppressors. The 51-T mount is an intuitive, lightning fast silencer attachment/detachment system that allows for secure installation of a suppressor in less than 3 seconds with no tools or moving parts. Not compatible with the older spring mount (18-Tooth) or newer ratchet taper mount (90-Tooth) sound suppressors.

Designed for inexpensive, high velocity 22LR ammunition, the accurate rapid-fire performance of the M22 offers the shooter an economical shortcut for modern defensive pistol practice at the range. The M22 gives shooters the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a 4"" match barrel, an extremely crisp, 4-lb. single-action trigger and a windage-adjustable sight. The M22 pistol from ISSC has five safety features: hammer drop-down, loaded chamber indicator, trigger safety tab, magazine disconnect, and an external key-lock. It uses easy to load 10-round magazines in a lightweight polymer frame with an integral rail for training with lights and lasers.

Condition: VERY lightly used! (about 200 rounds)

This is a forged steel frame and slide, high capacity 9mm with adjustable sights.
Great house, car or range gun, but a little on the big and heavy side for CCW for a person of small stature.
Low recoil due to size and an easy gun to shoot well.
I bought it new and shot it a couple of times a year.
It has proven to be very reliable, very accurate and pleasant to shoot.
It has the slightest of wear on the barrel hood and other than that it is  near new.
Has two factory mags and a 16 round capacity. 15+1
Comes with everything that came with it new, box, papers, warranty card, lock, cleaning kit, oil etc.
Checkered steel front and back straps, three dot adjustable sights, can be carried cocked and locked like a 1911 or double to single action like a third generation S&W
A very well built, heirloom quality, high cap 9mm in excellent plus condition.
Catalogs as AR-25-15C and is NOT the compact version"

LaRue Targets are made of the highest quality materials and are produced on computer numerically controlled (CNC) machinery that gives consistent high quality.

The overall dimensions are 28 inches high, 32 inches wide and is made of 3/8 inch steel plate that is hardened to 500 Brinnell. Silhouette plates are rated to accommodate 7.62mm NATO, but have been shot them with .300 Winchester Magnum at ranges as close as 200 meters without ill effect.

LaRue targets are battery powered and will cycle through approximately 1,800 down and up cycles before requiring a recharge. After being hit, the target returns to the upright position and automatically shuts off until the silhouette is again hit and knocked down. This is the primary reason for the systems long battery life. It also precludes having to turn the targets off and on, although there is a master on/off switch.

The targets are weatherproof and can be left out without damage. Users have reported leaving LaRue targets exposed to the weather over a year's time without affecting their operation. LaRue Tactical stands behind the quality of its targets and will repair or replace any target that is found to be defective.
Some of the main advantages over traditional targets are:

Battery Powered. Automatically resets 1800 times between charges.

Man Portable. 72 lbs total weight.

Self Contained. No assembly required, no set-up, no hoses, no wires!

Battle Tough. 3/8"" thick 500 Brinnell target. Withstands .223s and .308s.

Weather Proof. Leave LaRue Targets out year-round"

The P30 pistol series stands for systematic safety. Not just empty words, but rather a user-oriented performance commitment that was pursued with no compromises in the development and design of the P30. The result is a top-quality series of pistols that combines maximum safety with perfect functionality.

With a striking design and refined details. Besides its renowned reliability, the P30 is especially notable for the completely new design of its grip ergonomics. The easily exchangeable grip shells (right/left) are the only ones of their kind in the world. In combination with the exchangeable back strap the pistol provides maximum adaptability to any hand size – for both men and women.

What is more, the standardized MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail at the front of the P30 frame provides maximum flexibility with regard to equipment with additional tactical accessories.

So it is somewhat of a rare gun just being a West German, but even rarer to be dated after the reunification of Germany. The pistol is in good shape and comes with two 8 round magazines, a safari land paddle holster and the original box and owner's manual.  This is the most accurate pistol I have ever owned.

Additional components are built from 1018 cold rolled steel and plated with a Mil-spec black oxide finish. The proprietary STZ push button cylindrical breech lock design is 3 times stronger than existing lever lock systems. The Havoc is designed to mount on any Mil-Spec rail system. Installation simply requires sliding the launcher onto the bottom rail of the handguard and tightening two set screws which are included.

BERETTA PISTOL MODEL PX4 STORM CAL .40

The certified Beretta Px4 Storm double/single-action semiauto is the culmination Beretta’s experience in engineering pistols for military and law enforcement.
Absolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use. 
Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.

The gun has a set-trigger that is smooth as glass, and comes with a nice 3X9 scope and Harris bipod.  The micro-Mauser action has a jeweled bolt and is very smooth.  It has a detachable 5-round box magazine.  The blueing is 99% or better, with no corrosion or damage at all.  The wood is the deluxe version with checkering, and only a tiny bit of wear and maybe one or two very small nicks from coming and going into the gun safe.  

The accuracy of these CZ rifles is really unbelievable.  My local gun shop got me onto them with the .22 rimfire, and then I stepped up to this .223 to reach out farther.   I have taken crows out to 300 yard without much effort, and I'm sure it would do better if I wasn't so old!

The price on the rifle is firm, and I'm not very interested in trades at the moment.  I will need to see WA state ID, and would like to see a CWP, only for my records.
