CZ82 shoots the 9mm Makarov (A.K.A. 9x18mm).  Ammo is cheap on the internet ~$0.26-0.30 per round.  This pistol has a polygon barrel.  

Eats cheap steel case ammo and has been 100% reliable for me, about 500rnds.   I find it very accurate and easy to shoot, low bore axis = less recoil and easy followup.  Could make a great conceal carry.

If you are unfamiliar with CZ82: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CZ_82

Oddly enough this pistol from the 80s is on the ATF C&R list and can be sold legally in CO without a background check.  

Also, I have some Wolf ammo, $0.25 per round x 600rnds = $150

The SAM7SF
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7SF. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market.

The SAM7SF rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7SF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

The A400 Xplor Action is a semi-automatic shotgun that will be equally at home on an upland, duck or small game hunt as well as at the clay range. It incorporates all the advantages of the revolutionary A400 concept--low profile action, light weight, lightning-fast follow-up shots, low recoil, easy maintenance--and combines them with the classic looks of blue steel and walnut stock. But even here, Beretta has an eye towards innovation, offering updated lines and checkering, as well as a contrasting-color receiver."

I have replaced the grip on this with a Hogue grip for tracker series revolvers. It's not a perfect fit but it helps manage the recoil better and you can get more purchase on the grip.

THE LEGEND CONTINUES, The legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic is a semi-automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic features the original Swiss folding stock, as well as a polymer ergonomic forend.

The Classic’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ barrel.
SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger
housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. The SIG 556 Classic brings back the look and
feel of one of the world’s most sought after military rifles but on a platform available for law
enforcement and responsible citizens

The car has been in my family for about 5 years now and has been nothing but reliable for us. It runs and drives great with no issues. As of right now it has 190,000 miles on it. They will go up alittle bit more because I'm still driving it at times. The interior is very clean and nice. The overall condition of the body is good for the age. No rust on the body but it does have some small dings on parts of the body but nothing major. It does have a rebuilt title. It was that way when we got it. The heat works great and the A/C blows very cold. Both front windows work but do need some help at times going back up. New parts have been installed within the last year. New timing chains and tensioners. Water pump,radiator,alternator,battery,starter,outer tie rods,lower control arms,sway bar links. The tires on the front are less than 3 months old and the rear tires are about a year old but still look new. Like I said it does have a rebuilt title but for what reason I do not know. I do know for the years we have owned it. It has been a very dependable car that has always got us where we needed to go. I wouldn't hesitate to drive anywhere in it if I needed too. Would be a good beginners car or someone needing a nice dependable cheap car. I'm only selling because I can't afford to keep two cars now. Serious inquires and offers only. Low ball offers will be ignored. No trades of any kind. Text or give me a call if your interested. Cash only. Text REDACTED

Browning Buck Mark rimfire pistols lead the industry in quality, reliability, accuracy and variety. Every Buck Mark starts out as a solid piece of aircraft-grade 7075 aluminum alloy, and then is CNC machined to exacting tolerances. The crisp single-action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the Buck Mark comes ready for fun straight from the box. The Ultragrip RX and Ultragrip DX represent the latest in grip technology. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes.

Want to get a #4 Mk 1* (T) but don’t want to pay the $3,000 price tag? The next best thing is my handsome Canadian No.4 Mk I*, equipped to shoot as good as the genuine article. The 10 round group shown was shot with my 1950 Long branch #4 Mk 1*, equipped with a 3-9 x 40mm Redfield “Revolution” scope. The load was a Speer 174 gr HPBT match bullet, once fired Winchester brass, 40 grs of IMR 4895, and CCI large rifle primers (load data will be supplied with the rifle). It was shot on a 100 yard  indoor range in El Cajon, Calif, using a padded bench rest, from a clean barrel re-cleaned after each 5 rounds. The butt stock is fitted with an English wooden cheek piece, firmly held on by double-sided carpet tape (and thus will not injure the surface when removed). The action has a nice crisp trigger and rifling is sharp and in tip top condition. The fore end exhibits some light (normal?) handling marks but butt stock is  virtually pristine .
The original service issue open sights (see photo) will be supplied separately with the rifle.  If you wish to buy the rifle without the mounted scope and with the open sights re-installed, deduct $250.00 from the price (but you will have to re-zero it).  $850.00 (Rifle scope and fittings) $600 without (plus S&H). Serial # 93L8263
(Note: I have a small quantity of factory.303 ammo for sale plus some reloads and many once fired cases, some primed, trimmed, & reformed. Also some  bullets for reloading. (.303 ammo store price can reach $3 a round. If interested, request info)
             I am a C&R FFL but the sale is probably better handled thru your dealer’s FFL.

671,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3480671,For Sale:  (100 plus!) 12 gauge Steel Shotshells - factory 2-3/4 and 3 inch,"St. Paul area, Minnesota, United States",$ 30,"Listed On: Sunday, October 19, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a big box-O-Steel shotshells that I won't use as I don't hunt waterfowl any longer. Got these in trade from a friend a few years ago and they just sit there looking forlorn - they really want to get out and hunt some birds - maybe with you??

These are all factory loaded shells, all steel shot (better check them all as I ran a magnet through them BUT may have missed a couple lead??)

They are mostly Federal 3"" with some 2-3/4 inch included, a few Winchester and some ACTIV too. A lot of the Federal are Premium shells, too....pricey stuff....but mixed up so you will need to look at the hulls to determine shot size on them, but the printing is all still good and readable.

I can only post two pics so you see the big box (There are 70 shells in that box) and one bag of 9 3"" Federals - there are two more bags - one with 16 3"" ACTIV shells and one with 11 3"" Federals. (that is 106 shells total). If you want to see pics of the other bags, email me and I'll send 'em to you. Pics are high res so you can save them and zoom in to see exactly what most of these shells are.

As I said, these were my friends and were apparently sitting outside his truck a few years ago while they were hunting, and the boxes got rained on. The boxes totally came apart as cheap cardboard will do in the rain, ya know, and after they were dried out, they totally looked like crap so he must have opted for the ziploc bags instead of trying to glue the boxes back together (I'd have opted for the ""Duck"" tape....quack-quack!!).

I originally traded him 4 boxes of Federal 30.06 for these so I gotta at least recoup some of the lost value.....and by my rough estimate there are over a hundred bucks worth of shells here......making this a pretty good deal.

Local waterfowl hunters, here's a good opportunity to lay in four more boxes PLUS of pricey steel shotshells for this fall at BARGAIN BASEMENT PRICES......Just $30 cash for all.....a bargain compared to 2=3/4"" shells, and most of these are 3 inchers!

Sorry - will not ship these - local purchase, cash and carry only."

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use."

Manufacturer: Barnett 78201
Item: 9-95173
UPC: REDACTED17

The Barnett Vengeance represents a quantum leap in crossbow evolution. It is the first crossbow to combine a lightweight CarbonLite Riser with reverse draw technology. In this radical new reverse draw configuration, the limb pockets are moved closer to the trigger assembly and the limbs face forward on the bow, thus shifting the center of gravity closer to the shooter's body. This drastically reduces the weight at the front of the crossbow, which is essential for a well balanced shot. The most technically advanced riser ever created for a crossbow, the CarbonLite Riser removes approximately 43% of weight from the riser, which dramatically shifts the balance point to the shoulder. The combination of the reverse draw design with the CarbonLite Riser allows the Vengeance to provide the steadiest and most accurate shot possible. Decorated in a carbon fiber finish or in a high definition camouflage, the Vengeance is available through retailers as a complete package with crossbow, quick detach quiver, three 22"" arrows and an illuminated 3x32 Multi Reticle Scope.

It is otherwise identical, or nearly so, as far as I'm aware.

I'm looking to get $1300 cash, but would be willing to do a partial trade as long as the majority is still in cash. I'm primarily looking for a 3x reflex sight magnifier, AR pistol parts (I have a lower that needs buildin'), or a reliable, conceal carry-sized 1911. 

I am also willing to sell the scope without the red dot for $1100.

As can be seen in the pictures I have all of the original materials (that I'm aware of) except for the sticker and warranty card. If you know of anything that's missing odds are I still have it.

This ACOG was civilian-bought and is currently mounted on a rifle that only sees infrequent use, almost entirely at outdoor ranges; aside from some superficial scratches on the body and minor wear on the adjustment slots inside of the turrets, it's in great condition. (Note that my camera makes the scratches look worse than they are, so if you are okay with what you see you'll definitely be happy with what you get.) The lenses have been cleaned and are scratch-free as far as I am able to determine."

Very hard to find as they ceased importation shortly after these began to make their way to the U.S. market. This is a commercial production model of the infamous Makarov. Holds 12 rounds of 9x18, and fun fact, you can also use regular single stack 8 round makarov mags in this gun as well, although they will flop at the mag well, but from what I have read it does not affect functionality. 
I would rate this gun in Very Good-excellent condition, leaning closer towards excellent, with no scratches or scuffs anywhere, looks like it has been shot very little. everything works as it should. Comes with one factory 12 round mag, an aftermarket 10 round mag, and a little less than 150 rounds of mixed ammo. Also have a leather shoulder holster for a CZ-82 that fits it pretty well that I will throw in.  I also have a pearce flat rubber grip coming in the mail that will also be included along with the original plastic factory target style grips.
 TRADES
I am mainly looking to trade this gun although cash offers will be seriously considered as well. Considering a russian commercial makarov goes for about 400$ in this condition, 500-600$ would be fair estimate for this gun considering how rare it is to find a 12 round makarov.
