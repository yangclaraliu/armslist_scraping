AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

The Colt LE6940P features a true free-floating 16.1"" chrome-lined barrel
that provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range shooting. This
rifle has a rear Magpul MBUS and a folding front sight for enhanced optical
solutions, and there are four rail positions for mounting accessories. The
patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous
Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This
provides unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, which is not
found with traditional handguard rail systems. The LE6940P incorporates a
unique articulating link piston (ALP) operating system that reduces the
inherent stress in the piston stroke by allowing for deflection and thermal
expansion.

The upgrades and features that I can remember now are:
- polished action for smoother operation
- polished trigger assembly (hammer and sear)
- Weight in the form of lead added to the rear of the Deluxe Walnut Stock for a better             balanced Mini-14, and almost No Felt Recoil
-  Action bedded to the stock, relieved from barrel
- Original Ruger Lugged Stainless Steel Scope Rings
- Bushnell 3X9 Scope  w/ see-through caps
- Original Steel Rear fold-down Peep Sight
- Tactical Matte Stainless Steel Finish, with Stainless Steel construction throughout
- 16"" barrel
The gun has never had a failure to feed, with all types and brands of both .223 and 5.56X45 Nato. 

The mini-14 is a scaled-down version of the famed M14.  Both are the epitome of function and dependability.

It ALSO comes with 6 high capacity mags ranging from 20 to 40 round. Two or 3 or them are Ruger Factory mags, and the others are pro-mag or the like. Also comes with the military-style leather sling seen in the pictures.

There will be no required paperwork for the sale, but I would like to see a CWP and ID for my records. The price on the Mini is firm. I might be interest in trades for old single shots or lever action rifles. I'd love to find a Spencer. Can can add money for the right deal.

Thanks for looking!"

The serial number starts with 582XXX. This is the thicker barreled version. 
This Mini 14 comes with 4 genuine Ruger magazines, 3x20rd and 1 30rd. 
I also installed a custom Trushot-Technologies barrel stabilizer which helps enhance accuracy, and eliminate shot stringing. I also installed a front sling stud for bipod mounting or sling. Original front sling mount was removed, but reinstalled for selling. Also included is the picatinny rail as shown in the photo, and two sets of Ruger steel scope rings, (1” and 30MM) which can be used with picatinny rail removed. The trigger is highly tuned! I doubt you will ever find a mini 14 trigger like this one. It has a light but definite first stage, and light second stage, and a very short take up and reset. Very similar to Geissle SSA-E trigger which really helps with accuracy off the bench. The action is also very smooth. This is the smoothest Mini 14 I have ever felt, and accuracy is very good. Better than what you can get off the shelf with the work done to this gun. 
Asking $850 with all items mentioned included. 
This item is for sale ONLY to those who currently are legally allowed to purchase firearms in the state of Oregon. I would prefer to sell to an Oregon CHL holder. I will want a copy of your currently active ODL for my records and signed bill of sale. If you are not allowed to legally own firearms in the state of Oregon please do not respond to this offer.

Don't let the brand fool you. The 24/7 Tactical was developed to compete for a military contract against all the top names in gun making. This model was in the finals when the military canceled the contract. This model is no longer made and has been replaced with the G2 model with only a 4in barrel. This is a great weapon with several unique features. 5.25in barrel, DA/SA Striker Fire system. Decocker/Safety and ""second strike"" capability similar to Walther's. Allows you to attempt firing again after a misfire. Easy take down, everything is similar to a Beretta and 1911 rolled into one with the plus of a striker fire system. 24/7 are becoming very sought after weapons. I have one in .45 and .40 that I will probably never sell. I got this one in a trade. I originally thought I would collect and hang on to this but need to do some thinning of the collection.  Pick up a great weapon for just $425.00 OBO. Read review by Guns and Ammo.  May need to copy and paste.

about the gun. According to Medlin & Huon ,Military Handguns of France, 1858 to 1958; “The German ordnance designation for the weapon was 625(f). The Germans maintained quality control, with the standards of manufacture the same as with French-made arms. The finish on the pieces remained the same, as did that of the magazines.” “The German military acceptance stamp is on the left side of the frame, between and slightly below the 1935A and SACM marks. The first group is stamped Waffenamt 655 (Eagle 655), starting with serial number B701A and ending with serial number B1250A. Afterwards Waffenamt 251 was then used (Eagle WaA 251), until the end of manufacture, the last pistol being serial numbered D4550A.” Only a total of 23,850 German accepted guns were produced! 
Futhermore , Medlin & Huon state that; “During the run of Eagle 655 pistols, breech blocks and barrels have the 655 stamps. The change to the standard eagle with swastika on the barrel came with the change to WaA251. In the late 'B' series,(around B6500A) numbering of the breech block to match the serial number began. Between C3341 and C6327, the barrel was given a two digit mark to match the last two digits of the serial number. This continued to the last of the German arms. Thus a pistol after C6327 should have military proof on the barrel, the last two numbers of the serial number on the barrel and breech, and Eagle WaA251 on the slide.” 
Therefore this gun having an early serial number of B3658A, is absolutely correct to have a non-numbered breech block and only an eagle proof barrel."

They have a super smooth trigger which breaks very cleanly and has no creep also the accuracy is much better. It is in excellent condition with absolutely no blemishes, practically new. The finish is a satin stainless and looks brand new. It is an awesome carry gun. It is just weighty enough to be very comfortable to shoot considering it is a .40 caliber. It is double action only. You can feel the quality of the weapon when you pick it up! In a good belt holster this is a very comfortable carry....also, it works very well in a pocket holster. It came with only two mags but I purchased 2 extra ones (an 90.00 add on)  I Also changed out the standard black rubber grips (which are included as well) with a beautiful set of Kahr wood grips (I believe they are pau ferro, a 65.00 add on) They are checkered and provide a very positive grip on the weapon. Two of the magazines are 5 rounders and two are extended 6 rounders. That gives you 6 round capacity and 7 round capacity respectively (carrying one in the tube). Also included is an extra set of grip screws, the box and the paperwork. Any questions just message me. Thanks for looking! God Bless"

Don't let the brand fool you. The 24/7 Tactical was developed to compete for a military contract against all the top names in gun making. This model was in the finals when the military canceled the contract. This model is no longer made and has been replaced with the G2 model with only a 4in barrel. This is a great weapon with several unique features. 5.25in barrel, DA/SA Striker Fire system. Decocker/Safety and ""second strike"" capability similar to Walther's. Allows you to attempt firing again after a misfire. Easy take down, everything is similar to a Beretta and 1911 rolled into one with the plus of a striker fire system. 24/7 are becoming very sought after weapons. I have one in .45 and .40 that I will probably never sell. I got this one in a trade. I originally thought I would collect and hang on to this but need to do some thinning of the collection. Pick up a great weapon for just $425.00 OBO. Read review by Guns and Ammo. May need to copy and paste.

This will work in Glock 17s, Glock 22s and Glock 31s as a drop in barrel to convert caliber or replace an existing .40 cal barrel. This barrel offers full case support and does not create any ""glock bulge"" in cases, as well as the advantages of being a cut rifled barrel - Safe for reloads and lead only bullets in addition to standard jacketed bullets (herters nylon jacket, aluminum case, steel case, whatever). You will not find a better deal on a Glock barrel of any brand in this condition, $80 firm, cash only, face to face deal. If you would like detailed pictures to show wear (or lack thereof) on the barrel I will gladly provide them.

 I would be open to trades for 9mm luger, 40SW and/or 45ACP ammo. Or partial trade on a Ruger 10/22 plus cash on my end. Partial trade on an M&P22, Ruger MKI, MKII or MKIII + cash on my end. Sig Sauer Mosquito .22lr 1911 + cash on my end. Sig 226 22lr complete slide + mag(s). Or most specifically a Carcano 91/38 Carbine(short model), 6.5 Carcano, no 7.35s please, bent bolt only, + cash on my end. Priority given to closest serial number to C2766, kidding of course! But seriously the Carcano is top on my trades list."

It has a delayed roller-lock system which is very reliable in war situations because it's made to run dirty.  It's as accurate as top tier AR platforms, but shoots a .308, and i have seven 20 round magazines and a magazine chest rig that holds 4 mags. All the mags come loaded, so it comes with 140 rounds of 308. I took the original handguard off and put an aluminum tri-rail handguard on. Then I put a forward vertical grip/flashlight hybrid piece on it. It will come with the stock handguard and the one I purchased. The gun has been thoroughly cleaned and properly maintained and has had no failure to function after putting approximately 500 rounds through it. 

 I am willing to drive and meet anywhere in a 10 mile radius of the Weirton area. You can call or text me at 3.0.4.6.7.0.4.9.6.2. or email me. You can contact me anytime of the day or night.

It has been fired somewhere between 500-1000 times I also have an AR 15 chambered in 9mm with a cheapish Bushnell sight and Houge grip - 1000 rounds through it.SOLD Inside the Saiga box is a never fired Saiga 12 gauge with a different stock swapped on, I think I have the one that comes with it as well. Finally, I have a California compliant Saiga 12 gauge with a Chaos Titan quad rail, with a folding fore grip (I believe from Magpul), CCS billet trigger guard and some rando muzzle break.SOLD I have two 5 round and five 8 round Vepr mags from Russia and two SMG 12 round mags. I have four metal and two plastic 32 rd Uzi-style mags for the AR. I have one Saiga 5 rd mag somewhere. I bought the shotguns pretty close to retail, prior to the Russian import ban and built the AR. I just sort of over bought and should let someone else get some of these before they become too scarce. I don't really shoot them often and have other projects which need funding so make me and offer on something you like. I will ship through a FFL to an FFL of your choice as well, if you live elsewhere in the US (assuming you can legally own the weapon in question in your state) Thank you & God bless."

I am offering all three lots together for an even lower price of $625.  

These are calibers I no longer shoot and I am looking for cash so I can purchase a rifle from Armslist that I have my eye on.  

Click on ""Listings by This User"" at the top of this ad to get more details and more pictures of each of the three types of ammo.  Here is the short description:  

5.45x39mm / AK-74 Ammo (x925 rounds)
40 S&W Ammo (x898 rounds) 
30-06 / M1 Garand Ammo (500 rounds)

This much ammo for this price used to be the reason people went to this site.  I'm certainly not making a profit on this stuff - that's not my way.  I have ammo I'm not using and somebody else can.  It's a garage sale price for some good ammo.  All three calibers are from rifles or a handgun I had posted on Armslist.com - with the ammo as an option - and I sold without the ammo.  

Even if you only need two of the calibers, at this price you could buy the lot and sell the third caliber.  $625 is cheaper than you will find any two of these calibers in this combination.  

If you have questions about this ad feel free to send me an email.

I already notified the actual dealer, a known, reputable firm, about the SCAM, will let them follow-up with Armslist and try and pursue the creeps. Also, notice in the information at the top of the listings that both of these were categorized as ""shotguns"" rather than what they were. That, and the dealer name, were what caused me to take a second look, along with the ridiculously low prices. Let's work together to eliminate these creeps!!!"
