That being said she has 9109 miles currently on the odometer, 5311 consisted of two long road trips in 2011 and 2012. The engine was upgraded by a Harley mechanic which occurred at approximately 3000 miles. The the engine was upgraded from a 96CC to a 103CC. This bike will smoke the currently 2014 CVO. It has serious torque and will pass on mountain roads one up or two up without reservation. The heads were machined by T-Man performance and the cam of choice is a woods cam. If you haven't heard of T-Man or Woods check both out on the internet. She sits on Xtreme Machine Bolted Stilettos front (19x3.0) and rear (17x6.25) along with matching rotors. The last service was May 17th, 2014 which included a brand new back tire, inspection, amsoil synthetic oil, and fluid changes.

The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period.     
Match-Grade Accuracy out of the Box
Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of  match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class.
ALL LAWS APPLY i only have about 200 rnds thru the gun comes with 2x15rnd factory mags gun is in 99% condition."

ON G BROKER WAITING FOR $$$ ......................................................................................................................Looking to reduce my collection I had two unmolested NHM 91's for sale. The one I have left is in unfired condition, the other had a very low round count. It's been said these were overbuilt as a sniper type rifle and that they have .668 diameter heavy bull barrels that are chrome lined and are 20 inches long,  and heavier 1.6 mm stamped straight back receivers that will accept most ak furniture . These rifles are tanks. This rifle doesn't have a speck of rust in or out. These rifles were banned from importation in the early 1990's and ones in pristine condition are getting hard to find. It's all original with all matching numbers on front trunnion, bolt, bolt carrier and tube. Threads were not removed from these barrels as they were on the Mac 90's. The original thread protectors can be replaced with flash hiders etc. Original factory folding, telescoping bipod that has never been removed, these are getting very rare as well. The last two of these telescoping bipods I saw listed on Gun Broker went for over $100 each. This straight cut receiver will accept most AK furniture and magazines. This 25 yr old rifle has been my safe queen for the last 10 years. As I said I believe it is unfired since new... I've never fired it...  no primer burns on the bolt face or any other signs of being fired.  I had the other one for 20 years. The blue is very good original, and only has minor storage marks. Same with the furniture.... I'm not online 24/7 so most likely you won't receive an instant reply but if it's listed I still have it and I will get back with you within a few hours or so....Ky. Residents with Cash Only...Low Ballers will not receive a reply. This rifle is also listed on G. Broker with more pics, that auction ends Sunday, If I get a bid on there the rifle will have to be removed from this website....."

They normally come with 1 mag that fits flush with the bottom of the grip. I ordered 3 more with the extension for better hand grip on the gun so there are 4 12+1 mags total with this package.

Stop by LiveFire Armory with your AR or Pistol and let us check your trigger weight.

Trigger weight is the most important adjustment for custom tailoring the AR for accuracy.  It is also the least expensive change for accuracy.

Mil Spec is 5.5 #s to 9 #s.  They are usually 7.5 #s.  Mil Spec is characterized by a lot of creep and a gritty feel.

A Match or Varmint AR shoots best with a 3.5 # pull or less. Breaks like glass.

A Service Rifle AR for NRA Highpower Competition or a 3 Gun Rifle requires a 4.5 # to 5.5# pull.  Positive and firm.

If your interest is Zombies- Mil Spec is fine.  They move slow.

Livefire Armory offers a large selection of Single Stage and Two Stage drop-in trigger assemblies.  Your trigger can be changed out in less than ten minutes in store.

It is readily available now so there is no reason to overpay.

Most Wal-Marts put their ammo out in the morning around 7:30a. Check with your local store gun department to be sure. Then go here and check to see what they have or they will have the next morning: (They will often show what will be there in the morning)
http://www.wikiarms.com/walmart-search

Also you should check Slickguns frequently. They have ammo deals all the time and a dedicated link to help you out:
http://www.slickguns.com/

Brassbadger will help you too and you can get the free app for your android device (not sure about Apple) at the play store:
http://brassbadger.com/

These are just some options. Your local Academy Sports puts out ammo a few times a week. Ask them when they put it out and be there bright and early. Academy also frequently sells 22LR on their web site.

The IC-A5 rifle uses our Cold Hammer Forged barrels that are spiral fluted to reduce weight. They include a two position gas block, that can be switched between suppressed and non-suppressed modes. This feature enables the user to restrict the gas flow to the piston system, allowing the rifle to run smoothly and compensate for the added back pressure resulting from running a suppressor. The handguard utilizes individual rail sections that allow the owner to place accessory rails where they are needed while retaining the slick, low profile nature of the rest of the handguard.

The IC-A5 is perfect for the person who wants an adjustable gas block, and an extended rail in the same package."

The gun is brand new, unfired and in perfect condition.  I ordered this gun in late December of 2012 and it was completed on March 4th, 2014.

This CQB Elite was ordered with the following options:

- 5 inch carbon steel slide/full size carbon steel frame
- Black Armor-Tuff Slide with Gray Armor Tuff frame and small parts, the trigger and hammer are black AT
- All Bulletproof small parts, no tool steel or MIM anywhere on this gun
- GI guide rod with Bulletproof plug in black Armor-Tuff
- 1 piece Bulletproof magwell
- Bulletproof ambi thumb safety
- Countersunk slide stop
- Top of slide serrations
- Checkered rear of slide (beautifully done as you would expect from Wilson)
- Green fiber optic front sight with fixed, plain black rear Battlesight
- Black G10 Starburst flat-bottom grips

There really isn't much more I can say about this beautiful Wilson.  It is brand new and unfired outside of the Wilson shop so it is in perfect condition with no marks, dings or scratches of any kind, anywhere on the gun.  Included with the CQB Elite are two 8-round stainless ETM magazines, the original test target (very nice grouping), every piece of paperwork/owners manual, the original Wilson Combat gun bag and 2 of the Wilson ""dog tags"" that have the gun's serial number and build date on them.  One is attached to the zipper of the Wilson bag and the second is in a plastic baggie inside.  I can email additional pictures to serious buyers if need be.

If the options on this gun appeal to you then it is a great way to save yourself at least a one year wait.  I'm also listing it for more than $500 off the MSRP, and you can avoid the tax which was not insignificant on a $3500 gun.  I'm hoping to move the gun quickly to a serious buyer who appreciates the quality of a semi-custom 1911.

Asking price is $3,000 cash.  I live in Canal Fulton and am willing to travel a reasonable distance to make a sale.  If you are a long-distance buyer I am more than willing to ship the gun through my FFL after full payment is made via Cashier's Check or US Postal Money Order only.  Buyer must be over 21 years of age and an Ohio resident with valid Ohio driver's license that I can see at time of sale (for local face-to-face buyer obviously).  CHL holders are preferred but not required.  See below for info on possible trades:"

Hey all,
I have up for sale a 1895 Nagant “Gas Seal” Revolver with holster. I pocked this up in trade and would keep it, but i already have one and can’t see a reason to need two. Haha. I HAVE NOT shot this myself, but the gentleman i got it from said that it shot fine for him, but of course is “as is” (like every other gun trade anywhere haha). The rifling is good and the blueing is in decent shape for its age. This particular Nagant is marked “1932” as its manufacture year. 
In terms of trades, I would consider most rifle trades or even trade for pistols (mainly looking for a 38/357 revolver or a cheap 1911) . I have a BUNCH of surplus ammo for this that i could sell at an additional price, or add on to even out a trade. Just shoot me a text at REDACTED o a message on here and we can talk specifics. I would also trade for gun + cash, gun, or just cash. 
Need to meet up in Norman on this one.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

Designed personally by Adolf Hitler, this flag served the Heer and the Luftwaffe as their War Flag, and the Kriegsmarine as its War Ensign (the National Flag serving as Jack). This flag was hoisted daily in barracks operated by units of the Wehrmacht, and it had to be flown from a pole positioned near the barracks entrance, or failing this, near the guard room or staff building. New recruits in the latter part of World War. The flag had to be formally hoisted every morning and lowered every evening. These hoisting and lowering ceremonies took the form of either an ordinary or a ceremonial flag parade. At the ordinary raising, the party consisted of the Orderly Officer of the Day, the guard, and one musician. At the ceremonial raising, one officer, one platoon of soldiers with rifles, the guard, the regimental band, and the corps of drums were all present."

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

I preferred to use the press as what I'd call an ""enhanced single stage,"" but it also works fine if you want to do each stage successively as the press was designed.  Six holes can support any reloading die configuration or multiple calibers, however the user may wish.  It works fine, I've loaded several thousand rounds with it only bolted to a small shelf in my garage.  My Hornady dies were a bit of a tight fit with their large locking rings, but they do work nonetheless.  Asking $90 for everything or may accept equitable trades.  Thanks for checking it out."
