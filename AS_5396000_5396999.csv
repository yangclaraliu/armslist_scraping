The categories on Armslist don't allow me to list this as a Double/Single Action pistol, in spite of that being a more accurate description.Unless you have positively monsterous hands, this pistol won't nip you with the slide.  It is a comfortable gun to shoot.  Because it's stainless steel, it's easy to take care of.  I'm not sure how old the gun is, but it was made in WEST Germany, therefore, I would presume it was manufactured before reunification.  As such, it shows some handling marks.  Due to the quality that made Sig Sauer famous, it will continue to operate faithfully.If you have any further questions, I will do my best to answer them.  My price is somewhat negotiable.  I am willing to travel within Ohio to make a deal.  How far I'm willing to travel will come into consideration with regard to the negotiation of price.  I will need to see your ID so I can be assured that you are an Ohio resident.  CCW holders are preferred (because I have some assurance that you could pass NICS.  No. I am not a licensed dealer.  I don't have access to NICS.  I am not doing this for a living.  I just found something I want more."

I live in Danville and will meet up if interested, not looking to trade."

Huge advantage using the 40 S&W round and even comes with 2 loaded mags (15 rounds) as well as 20 more rounds of Speer 180gr FMJ ammo! It looks very nice with the nickel finsih slide and the solid black polymer lower with the trigger nickel coated as well for a nice professional look and feel. This is perfect for the person who wants to extra power of a 40 and yet still wants to easily conceal carry or use for home defense.I have only had the gun for a few months, it was a gift from a family member but I personally don't have a lot of the 40 S&W ammo and so I'm selling it for that reason. The gun works fine and has been cleaned recently to make sure it has no rust or corrosion. The grip is not excessively positive to where it hurts to hold but is just right to help keep hands in place while shooting.Comes with 2 mags, one is a short 7 round and the other an extended 8 round mag. Both are original Kahr magazines. The trigger pull is very smooth and the wide trigger helps distribute the pull weight so it feels fairly easy. It also comes with a detachable panel on the right side of the pistol grip where lasers can be mounted, always a big bonus.This gun definitely won't last long on the market especially at this price!Please feel free to contact me, via email is preferred.

The bluing is in very good condition (90% +). Only a few light scuffs / scratches show that this is a used gun.  The Saiga-20 is a 20-gauge semi-automatic tactical shotgun available in a wide range of configurations, visibly patterned after the Kalashnikov series of rifles. Like the AK-47 rifle variants, it is a rotating bolt, gas-operated gun that feeds from a box magazine. All Saiga-20 configurations are recognizable as Kalashnikov-pattern guns by the large safety lever on the right side of the receiver, the optic mounting rail on the left side of the receiver and the large top-mounted dust cover held in place by the rear of the recoil spring assembly.   The looser clearances offered in an AK47 style design result in high reliability -- an enormous boon on a semi-automatic shotgun, as this class of weapon had previously tended towards unreliability.""

AMT created the stainless steel 10/22 (as well as the first stainless steel MarkI pistol) copies of Ruger's guns before Ruger made them in stainless.  Ruger currently markets some of their 10/22's as stainless steel but, in fact, only the barrels are stainless.  The receivers and trigger groups are Aluminum Alloy.  AMT's guns (like this one) are ALL stainless steel.  AMT made two models - a folding stock tactical model and this harder to find Target model."

The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. How Walther SOFTCOIL™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have  The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.

Comes with a 6 rd mag and a 7 rd extended mag. The double action trigger on this gun is amazing.
The gun currently has a universal Clip Draw installed on the left side of the gun, enabling carrying clipped to the belt or pants edge without a holster. Great for CCW when wearing sports wear. The Clip Draw can be installed on the opposite side or removed. Also comes with a trigger block that minimizes potential of accidental discharge when the gun is worn with the Clip Draw.
Also included is a Remora clipless holster and a separate Remora clipless mag carrier. I also included an ambidextrous tuckable holster that I made that I think is better than most tuckable version commercially sold. It allows a shirt to be tucked in and the holster be worn with any cant, but more importantly has a superior clip that is nearly completely invisible when worn as unlike most tuckable holsters with clips that can be seen over the belt, this clip is worn behind the belt clipped to the pants and the clip is absolutely secure when locked. Also included is a custom fitted book hide that has a modern dust jacket for better concealment.
Comes with original box, manual, etc."
