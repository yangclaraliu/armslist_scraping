I bought this a few weeks ago, put a couple mags through it, and realised that I don't particularly care for it. I suppose that's what I get for buying a gun online without ever seeing it. The gun is effectively new with less than 50 rounds fired. If you want a semi automatic pistol that has some real power, this is the gun for you. With full power loadings at 700+ lb.ft. of energy, this handgun will drop pretty much anything you would want to hunt with a handgun and 10mm is an approved round for hunting deer in the state of Iowa. Price is $650 or a reasonable offer. While I would rather have cash, I will consider trades. I am mostly interested in surplus, pocket pistols, combloc firearms, and oddities, but the worst I can say to a trade is no. IF YOU ARE PURCHASING THIS FIREARM YOU MUST PRESENT A VALID STATE OF IOWA PERMIT TO PURCHASE OR CARRY A HANDGUN AND A VALID DRIVER'S LICENSE AS WELL AS COMPLETE A BILL OF SALE"

Spyderco began with the Native 5–a highly evolved fifth generation version of the tried-and-true Native model. They then pushed the envelope of materials and craftsmanship with a blade made of DS93X Thor pattern martensitic Damascus steel from the Swedish firm Damasteel. This extraordinary material is produced by Damasteel’s proprietary powder metallurgy process, which forge welds layers of RWL34 and PMC27 steels into a state-of-the- art stainless Damascus steel with an intricate pattern. The blade is laser engraved with the 40th anniversary logo and paired with a stunning handle featuring CNC-machined, fluted carbon fiber scales. The Native 5’s signature four-position pocket clip provides convenient, versatile carry and pays homage to Spyderco’s pioneering role in creating the modern clip-carried folding knife.

No import marks. Also comes with 4 boxes of 8mm new production ammo and sling (no case). If you have any questions or would like some more pictures, feel free to ask. No shipping and trades considered would be a Mas 49/56 in excellent condition, maybe an imported AK, maybe a nice Colt LE6920, or maybe other interesting military surplus rifles (M1 Garand, M1 Carbine, etc.). Not looking for any shotguns, black powder, or hunting riles currently. Let me know what you have and we'll see if we can make a deal. Can add cash or some other trade(s) depending on what you have. Not looking for cash (have already declined multiple cash offers and would have to offer the rifle to those folks first if I would decide to sell) unless we make a deal and you're making up a little trade value. Value of rifle, ammo, and sling is $775."

Often the Japanese would rush the US forces in a futile attempt to hold on...surrender was not an option for most...only death could bring honor to their family. This pistol was fired at the US ARMY soldier, he was hit in the leg. The six other GI's in the group fired their machine guns, and killed the Japanese officer....they recovered this pistol from his body. There is a letter authorizing the G.I. to keep the pistol as a WAR TROPHY. The holster, Japanese, is also included. This GI was given a Purple Heart for his injury... that is also included.

There are no rub marks at the muzzle as caused by a holster or box rub. There are no flaws hidden. The grips are excellent condition as well, and are numbered to match the gun.  The bore and mechanicals are in matching excellent condition. This revolver is a nice example, that could be shot occasionally without fear of damage. Included is the original correct gold box, it is not numbered to this, or any other gun.

MUST USE A ZEISS VARIPOINT WITH CORESPONDING IC CONTROL. YOUR CHOICE OF SIDEPLATES ( SHOWN BELOW ) THIS IS THE NEW R8 MODEL FROM BLASER. ALL OF THE GREAT BLASER FEATURES PLUS MORE. YOUR CHOICE OF SIDEPLATES. A New Era of Perfection ""The beginning of a new era of perfection"", is how Blaser CEO Bernhard Knoebel has named the launch of the new Blaser bolt action rifle R8 in his preface of the brand-new catalog. For the past five years, there has been one lingering question for the hunters and engineers at Blaser, regarding the Blaser bolt action rifle R93: How can this technically superior concept be taken to the next level? In order to answer this question the Blaser engineers, most of them passionate hunters themselves, kept a close connection to hunters around the world in order to respond to their requests. Detachable Magazine When the development of the R8 actually started the detachable magazine was right at the top of the optimization list. Blaser found an ergonomically superior solution that essentially supports fast and intuitive handling. Magazine and trigger unit merged into one compact module. The magazine buttons are positioned right above the trigger guard. Thus, the magazine can be released blindly and within a split second. When removing the magazine, the R8 automatically de-cocks and once the magazine is removed, the cocking slide cannot engage anymore. Today, this is a very important safety feature securing the rifle against misuse by unauthorized persons. Blaser Precision Trigger The detachable magazine is just one of a multitude of innovations that turn the R8 into the new worldwide benchmark when it comes to bolt action rifles. Enhancing the reliable and precise performance of the trigger posed a very special engineering challenge that has been brilliantly mastered. The new Blaser Precision Trigger breaks crisp as glass at a trigger pull of 750 gram / 1 5/8 lbs. Thanks to its extremely short release time it turns the shooter’s thought impulse immediately into an accurate shot. The innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing, which marks the next leap in rifle technology. The desmodromic trigger mechanism offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Perfect Stock In order to make shooting with the R8 as comfortable and safe as possible, Blaser attached immense importance to optimizing the stock, reaching a new level of perfection here, too. Different from traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. This results in increased muzzle stability and a substantial reduction of felt recoil. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Design Besides achieving maximum performance, Blaser gave particular attention to superior style and design. Concave and convex lines discreetly shape the rifles appearance. Contours of stock, action, mount and bolt handle blend perfectly, giving the R8 a dynamic and unequaled elegance.....Shipping will cost $40"

Ser # 170808. All numbers match. Caliber 7.65mm or .32 ACP. Here is a write up on these: http://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/07Dreyse/07dreyse.html These are very cool old guns. Fun to shoot too. I shot this one and it functioned good. I used brass case Remington ammo. The bore and barrel are very good. The grips could be homemade. If so, they are an excellent job! I didn't go crazy researching them. Could be factory special order. Full disclosure: the bottom side of the barrel shroud has a torn piece of metal at the very end. It looks like it has been like that for many years and when I shot it, it did not move, so is stabilized. I'm asking less than what I have into this gun. It was a buy for my son to study. The magazine is from an FN Browning Model 1900. In the link I provided, you will see that the Browning 1900 and Dreyse 1907 magazines are interchangeable. The difference being that this is a $100 magazine versus a $65 Dreyse magazine.  $305 plus actual USPS shipping to an 03 FFL or better. IF YOU WANT IT SHIPPED TO YOUR C&R THEN READ THE #4 TERM BELOW! I must collect 6% sales tax if sold in Vermont.  TERMS: 1. I will accept a USPS Money Order or Paypal as a discreet gift. 2. AK and HI whatever extra the post office charges 3.

The company's main customers come from the Unites States and Europe.   About the Cartridge: This cartridge was introduced along with the Luger semi-automatic pistol. The pistol and cartridge was first adopted by the German Navy in 1904 and then by the German Army in 1908. This cartridge has since been adopted by the military of practically every non-Communist power. It has become the most popular and widely-used handgun cartridge in the world. Performance wise, the 9mm cartridge has somewhat more power than the .38 Special but falls well short of the .357 Magnum.         Type: Pistol   Produced: 1980 - 2011   Caliber: 9 mm   Action: recoil operated semi-automatic   Trigger: double-action (DA/SA)   Safety: slide mounted firing pin block   Magazine: 14-round   Frame: blued finish steel   Grips: plastic   Sights: fixed   Notes:     Barrel Length: 4.15 in.
