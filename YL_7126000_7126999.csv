This is the ""Primary Arms Microdot with Removable Base,"" however if you look on their website I think this is an older version of the one currently for sale (see below).  It has had very little use.  It's a 2MOA dot, with rotary illumination control (11 brightness settings). It also comes with a killflash and flip-up caps/covers for both lenses, none of which are compatible with the new version (I almost want to keep it because of this...) This is a very nice sight IMO especially for the money, it's lightweight and I like the small 2moa dot. The pictured American Defense mount is NOT included at this time.  I will update pics as soon as I can.  If bought separately these items would total over $100 ($90 for the sight, $20 for the killflash, no idea on the caps). I am asking $70. I will ship at the buyer's expense.Thanks!"

So, while the barrel and frame are 2013 RR builds, the slide is a 2017 RR.I also had them install a flat trigger.

Has some late war features, like the 4 slot muzzle brake and the one piece barrel band. There is a crack in the handguard in front on the rear sight, but it's mostly hidden when the handguard is on and it would probably be a easy fix.

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it.

Like new with a low round count (less than 200) and very light holster wear. I also installed Talon grips over the stipple for a more confortable concealed carry (I don't wear a t-shirt underneath and move around a lot) but that can easily be taken off if you prefer. I personally think that it gives it more character plus the stipple/talon combo has a very nice feel to it. I'm also including 1000rds (700 brass, 300 steel) of factory ammo.

774,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7126774,For Sale:  HK VP9SK,"La Puente, Los Angeles, California",$ 700,"Listed On: Monday, April 30, 2018",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The eagerly anticipated subcompact model of the acclaimed Heckler & Koch VP Series handgun, VP9SK (in 9 mm) has all of the sought-after characteristics of larger frame VP pistols but in a more concealable design.
The highly-rated HK VP precision strike trigger is also found on the VPSK. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The net result is trigger quality unmatched in production striker fired pistols.
A small-scale interpretation of the completely adjustable VP grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the compact grip frame of the VP9SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit any individual user and is a feature found only on Heckler & Koch handguns. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting.
The VPSK has the features of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
HK’s patented charging supports, found on full size VP pistols, are also present on the VPSK. The charging supports are simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength.
VPSK pistols can use a variety of proven HK magazines, including compact double stack 10-round and 13-round with either flat or extended floorplates for a more ergonomic grip. The VPSK can also use the same high capacity 15-round magazine used by the full size VP and P30 handguns. Magazine sleeves that replicate the grip profile of the VP handgun are also available.
VPSK pistols have an abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.
VPSK pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component life span.
HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures a long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VPSK’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.
Despite their small size, VPSK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. VPSK models are currently available in 9 mm.
VPSK pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.
A high quality and well-engineered design, the VP9SK possesses all the features and long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. *This item is not on the freedom-infringing, illogical, and unnecessary CA Handgun Roster; as a result, it is only available to LE in California, but available in remaining parts of the United States of America."

The condition of everything offered is excellent. This pistol has been very reliable and accurate.I bought this pistol about 18 months ago to get back into shooting after several decades, and to learn more about semi-autos since I had shot only revolvers. Since then, this pistol has served as a home defense gun.As I learned more, I become a fan of all-steel, double/single action classic 9mm designs like the CZ-75, so I intend to replace this pistol with that type of firearm.This is offered as a cash sale through an FFL to PA residents only (no trades). The buyer will be responsible for the FFL transfer fee. I am willing to meet at any FFL within 20 miles or so of West Chester.Current MSRPs are $319 for the pistol and $229 for the laser, $548 total.Current discounted sale prices are about $170 for the pistol and about $150 for the laser, $320 total (plus shipping and tax).Current prices for a used pistol sold on Gunbroker are $150 and up, used laserguards are rarely sold separate from a firearm."

Specifically where the lower connects by the magwell, which is typical of these guns. Comes with 5 korean mags, original MKE 10 round mag, and 1 brand new POF 30 round, which has been 100% reliable.  Claw mount top rail, Takes 30rd mags and has necessary 922r parts.These guns were made on HK tooling. A lot of the parts are interchangeable with true HK parts. They take any mags that HK94 take. These aren't the ones that take only proprietary mags. The AT94 are more desirable and rarer than other clones because they have a thicker barrel than the newer zenith clones. The recoil on this is non-existant.
