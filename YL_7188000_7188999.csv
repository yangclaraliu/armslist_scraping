Knoxx folding recoil reduction stock is included.
What is the difference between a Remington Express and a Police Magnum?""   The Remington Police Magnum shotgun is built heavier to withstand the  abuse and pounding that police departments inflict on their gear. It has a  metal trigger assembly versus the Express's plastic assembly. The Police  Magnum also has heavier springs (7 lb. sear disconnect spring versus's the  Express's 5 lb. disconnect spring).
The Police Magnum has a 22 inch  magazine spring versus a 16 inch magazine spring in the Express.  The Police gun comes with a heavier lifter spring. Each Police Magnum  comes with front and rear sling swivel studs. These are just some of the  differences in the two guns. Remember, you get exactly what you pay for.  Both models function the same and digest the same ammo, so if you are  inclined to inflict this type of punishment on your guns then consider a  Police Magnum.   From the Remington web site:   What are the differences between the M-870 Police and the M-870 Express HD?  Question   Structurally the two receivers are identical. The only difference will be that the Police model will have a more durable finish. The magazine tubes will be slightly different. The Model 870 Express will have two indents in the magazine tube to accommodate the new style plastic magazine spring retainer. However, this prevents the Express model from accepting a magazine tube extension without alteration to the tube.   Other differences will be that the Police model includes sling swivel studs, a shorter fore-end, heavier shell latches, a heavier sear spring and a heavier magazine spring.  Q: What is the difference between the metal finish on the sporting goods guns and police guns?   A: A standard ""blue"" finish is offered in both lines, however, the ""matte"" finish on the sporting goods guns is a bead blast bluing. The ""matte"" finish on the police guns is a parkerization process. Parkerization is 60% more durable than bead blast bluing.   1) The wood stock on the 870P is walnut. The wood stock on the Express is Birch. 2) The Synthetic stock on the 870P is Davis SpeedFeed. The synthetic stock on the Express is Remington. 3) The extractor on the P is machined. 4) Express HD models come with 18"" cylinder bore barrels. The P can be ordered with any barrel length/choke combo, but production units range from 14"" Modified to 20"" IC. 5) The P can be had with a variety of sight options from bead to rifle sight to tritium ghost ring. The Express comes with a bead, and a rifle sight barrel can be purchased as an accessory. 6) The trigger-plate assembly on the P is aluminum with no ISS. It's plastic with ISS on the Expess."

The SDP Compact Black features a full aluminum lower frame, which gives it unparalleled balance, and can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Black is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The aluminum pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Black. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight.

Russian Elcan,"Melbourne, Orlando, Florida",$ 600,"Listed On: Friday, August 11, 2017",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is my WPA PSU 1x/4x. Awesome optic, but sold the rifle it was sitting on and it has been in the safe since. Asking $600 OBO. Trades considered are 9MM and 45ACP Glocks and Sigs. I would consider a Aimpoint or Eotech for shotgun. The 1x/4x32mm PSU, WPA’s flagship scope, was designed to combine the best features of both the 1x and 4x sights. When set on 1x, the PSU provides a huge 26 degree field of view facilitating rapid “both eyes open” target engagement. Set on 1x it can be employed similar to a reflex sight, providing quick hits on multiple or fast moving targets. With the flip of a switch the magnification increases to 4x providing target identification, ranging and engagement at extended distances. A Bullet Drop Compensating reticle combined with a simple to use “no math” telemetric rangefinder provides fast and reliable hits. Built to survive harsh conditions the PSU is manufactured from a solid aluminum alloy body. The design is both shockproof and watertight. The fully multi-coated optics provides a sharp and bright image with accurate color rendition and excellent resolution. The illuminated reticle features seven intensity settings and is powered by a readily available CR2032 3-volt battery. The BDC reticle provides ballistic compensation out to 800 meters. The telemetric rangefinder allows ranging out to the same distance. Capped adjustment turrets provide quick and trouble free zeroing. Once zeroed all ballistic corrections are made using the reticle. Very compact in size, the PSU is only 7.4 inches long. Weight is just 24 ounces. Eye relief is a generous 2.75 inches. The PSU mounts easily to a MIL STD 1913 Picatinny rail and features two QD levers. These allow rapid attachment and removal, no tools required. Extremely robust, the PSU is a perfect match for an AR-15 or other Modern Sporting Rifle. Magnification easily changes from 1x to 4x 32mm objective provides a large Exit Pupil Very wide field of view Compact size, only 7.4 inches long Illuminated 800 meter BDC reticle Illuminated 800 meter telemetric rangefinder Seven intensity settings Power provided by common CR2032 battery Only 24.6 ounces with QD mount Fits Mil Std 1913 Picatinny rail QD levers for rapid on/off Shockproof and watertight construction"

The Lite Rail incorporates precision CNC-machined M1913 Picatinny Rail surfaces along its entire length for the addition of lights, lasers, vertical grips and/or other tactical accessories. The skeletonized design of the quad rail handguard removes all unnecessary weight and bulk, keeping the rifle trim and lively for better handling qualities. While light weight was certainly a design goal, Strength and Rigidity are the Lite Rail's true defining characteristics, ensuring military-grade durability and performance under the most demanding of circumstances. Installation requires the removal of the factory barrel nut, replacing it with Daniel Defense's proprietary ""Bolt-Up System"" featuring a hardened steel barrel nut and simplified alignment of the upper-to-handguard top rail interface. This requires the use of the included Daniel Defense Barrel Nut Wrench. Six Grade-8 Mil-Spec Fasteners are then used to secure the handguard tube to the upper receiver via a pair of matching aluminum Bolt-Up Plates. The ""Bolt-Up System"" is an extremely strong and proven design, tested thoroughly by USSOCOM who selected it and the Daniel Defense RIS II Handguard for the SOPMOD II Program.

Traditional side ejection is not ambidextrous and forward eject, like in the FN 2000 or the Kel-Tec RFB, is quite complex. The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. Obviously, the bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower full auto rate (when applicable). The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies. Bolt, bolt carrier, firing mechanism, ejector chute and bolt stop are identical for all variations. The short stroke gas operated piston is fully adjustable for different ammunitions and muzzle attachments.

I purchased these new and they have never been out of the box, as far as I can remember, until today when I took pictures. They have never been put together. The wood is nicer and has a shiny finish on the grade 5 but is still very nice on the grade 1 also. Notice there are some dull spots in the pictures, that is packing grease smudges that I didn't want to wipe off. Please ask any questions you'd like, I will be glad to answer. I also have a matched set of Browning model 42 410 gauges and a set of Browning model 12 20 gauges but the serial numbers don't match on the 20 gauges. I will accept money order only for payment. Shotguns will ship next business day after payment is received and funds verified. Shipping is $45.00 in the continental US, Hawaii and Alaska will be higher and I will only ship to an FFL. If there is a transfer fee on the receiving end buyer will pay that. I ship FEDEX or USPS. Please ask any question you have because I only except returns if I have failed to disclose something.
