Ok, If you have wanted one of these, here is your few hour limited time today chance.
I just bought this over the weekend. It came with the ruger carry case, two magazines, a white hat digital camo right hand holster and a bulk box of 22.
Price paid was 300.
I did not use any of the bulk box. I am left handed, the gun is also right handed, and I am left handed, just kidding, really.  This one is black.
It came with only the grip that was on it, not the second one that is a teenie tiny bigger. Oh, well. That if needed is inexspensive.

A passion for a cool pistol. These are touted to be the best 22 semi on the market. It shoots everything, and I mean everything. I shot it one box of 100 rounds and decided, yet once again, my OCD has kicked in this was yet another one date event.

email offers, I do not need your cell number until we firm something up, but we will want to discuss prior to meeting in voice for any questions and answers.
It was unfired when I got it as the guy I bought it from it was his carry pistol and he just bought a g42 last week. So I did not buy anything at the gun show and got gun fever set in after lunch and i went and got this.

This is an excellent pistol. look at the reviews and pricings. get with me today.
As any of you know me that have worked with me before my sales tactics are agressive and the items do not last long as I am always going to the next item on the short list.
this is the forth one of these that I have had since they have come out and yet once again they all have been charming to use and a pleasure to operate. Always shoot, never a stovepipe, always a fire, dead on accurate and most of all this once has the 60 dollar holster and 25 dollar box of bulk ammo of 222 count if i remember right.

ok, thats about it.

DD is made in Black Creek, GA. This is a high quality, American made rifle. I have only put about 400 rounds down range with this rifle. The barrel break in period is around 200-250 rounds, so it is just getting primed. I bought this rifle last year, but I recently joined the military, and I'll be leaving in January. I unfortunately am having to sell my gun collection so it will make my move easier. This is an absolutely exquisite M4, and do your research...it's worth every penny. I have made a few upgrades to this weapon...I added a Magpul B.A.D. Lever, a Magpul ASAP ambi sling attachment point, front and rear Magpul MBUS sights, and I also have a Magpul MS3 Gen 2 Sling. 

I also purchased an Aimpoint CompM4 that I will sell for an additional $650...it is brand new and I have all the original boxes, components, etc for it. It has the ARD, and if you'll read about it is one of the best sights ever developed...it is current the US Army's M68 CCO. It was only on the gun for a couple of range sessions to zero it in. In addition to the gun, I also have ammo and some Magpul Gen2 and Gen3 PMAGs that I will sell. The gun comes with the two Magpul Gen2 PMAGS that orginally came with the gun. I have additional PMAGS that I will sell at retail value, with 5 of the Gen3s still being in the original Magpul packaging. Three of the Gen2 PMAGS have the Ranger plate on them. The rifle also comes with the DD hard shell case. 

I have ammo for sale as well...1000 rounds of Lake City (Federal) M855 green tip LAP 5.56 NATO ammo. This Lake City 5.56mm XM855 ammo comes loose, and in an ammo can. This is the perfect ammo for AR-15 type rifles. Bullet weight is 62 grain with a copper jacket and hard steel penetrater in the core for exceptional penetration of a variety of barriers. The case is brass with a non-corrosive boxer primer and can be reloaded after use if you are into that. This is the same ammo as used by the US Military. This ammunition has been exceptionally good stuff, beautiful ammo, extremely reliable and consistent for Lake City ammo. $500

I also have 200 rounds of plinking ammo that I bought at the Tanner Gun show from Ammo Can. It is a 55 gr FMJ, and can be reloaded. It also comes with an ammo can. $75.

I also have 40 rounds of Winchester White Box gov't overrun ammo. It is a 63 grain, self defense ammo. $40

The price quoted excludes the ammunition, the Aimpoint Comp M4 sight, and the extra PMags (gun comes with two already). If you have any questions please let me know. This is a very fair price for the upgrades, condition, care, quality and how little the rifle was used. These are very high quality, and hard to find. I am open to serious offers, and I hope to find this gun a good home. I also have plenty of other photos, so just email me if you would like to see anything else. Thanks!"

The LC9 is perfect other than a little holster wear on the slide. It is a small 9mm suitable for concealed carry. It has a capacity of 7 + 1 with standard magazines such as the ones I am selling with it. It can fit in a pocket or other methods of concealed carry. It is big enough that it's comfortable to shoot at the range for extended sessions. It can handle +P but Ruger does not recommend running a large number of +P rounds through it on a regular basis. The gun has several safety features: magazine release safety (won't fire when the magazine is out, even if there is a round in the chamber), thumb safety, and very long trigger pull to reduce accidental discharge in stress situations.

Extras - pictured unless otherwise noted:

- LaserMax trigger guard laser installed and zeroed for ~7 yards. Easy to adjust with a small hex key (included).
- Two extra Ruger magazines - three magazines in total. These sell for $45 apiece at Gander Mountain.
- Not pictured: Blackhawk pocket holster.
- Alternate magazine base plates - three flat, three extended. The extended ones do not increase capacity, but they let you hold the pistol with all of your fingers. I carried this pistol with a flat plate on the first magazine, but kept the extended plates on the other magazines for reloads or range trips.
- Box, lock, manual.

Buyer must have NC driver license and either NC CHP (preferred) or a valid pistol purchase permit.

If you buy the gun, I will also sell you a 100-round value pack of Winchester whitebox 115-grain 9mm for an additional $25. I will only sell this if you buy the gun, so don't ask :)

Not interested in most trades. I guess it doesn't hurt to ask, but I already bought this gun's replacement, and am looking to sell it moreso than trade it. The trades I might be interested in include a S&W .357 with at least a 4"" barrel, and a Beretta 92FS/M9."

I have a great condition M&P 40 compact up for sale it has seen maybe 300 rounds of 40 and 200 rounds of 9mm.  The 9mm barrel is top quality and not cheap coming from StormLake. The nifty thing about the .40 mags from smith is that they actually hold and feed 9mm so there is no need to have dedicated 9mm mags although it is not advisable to use 9mm in the .40 mags for defense scenarios. I am asking for $600 cash and will consider trades. 

Reasoning for the sale is I have a M&P 9mm Compact which I invested a lot of money into with APEX parts and upgraded sights so I am going to stick with the M&P 9c and sell this one."

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by Sig Sauer, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. Featuring the Sig internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. SigLite night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous."

M4V7 
Here is a description from DD web site:
The Daniel Defense M4, V7 Upper Receiver Group is built off the extremely popular V5 platform. We incorporated the Modular Float Rail 12.0 to provide each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rail sections is accomplished with little effort. This allows the shooter to customize the rail set up. The DDM4v7 URG is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach to the barrel assembly. Daniel Defense complete upper receiver groups come complete with bolt carrier group and charging handle.

They also have the best lifetime warranty in the business, which follows the gun and not the owner.   Although I never had a problem with mine, from what I hear, their customer service is beyond belief.    They literally R the best bang for the buck.  I recently bought a bunch of guns in a package deal, and am selling off those that I have no need for.  After all, how many C9's does one need?  In my case, the answer is 1, but not 3.    I only listed 2 photos since the photos show them as being identical.  However, 1 has more scratches than the other.  I have priced them accordingly.  The scratches don't show in the photos.  The cleaner of the two will go for $130.00.  The other one $115.     Both seem to function well.  This will be a private sale.  I Might be willing to trade for a 9mm Hi-point Carbine (newer style stock only, & I will be checking to see if stolen before doing a trade).  For the right trade, I would add to the deal.

This is a feeler post. I've been looking to shake things up a bit and see if anyone would be interested in trading for anything cool. Let me tell you what I got...

Saiga AKM in 7.62x39mm - Converted:
I bought this a local gunshop earlier this year, and it has an August 2013 manufacture date. I converted it using a kit, and have stripped the paint off of it and repainted it using high temperature black matte engine paint that I've found to be more durable and better looking. I have a 9"" Warsaw stock that I can throw along with it, but I currently have the Archangel OPFOR stock on it, as I like the adaptability and the cheek riser. I also threaded the barrel and installed an AK-74 style muzzle brake. I also replaced the trigger spring so it isn't as stiff when firing. It shoots smooth, hasn't had a failure to feed, and is extremely accurate as far as AKs go.

I have 6 magazines, a drum magazine, cleaning kit, and about 700 rounds to go along with it, should we trade out.

SIG P938:
This guy came with Rosewood grips and night sights, but I replaced the grips with a set of hogues. I also have an extended pinky grip magazine, a SHTF IWB holster, and about 350 rounds of 9mm to go along with it. This is my carry pistol but I'm looking for something different.
