He has 1 Remington 870 wing master and one Winchester 1400 mk2 both 20 gauge. He's looking to see what he can get for them. I looked around on gun broker and the prices are from 250 to 6-700 I'm not sure if his models are special enough for a price tag that high. Even if not interested and you could shoot me some better info on them that would be very appreciated it he told me he'd take 700 for both but I'm not positive they will get that much.  I can send more pics. Both guns in excellent condition. No scratches wood is in great condition. Not sure if they have even been fired.  I know my Dad never shot them.  He has had them for a while.

It retained all of its` original parts though.  I have rejuvinated it by enhancing the carded finish while taking care to preserve what was still there so, as to restore as opposed to recreate. I purchased an original 1918 hammer ( cost too dame much bidding on E bag ) to replace the one it had . The old hammer goes with it`s purchase. The pistol has been bead blasted with fine aluminum oxide meadium to preserve the metal peperation as much as possible. I made sure that there was clearence between the lower front of the SLIDE and the dust cover of the FRAME so, that there will NOT be bare metal wear there on the slide. The pistol has been Black Oxide finished.  I would like to get $1200 for it but, I am asking $975. If your interested I can send pics of the small parts and barrel .  Sincerly S.N."

Much more than just their take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who's picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it - it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that 'brick-in-the-hand' feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail, and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. Designed to minimize creep and stacking, the P-10's trigger breaks at a clean 4-4.5lbs and rebounds with a short, positive reset, meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with their legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The 'C' in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.Type: PistolAction: Single/DoubleCaliber: 9mm LugerBarrel Length: 4""Capacity: 15+1Safety: Trigger/Firing PinGrips: Black Interchangeable BackstrapSight Configuration: 3-DotWeight: 26 ozFrame Finish: Black NitrideFrame Material: PolymerBarrel Type: Cold Hammer-ForgedSlide Description: Black Nitride***No trades at this time*******Background included in price of gun****"

Black phosphate finished, fluted, 16"" long, with mid-length gas, .081"" gas port, 1 in 9 twist, with M4 ramps and 5.56 NATO chambered. We like the 16"" barrel because it's short enough with a comp attached, to be quick and maneuverable in house clearing stages or close, tight quarters and shooting positions, yet long enough to give the velocity needed to flash steel targets at long range. Fluting both before and after the gas block facilitates cooling and reduces weight. The mid-length gas system softens the recoil impulse over a standard carbine length gas system; and the chamber and 1 in 9 twist rate allows shooters to use standard XM193 or other readily available 55 gr. ball ammunition.  Has assembly marks but has not been fired.  $175"

I can however either drive it to the shop of your choosing for the transfer to take place, or have it shipped (shipping via Ship My Gun is around $35) to the FFL of your choice.This firearm can only be sold to a Virginia resident, out of state customers must pay to have the gun shipped to an FFL within their own state for the transfer to take place (check your local laws to see if pistol grip shotguns are legal in your area).For local customers paying cash/money-order: You have the biggest range of options when it comes to payment. The fastest (and perfered) method of transfer would be meeting in the parkinglot of your chosen FFL, exchanging money, and then walking into the shop to fill out the required paperwork.For local customers customers paying with check: After contacting me to confirm your purchase, either mail or deliver your check to (address). After the check has cleared, we can proceed to the transfer portion of the process as detailed in the local-cash section.For distant/out of state customers: We'll have to talk more thoroughly about how exactly you'd like to recieve your firearm, but in general, you can use any of the three payment methods listed above (cash, check, or money-order).

These lead cast bullets are made from 92-6-2 alloy and then are coated in HiTek coating.  The benefits to shooting are numerous and include:  The coating molecularly bonds to the bullet totally encapsulating it.  Coating prevents lead to bore contact.  Less smoke as associated with traditional lubed bullets.  Range FRIENDLY!  Bullets feed well in automated bullet feeders.  Shoot higher velocities without lead fouling.  Can be shot through polygonal rifling.
The 9mm 147 FP-NLG is a non-lube groove bullet thus has a longer driving band creating greater accuracy during the firing process.

The ejector rod is probably a replacement, screw heads are not engraved and the ejector rod is not numbered. It was very common for ejector rod housings to be removed on revolvers used in battle. Supposedly they would hang up on holsters. Also the barrel fit is not perfect, but markings on barrel are correct and match the remainder of gun perfectly.
