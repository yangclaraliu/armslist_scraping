Of course, that is not something that messes up the value because it easily can be taken off and leaves no marks.  The overall condition of the gun is beautiful.  There is no marring in the bluing or damages to the metal anywhere.  The wood grips do have a few dent marks on the butt end, but nothing that is overwhelming or stands out.  You have to be inspecting it close to notice anything.This gun was owned by a gentleman that passed away a few months ago and he lived for his guns.  So this was very well taken care of.  He even left good notes in his journal.  After reviewing it, we found out that he purchased this gun from the original owner when he was in the service.  He did not have the box for it, but it was never put into a holster.  Kept in a gun rug and the previous owner said that he may have put 50 rounds through it, if that.  The past owner had down everytime he shot any of his firearms, in his journal.  There is only one listing for the Colt and he shot 25 rounds through it on May 9th of 1988.  Since then it has been in the gun rug and kept away from damp areas such as the basement.The cylinder is tight and the action is smooth as Tennessee Moonshine.  The cylinder also does not have that ""wedding ring"" marking on the cylinder, which also indicates it has been shot very little.  The family is going to put this in a gun auction in September and the auctioneer gave them an idea of what they could expect to get for it, based on the 5 or 6 he has sold this year, to be somewhere around the $2400.00-3100.00 because of its condition.  The family will place it in the auction as planned, but they would like to get the money for it ASAP so I have it listed on my account for anyone that is interested, to make an offer.  Please let me know as soon as you can.  I am going to leave it up for two weeks so please reach out to me if you are interested as soon as you can.  Thank you for looking and let me know if you have any questions and I will get them answered for you.Thanks for lookingUPDATE:  Gonna leave this up until it is sold or September 25th which is the day of the auction.  I have had 48 responses to this ad, so with that information I was able to lock in an ""if sold before auction"" price from the family.  $2675.00 will get you the Python.  We might accept a partial trade so if you have anything you would like to trade, feel free to ask.Thanks a bunch!"

It takes .380 auto and feels great. This gun is specifically meant for concealed carry, it is advertised as the lightest .380 ever. Super low profile sights allow for a snag free draw. There is NO external safety! Slide isn't the easiest to pull back because it is locked breech so you have grip it properly and intentionally cock it, this is done on purpose because there is no external safety, is meant to be carried loaded, and is meant for concealed carry, a safety feature if you will. Another safety feature is a heavy and long trigger pull. To fire the gun you have to give it a good squeeze, I can almost guarantee you no foreign objects would cause the gun to fire.  Very simple design meant for extremely quick and easy use. Train with it and when you need to draw it, it will have your back."

This is a Charles Daly 3-9x40 ""Wide Angle"" scope - the view is rectangular, instead of a circle. It has a basic duplex reticle. The scope is in great shape, but it does have two ring marks and indents, from a previous owner being a bit too aggressive in tightening the rings. However, as far as I can tell, it functions perfectly. The reticle adjustments move left, right, up, and down with no problems. The glass is perfect, and the optics are clear and bright. Both turrents have firm clicks in their adjustments, and are 1/4"" MOA adjustable. It has a fast-focus eyepiece, and the power ring moves very smoothly. The scope cover shown is included. Made in Korea. I would put this a cut above Tasco or Simmons, roughly in the same class as the Bushnell Banner. Not a Leupold, but a good scope to mount on your truck gun or keep as a spare.

At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.
The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system and is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.
The KRISS Vector SDP is the Non-NFA semi-automatic pistol variant of the KRISS Vector platform. It features a short, threaded, 5.5” barrel. A rear quick detach sling point assists with carrying the firearm. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector SDP are the Magpul MBUS sights, full length picatinny top rail and a Glock Magazine. Although this SDP maybe small, it still has the same capabilities as its larger counterparts and is civilian legal in most states."

Originally bought new by my wife a few months ago for her EDC, I inherited it from her when she went back to carrying her Glock 26. While I used to be a big pocket carry guy, I'm finding more and more I just go IWB with my M&P - so this is just sitting around. Shows some sort of wear as shown in the picture on the left upper slide area - I suspect it's from the Desantis Nemesis holster I used to carry it in, as it bounced on my thigh as I strode around all day. Went with the included (and modified to not rub me wrong) BORAII pocket ""holster"" to thin it down for the pocket and increase ""retention"" for when it's sitting out. Very low round count - probably less than 50 - and never gave us a lick of trouble. We've had a few Nanos over the years as our perceived needs changed and they've all run like a top.Comes with the 6 round flush and 8 round extended grip mags, all factory packaging, and the BORAII holster. If you're into pocket carry, and like the idea of a very controllable, soft shooting 9mm that's not much larger than the micro 380s, or if you're looking for an ankle gun or really small IWB gun that just disappears, this is a great choice. Cash price $350 OBO, or open to handgun trades. Top pick would be a Shield without a thumb safety, but I'll entertain quality offers. No manual safety guns need apply. I need to stick close to home on this one. FTF only - no shipping. I'm from Argos - located in Marshall County along the US 31 corridor. I can drive as far south as Peru, east to Etna Green, west to Grovertown, north to US 6. I'll need to see the interested party's IN DL and LTCH unless you're known to me.

I've owned it almost 25 years and I'm sure it will function better than today's junk 25 years from now.  It has been used by 2 FAMILIES of boys but looks good, especially considering that it's 64 YEARS OLD.  The bore is perfect and your MOM can strip and clean it and be shooting again before you can get a Ruger, Browning or Colt semi-auto .22 APART! Finish shows honest use but looks good enough to get attention at the range and while the new crap is clogging up, you'll be shooting. It's a usable collector item. I don't do pictures of any kind, so available for LOCAL CASH SALE TO OHIO RESIDENT ONLY. If I can't get around $400 for it, I'll just return it to the safe until after the election.
