They were replaced by the GP100 series revolvers in 89 and have since become extremely coveted firearms for those seeking either an everyday carry gun, or as a collectors piece. This revolver has a beautiful stainless steel finish, with only a few minor scratches from holster wear. It comes with the original rosewood grips which have faded on one side from service in Europe, but are still in fantastic shape and could easily be refinished if desired. This revolver has a 4 inch barrel with fixed sights.

The trigger pull is even and has a clean break, and functions flawlessly in either DA or SA. And being a 357 Magnum the frame is capable of handling a variety of rounds including .38 SPC, 38 SPC + P, or the Man-Stopping 357 Magnum. These revolvers were trusted by police departments around the world to defend the lives of not only their officers, but the citizens whom the served; and this Service Six Revolver is ready to do the same for you today.I am currently asking $700 firm for this firearm.

It is in mint condition and comes in the original box with all its paperwork. Vortex Crossfire II 4-12x40mm AO Rifle Scope is a small-frame, high accuracy rifle scope based off the design of the original CrossFire. Built out of a single piece of aircraft grade aluminum and fashioned into a 1"" tube, these Vortex Optics rifle scopes are waterproof, fog-proof, and shockproof, creating a highly durable scope that you'll want to use over and over again. Fully multi-coated optics on the riflescope give you a high enough light transmission rate for accurate shooting at dawn and dusk, and the smaller objective lens diameter results in a lighter body and a more compact profile. The Vortex Optics Cross Fire 2 4-12x Adjustable Objective Riflescope has an adjustable objective lens which, combined with the fast focus eyepiece, will eliminate parallax error and make for dynamic target acquisition. Vortex Optics has equipped this model of the CrossFire II scope with capped turrets to improve the mobility of the scope. If you liked the original Vortex Crossfire rifle scope, you'll really love the improved Vortex Cross-Fire II 4-12x40mm Capped Turret Scope.Magnification: 4x to 12xObjective Lens Diameter: 40mmEye Relief: 4x - 3.9""; 12x - 4.4""Field of View (at 100 yards): 4x - 24.7'; 12x - 8.4'Tube Diameter: 1""Turret Style: CappedAdjustment Click Rate: 1/4 MOAMax Adjustment: 50 MOALength: 13.6""Weight: 19.2 ozFinish: Matte Black"

I have 160 rounds out of this gun. Bought it off of a friend who did the pistol grip conversion, as well as converting it to accept AK magazines. The magazine fits in perfectly and has almost no wobble to it. The stock is a Magpul stock. He also gave it a battle worn finish and sprayed it with clear coat. This rifle has been nothing but reliable for me, but given the nature of the upcoming assault weapon laws next year, I want to slim out my rifle collection. The rifle will come with 1 ten round magazine that is pictured below. Saigas are no longer imported into the United States so this is your chance to own one before it is too late! If you have any questions feel free to message me. I am willing to drive a bit further for the right deal."

Additionally the bore is mirror bright and has clear rifling. I function tested the rifle at an indoor range, 50 rounds with no issues. I also had a gunsmith perform the SKS ""drop free"" mod on the BCG, in the event someone wants to use detachable magazines.I will include the left over surplus 7.62x39, around 50 rounds or so.The serial no. seems to indicate that it is a 1950's era SKS - I am told the rule of thumb is that if the SKS has a 7 digit serial number, the first digit is the number of years after 1956, which was the year of initial manufacture. I'm not a historian but that is the prevailing wisdom, in which case this rifle was made in 1958.
I am including as many pictures as possible to let them do the talking for me. There is finish wear on the gun and dings and scratches on the stock, which is to be expected for a gun that's older than your average gun owner. Nothing that would affect the function or integrity of the firearm.

The result was a rough looking weapon but it was perfectly shootable and easier to handle than the original. Shot this one at the range a few times and it wasn't a bad shooter. An impulse buy for me but now I have an Austrian made M95 long rifle in the original 8x50R calibre and this one is just taking up safe space.Price includes two 20 round boxes of 8x56R ammo ( 203gr FMJ and SP ) and two Austrian made ( c. 1934 ) 5 round M95 en bloc clips."

Even if you aren't interested in buying it, the pictures are worth looking at and that is free ;-)Designed to be small and compact for easy carry conceal or small storage areas, this Model 36 J-frame has a pinned 1.875 inch (sometimes called a 2 inch) barrel. It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder, case-hardened trigger, and case-hardened exposed hammer with single or double action.This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a bright shiny nickel finish and has wood grips with serial numbers that match the square butt frame.This thirty-six year old classic revolver is in beautiful condition. It had 25 rounds fired through it by the previous owner, so it was not new in the box but oh so close. That gave me license to take it out this morning to the gun range to put 15 more rounds through it as I was firing my other .38 Special revolver.As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is an accurate and fun gun. While this gun is pretty enough to just put up somewhere and admire, it is dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun.Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Please contact me for several additional pictures. Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."
