After the epoxy cures the stock is CNC machined to exacting tolerances. The result is 2 solid epoxy pillars that surround the action screws.

This is an AMT AUTOMAG III 30-Carbine, FACTORY NEW in BOX, NEVER FIRED!  Tell Dirty Harry to move over, you have this incredible Automag III! 
 
The Automag III is also called the “flame thrower” for the fire that comes out of the barrel when you shoot!  I have another one of these hand-cannons that I shoot and keep for self-defense – it is an awesome weapon, never jams, extremely powerful (the .30-carbine goes through body armor, cracks engine blocks, etc), never rusts, and the gun with its 6.5 inch barrel is super accurate!  Try a hollow point or soft point 30-carbine load, it packs a wallop!  But, then it should, this is rifle ammunition in a pistol. Go ahead, make Dirty Harry’s day, buy this hand-cannon.
 
My selling price of $1,400 is firm.  In fact, my selling price for a FACTORY NEW, NEVER FIRED AMT AUTOMAG III is less than a used Automag! 
 
Hurry, this is an incredible bargain!  No Trades, and remember, my $1,400 selling price is firm (it is already over $1,600 below its market value)."

Brand new in factory carton, unfired, all parts, manual, range test results, etc., still in sealed pouches. Front sight inserts in cosmolined pouch. 25” free floating barrel.These rifles are among the finest you can get and are widely sought after by both collectors and target shooters alike.Produced for the US Army from 1987-1990, Kimber of Oregon contracted these single-shot rifles. This is a single shot .22 LR (only) heavy barreled match rifle than has an overall weight of 10.75 lbs., and a length of 43 inches. it has an adjustable trigger, three butt plate spacers and a hand stop assembly. They were issued with a very precise Kimber rear aperture sight, a front sight with ten inserts, and are renowned for their accuracy. For whatever reason, the Army chose to keep them in arsenal storage for more than a decade and not use them. Most were passed on to the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP) a non-profit based at Camp Perry, Ohio, for disposal to pre-qualified civilian shooters. As soon as they hit the CMP's shelves, they rapidly sold out. Kimber 82 Government models are excellent shooters. They are rare and are extremely collectable. A quick search of Gunbroker shows these rifles garnering prices of up to $1600. This is a rifle that has exceptional grain. It has a great test group verification sticker, all related paperwork, owners manual, bolt , micrometer sights (font and rear) with all front sight inserts. It even has the white ""barrel pipe cleaner rod"" that was used to help prevent corrosion inside the barrel during storage.If you are looking for a Kimber model 82G, either for shooting or to keep ""New In the Box"", this is that rifle! It is basically, ""The Pick of the Litter"".You would be hard-pressed to find a comparable match rifle for this price and this gun would nicely round any serious Kimber oficiandos collection.Asking $1175- CASH ONLY NON-NEGOTIABLE YOU MUST BE A TN RESIDENT – NON FELON, NO EXCEPTIONS.NO TRADESIf interested please call REDACTED No e-mails - No texts please, thanks."

On subject:  The 1911 has a manufacture date of 1942 and if you're interested in looking it up for yourself I could send you the serial number.  It's more of a shooter than a collector as someone's replaced the sights with aftermarket fixed sights, stippled the front and rear of the grip (frame and mainspring housing), and the blued finish looks a little soft.  It's a great gun and makes for a great conversation piece at the range :)
Comes with two mags and the leather pouch.  For the right trade I do have a few extras I can toss in (slide from similar era, HS barrel, etc) but would rather keep those tbh.
If we do a cash sale, I'd like the buyer to pay the FFL, if we trade we can work something else out depending on the deal.  I would like to keep it pretty local to Tacoma (I have a couple kids so free time is hard to come by these days)
More pictures available on request (sorry, armslist only lets me upload one and that was the one I had handy)
 
Thanks!"

I will be including 825 FMJ rounds and 90 boxed JPH rounds along with 45 loose JHP rounds (in an additional plastic ammo container).

No safety to slow you down either.  Pocket holster from Desantis will come with it. In the holster it doesn't print at all, looks like a wallet or even better perfect for purse carry, ladies won't have to fight a slide or whether or not one is in the chamber.

(see AKOU review on youtube).  It has a milspec buffer tube and M4 stock on the back. Also included in the build is the wonderful Krebs selector and the CSS extended charging handle.Muzzle device is the FSC 47 by IW.  The DDI itself is a # match hungarian kit with Nitrided barrel (fenocite) and the whole thing was finished in Gunkote black.  Lots of quality in this AK build for little money.  I shot the rifle 140 rounds before the conversion.  Includes a new 30rd Bulgarian poly mag.  NO TRADES!!Look at what a stock DDI is selling for and then look at the parts included here.

Pretty standard item, round receiver, made by izhevsk. Stock has a few scrapes in it from when they were shipped over, apparently the importer literally just threw in the bayonets in the shipping crate, and didn't even try to package them. Includes bayonet (not pictured). I can provide additional pics if you would like.Solid shooter, I upgraded it with a trigger return spring, makes it more like a Finnish mosin trigger. Not looking to make money off this, just simply need the room in the safe. Good luck finding mosins from a distributor for less than $200 these days though...No shipping, sorry."

A few years back, I was on a mini-prepper kick and decided to try to make the best rifle possible based on durability, accuracy, ease of use, and abundance of parts.  The catch was that I gave myself a financial ceiling of $500.  Naturally, that led to the venerated M91/30.  This was the best shooting of the four that I owned at the time.  Altogether, I came in at about $420 for the whole set up, including the cost of the rifle.
I removed the front and rear sights with equal parts brute force and loving tenderness.  Once they were off, I placed a Bushnell pistol scope on the existing dove tail that the rear sight ramp is usually pinned to.  I used the beefiest rings that I could find to mitigate the kick of Russian aggression that is transferred to your shoulder when you fire the M91/30.   The front sight was taken off as well.  Then I installed an ATI Monte Carlo type stock.
The end result was/is a fairly impressive shooting rifle.  The stock absorbs a good amount of the punishment, making it not too miserable the day after shooting a few rounds.  I’m able to get 2.5’’ groups at 100 yards, despite the fact that I’m not the best shot in the world.Here's a photo of the group I shot after I did all the work. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B36N6uTeC5o1LUNsOTFZaHkwSFU
Included in this sale is everything pictured plus a sling, ammo pouch, and whatever other Mosin Nagant paraphernalia I can dig up.  I lost the oil cans.  Sorry.
I may consider trades if the right thing pops up, but money talks.  You know you want to own this badass piece of Bubba’s best gunsmith work."

The rifle is heavy, accurate, and a real joy to shoot longer range targets. I've had an adjustable cheek piece added to aid with a natural cheek weld and scope alignment. The rifle does have a scope (Leupold 3-9) although it is a little underpowered for the rifles capabilities of reaching out there. The rifle retails for around $1200.00 and the additional hardware ups the anti another couple of hundred.  My asking price of $900.00 makes this a fairly good deal. My health issues = Your gain.
