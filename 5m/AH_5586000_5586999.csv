COBRAY SINGLE SHOT 12 GAUGE MARINE FLARE PISTOL FIRES .45 COLT AMMO OR .410 SHOTGUN SHELL AMMO WITH CONVERSION KIT STEEL BARREL. *(YOU DON'T NEED A FFL LICENSE TO BUY OR SELL THIS PISTOL!!!) Flare pistol does not have or need any serial numbers. This is a great ""LIBERTY"" pistol or SURVIVAL tool and has proved itself to be a reliable functioning design! This Cobray pistol's production was started in the early 1970’s to be far superior to the current Orion flare pistols. This Cobray pistol was a unique design compared to all other flare pistols on the market at that time and to very this day. Made to be small, lightweight, reliable yet very sturdy. As most gun buyers have realized that reliable .45 Colt Derringers are very expensive. The BondArms gun company and the AmericanDerringer gun company sell their well built .45 Colt Derringer pistols for over $400.00 dollars! This Cobray Derringer pistol I have for sale here is a much better deal for the money.

Blue force gear 221 sling which converts from a 2 point to a 1 point sling with the quick click of a button.    In my opinion blue force gear makes the best slings in the industry.  I also have a pelican case that fits this rifle perfectly which cost $150 when I bought it For a different gun.    It just needs one piece of foam to carve out to fit the scar perfectly which you can order online or from pelican directly for relatively cheap.   It still works fine without the extra piece of foam though and also comes with the original carboard  case and all instructions that can when originally purchased.  The only cosmetic damage that I can notice is a slight bit of discoloration from when I set the hot rifle down on the plastic case after shooting with it and a little bit of the plastic melted on the outside of the barrel which mostly came right of and would t event be noticed unless specifically searching for it.  It has zero effect on performance. And the gun run amazingly.    The gun has only had 500 to 600 rounds through it at maximum. The rifling inside looks brand new.....I prefer to sell locally and be happy to let you try it at a local gun range I would also consider selling to anyone in the United States but I would have to receive the payment before shipping and returns are not excepted.  I only ship to FFL's!   I'm pricing to sell this ASAP and this should last for sale for more then a day or 2 at this price.   I love this gun so much that I'm buying the exact same one again when I get my finances in order..... Whoever gets this gun and scope at this price is very very very lucky......good luck! Thank u!!!"

Less than 1,000 rounds fired, this gun was purchased a year ago. This gun is valued at 2400 new. I do have some flexibility on price. 16inch barrel. Would meet at gun shop for transaction. Call or text REDACTED for any questions. More info on gun from website below. The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

There were 990 of these imported. Of those an estimated ""Couple Hundred"" had scope bases attached. There is less information regarding the actual scope mounts but I have heard ""less than 50"" and ""50 to 75"". Surfice it to say it wasn't a lot. But the prize is the scope itself. They were not imported or available to the best of my knowledge. I looked long and hard to locate a Finnish original scope for the M28-76 however that proved more difficult than I imagined. The scope on this rifle IS the correct scope but of a different name. The original German manufacturer of the Finnish scope is the same manufacturer of this scope. It is identical in every way except the printed name. It is not a copy, fake or reproduction. It is the genuine item, just not from Finland. This was very difficult to locate. In this configuration it is very unique and you may not find another one, original or otherwise. The correct Original scope case is included as shown in the pictures. You will note the scope has an elevation adjustment but not a windage. That's because the scope mount has the windage adjustment built in.This rifle also comes with the original Diopter sight and mounting screw.
The Bipod is aftermarket and the palm stop/bipod mount is also. They attach to the rail and remove quickly if not desired. It also has a quick release sling mount. I have an ORIGINAL Sling and ORIGINAL sling mount that comes with this rifle. (Not Pictured). This rifle has not shot surplus ammunition. This rifle shoots 7.62x53r Finnish ammunition. I hand load myself for this rifle.
The stock on this firearm is original however the rubber pad was not there when I purchased it. There was reminants of glue and it was rather worn and ragged on the butt. Even though that was ""original"" it was rough at best. I sanded the glue off and coated the stock in tung oil. It looks nice but not shiny or thick. It has a dull look and the grain of the wood shows nicely. Basically, it looks beautiful.Many more high resolution pictures available upon request."

Must complete background check. Under current Colorado state law I cannot transfer the 30 round magazines; the rifles come without magazines but accept any 10 / 20 / 30 round typical AR 15 magazines.

   I have a like-new Radical Firearms AR-15 upper receiver chambered in 5.56mm. I bought this upper thinking I was going to build another AR, but it never happened. I test fired 20 rounds of Federal XM193 55 grain ammo to make sure that the upper functioned, and it works flawlessly and accurately. 
   The upper has a free floated handguard that accepts any Magpul MOE accessories. It comes with a picatinny rail already installed on the underside for attaching a foregrip. Mil Spec build quality and the same finish on the receiver that the military uses.
   I have to also stress, this upper DOES NOT come with a bolt carrier group. I repeat, NO BOLT CARRIER GROUP. But that is why I am selling it for so cheap. You can find bolt carriers for 70-80 bucks all day online. Buy a 150 dollar lower and you have an AWESOME budget AR build.

It is only possible because it is permanently treated with RF85, the nano technology that injects calcium into the molecular fabric of the metal. RF85 is permanent. It isIN the metal. RF85 reduces friction 85% and wears with the metal. Under heat and pressure the calcium nano particles elongate and form a protective barrier that eliminates the need for lubrication. An ancillary benefit arises because without an oily film to catch carbon particles, the rifle runs cleaner much longer. A typical lubricated weapon traps the carbon byproducts from explosives. Under the heated conditions found in weapons, the gooey mess turns into tar which bakes into a solid mass and fouls the chamber. The result is life-threatening weapon failure. The Anderson Rifle uses RF85 nano-technology to fire with  85% Less Friction 23% Faster Action Never Needs Oiling  Cleans Up with Soap & Water$1300 plus tax/shipping where applicable."

Rifle is used but still shoot well. Will get pics up this weekend. $850 oboX7 Main Features SummaryChassis – All 7075 T6 Aluminum. Lower receiver and forend are custom billet designs made in-house at NGA. Upper receiver is a modified Nordic Mil-Spec hammer-forged unit. Buffer tube is Mil-Spec impact extruded from VLTOR.Lower receiver – Expanded, flared mag well for faster loading and more finger room in clearance drills. All aspects of magazine handling & holding have been improved. The front of the mag well was curved for more comfortable hand holding for those who grip this way. 0.154” fire control pins with 0.0005” tolerance.Rails – All rails are Mil-Spec 1913. Top rail is continuous and nearly seamless. Side rails are short and set back from the front for ergonomic reasons. The standard configuration is without a bottom rail, but a rail kit is available for mounting vertical foregrips and bipods.Forend ergonomics - Special emphasis went into the ergonomics of hand-holding for various types of grip. The circumference was reduced to a bare minimum to fit all hand sizes. The small side rails were moved back away from the front in order to allow indexing for the two most common forward grip styles.Charging handle – BCM Gunfighter 7075 billet Aluminum with medium latch.Barrels - Barrels are exclusively from Noveske Rifleworks. They are made from extra-hard 416R stainless steel, with NGA stainless steel gas blocks and compensators, ported for mid-length, direct gas impingement operation. Rifling is polygonal 5 lands/grooves, 1:7"" twist. Barrels are guaranteed accurate within 1 MOA. Other barrels were tested and we hoped to select some lower cost options, but in the end, only Noveske barrels met all of our expectations. Recommended bullet weight range for 1:7"" barrels is 55 - 77g. Hopefully soon, we'll introduce a Noveske varmint barrel suitable for lighter weight bullets.* 14.5” modified Afghan profile, permanently affixed compensator* 16"" heavy profile, screw-on compensatorGas block – stainless steel, micro gas block designed and mfg’d by NGA.Compensator – stainless steel, designed and mfg’d by NGA; each barrel option has a specifically tuned version of the compensator that achieves perfect muzzle neutrality.Trigger options - Any trigger from the Geissele Automatics catalog can be configured. The 2 most popular options are the SSA and the S3G, which we believe are the best triggers on the market for most purposes. Note that Geissele uses ultra precision EDM to machine these tool steel triggers and they use extra heavy hammer springs for the fastest possible lock time and lowest chance of light primer strikes.Bolt carrier group - BCM is now the exclusive supplier for the BCG. The bolt is made of Carpenter 158. Each bolt is shot-peened, initially MPI tested, high pressure proof tested and re-MPI'd. NGA re-torques and adds redundant staking to the gas key fasteners. NGA ceramic coating reduces fouling, corrosion and maintenance.Buffer system – H2 buffer and custom heavy oil-hardened chrome silicon spring designed for millions of cycles.Furniture - VLTOR IMOD Mil-Spec butt stock and generic Mil-Spec pistol grip.Sling mounts – 2 stainless steel QD ports are provided at the rear of the forend and 1 is permanently mounted in the rear of the lower receiver.Finish – Ceramic coated inside and out. Matte gray chassis and black equipment.Weight: 6.6+ lbs empty, no sights, depending on barrel selectedPrice: $2445+"
