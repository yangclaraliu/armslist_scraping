Call me, Jeff,  at REDACTED from 9am -11pm. These are very fast at 62 grain weight and are well known as 22 Cal hog bullets, and probably the only 22 Cal bullet that will penetrate and expand on hogs. You can also use them for other critters, and they make a great tactical round as well. They sell for $29.49 a box at Midway, plus you would pay shipping. Sportsman's Warehouse sells them for $29.99 a box.  I have 8 boxes of them for a total of 400 bullets. Another advantage of these bullets is they weigh the same as 62 grain steel core green tip armor peircing military bullets, so you will have the same trajectory; however, the Barnes bullet will be much more accurate. And if you are building up a precision AR-15, then these are top choices for accuracy and downrange killing power. And these bullets work great for bolt guns too. I will sell you 8 boxes for the price of 7 at Midway's price, which is $206.  And am willing to meet if you live in Portland/Vancouver down to Albany along the I-5 Corridor.  I live in north Salem off of exit 258 just south of Keizer."

479,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5697479,"For Sale:  Interarms 50 Cal Hawken Rifle, High Quality","Portland, Portland, Oregon",$ 315,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 19, 2016",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,Muzzle Loader,"First off, the quality on these is better than you are going to find on anything else. Unfortunately, our American companies like Thompson Center, Lyman, and Traditions are all producing cheaply made ""traditional"" muzzle loaders these days. The wood on those tends to have no grain or poor wood grain quality, and fit and finish is sloppy. Also they are using thinner brass on the furniture, and not finishing it out, especially on the patch boxes. On the Tradidtions I saw yesterday at Sportsman's Warehouse, the patch box is of minimum size, no depth to it, and bare wood on the inside, meaning no wood sealant was put on it to protect it from moisture, and the very thin brass door of the patch box certainly won't keep moisture out.  Call me, Jeff, at REDACTED, from 9am - 11pm. These Interarms Hawkens are SO MUCH BETTER in how they are made, everything is more sturdy, especially the brass furniture and wood quality. This one has a 29 inch , 66 twist barrel.  It has a very strong stock with good looking black mineral streaking lines that go down the full length of the stock. The buttstock is not skinny like on a lot of muzzle loaders at the local sporting goods stores. This normal thickness stock gives a wider footprint on your shoulder to mitigate recoil, meaning it will be a comfortable gun to shoot. The patch box is exceptional. It goes deep and has a lot of room for patches and primers, etc. It's not just decorative, it is every bit as functional as it is good looking, making it different and better than a lot of guns of this type. The brass furniture is excellent on this rifle, and so is the double set trigger. The sights are very good too. They are easy to use and practical in lower light. The only flaw is there are a few minor marks on the left side of the stock, and I put up two pictures of the left side showing them. A little buffing and then adding some  tung oil to the finish would probably take care of it. These rifles are $450 or more new. This one is $315. The only reason I am selling it is I want more money for bulding up a duck hunting boat for the fall season. It's a very well made rifle, and a great buy."

That's cheaper than you can by them or order them from retailers. Call or text me at REDACTED.  The 30 Cal 190 gr ABLR's will fly stable at the longest ranges out of a 10 twist barrel, which is what most shooters are using. The 210 grain ABLR will not. These will fly better. The ABLR's are very hard to come by, and I had to make two trips to Bend, Oregon, which is 3 hrs one way, 12 hours drive time for two trips, to get these. Acquiring these saves you a lot of hassle to acquire these premium bullets. Nosler makes a run of these once or twice a year. You get the benefit of acquiring a bulk quanitity which will ensure you don't run out any time soonI have 1,700  30 caliber 190 grain Nosler Accubond Long Range Bullets for sale.  The G1 BC is .640, the highest BC of any 30 cal 190 grain bullet.  Also, as a hunting bullet it WILL EXPAND DOWN TO 1300FPS. As a target bullet, Mike at Nosler uses these very Nosler seconds to shoot a mile in his 30 cal magnums (300 Win Mag and 300RUM).  I do not work for Nosler.  Your price on these is my cost, actually it is below my cost because the price includes insured shipping to you in the the lower 48 and Alaska/Hawaii. This is a smart buy if you shoot 30-06 or a 30 cal magnum.  So why would I sell them then, after making the effort to acquire them?   I do more duck hunting than long range shooting, and I am having a duck boat built over the next couple of months and I'd rather pay for some options cash instead of putting it on a credit card. Just a matter of economics and time.  I SAY IT AGAIN, THIS IS A VERY SMART BUY FOR YOU.NOTE: I LIVE IN SALEM. IF YOU LIVE ANYWHERE FROM PORTLAND TO SALEM TO ALBANY, THEN I CAN SELL THEM TO YOU AT LEAST 4 BOXES OF 100 AT $55.49 PER BOX.  THESE BULLETS ARE BEING SOLD AT LESS THAN YOU CAN GET THEM FOR FROM ANY RETAILER."

That's cheaper than you can by them or order them from retailers, who will also charge shipping. Call or text me, Jeff, at REDACTED.  The 30 Cal 190 gr ABLR's will fly stable at the longest ranges out of a 10 twist barrel, which is what most shooters are using. The 210 grain ABLR will not. These will fly better. The ABLR's are very hard to come by, and I had to make two trips to Bend, Oregon, which is 3 hrs one way, 12 hours drive time for two trips, to get these. Acquiring these saves you a lot of hassle to acquire these premium bullets. Nosler makes a run of these once or twice a year.  The G1 BC is .640, the highest BC of any 30 cal 190 grain bullet.  Also, as a hunting bullet it WILL EXPAND DOWN TO 1300FPS. As a target bullet, Mike at Nosler uses these very Nosler seconds to shoot a mile in his 30 cal magnums (300 Win Mag and 300RUM).  I do not work for Nosler.  Your price on these is my cost. NOTE: I live in Salem and can meet you somewhere if you live in Portland down to Albany.

It remained in production until around 1940. It is the same pistol as the Browning 1903. There were also pistols made for the civilian market with the 1907 designation. When these guns were imported into the Unite States, the importers realized that the original chambering ( 9mm. Browning Long ) would not be a popular sell. There solution was to replace the original barrels with one chambered for .380 Auto, a popular cartridge in the US. The side of the frame was then stamped "".380 Auto"". Everything except the barrel stayed the same. The pistol I have for sale has the Military Regiment desination stamped on the left side of the frame. I'm guessing this gun was made sometime in the early 1920's, but I'm not sure. In my pictures you will see a second barrel, that is the .380 barrel installed for US sale and is chambered in .380 Auto. Installed in the gun is a factory Browning 9mm. Long barrel. So you can shoot both .380 Auto and the 9mm. Browning Long cartridges from this pistol. It only requires changing the barrel. I will include some Browning 9mm. Long ammo with this sale. Both barrels have excellent bores. Any questions just email. Buyer must be an Ohio Resident and be at least 21 years of age. Thanks for looking."

Jeff Cooper admired the CZ as one of the few ""wonder-nines"" because of the designs' ability to be carried ""Cocked and Locked"".The Kadet2 Adapter is a unique and very rare piece of kit.  Designed to allow for frequent pistol practice with the ergonomics and weight of the full sized gun, but using cheaper .22LR ammo.  Unlike some other .22LR adapter systems that are made of lightweight potmetal, the Kadet2 is full steel with a unique slide system.  It utilizes the same trigger pull, hammer drop, frame, weight, and ergodynamics of the CZ in the .22LR.  A picture below shows the Kadet2 slide Open.The Kadet2 is not widely imported by CZ into the US.  Finding one is expensive, if you can find one at all.  Finding a Kadet2 used is even rarer as folks don't usually let go of a Kadet2 once they have it.  Finding a Kadet2 that is precision matched to the frame is the rarest of all CZ finds.  I purchased the CZ-75B and Kadet2 new, and I hand fit the Kadet2 to the frame by carefully shaving away mere thousandths of an inch on all the bearing parts until the Kadet2 fit perfectly.  The fit is tight, firm, and allows for amazing accuracy.The Kadet2 comes with a micro adjustable rear sight.  I added the same sight to the 9mm slide.  Both are adjusted such that CCI MaxiMag .22LR HyperVelocity and Hornady American Gunner 115gr 9mm +P both print with the same accuracy at 7 yards.  This allows for lots of practice with reduced recoil of the .22LR, and then switching over the slide to 9mm for carry or competition.What comes with this package:1 ea. CZ-75B steel frame1 ea. CZ-75B 9mm slide1 ea. Kadet2 Adapter Slide .22LR2 ea. 9mm magazines at 16 +1.  I replaced the standard steel baseplates with CZ rubber baseplates, the steel plates are included in the package and shown in the pictures.2 ea. .22LR magazines at 10 + 12 ea. frame pins, one for .22LR, one for 9mm, but either works with either slide2 ea. custom boxes, one for the 9mm, one for the Kadet21 ea. 9mm patch jag and 9mm bore brush1 ea. .22LR patch jag and .22LR bore brush2 ea. plastic standard CZ grips (never used-shown in pictures)2 ea. custom smooth brushed aluminum CZ grips - mounted on the frame as shown1 ea. combat rear sight (part of the three dot sighting system) that can be reinstalled into either slide dovetail.  Shown in pictures.1 ea.

Tiny orifices perforate the striker channel, which allows water to drain. In addition, specially designed guides diminish water resistance when the striker moves forward. This, along with a beefier striker spring, allow the gun to be fired when completely flooded. Finally, the PPQ Internals are recoated with phosphate to prevent corrosion."
