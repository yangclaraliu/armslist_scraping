As said, it shoots up to the large 3-1/2"" shell, comes with two mag tube end caps (one with a sling swivel), a $100 Beretta choke tube set (includes extended chokes), a $80 Drake Waterfowl floating gun case, a box of 3-1/2"" goose shells, aftermarket fiber optic front sight and a custom charging handle.To buy this set new, all total, this will run you almost $1800.I want to move this shotgun fast and you simply will NEVER get a deal like this again. I want $699 cash for all of it or my partial trade value will be as follows (and higher of course):I will take a new or like new Gen 3 or newer Glock 19, 26 or 43 PLUS $300 in cash on top from you. The only straight across trade I will do is for an AR10 (DPMS is okay) or a NEW Henry's Big Boy lever rifle in .45 colt only.Do not wait too long, get ahold of me rightaway; I'm going to list it on Gunbroker too so it will sell fast at this price. I'm dumping duck hunting so all my gear has to go. I'll be posting other waterfowl items like a bunch of new calls, camo gear, gear bags and so on.This deal has to occur at an FFL. I prefer my guy out here in S. Hill/Graham and he is only $25 and that is on you, of course. If you are partial trading me a Glock, you pay your $25 and I will pay mine.On your marks, get set, go..."

Here is the description from Cobb's website:
The Cobb Tuning Accessport is a multi-featured ECU reprogramming device for your Subaru WRX/STI. The Accessport comes loaded with multiple maps for various setups (i.e. stock, turboback exhaust, etc.). It also allows for custom tuning by Cobb certified 'Pro-Tuners' or self-tuning with the purchase of Cobb's Street Tuner system and a laptop computer. Your Subaur WRX/STI can easily be returned to stock at any time, as the Accessport retains your stock base map. In addition, the Cobb Tuning Accesport functions as a scan tool and on board data logger, diagnosing and clearing check engine lights (CELs) and logging numerous other vehicle parameters. The Accessport's color display allows the user to display a variety of parameters including dynamometer testing, real time digital gauges and actuator duty cycles. Best of all, the Cobb Accessport installs via the under-dash diagnostic port, meaning you don't have to pick up a tool or even open your hood to install it.
 Cobb's Accessport Stage 1 map is designed for showroom stock cars, meaning you can boost your power and prepare for future modifications by simply plugging in the Accessport! As you add upgrades (i.e. exhaust) you can download the appropriate map to get even more power from your WRX/STI! If you already have an exhaust or other modifications, Cobb's Stage 2 map will eliminate the check engine lights (CELs) resulting from removing the catalytic converters, and maps with lowered wastegate duty cycles are available to reduce boost spikes on cars with the stock turbo and aftermarket exhausts. The Cobb Accessport functions as a 'chip' for users working within the guidelines of the included maps, but it can also be tuned by a Cobb Protuner, or the end user using Cobb's optional Street-Tuner software for additional modifications including bigger injectors, turbos, etc. All the while, the Accessport retains the driveability and simplicity of a stock ECU.
     Features and Notes:     Installs via the vehicle's diagnostic port - no tools/disassembly/wiring required!     Reversible Process: the ECU can be returned to stock at any time     Scantool Capability: Read and clear check engine lights (CELs).     Measure 0-60, 1/4 mile times, estimate fuel economy, & estimate torque and horsepower.     Data Readout: Display engine parameters on the color screen.     Dynamometer: Easily calculate power output and compare with other Accessport users
     FITMENT:     Subaru WRX / STI 2008 - 2014     Subaru Legacy GT 2005 - 2013      Subaru Forester XT 2007 - 2013     Subaru Outback 2007 - 2009"

This is the mod.14 which was basically the same as their mod.15 but with fixed sights and matte blue finish. Has a 2 1/2"" snub barrel which are hard to find on these. One neat feature about Dan Wesson's is that you can swap out barrels in a matter of minutes. (You'll have to get a separate tool to do so.) It's stamped ""Made in the U.S.A., Monson, Mass."", which are considered the better quality Dan's that were built at the original factory (now owned by CZ). My research shows it was manufactured sometime between 1970-72. It's a shooter grade gun, but it's reliable and everything locks up tight and functions as it should. Also has a pretty nice trigger that feels a lot like a GP100 but with a shorter stroke due to having a trigger stop.Mainly looking for trades. Interested in other shooter grade guns or rifles. Mostly into revolver calibers. Been wanting a Ruger SP101, or a S&W 351. Just let me know what you got. I'm in no rush to sell or trade.Be willing to show SC drivers license/conceal carry permit, and we'll both sign a bill of sale."
