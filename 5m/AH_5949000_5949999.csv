I am the original and only owner of this gun and I bought it brand new from gander mountain a year ago. I still have the original box and paperwork. The rifle is in like new condition and I have only fired 100 rounds through it. It has a free floated barrel and the adjustable trigger is very nice. I was able to shoot 1/2 inch groups at 50 yards on a bench with the bipod and scope. It was cleaned and lubed after each use. Included with the rifle for the $215 price is a very nice nikon prostaff rimfire 3x9x40 scope and the caldwell adjustable bipod. the ammo seen in the photos has been sold and is no longer available. FFL transfer is required. We can meet anywhere you would like to do the transfer.
