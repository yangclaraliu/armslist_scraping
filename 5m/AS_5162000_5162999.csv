67,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5162067,For Sale:  Last Civilian Supply - Rarest Special Forces Bullets In the World,"NW Suburbs, Illinois, United States","$ 100,000","Listed On: Friday, February 12, 2016",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"How would you like to own the rarest, most restricted ammunition in the United States? A firm known as Accutec USA designed a very specific bullet for special forces, air marshals and government operators approximately 15 years ago. This product was known as the RRLP Ultra-Frangible bullet. It was designed for operators to achieve several goals: To be manufactured in all common calibers for special forces and operators in both rifle, submachine gun and pistol configurations. That it be non-toxic and contain no lead That it have proprietary coatings (patented) to reduce or eliminate barrel fouling That it penetrate effectively against threats That it frange to an individual fragment size no larger than 3 grains That it prevent lethal “backsplatter” ricochet to the operator at 5 feet distance That it is certified by the FBI ballistics lab for its intended purpose with gel tests That it be capable of being loaded in supersonic or subsonic configurations as deemed necessary by the engagement. The net result of these efforts was the creation of a marvelous ammunition. It appears Accutec’s business model was to sell to the government agencies directly and rumor has it that they made an agreement with their distribution partners at the behest of the government to never sell these products to civilians. This was likely done to keep the patented technologies from being reverse engineered by competitors or foreign nations. I wish to emphasize that there is no legal barrier to owning these bullets in the USA other than that there was no means to acquire them as the manufacturer never wanted them sold to the public. Things changed for Accutec as they decided to change their business model. Instead of manufacturing bullets, now you pay them a licensing fee as a nation-state and they provide the formula and design information under license to you so that places like Federal and Lake City can manufacture their technology for your operators and special forces teams for a set period of time or quantity. So in effect, Accutec stopped making bullets so there is no more supply outside the hands of their licensees that will NEVER let the product enter the hands of the general public. Around 2001 Accutec signed agreements with one US distributor that subsequently had a small pallet of these bullets available for their government clientele. That firm went out of business about 3 years ago. When 5/3 bank took management of the distributor they became the primary creditor and liquidated all remaining inventory. I personally acquired all the Accutec inventory and since I did not sign any agreements or consent to any restrictions on sale, Accutec and their designees have no control over how I sell or market the remaining inventory. Things went along swimmingly and I sold Accutec bullets for a year at a reasonable cost of $1.60 per projectile in most of the common calibers like .40 S&W, 9mm, 5.56mm and .38/.357. I also was selling them through retailers in the USA. Some of the clients that purchased the product included instructors for several well known US S.W.A.T teams and government operators. Then things went sideways: My suppliers were threatened with a lawsuit by the owners of AccuTec USA which caused us all to take pause, obtain legal advice and proceed accordingly. After much discussion with legal counsel we decided that the threat was baseless and that we were 100% confident that we had the legitimate right to do whatever we wish with the sale of Accutec ammunition as we are not bound by any agreements with Accutec. In the end we were right and we secured a release from AccuTec’s legal counsel, Nexsen Pruet LLC Intellectual Property Attorneys. Accordingly, we are now ready to sell of the last remaining civilian accessible stock of Accutec bullets available anywhere in the world. When this supply is gone, it will only be in the hands of government agencies and foreign powers that have signed agreements with the manufacturer. We have remaining: 5.56mm 87gr Projectiles .40 caliber / 10mm 180gr Projectiles .45 caliber 230gr Projectiles 9mm 124gr Projectiles The packages of the above are sold in bulk plastic bags that range in size from 250 count to 500 count packages. The pricing is as follows: .40, .45 and 9mm @ $0.40 per projectile plus freight. (and they are heavy, so minimum freight charge is $30.00) 5.56mm @ $0.80 per projectile plus freight. (and they are heavy, so minimum freight charge is $30.00) ***Note, I have only 6000 pieces left of 5.56mm so preference will be given to the larger order of this very rare commodity*** Each order will include a copy of the letter from Accutec’s attorney’s stating that they are legitimate product of Accutec.

Norcross Customs, I will make you a completely custom holster with your input from the ground up. The process starts by determining the style of carry that suits you as an individual.

Kahr's attention to detail, use of the finest materials, and employment of the most precise manufacturing methods gives you value, unmatched at any price.  Several U.S. Patents cover Kahr's unique locking, firing, and extraction systems. The incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a cam to both unlock the passive safety and finish cocking and releasing the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.  Kahr's patented ""offset barrel"" design places the trigger mechanism beside the barrel lug, raising the shooter's hand close to the center line of the bore. This, with the ergonomically designed grips, results in a remarkable degree of shooting comfort and control with reduced muzzle flip and felt recoil.  A patented self-cleaning extractor, specially designed so that powder residue is forced away from the extractor, assures that the extractor will continue to function, shot after shot. Furthermore, the extractor is designed so that it employs the slide itself to limit its movement so that failures to extract are nearly impossible.  These innovations, found only in the Kahr pistol, give the Kahr shooter an advantage in critical self-defensive situations. The Kahr design and its quality manufacturing provide unmatched value in a compact handgun, especially important when your life depends on it.

Kahr's attention to detail, use of the finest materials, and employment of the most precise manufacturing methods gives you value, unmatched at any price.  Several U.S. Patents cover Kahr's unique locking, firing, and extraction systems. The incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a cam to both unlock the passive safety and finish cocking and releasing the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.  Kahr's patented ""offset barrel"" design places the trigger mechanism beside the barrel lug, raising the shooter's hand close to the center line of the bore. This, with the ergonomically designed grips, results in a remarkable degree of shooting comfort and control with reduced muzzle flip and felt recoil.  A patented self-cleaning extractor, specially designed so that powder residue is forced away from the extractor, assures that the extractor will continue to function, shot after shot. Furthermore, the extractor is designed so that it employs the slide itself to limit its movement so that failures to extract are nearly impossible.  These innovations, found only in the Kahr pistol, give the Kahr shooter an advantage in critical self-defensive situations. The Kahr design and its quality manufacturing provide unmatched value in a compact handgun, especially important when your life depends on it.  The development of the Kahr handgun involved numerous testing sessions during which 10,000 rounds of ammunition were fired through a single Kahr pistol.

Kahr's attention to detail, use of the finest materials, and employment of the most precise manufacturing methods gives you value, unmatched at any price.  Several U.S. Patents cover Kahr's unique locking, firing, and extraction systems. The incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a cam to both unlock the passive safety and finish cocking and releasing the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.  Kahr's patented ""offset barrel"" design places the trigger mechanism beside the barrel lug, raising the shooter's hand close to the center line of the bore. This, with the ergonomically designed grips, results in a remarkable degree of shooting comfort and control with reduced muzzle flip and felt recoil.  A patented self-cleaning extractor, specially designed so that powder residue is forced away from the extractor, assures that the extractor will continue to function, shot after shot. Furthermore, the extractor is designed so that it employs the slide itself to limit its movement so that failures to extract are nearly impossible.  These innovations, found only in the Kahr pistol, give the Kahr shooter an advantage in critical self-defensive situations. The Kahr design and its quality manufacturing provide unmatched value in a compact handgun, especially important when your life depends on it.  The development of the Kahr handgun involved numerous testing sessions during which 10,000 rounds of ammunition were fired through a single Kahr pistol. Each Kahr model has been extensively tested to assure the reliability, function, accuracy and safety of each component and of the final product. Any change in design has been rigorously tested to ensure absolute functioning.  As a result of this exhaustive testing, Kahr has produced the most reliable compact firearm in the world today. We, at Kahr, have total confidence in the durability and long-term reliability of our Kahr pistols.

All parts function as they should…after all it is a COLT!The serial number from Colt for Govt Carbines to be Pre-ban is CG 018500 so you can see this is just over 400 prior.

They don't have the magazine disconnect or loaded chamber indicator that are present on the current Mark III pistols, which makes the trigger better and the Mark II easier to clean. This Ruger is a KMK 10, a stainless steel pistol with a 10 inch bull barrel.  It has been shot but doesn't have a blemish anywhere, it is in great shape.  While thousands of these pistols were made, Ruger no longer has the manufacturing capability to make 10"" barrels for their 22LR pistols.  So while they are definitely not rare, it can be difficult to find them for sale, certainly not looking as good as this pistol does.I prefer to meet face to face, but could also ship this from my FFL to yours."
