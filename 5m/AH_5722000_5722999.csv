Griffin Armament has created a tradition for itself in recent years by being first-to-market with revolutionary concepts packed into quality products at a great value.  The Optimus is the culmination of their efforts to date (though we are still expecting great things out of this company!). The Optimus ships with a number of bells and whistles.  Here is the breakdown:  Serialized tube containing 5 removable baffles Pistol booster (Nielsen Device) with one piston 9mm (.38”) and 5.56mm (.22”) End Caps Interior “Retaining” Cap Taper Mount “Rifle Extension Tube” Rifle Blast Baffle Griffin Taper Mount Minimalist Brake Shim Kit  It is also compatible with the following Griffin Mounting solutions. Sold separately.  Revolution 3 Lug Coupler Assembly Revolution 3 Lug Adapters Taper Mount Direct Thread Adapter Revolution Fixed Barrel Adapter  By changing out mounting hardware and endcaps, the Optimus can be configured to shoot many different calibers on a wide variety of hosts.  It is rated (in full size configuration) to .300 WinMag and will work on any lesser rifle round.  Drop a 3-lug coupler or Revolution Fixed Barrel Adapter onto it in the short configuration and you can still run it on 5.56 or .300 BLK (these calibers obviously also work in the full size as well).  Drop the booster system into it and you are ready to rock on any 9mm semi-auto handgun.  Since it is also user-serviceable, you can run it on rimfire hosts as well!  Direct thread, Taper Mount or 3-lug; the Optimus will work in either large or small configurations on any rimfire caliber host platform."

The Compact Sportsman 20 gauge will chamber 2 3/4 and 3-inch shotshells and comes with a fast-handling 21-inch vent rib barrel with a single bead sight and is equipped with our interchangeable Rem™ Choke System. Modified choke tube is supplied. The compact model of the 11-87 sportsman field came out in 2008. Remington no longer makes the compact model for the field, only their black synthetic. So this gun is unique of its kind. This shotgun has seen many great adventures and has always been true and loyal.Why we are selling this great gun: We are a nonprofit organization where fathers and sons connect with each other while camping out and shooting guns. Skeet-shooting has been our main activity over the years and we have absolutely loved these compact 11-87's because they are super reliable and lots of fun to shoot. However, since our NPO is expanding, we are selling these guns to purchase new rugged synthetic 870s to withstand our growth and heavy use of shooting. We want to preserve the beauty of these magnificent shotguns by not overkilling them on the ranges. Since these guns have seen many great outings, the original wood finish has started to dull and scuff with a few minor scratches to the wood finish as well.  We would love to get $395 for this beautiful gun, but are willing to reasonably negotiate. We believe these have been priced fairly based on what other guns of its type are being sold for, and on the account that the 11-87 sportsman field compacts are harder to come by.  Please Text or email anytime for legitimate questions or inquiries. If you would like to call, we ask that you call between the hours of 12pm and 6pm M-F.

It must be chambered in .45ACP and the SDP model (pistol version). I do not want to pay extra for a SB15 (or other AR-esque) brace, but the actual Vector PSB would be nice. I would also prefer a GEN 2, but will consider GEN 1 so long as it is newer or the internals have been updated to fix the early issues. I have cash on-hand and can travel within a couple of hours for a good deal. I am not against doing a dealer transfer so long as it's a reasonable price. Not to sound like a jerk, but I should say this up front: BudsGunShop.com lists new .45 SDPs at $1,122 plus tax with free shipping. Please take this into consideration with your asking price for a used one. I can add some cash for the proper brace, adapter, or magazines, but the firearm itself is no longer $1,600+.**ARMSLIST requires I enter a price. Do not think of it as a fixed number.**"

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. A further evolution of the 75 B Ω, the new Convertible version allows users to swap from decocker to safety operation in the same manner as the popular P-07/P-09 pistols. Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials to enhance durability, operation life and reliability.        SPECIFICATIONS   CZ 75 B Ω Urban Grey Suppressor-Ready (Omega)"

This top-quality barrel connects directly to the upper receiver through a robust 4-Bolt Connection System with a patent pending barrel extension resulting in increased stability, better accuracy, and reduced weight. Ambidextrous controls make operating the .308 Ambush comfortable and convenient for both right- and left-handed shooters. You can easily drop the magazine, release the bolt, or operate the safety selector from either side of the receiver. The charging handle is ambidextrous as well and also user-configurable—you can set up either side of the charging handle with a larger or smaller handle to accommodate magnified optics or iron sights for a snag-free setup. The water-transfer printing process (also known as hydro-graphics) of this finish makes for a durable, uniform coating that holds up to and resists even the harshest environments. The Ambush is fed with an optimized bolt carrier group featuring a redesigned geometry and a new extremely slick, low-friction coating to ensure smooth, reliable feeding. As a sportsman, you have an obligation to take clean shots on your game, and a crisp 2-Stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) Trigger gives you the advantage you need to deliver a precise, on-target shot that’ll bring down that elusive trophy you worked so hard to get in your sights.BRAND NEW IN BOX!MAP PRICING RESTRICTION!

Minor cosmetic blemishes from normal wear.

The 9.0's length stops just past a carbine-length gas block, providing true free-float. Our two-pin proprietary barrel nut system with its locking anti-slip plate, sets LaRue handguards apart from the competition. Once properly installed, there is no chance of movement whatsoever. The side and bottom rails are tucked closer to the barrel, keeping the profile narrower and more streamlined. LaRue handguards also include integral QD sling-swivel sockets at the base of each side for convenient mounting 2-point slings. Additionally, our Free-float Rail system provides an excellent heat-sinking feature that pulls throat-damaging heat away from the chamber area. Another heat-sinking benefit is the elimination of pressure-spikes, which some feel is the cause of a large part of pre-mature bolt failures.Comes complete with Allen wrench, vial of blue Locktite and Instructions."

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****   Springfield Armory designed a very unique 1911 TRP pistol, the Legend Series, with a carefully chosen set of features that model some of the same attributes Chris Kyle insisted on for his personal pistol. It features a five-inch stainless steel match grade barrel, low-profile three-dot Tritium combat sights, and black and gray G10 grips with an attractive American flag engraving. The frame and slide is constructed from a forged carbon steel with Black Nitride treatment for durability and corrosion resistance. A National Match full-length guide rod rounds out the 8.6-inch long government model 1911. This pistol ships with one seven-round stainless steel magazine with slam pad, a commemorative mahogany display case, pure silver Chris Kyle limited edition challenge coin, Springfield Armory certificate of authenticity, and a copy of Chris’s book, American Sniper, personally autographed by Taya Kyle. In partnership with the Chris Kyle Foundation and the Kyle family, Springfield Armory® has introduced the Limited Edition Chris Kyle TRP™ Operator® as a part of the Legend Series of pistols. A portion of the sales proceeds will provide direct support to the Chris Kyle FROG Foundation. Why the TRP™? While in combat, Chris chose the Springfield Armory® TRP™ for its reliable performance and toughness. In his best-selling book, American Sniper, he credits the TRP™ with saving his life. “In 2004, I bought a Springfield TRP™ Operator®, which used a .45 caliber round. It had a 1911 body style, with custom grips and a rail system that let me add a light and laser combo. Black, it had a bull barrel and was an excellent gun – until it took a frag for me in Fallajuh. I was actually able to get it repaired – those Springfields are tough.” AUCTION FOR SERIAL #0001 AT NRA ANNUAL MEETING 2016 Springfield Armory® placed the first Legend pistol on the auction site GunBroker.com on May 1, 2016. Thanks to the support and generosity of gun enthusiasts across the country, the unique pistol’s bid price quickly skyrocketed from $500 to over $20,000. Fortunately for other Springfield Armory® TRP™ enthusiasts, there are 999 other Legend Series pistols available now at gun stores across the country. The Legend Series pistols feature five-inch stainless steel match grade barrels, low-profile three-dot Tritium combat sights, and black and gray G10 grips with an attractive American flag engraving. The slides are forged carbon steel with Black Nitride treatment for durability and corrosion resistance. A National Match full-length guide rod rounds out the 8.6-inch long government model 1911.

The TRP standard line is designed around the same specifications as the FBI contract pistol, the TRP-PRO model. The Springfield TRP offers nearly the same performance and features as the TRP-PRO model at a fraction of the cost. From its fully checkered front strap and mainspring housing, to its durable stainless steel finish, this gun can only be described as a knock out value. The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission. Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.   We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $1345.

The SRS-A1 Covert is desgined around the core components of accuracy with super ergonomics. The use of aircraft grade materials and ultra high strength steel creates an extremely durable and lightweight sytem.  Accurate  Designed with the same accuracy components as the SRS-A1, the Covert holds the same guarantee of the 1/2 MOA or better accuracy at 100 yards for 3 shots using DT ammunition. The SRS-A1 Covert uses conversion kits with fast-twist barrels to optimize accuracy for both subsonic and full-power ammunition.  Compact  The SRS-A1 Covert is the shortest sniper rifle in the world with a overall length of just 27 inches. At over a foot shorter than traditional sniper rifles, the Covert adds a new level of concealability in a full-power sniper rifle that gives up no capability.  Convertible  The SRS-A1 Covert uses their patented quick caliber conversion feature. With the ability to change calibers in sixty seconds, operators have the option to fire suppressed subsonic ammunition or full power standard ammunition with MOA accuracy. The Covert also accepts full-length SRS-A1 conversion kits in all calibers providing snipers full size rifle flexibility.  Features  Recoil Pad: The recoil pad is raised to position the shooter's shoulder above the bore line in order to minimze muzzle rise and the pad is soft enough to allow long strings of fire with large magnum cartridges like the 338LM. Adjustable Length of Pull: Users can quickly adjust length of pull by adding or removing multiple 1/2 inch spacers with their proprietary lever locking system. Monopod: Their patent-pending monopod is the fastest actuating device of its kind. Just pull down on the knurled thumb wheel to engage the spike for rapid elevation modification and then spin the wheel right or left for fine adjustment. Telescopic Bolt: Their bolt utilizes a 60 degree bolt throw for fast manipulation. It's collapsible deisgn allows the rifle length to be extremely short. Safety: The ambidextrous safety switch easily actuated from firing position. Match Trigger: The match trigger is adjustable for travel, creep, location, and weight. Barrel Mounting System: Their patented barrel mounting system ensures consistent mounting & return-to-zero repeataiblity. Its five inch locking engagment reduces harmonic barrel whip of a 26"" barrel to that of a 20"" barrel which improves accuracy as a result. Handguard and Accessory Mounting: The free-floated hand-guard has six flush cup sling mounting points to chose from and also allows users to strategically place picatinny rails to optimize mounting of support accessories. Barrel: Stainless steel fluted match barrel. The barrel mounting system utilizes five inches of locking engagement which reduces harmonic barrel whip of a 26"" barrel to that of a 20"" barrel which improves accuracy as a result. Muzzle Devices: Their patented muzzle devices both muzzle breaks and silencers are designed to increase accuracy, shooter recovery, and reduce recoil by 30-40%. Accuracy is improved becuase their designs immediately strip excess gases away from projectiles.

The magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard, which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves. A decocking lever is on the left side, which will silently lower the cocked hammer. The MK 23 is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable Laser Aiming Module (LAM), a suppressor, and some other features such as a special high-pressure match cartridge (.45 +P ammunition).[8]The firearm was tested and found to be capable of firing tens of thousands of rounds without a barrel change.[10] It remains reliable in harsh conditions, making it suitable for use by special forces. The .45 ACP round has considerable stopping power and yet is subsonic, making it suitable for use with a suppressor."

They sell for an average of $200.00 each on EBAY.This is a lot of 18 vintage Weatherby ""Premier"" riflescopes primarily in 3-9x40mm although two of them are 2.75x40mm. These were made between 1972 and 1983 by Asia Optical in Japan. These were Weatherby's top-of-the-line scopes, and were as fine a hunting implements as could be found. These are not from china, they were made on contract by one of Japan's finest optical factories, the equal of any in Europe. They are handsome and durable. There are 4 or 5 that look like they are ready to go but they may need cleaning or work as well. I am selling the whole lot as for parts or repair as some or all may need parts or repair. I would suggest a handy optics repair man or aspiring one buys them. No promises here.As you can see there are spare lenses, glass, parts, etc... as well.These scopes can still be serviced or repaired if need be. ABO (USA), INC. in Miami florida services them. I believe they do a full tune for around $65.00. Some have said these scopes compare to the scopes of today that cost in the $1000.00 range. You know its great quality if it has the Weatherby name on it. The tube diameter is 1 inch on these."
