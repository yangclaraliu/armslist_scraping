Please feel free to text REDACTEDWe are a local FFL.Beretta® uses a reliable tilt-breech system on the PX4 Storm Sub-Compact Semi-Auto Pistol to keep it as slim and lightweight as possible, as opposed to the rotating barrel design used on the full-sized PX4 Storm. The tilt-breech system works to dissipate the recoil in the web of the hand and reduce muzzle rise. The PX4 Sub-Compact semi-automatic pistol shoots in either double or single action mode, and is equally suited for concealed carry, home defense, and recreational shooting. The Sub-Compact PX4 Storm features a lightweight, corrosion resistant, fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame that includes an integral Picatinny rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser sights. Interchange backstraps allow a perfect fit to any sized hand; the PX4 Storm has an ambidextrous slide lock and safety, and the magazine release is reversible. The slide has a durable Bruniton™ non-reflective black finish that provides superior corrosion resistance, ideal for concealed carry use where the firearm can be exposed to perspiration on a daily basis. The gun's stainless steel barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance. 3-dot sights provide quick target acquisition, and both front and rear sights are dovetailed into the slide, allowing user to easily change them with after market night sights. The Beretta PX4 Storm Sub-Compact Semi-Auto Pistol uses a double-stacked magazine with a hinged baseplate for the pinky, if needed. Full-sized PX4 Storm magazines can also be used with the sub-compact model. Comes with 2 magazines."

These guns have been cut down to a barrel length of 19 inches and an OAL of 27.5 inches, measuring at the absolute shortest point. They are completely legal in the same way a pistol grip only pump shotgun is and are not subject to ATF restrictions or NFA rules. These two are single shots in 12 gauge and .410. The 12 gauge is an H&R, the .410 is an off brand Japanese gun which I have been unable to find any information on. Mechanically the 12 is in excellent condition, it is missing its trigger guard and the polymer where it used to be is a bit rough but no issues firing and the wood is very nice. The .410 is a bit different, it works fine but its rough and definately seen better days with a patina on the barrel. They're both fun guns to shoot, the .410 being much easier to fire single handedly for obvious reasons. I'm just trying to cut down on my collection at the moment and no longer need them. They make amusing novelties, conveniantly short self-defense tools, and might be fun gunsmithing projects, the .410 would be an excellent cheap gun to tinker with or refinish.Asking $100 for the 12 gauge and $80 for the .410. Will do both for $160 OBO. Cash, local sale in Tallahassee. More pictures available upon request.I'm more than willing to consider trades for ammunition, primarily 5.56 although anything else just ask me, worst I can say is no thanks."

Though I've not seen the XCR as much in the U.S., the rifle is very popular in Canada, while distribution in the US, seems to be more limited.  In those areas of the U.S. where consumers have been able to use and learn about the XCR, there seems to be many happy owners.  The XCR's piston driven platform is extremely reliable, easy to clean and maintain, and very accurate.  The XCR has a folding stock, a quick change barrel system with conversion kits for .300 BLK and other calibers available. Unlike the ACR however, the XCR is not made of polymer but rather is made entirely of metal, including the very rugged and tough FAST stock.  The XCR has a monolithic rail system as the upper reciever and the forend/handguard are a continuous single piece.  I have owned this rifle since late 2013 and have put somewhere between 500-750 rounds down range with it.  As mentioned above, this rifle comes equiped with the FAST Stock as shown in the pictures, however I also purchased the ACE Skeleton stock for the XCR and this second stock is also included.  Though the skeleton stock is lighter, I personally prefer the FAST stock, which I find to be superior to the various stocks that are available for the SCAR or ACR.  The FAST stock not only extends to one of six positions, but it also has an adjustable cheek riser.  The r rifle's trigger has also been upgraded with Robinson's 2-stage match trigger which provides a pull weight of 3.5 lbs with a 2 lb. first stage and a 1.5 lb. second stage.  Relative to the 5.5 lb. single stage stock trigger, this upgrade greatly improves accuracy and rate of fire.  The stock single stage trigger is also included.  Another upgrade that I've added is the compensator/muzzle brake, which mitigates muzzle rise.  Finally, the stock pistol grip has been upgraded with a Hogue rubber pistol grip and I have added Magpul ""Pro Gen 3 flip-up backup sights.  The total value of these extras and upgrades is just over $600.  The rifle has a quad rail system, (though you'll notice in the pictures that I have rail covers over the rails), and a 16"" chrome lined barrel.  I have plenty of additional pictures so please let me know if you'd like to see them or if you'd like to check this rifle out in person. Included with Purchase: Robinson XCR-L in 5.56 Robinson FAST Stock ACE Skeleton Stock Robinson 5.5 lb.

Basically new Remington 700 VSF 22-250. Stainless fluted barrel. Black synthetic stock. Adjustable trigger....this thing is CRISP. This rifle has been fired 20 times. It punches the same hole without a second thought. Has dual swivels on the stock for bipod and sling attachment. Mounted on the gun is a Vortex Diamondback HP 4-16x42. Scope also has removable sun shade. Great for daytime hunting. Crystal clear. Butler creek flip up scope covers. On the stock of the gun is a Blackhawk cheek pad with ammo storage and a zipper pocket for a yardage card or knife. And finally a camo sling. Nothing special but it does have a thumb hole for when you walk. I bought everything in February. Sighted it in and hunted with it once, It's a tack driving beast.  Otherwise it's sat in the safe. I know what it's worth so my price is firm. Only trade considered would be for a nice AR with a free floated handguard but I will let you know if I'm interested. Send offer and detailed description and I'll give you an answer. No I don't need help selling, no I'm not interested in pistols. Cash price is $1,000 firm.transaction will occur at the Lees summit police department, or at frontier justice. If you would like to go through and ffl that is fine but it will be on your dime. Missouri ID required.text at REDACTED"

The hammer forged barrel made from proprietary cannon grade steel. Its polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The trigger has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP uses HK s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels accommodating all hand sizes. A unique VP feature is HK s patented charging supports simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. This pistol has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. It ships with three 15 round magazines."

The shotgun comes with a hard carry case.  Price is absolutely firm at $750.  You can't touch one of these for under $1200 these days.  I won't accept a penny less.  Please, serious buyers only.  No trades!   I will send photos to anyone interested.   I will do meets at Jays Sporting Goods in Clare Michigan only.  Zip code is 48617."
