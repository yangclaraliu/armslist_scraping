For sale or trade is a STI Ranger II 1911 chambered in 9mm.  This is a commander length 1911 and comes with the original box and two magazines.  STI is known for their quality and the 9mm chambering offers an option for those love the feel of a 1911 but don't particularly care for the recoil of a .45 ACP.  This would make an excellent carry gun.  A set of Hogue grips will also be included with the pistol.  STI firearms are made in Texas and they are known not only for their excellent quality but for their outstanding customer service as well.  The only reason I'm letting this go is the 9mm just isn't for me as I prefer either 10mm or .45ACP.  I prefer to sell this outright as I have my eye on something but I would consider trades as well. I'm wanting to move the pistol this week and I'll take a look at all cash offers.

The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip. The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16” barrel. The DEFIANCE KRISS Stock provides a wide range of adjustment and length of pull. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine.

This is a once mounted Accupoint 1-6. Here's the model and stats: https://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=TR25-C-200089Illumination is provided by a dimmable fiber optic and in total darkness is supplied by tritium just like the ACOGs. The glass is incredible with a forgiving eye box and generous eye relief. The reticle is simple, fine, and very precise. This thing shines at 6x. The dot seems a little dim in most situations, but once you start putting rounds down range, you realize it's pretty much perfect. As the sun gets brighter, so does the dot. I put this side by side with the Vortex Razor to compare the glass and it's shockingly close. If you're picky about your glass and over worrying about batteries or electronics, this scope is a dream come true. It comes with everything is came with originally and a blank warranty card so it's all yours. This has less use than most ""new"" floor models. Mount is not included."

This gives the functionality of a 1x reflex sight and the ability to reach out to the effective range of a 5.56 without sacrificing the handling of your rifle. Fantastic for competition and also for anything scenario where you'd have to carry your rifle for any significant period of time. All the functionality with none of the drawbacks. With a push button brightness control and an auto shutoff/motion wake function, this scope has all the features while still being as simple to operate as it gets. Useful drop compensation in the reticle and fantastic glass. Also one of the best 1x I've seen on a variable power scope. This is a beast at close quarters."

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****   Henry’s new Wildlife Edition rifle comes with an engraved brass receiver and octagonal barrel. Whether you need a hard-hitting rifle capable of fast repeat shots in the bear country of Alaska or a light rifle for deer hunting in the mountains of Pennsylvania, Henry’s new Wildlife Edition rifle will provide the accuracy and reliability you can count on. Introduced by the U.S. Army in 1873, this cartridge was first known as the .45 Government. As it made its way into commercially produced firearms the name .45-70 appeared, because it was loaded with a 70 grain blackpowder charge with 405 and 500 grain bullets. Virtually all rifle making companies of the late 19th century chambered their single shots and lever actions for the .45-70. As those companies and their rifles faded away, the .45-70’s popularity did not. Factory .45-70 ammunition has been cataloged continuously since 1873 but never in the variety of loadings available now, in the 21st century. They range from 405 grain lead bullet, low-velocity loads for deer hunting and target shooting to high-velocity 300 to 400 grain jacketed bullet ones meant for large game. The Model H010B .45-70 can handle them all. Its receiver is brass fitted with a 22 in octagon barrel underneath and a tubular magazine of four-round capacity. Its pistol-grip buttstock and steel-capped forend are crafted of beautiful American walnut and cut with checkering to provide a sure grip. The buttstock wears a brass plate.   We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $959.

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****   Ruger is proud to introduce the new 10/22 Classic VI Takedown 22LR. This newest introduction shares all the popular attributes of the 10/22 Takedown line. Readily separated into two subassemblies, the 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger 10/22®. As reliable and accurate as every 10/22, the 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America’s favorite rimfire rifle by your side. The barrel and forend of the 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used. The Ruger Classic VI Takedown features a Deluxe Classic VI Walnut Stock, a Gold Bead Front Sight, and Adjustable Rear.  We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $335.

The Automag III is also called the “flame thrower” for the fire that comes out of the barrel when you shoot!  I have another one of these hand-cannons that I shoot and keep for self-defense – it is an awesome weapon, never jams, extremely powerful (the .30-carbine goes through body armor, cracks engine blocks, etc), never rusts, and the gun with its 6.5 inch barrel is super accurate!  Try a hollow point or soft point 30-carbine load, it packs a wallop!  But, then it should, this is rifle ammunition in a pistol. Go ahead, make Dirty Harry’s day, buy this hand-cannon.
Is my selling price for a NEW, NEVER FIRED AMT Automag III fair?  Look on line, you will see my selling price is less than what others are asking for used Automags!  But don’t take my word for it, see a typical selling price of a used Automag for yourself, go to: https://www.gunsamerica.com/910511780/AMT-IAI-Auto-Mag-III-30-carbine-6-1-2-barrel-original-box-copy-of-manual-1-mag-Millett-adj-site-rar.htm
