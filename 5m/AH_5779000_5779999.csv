THIS MODEL WILL NOT FIT YUGO M-70/N-PAP/O-PAP, KRINKOVS, M92'S, UNCONVENRTED VEPR'S OR UNCONVERTED SAIGAS.
The ALFA RAIL Keymod forend for the standard patten AK gives the look and feel of a more traditional AK forend while giving the ability to mount Keymod accessories and other optional components, all while mouting exactly like the original handguard!
The forend is simply installed like any standard AK handguard and is held in place by the front handguard retainer. An extremely precise and tight fight, in addition to careful design of the interface points with weapon ensures that the mounting is rock solid!
Weighing 3.5 ounces it is actually almost an ounce lighter than the original polymer forend, yet several times stronger! An optional Superlow Optics Mount Upper which weighs only 2 ounces allows you to mount an Aimpoint Micro on its picatnny top rail and have co-witness with the iron sights.
Even better, the ALFA RAIL lower forend will work with the standard polymer or wood upper handguard, or even with an Ultimak railed upper gas tube! Manufactured from solid billets of 6061 T6 aluminum and anodized black the ALFA RAIL upper and lower include instructions and all hardware necessary for installation and are 100% made in the USA."

The M402 is the most compact and efficient suppressor available for the Colt Commando and other short barreled carbines. It is equally at home on SPR-type and precision AR-15/M16 rifles as it has been independently applauded for it's accuracy improving characteristics.
The M402 is built from high nickel steel alloys with a matte black oxide finish. Designed for semiauto and limited full auto fire, the suppressor mounts on the muzzle threads in place of the flash hider. It adds only a little over four inches to the overall length of the weapon and comes with 1/2X28 threads to match most NATO 5.56mm weapons.
Battle tested from Alaska to Afghanistan, sound, flash, and visual signature are reduced greatly with the use of this dimunitive but durable suppressor.

Had 1 magazine shot through it to test and see if I would like it better than my PPQ. I am not too fond of the reset on the trigger but perhaps you won't mind it. It comes with all stock components which include 2 magazines, paper work, back straps, and side straps. It feels very nice in the hand as the P30 is the best grip I have ever held. I am only selling because I cannot shoot the P30 as well as I would like, but I cannot shoot a Glock either so it is more than likely human error. I am selling it at $600.00 firm. If you are interested than please send me an email so we can set up a date and time for the sale."

Every design feature on the SDP Compact Alpha is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The polymer pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Alpha. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.Specifications:- Action: DA/SA with Ambidextrous De-Cocking Lever- Caliber: 9mm- Barrel Length: 3.70""- Barrel Threading: 13.50 x 1 LH- Capacity: 15 Rounds- Magazine Catch: Left/Right (Reversible)- Sight Radius: 5.70""- Sights: Front: Iron Blade with White Dot and Rear: Serrated Fixed- Trigger Pull Weight: SA: 4.0+ lb and DA: 10.0+ lb- Slide Material: Steel- Slide finish: Cerakote- Frame Material: Upper: Milled Aluminum and Lower: Polymer- Frame Finish: Cerakote- Grip: Polymer Including Finger Molds- Interchangeable Inserts: Polymer Base with Rubber Size (Small, Medium, Large)"
