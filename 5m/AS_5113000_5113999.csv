I put this package together for a customer a few weeks back and he had some things come up and wound up not being able to afford it. So now I’m trying to move it to minimize his losses. These guns come from the factory as excellent competition pistols, but I’ve improved this one even more. It came with a 5 inch stainless match ported barrel and ported slide. The performance center trigger was a slight upgrade, but that has been taken to the next level with the Apex Tactical flat-faced aluminum trigger and upgraded internals. This is the closest you’ll get to a match 1911 trigger pull in a polymer gun! I also added Speed Shooters Specialties ESP magwell and corresponding aluminum base pads. This allows for quicker reloads, yet isn’t oversized like most competition setups. All comes in factory hard case with everything as it did from the factory. Again this firearm is FACTORY NEW UNFIRED! His original cost out the door was going to be just over $1200. But now I am only asking $1000 cash or best reasonable offer! All firearm partial trade offers will be evaluated. Blackacre Arms is a FFL licensed shop located in Stanfield, NC. All federal, state and local law applies.

Most Winchester folks say pre 64 guns are the most desirable.  In 1964, Winchester changed many  items in their guns to save costs.  By the late 70s, Winchester listened to their customers and addressed many of the complaints (better wood, machined internal parts, and darker blueing).  Guns over the next years began to again change due to lawyer's (safeties and such). The late 70s Winchesters are considered the best value for use due to their quality and construction.  This gun does have a minimal round count, but because of long term storage without intervention, there is some flaws in the receiver blueing (typical of post 63 Winchesters due to metallurgy).  Blueing on the barrel is perfect.  The walnut has a very nice color and grain. This would be a great gun for someone who wants a low use gun which would be great in the woods or field."

It's a color that mimics Daniel Defense FDE anodizing. It has the brown tone of DD FDE in normal light, while upon closer inspection or in direct spot light has the golden/bronze undertones. Looks fantastic, must see in person to appreciate the resemblance. This rail was used as one of the pieces to prototype the color. With the ""recipe"" complete, this piece is up for sale. Make yourself a very unique looking carbine! Rail itself is in great shape and locks up tight on a Colt 6920 upper. No wobble whatsoever. Only the upper/lower rail and hardware are included; the photos of the Block II build and other items are for color reference only and not included. Price is firm at this time. If you are interested in having your Daniel Defense RIS II (or any other rail) coated, please email me. I am currently charging $85 per rail, and that includes return shipping. Email me for more info.Price is $126 shipped I accept USPS Money Order or PayPal ""gift"", or $120 cash FTF in Bend, ORDisclosure: This is a test piece, not a customer job...so on my way to the oven I clumsily let the lower rail bump into a separate wet part, and it left a few little marks on the lower rail. Not a big deal, you won't even notice it, but it's there if you look closely."

They were acquired in a batch of FN uppers, however, these two are unmarked (no forge code). They have engraved T-Marks identical to my FN uppers. They have no feedramps, so they would be great for an older rifle barrel, or for FNMI A2 barrels for a true M16A4 clone. The receivers were stripped of their anodizing, and Cerakoted in ""Armor Black"" at a 20:1 hardener ratio, making them an ideal match for typical anodized lowers. These are fresh out of the oven. May show some small marks on sharp edges from handling, but otherwise like new, in my opinion.
