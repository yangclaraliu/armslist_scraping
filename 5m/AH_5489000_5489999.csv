Every other chamber has a very slight burn mark from factory test firing and other than that, there is no other distractions on the very beautiful King Cobra. You will not find a better condition 1988 Colt King Cobra than this one as it is as good as factory new but from 1988. Finding a 100% condition King Cobra is difficult these days as they have all been fired and polished up and being sold as NIB when in fact, they are not NIB. The beauty of this King Cobra is very apparent when you look at the pictures. The grips are crisp and the overall finish as 100%. If you have been in the market for a collector grade 1988 Colt King Cobra, this is your Colt. We will say it again, you will never find one better if you looking for mint condition King Cobra. Don’t let this 28 year old NIB Colt King Cobra get passed you and not being placed in your collection. Shipping is $25 to your FFL. Free shipping to all military, veterans and law enforcement.

The first ones were made here in the US at the same plant that made the ones for the military. After the initial run they moved production to Belgium. They came in a Storm case with 2 mags and a Certificate of Authenticity. You dont find these everyday and are very rare.  This is gun 186 of less than 1000 in the world to exist and less than half are Flat Dark Earth. The Limited 17s had 3 digit serial number where the Limited 16s had 7 digit serial number. No record of how many were actually produced and sold. Only the factory round has been fired at the factory and has remained unfired since. If you know Browning/FN guns then you know what you are looking at. I already sold one with a higher serial number. If there are no good offers then i will sell this one to the same person. Thought i would give someone else the chance to buy or trade for this beauty. The price listed isnt the price obviously. Just make an offer and all I can say is no or deal. No ridiculous lowball offers though please. If you dont know what you are looking at dont offer expecting to get it for 2 or 3000 because you cant get a regular scar 17s that they made a million of for that price. Ill entertain multi gun trades or trades plus cash depending what you have even fourwheeler etc. Dont miss this once in a lifetime gun. You won't see another and you certainly wont see one for sale.

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5489998,For Sale:  Black Surefire Mini Scout M300c Series Flashlight,"North Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina",$ 215,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 17, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Selling a Surefire Mini Scout (Black). Solid-state, recoil-proof LED generates 300 lumens. This is a great deal, being that this light typically retails for about $269.99, without the Rear Cap for a pressure switch, which costs about $50 additionaly and that's also without the standards pressure switch pad. In this package the light comes with the standard pressure switch, the Click On/Off Tail Cap, the Rear Cap for the pressure switch and all mounts to any rail. MSRP would put this package over $325, which is what I paid for it. Today I'm pricing this at just under that price (no tax of course). Again, this is a great deal, but also because even though the light was mounted to my rifle, it was never shot while attached. The reason is that I didn't like the look initially when I mounted the light, so I ordered the M300-TN (Tan) instead and quickly dismounted the M300c for the Tan replacement. The Light was purchased only a week ago and is now back in the orginal box. I say all that to prove the light is in Excellent condition. For an additional $35 I'll even throw in the Thorntail Offset Light Mount, depicted in image #2. The Thorntail Offset Light Mount retails at about $50 (you can Youtube it and confirm it's quality) and is an excellent Picatinny rail mount that has been made specifically for the Surefire M-Series Tactical Lights, made by a high quality brand and company, Haley Strategic.  I'm only interested in serious buyers. No trades, no shipping deliveries. Only cash."
