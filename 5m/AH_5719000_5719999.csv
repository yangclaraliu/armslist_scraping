The upper receiver features a cold-hammer-forged, chrome-moly, medium-contour steel barrel. Measuring 16.1 inches long, the barrel has a 1-in-8-inch twist and a 5.56mm NATO chamber with M4 feed ramps. It also has 1/2×28 threading for adding suppressors and comes with a standard flash suppressor.The upper also features a chrome-plated bolt carrier with a properly staked gas key. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance. Built from 9310 steel, the bolt has been shot-peened and magnetic-particle (MP) inspected. The upper includes an ejection port cover, a forward assist and a brass deflector. The front sight is milled with a serrated rear ramp to cut down on glare. This sight sits at the standard A2 height, so it works with any rear sight, and a quick-detach (QD) sling flush cup is included on the bottom—a really nice touch. Ruger also includes a windage-adjustable, flip-up Rapid Deploy rear sight. The A2-style forend, made from heat-resistant, glass-filled nylon, is attached to the upper using a modified delta ring. Simply unscrew the ring and any M4-compatible handguard can be added—no tools are necessary.The mil-spec, six-position buffer tube holds an M4-style collapsible buttstock. Ruger has also outfitted the lower receiver with an ergonomic pistol grip and an enlarged trigger guard. The single-stage trigger is crisp and predictable, with minimal crunch and creep and no over travel. It should meet any duty requirements. The quality of my test rifle was apparent immediately after pulling it out of the box. There is nothing about this rifle that screams compromise. In fact, it is as well built as many rifles that cost twice as much."

The high level overview is this frame is designed as an 80% frame, and includes all the necessary end mill bits and drill bits, along with the Jig to assist completing your pistol project accurately. Most people use a drill press with a cross vise to mill out the product, many folks have drill presses sitting in their garages, or can find someone who has one available to borrow. The frame accepts Glock17  9mm slides, as well as the Glock 40 caliber slide. The Smith and Wesson 40cal slide is also compatible with the Sig357 barrel configuration, which essentially gives you 3 different calibers to choose from. Unlike the Glock, this frame includes a uniquely extended beaver-tail, and most notably a super tactical 1911 pistol grip rather than the standard glock styled pistol grip. Even better, this pistol grip includes a built in flared magwell for speed loading. This feature will surely be a favorite amongst competition shooters who require speed and accuracy. Finally, the areas that need to be milled out to complete this project include:   The barrel bridge   The top rails of the receiver   The slide guide rails    Once completed, you insert the custom locking block which comes with the kit, it provides additional metallic rails up front.
