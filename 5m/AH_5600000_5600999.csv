I prefer to keep sights in the ready position, not folded. By having the both sights mounted in this manner, it allows both sights to slightly fold forward during concealed weapon retrieval (like from under a vehicle seat), instead of possibly getting caught on a object, that could hinder rapid retrieval. If the purchaser would prefer the sights to be mounted in the traditional manner, I'm more than happy to take the 60 seconds to change them around to any position you prefer. *********"

Patton referred to as: "" the greatest battlefield implement ever devised."" She was originally purchased through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.The rifle is chambered in the venerable 30-06 cartridge. The SA barrel dates to 4-55. The SA rifle serial number dates to 1955 as well. That, along with like condition and Patina, suggests the barrel is original to the gun. The serial number will be given upon phone conversation only. There are no visible import marks. The stainless gas seal is the only area exhibiting any significant wear. Rust is non-existent, nor are there any signs of major battle scars. Normal wear is minimal for the time frame. The stock is a post WWII Overton Stock with evidence of a faint DOD cartouche stamp. The barrel is shiny and remains accurate. The rifle functions wonderfully and is accompanied by 5 en bloc clips. The rifle wears an OD nylon sling, befitting of the time period in both use and appearance. The weapon has the normal matching of the major US manufacturers parts of that time:Receiver- SABarrel- 4-1955Trigger Group- International Harvester Op Rod- SA Bolt- Harrington and RichardsonSights (SA). The sights are in excellent mechanical condition and show minimal wear. They remain audible, tactile and precise on the firing line.Stock- OvertonME- 2Do not have a chamber guage, but throat wear is minimal. Casing test shows a solid 1/8"" of the top of the casing, so it's definitely not ""swallowing"" it. The pkg. will come with 5 En Bloc Clips & a Hard Carry Case.*Numerous additional photos and videos upon request."

I feel it should be done. My M600 TrackingPoint rifle has become a safe queen and that does her a disservice. She is meant to be fired and I just don't have the time anymore with the new job. She is in immaculate condition. I take care of my weapons. The only mark on her is where the spent casings eject.The TrackingPoint rifles are built on Daniel Defense weapon system with the Precision Guided Firing system installed. This baby has put 6 shots within sub-MOA accuracy standard easily. I have set her to .1 MOA and handed her to my wife, who had never shot a rifle before, gave her 5 minutes explanation on the controls and she put 5 shots under a quarter at 100 yards. She is advertised to be that accurate up to 550 yards but I have only been able to test it at 450yards so far. I can not emphasize enough that this weapon absolutely delivers as advertised. The Rifle allows you to connect your smartphone and or/tablet in order to see the scope view as well. Everytime you tag a target the scope records the shot and downloads to your smart device. Pretty cool when showing people what you are doing or a cool shot you made when telling friends later.The rifle will come with the weapon itself, 4 batteries and charger (holds two at a time), 2 20 rd mags, 70 rounds of TrackingPoint ammo (5.56 69gr open tipped match grade), and 340rds of Gorilla Ammo (223REM 69gr Open tipped match grade) and the coup de grace....Recon Jet Shooting glasses. The Recon Glasses have the ShotGlass app installed and allows you to view through the TrackingPoint scope in the viewer on the glasses. I JUST received the glasses and have done nothing more than charge them and turn them on and look through it. Haven't even gotten them to the range yet lol. Standard price for the rifle is $9995.00 and the glasses are $995.00.I will let the entire thing go for 8k but I am negotiable. I primarily want cash but I am open to trades. Only trades I am interested in are pistols for defense. Glock, M&P, H&K VP9. I took a lot of pictures but it is only letting me load one. Email me for more pics if needed."

The only mark on her is where the spent casings eject.The TrackingPoint rifles are built on Daniel Defense weapon system with the Precision Guided Firing system installed. This baby has put 6 shots within sub-MOA accuracy standard easily. I have set her to .1 MOA and handed her to my wife, who had never shot a rifle before, gave her 5 minutes explanation on the controls and she put 5 shots under a quarter at 100 yards. She is advertised to be that accurate up to 550 yards but I have only been able to test it at 450yards so far. I can not emphasize enough that this weapon absolutely delivers as advertised. The Rifle allows you to connect your smartphone and or/tablet in order to see the scope view as well. Everytime you tag a target the scope records the shot and downloads to your smart device. Pretty cool when showing people what you are doing or a cool shot you made when telling friends later.The rifle will come with the weapon itself, 4 batteries and charger (holds two at a time), 2 20 rd mags, 70 rounds of TrackingPoint ammo (5.56 69gr open tipped match grade), and 340rds of Gorilla Ammo (223REM 69gr Open tipped match grade) and the coup de grace....Recon Jet Shooting glasses. The Recon Glasses have the ShotGlass app installed and allows you to view through the TrackingPoint scope in the viewer on the glasses. I JUST received the glasses and have done nothing more than charge them and turn them on and look through it. Haven't even gotten them to the range yet lol. Standard price for the rifle is $9995.00 and the glasses are $995.00.I will let the entire thing go for 7k but I am negotiable. I primarily want cash but I am open to trades. Only trades I am interested in are pistols for defense. Glock, M&P, H&K VP9. I took a lot of pictures but it is only letting me load a couple. Email me for more pics if needed."
