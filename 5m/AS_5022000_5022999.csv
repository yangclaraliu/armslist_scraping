Magpul items in picture are NOT included but are available for a reasonable price.

Updated to reflect my bottom dollar price. Please bear in mind the fact that this rifle has never been fired, has a piston upper and is a factory built rifle from a reputable manufacturer (not pieced together by someone who may or may not have experience doing so, or done so with parts that may or may not be ideal). If you want a cheaper rifle please go buy a DPMS for $700 plus FFL fees or tax, and have fun cleaning it because it won't be a piston uppered rifle (...and you'll still have a DPMS, hopefully you won't have the problems that come with some of them).

Rifle:

Adams Arms factory rifle. Never fired. This is a pretty straight forward well built AR-15. Adjustable piston upper, nitride/melonite (not chrome lined) barrel, 5.56 chamber (1:7 twist). Beyond thatâ¦ what you see is what you get. $750, firm.

Rifle has a small ding in the shell deflector from an incident while putting another gun in the safe. Ding is slight but I wanted to mention it. It is common for people to put soft Velcro in the shell deflector to keep it from wearing. Doing so would hide the ding.

Magpul goodies (available for extra):

 Hello Everyone, 
This listing is for an unfired Entry Level AR15. This is from my private collection and I would keep it, but I would rather thin out a bit or try something else. This is a PSA Upper with a 16 inch stainless heavy freedom barrel with a 1:7 twist. This comes with a FDE adjustable stock, Magpul forend, stainless buffer, A2 front post, polymer rear flip sight, Two polymer 30rd magazines (one could use a little smoothing out), and a Seekins Billet extended mag release button. This is based on an Anderson Multi cal lower and Anderson parts kit. 
 I would also consider trades on this. Mainly would consider CMR30s, UC-9s, Marlin 357/44 magnum lever guns, Just Right Carbines in 45/9mm, 10/22, etc. Some trades will need boot/extras on your end, some will on mine. Shoot any offers to REDACTED (text only please) and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this.

Some info on the HSM/Berger Trophy Gold line:
HSM teamed with Berger to create their exclusive line of Trophy Gold rifle ammunition, loaded with Berger's premium match grade VLD (Very Low Drag) hunting bullets, offering a load for small, medium and large sized game. Previously only available to those who hand loaded, Berger's VLD hunting bullets have the highest possible ballistic coefficient, which are designed for shots in excess of 300 yards while maintaining excellent close range performance. The VLD's design incorporates a sharp hollow point nose, engineered to penetrate between 2"" and 3"" before expansion begins. After initial expansion, the bullet sheds 40% to 85% of its weight, as shrapnel, into surrounding tissue and organs, creating a devastating wound channel and causing the vast majority of the bullet's energy and hydrostatic shock to be expended throughout the mass of the target animal. The resulting terminal performance and overwhelming knockdown power ensure a quick and humane harvest."

I had a chance at the range this weekend to try one out and was amazed how accurate it was right out of the box just the way it came from S&W. There were three guys there shooting customized Glocks and the S&W was out shooting them 10 to 1. I planned to carry Federal HST ammo in it. Just wandered why most people don't want a 40 S&W? It seems its good enough for the FBI and has no problem droping people in there tracks.

Receiver: SAR 4800 / 1005-SA-48-MATCH, Springfield crest.

All parts are Imbel with matching finish and minimal wear. Bolt/carrier/receiver all matching serial #. Bore is immaculate and it is very accurate.

There is a scope rail professionally installed on the right side of the receiver. It's marked ""MMC Fort Worth Texas"" and the iron sights line up perfectly on top of it. The dust cover can be removed normally. It's rock solid.

Ranges don't allow shotguns or rifles (at least the ones I've talked to don't.)

I have gone shooting in the Wildlife Preserve in the past, but my buddy said he was out there the other day and a ranger drove up and told him to stop shooting targets. I only shoot targets, by the way, to keep up my skills, I plan to use the rifle for home defense, not hunting. (I also have a couple of pistols, never owned a rifle before.)

Just looking for a good out-o-the-way area with a backdrop where the firing won't bother anybody. I always clean up my targets and brass after myself, by the way."

Detachable magazine. 30-06 Springfield. Excellent wood with new lacquer finish and strong checkering. Superb bore, barrel trimmed to 18.5""Â and nicely crowned. Factory buttplate. Detail strip, media blast, and hot black oxide finish. Tapped for scope base or rail. Rear sling stud. This gun was neglected and some pitting developed. I refurbished it and it's a fine rifle now, and would be an excellent lower cost solution for a truck gun and shooter. Â I did not reblue the magazine, magazine release, action release, or safty button.Â The gun cycles exceptionally smooth. I have not personally shot it, having no place to do so. Firing pin strikes a wooden dowel strongly. Note: The original scope base and rings comes with the gun, but they were not blasted and blued. Also included is a Bushnell scope (clear reticle, but scuffed exterior). All of the screws were replaced with new ones. $200 FTF around Raleigh/Durham with legal all laws complied with. Can meet weekdays only, during day time hours."

Overall, very nice/excellent condition, I would say like new condition if it were not for a few dings on the receiver, top left of receiver. 

$1,200 FIRM in cash or higher in trade value.  

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal and the value is there, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now and am needing some tires in the next month or so.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Also, Pmags for both AR-15 and AR-10.

Ammo to help complete a deal in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area or I can ship for $30 more.  Thanks for looking!"

This is the standard model as opposed to the LE model.  This has been my daily carry gun for a few months now but I've opted to go in a different direction.  The HK is extremely accurate and operates flawlessly.  The pistol comes with two BladeTech holsters; one IWB and one OWB.  The OWB is brand new and has never been carried.  The HK also comes with three magazines.  The two holsters and extra mag are a value of almost $150 themselves.  I'm pricing this fairly as I would prefer to sell as opposed to trade.
