Layaway w/ 125.00 Down - 90 Days to Payoff This is a one of a kind survival kit that is designed to get you through the first 24 hours of a horrific catastrophe. The First 24 Kit comes with the Taurus model 617 in .357 Magnum. Having the right tool for the right job makes life a little easier. Having the right tool in a hazardous environment could be a test of survival. Taurus understood this and teamed up with AimPro Tactical to design a short-term security preparation kit to aid citizens in their time of need. The First 24 617 is intended as a survival kit, supporting its owner during the first 24 hours of a disaster by equipping them with basic survival tools. The custom-tuned Taurus 617 with a Black X-COAT finish is the essence of the kit with crucial stopping power and intuitive use. This kit includes two HKS Speed Loaders, great for fast reloading of the revolver. The low profile sights, compact frame and two inch barrel allows a user to conceal carry with ease. The Hogue Mono-grip installed on the 617 offers the control and confidence needed when your life is shaken to its core. The kit is protected with a strong, I-series SKB case. The inside of the kit contains tools that will assist in the first 24 hours of a disaster. The CRKT Sting knife can be used as a self-defense and/or cutting tool. The Brite-Strike® ELPI is a brilliant, 160 lumen pen-sized flashlight, with an on/off/strobe mode which can distract and disorient an attacker. The First 24 also contains Brite-Strike® APALS, which are incredible, waterproof lighting and marking devices with adhesive backings. The APALS have a run time of 80+ hours, can be seen up to ½ mile, and have three modes: fast strobe, slow strobe, and on/off. Fire is an important tool for both mental and physical survival. Therefore, the kit contains a Zippo® Fire Starter that uses a simple flint wheel to spark water resistant, waxed tinder sticks that are included and housed in a waterproof case. This grab-it-and-go kit also comes with six AA Energizer batteries on a SlimLine Caddy, a Suunto compass, a survival blanket and twenty feet of 550 Para cord. All of the items are secured in laser cut foam for exact fitting. Be ready for anything and protect your family, home and yourself with the First 24 kit!

I APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT ITS THE ONLY WAY I CAN SELL THIS IN GOOD CONSCIENCE. PLEASE BE PREPARED TO SHOW A VALID OHIO CCL IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS ITEM. THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING. This is a great opportunity to get two guns in one! This is a lightly used GEN 3 Glock 27 (.40) with tritium night sights. THIS WEAPON HAS FUNCTIONED FLAWLESSLY. It had a custom stippling job done on the blackstrap, finger grooves, trigger guard, and thumb shelves as can be seen in the photos.  In addition, the trigger guard was undercut to allow for a more complete purchase on the weapon for a more secure grip. The stippling was done specifically for concealed carry so it is only on areas that do not contact the skin when carried inside the waistband. This weapon is only being sold because I was given a S&W Shield as a gift and have decided to use it as my backup gun. I have purchased a complete 9mm conversion for this gun which includes a stainless steel Storm Lake match grade barrel, Glock factory 9mm extractor, and ejector. Only the barrel is needed to convert to 9mm. The other parts are only needed if you want additional peace of mind for positive case extraction and ejection when carrying this for defensive purposes. These are very easily changed yourself if you need to. I also installed maritime spring cups and a polished safety plunger to remove the gritty feel of the factory trigger. (I can also sell you the Zev  tech custom fulcrum trigger which I had used,  to replace the factory one if you'd like for an additional $125 - it cost me over $200). The Glock factory .40 barrel has approximately 50 rounds through it while the Storm Lake 9mm barrel has approximately 200 through it.  Below is is a list of all of the features of the gun and installed parts as well as a second list of the additional parts I am including with this sale. THIS IS BEING SOLD AS A COMPLETE PACKAGE (item will be shipped with its original Glock case and all factory paperwork, gun lock, and magazine loader and two Glock 27 magazines in addition to the six Glock magazines listed below)UPGRADES INSTALLED ON THE GUN: (in addition to custom stippling job)Meprolight Tritium Night SightsPolished safety plunger with upgraded springForward located slide release (minimizes accidental thumb releasing the slide during firing)American Flag rear slide plate coverADDITIONAL PARTS INCLUDED WITH THIS SALE TO BE INSTALLED BY PURCHASER AS NEEDEDStorm Lake stainless steel drop in 9mm conversion barrel Tungsten guide rod with captive recoil spring Ghost Inc. 3.5# connectorOriginal non-Maritime spring cupsGlock 9mm ejectorGlock 9mm extractorGlock factory safety plunger and spring(1) Glock 27 .40 cal magazine with +1 extension(1) Glock 27 .40 cal magazine-for a total of (4) .40 cal Glock 27 magazines(1) Glock 26 9mmmagazine with +1 extension(2) Glock 26 9mm magazines with +2 extension(1) Glock 26 9mmcal magazine -for a total of (4) 9mm Glock 26 magazinesTHIS PACKAGE IS WORTH MUCH MUCH MORE THAN I AM ASKING.

I have made a few upgrades to the rifle, for one I had Ryan at FTW Cerakote the barrel black, I also added the Midwest Industries 15"" keymod Handguard, and lastly I topped it off with a Vortex Crossfire ii 6-18x44 scope with p series scope rings.

I have over that invested in this. I may be into certain trades, depending on what you have. May be interested in multiple gun trades or trades plus cash. Mostly interested in tactical weapons.
