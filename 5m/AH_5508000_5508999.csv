This rifle does have the holes in the reciever from the PEM scope mount plugged, and scope number has been struck out in the barrel shank.
For a little History, in WW2 after Germany invaded Russia, the Russian military found thier SVT-40 sniper rifles had accuracy issues. to quickly arm thier front line snipers the Russian started back up production of PEM snipers in 1942, until they had adapted the PU scopes for the mosin nagant snipers in late 1942. 
By the end of WW2 Russia had way too many snipers, so they kept a portion of thier PU snipers, while returning the rest, and older sniper variants back into regular M91/30s

Comes with 2-15rd magazines, box, swappable palm-swells and backstraps. The polymer lower is texturized and a bit more aggresive than a Glock - features ambidexterous paddle style magazine releases and slide locks/catchs for left and righth handed shooters. Has a steel guide rod versus a polymer one and night-sights. The internals slide bearing surfaces and the barrel have been polished to aid in cycling and lessening friction. This gun has the BEST stock striker fired trigger in it's class - and has been broken in a little better for an extremely fine pull.Price for both together is already cheap so please no haggling. Email or text 9one7 2one7 7zero8zero for for pictures/information."

This is a very cool gun but I need the money for other projects. Has a nice light trigger and comes with the leather holster. Not exactly a sniper rifle in terms of accuracy but is great for just plinking or learning on. I'm asking $200 but am flexible on the price. 407-4485"

Also sold with the gun is 818 rounds (yes I counted) of Speer 127 TMJ and FOUR Sig/MEC-GAR mags. This gun is perfect, not a scratch, not a mark, nothing. This pistol started life as an E2 which has the plastic slide on grip that is supposed to be more ergonomic. I preferred the original grip style and purchased the grip panels and screws and converted it. The gun will also come with the original grip if you'd like to change it back. This gun has only 285 rounds through it. (yes I keep track of every round on all the guns I own) I am downsizing the number of calibers I have and shoot .357 the least. This gun is very fun to shoot, especially at night, it throws fireballs. Recoil impulse is mild being a full metal pistol. I owned a Glock in .357 and this Sig recoils about half as much. A really nice pistol to add to the collection.  Price for everything is $900. This is a pretty heavy discount on the ammo and the two extra mags are free.  The price is firm. All local and state laws and regulations will be followed, no exceptions.  Online FOID check, Illinois bill of sale, personal bill of sale, copies of DL's and 72hr waiting period are conditions of this sale.  The only trade im interested in is a new, or like new, Zenith Z5-P plus cash on my end.  Message me with questions.  Thanks for looking."

Shipped with a 6″ barrel, the new shroud is designated the HV6, a heavy vent shroud profile that tames the .357’s recoil very well. The double action trigger is short and relatively light, while the single action is light and crisp. The target-like SA trigger pull made the Dan Wesson revolver a favorite among competitors and hunters, and the tradition continues in the 715. Barrel assemblies and grips are easily swapped by the shooter, and the 715 accepts grips and barrel/shroud assemblies from 15-2 model and newer revolvers. The original Dan Wesson revolver improved on the accuracy and service life of the traditional double action revolver design in a few ways. The tensioned barrel of the DW interchangeable barrel system enhances accuracy, pulling the barrel tight like a guitar string, enabling it to vibrate at the same frequency every time. The forward crane latch, located in front of the cylinder and paired with a rear ball detent helps to ensure proper cylinder/barrel alignment during firing. Superior to the rear locking designs of other revolvers, it adds to the accuracy of the 715. While the tensioned barrel definitely improves accuracy above other revolvers, it’s the consistent cylinder/barrel alignment that contributes most to the accuracy of the design. Additionally, the clockwise-rotating cylinder reduces stress on the crane, since it turns in the same direction the crane locks, prolonging service life and keeping everything tight. The 715’s frame is robust, built to handle the heaviest of factory loads. Each revolver is shipped in a custom Dan Wesson hard case. Patterned after the ever-popular Pistol Pack, each case has compartments for three additional barrel assemblies and factory-supplied barrel wrench kit. The 715 Pistol Pack ships with 4″, 6″ and 8″ barrel lengths."
