The trigger on this rifle is also something i have never experienced in a AR type platform and i have felt just about all the big name drop in trigger names out there. There are so many AR platforms out there that are so much alike but this rifle is still so far ahead of the pack. This rifle is in almost New condition it has seen somewhere in the 200 range round count and shoots like a custom bolt rifle and only has a 16"" barrel. Here is some info on the break down.he PredatOBR 7.62 was designed for those who are searching for a hybrid cross between the standard OBR and PredatAR 7.62x51 Rifles. The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely “broken down” and stored into the optional Rollup Bag and Toolbox. The PredatOBR handguard has a locking stainless steel QD Lever system on each side.

It's a tube fed semi-auto 22L/LR caliber rifle that holds 15 rounds and it was made in the New Haven, Conn factory which shut down in 2006. Model 190 rifles were produced from 1964-1980 but actual production numbers remain unclear because somewhere along the line Winchester lost all the serial number records for this model. This also makes it hard to date a model 190 but I believe this rifle was made sometime in the mid to late 60s. The model 190 Deluxe is quite a bit more rare than the average model 190 because of it's checkered stock and 20 3/4"" barrel. This is the same stock that was offered on the model 290 which was produced from 65-73 and was basically a more expensive ""fancy"" 190. This is a used rifle but it's in quite good shape for it's age and is a great shooting gun that rarely comes out of the safe. It has some minor wear and tear on the barrel and some minor scratches on the stock but nothing major. I believe the white marks are from leaning on my wall the last time I moved my safe and should polish off easily. I'm asking $450 OBO and will ship to FFL, buyer pays all shipping and FFL fees.

Today's X-Bolt rifle inherits the strongest, most note-worthy features of its predecessors. The X-Bolt White Gold model has a Monte Carlo stock. This feature is recognized as the comb steps sharply down toward the heel of the buttstock, allowing more contact between the recoil pad of the stock and the shooter's shoulder. With this design, the recoil of the fired shell comes directly back or in-line with the stronger part of the inner shoulder, making the rifle more pleasant to shoot, especially when a long day at the range is expected."

You can also still shoot in semi mode, and the safetey still functions as normal. These bad Larrys sell for $400 and we charge $75 to fit them.

Both bbl sets are dated May 1939, and are serialized to the receiver. One bbl set is 16ga over 16ga measuring 28"" long, and the other is 16ga 0ver 8mm Mauser measuring 25.5"" long. This gun has been used and hunted with, and shows signs of use. Recoil pad has been replaced many years ago, which leads me to think the finish has at least been added to, if not refinished at some point in it's life. Finish is thinning is spots. Photos do not correctly show color of bluing - it is much darker in reality, but is also thinning some in spots, and shows light freckling in places. Not rust, but dark spots..... Case hardening colors have also faded to the point they are all but gone, except in hidden areas. Stock also has a few small dings, but no cracks or breaks. Somewhere in time the scope also took a hard left and disappeared. On the up side, bores are perfect, action locks up like a tank, and this gun should offer many more decades of use. Photos will show that the shotgun chambers are 2 3/4"" - that is incorrect. they are chambered for 2 1/2"" shells but someone measured the chamber and determined it was 2 3/4"" long, but that is the distance to the begining of the forcing cone. Markings were applied here as the Germans would have marked it in millimeters. Do NOT fire 2 3/4"" shells in this gun or pressures will rise significantly. I will stick a couple photos in the listing, but I can give you a link to a photobucket folder with many photos. Not able to poste a link here."

I have a LNIB Walther PPS M2 LE edition for sale. The LE version comes from the factory with phosphorescent glow sights and an extra 8 round magazine. This is the newly redesigned Walther PPS. I feel that Walther did a wonderful job with the M2 model of the venerable PPS line. The grip is more ergonomic than the m1 and has a button magazine release instead of the typical German styled paddle release. Walther did away with the backstrap safety system which is a huge advantage over the M1. I have shot 100 rnds through the gun and it performed flawlessly with the 6, 7 and 8 round mags. The 6 round mag offers maximum concealment while the 7 and 8 round mags offer a full, no pinky dangling purchase on the pistol. I've practiced fast mag changes and even with my xl sized hands, I haven't experienced any pinching. The trigger is good and I especially like the striker indicator that protrudes from the rear when the trigger is depressed. Makes reholstering a bit safer. In my opinion, this is the best shooting pistol of the single stack, subcompact striker fired pistols that have swept the market in the past years, especially if you have larger hands. The extra bit of weight it has over the competition helps to soften recoil and provides for very fast follow up shots. If I wasn't so pragmatic, Id keep it but I've found that Glocks are a bit more practical for my unrefined tastes. Included is a super generic Blackhawk IWB holster. There are plenty of holster companies making great rigs for the m2 and I'll send some links if interested. I might trade for a g43 package, but no other trades will be considered. Please call or text 614-five84-9325 or email me. Thanks."

The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed. Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability. Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability. Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics. Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired. Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface. Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance. Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting. Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability. Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul PMAG.

This is definitely not your average 12 gauge!As seen in the pictures, this is a cool, big gun. 2+1 magazine configuration, perfect for hunting most animals you'll see while hunting around here. Barrel is in good condition, with minor wear.The original walnut stock is in great condition, with only a minor 2mm crack in the forearm, that was repaired decades ago and isn't noticeable at all. Stock is drilled for sling mounts, and has the factory included recoil-reducing butt pad. Butt sleeve with shells not included.Looking to trade, but will sell for right price. Price is negotiable, but don't lowball me. Trust me, you will not win that game!Email me any offers! Doesn't hurt to ask or try.I'm in the north Lakeland area, and can travel a little for a good deal."
