The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles. This Varmint Target model is a predators worst nightmare, and a target shooters dream."

II.   Overall it’s in pretty good condition, but has a few things that bear mentioning:
 
-          This gun is a civilian-manufacture model, made for British club target shooters and well-to-do officers that wanted a long rifle with extra care taken during fitting up.  This is evidenced by the lack of a rollmark on the action wrist under the bolt, where most Enfields have a royal cipher, year of manufacture, model, and name of the arsenal where it was made.
-          -This rifle has not been sporterized.  All the furniture is still there, barrel has not been cut down, all parts present.
-          -Volley sights are intact, and function.
-          -Magazine cutoff is intact, and functions.
-          -The bolt is lacks a safety (not missing, just not manufactured with one).   This was common for commercial MLM’s.
-          -Dustcover lugs are still present on the bolt.  Most of these were ground off over the years as Magazine Lee-Metfords were upgraded to newer standards over the years.
-          -Magazine cutoff intact, and functions.
-          -Exterior finish is excellent, both on the metal and wooden furniture.
-          -Bayonet bar is still present.
 
A few irregularities exist, which is common for guns that have spent 100 years in Afghanistan:
-          -The buttstock is from an SMLE or No. 4.   It lacks the long top tang of Long Lee butts.
Also, the bore is totally shot.  This gun was shot with corrosive ammo and not cleaned, and the barest traces of rifling remain.  The bore is pretty rough, no excuses.  I’ve shot the gun and can group rounds at 4”-6” at 100 yards, which is impressive considering the condition of the barrel.
 
This gun is the perfect restoration project, wall-hanger, or place-holder for the serious Enfield collector.  Willing to drive an hour from my home in Akron, OH to make the right deal, and I will also ship UPS at buyer’s expense.  This gun is classified as an antique by the ATF and no FFL transfer is required.   Rifle also comes with 10 rounds of HXP.
 
Feel free to message with any questions and to ask for additional pictures, I have plenty.
 
Thanks for looking!"

Standard features ensure the kind of accuracy and dependability that made Kimber the most popular 1911 brand in the world, and 1911 ergonomics make it ideal for carry and defense. The Custom II has a match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the proven accuracy and performance of the .45 ACP cartridge, the Custom II is ready for everything from duty carry to recreational shooting and personal defense."

Made in the Izmash factory where the Russian military AK's are made this rifle is hard to come by. All marking are in Russian as is the factory manual. The furniture is upgraded with a picatinny rail on the bottom foregrip for a vertical grip if you want one.  Very clean with a chrome lined barrel. Comes with one 10 and one 15 round mag. Can also throw in a side scope mount if you are interested. Runs 100% and is in excellent condition. Onlyreason I am selling is I am moving out of the communist republic of nj to a free state and see no need to take my compliant firearms with me. NJ buyer MUST have FID with matching DL. YOU WILL SUBMIT A COPY OF BOTH TO ME FOR MY OWN RECORDS AND WE WILL DO A COE. Any others will go through ffl. I know what I have and low ballers will be ignored. All Russian gun imports are currently banned. And finding one with this dragonov stock is near impossible. A simple search of gunbroker will show you that these rifles are going for anywhere from 1299-1900$. I have no problem taking this gun with me and letting it appreciate in value to sell at a later date if I don't get a good offer. But I would rather see someone who knows and appreciates get it.

This is an amazing hunting gun, 6+1 capacity, natural pointer, weather resistant, upgraded front sight, rail for optics, big loop from the factory as well as polished internals. The laminate  stock is beautiful  and the stainless  receiver is an attention grabber. This gun was featured in the new jurrasic park movie if that means anything;) Some slight wear marks in firearm but nothing major. This is a seriously  sweet rifle, smooth and accurate recoil is not too bad at all. These go for 900+ new no matter where you  look online or in store. Mine is only a couple years old and was not shot much, I know this is used and I'm asking a very fair price. I will also include a pine Ridge 45-70 specific scope ($100) and possibly  a box of 500 grain +P bear loads. I WILL ALSO ENTERTAIN TRADES WITH AT LEAST 500 CASH. I think  the trade cause is higher. Can get more pics or info on request."

If your a glock fan once you shoot a kimber you will never go back. The triggers are light smooth and crisp with very little reset on it . Which makes for a extremely accurate shot.
