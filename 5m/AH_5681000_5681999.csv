It functions fine but there is an even rust and wear throughout the entire gun. It is missing all sling swivels and it is missing the rear sight. The wood has it's share of chips and splits. I've bought a few ""untouched"" Martinis from IMA over the years and although this rifle isn't perfect it's in better shape than every untouched Martini I've bought.At some point this rifle saw service in South Australia and is marked as such (SA 2556 on right side of receiver). There are NO Nepalese markings of any kind on this rifle, so this is pre-Nepalese cache and is in considerably better shape than most Martinis available today that came from Nepal (which were stored in shambly piles in a literal castle for over one hundred years before finally being bought by companies in the US to sell to the public).I'm asking $550 but I'd prefer to trade for AKs, AK parts kits, and AK related accessoiries/ammo; particularly 5.45x39 ammo and surplus 5.45 magazines.IMA-USA is selling 1870s dated untouched Martini Henrys they got from Nepal for the same price (www.ima-usa.com/original-british-p-1871-martini-henry-mkii-short-lever-rifle-1870-s-dated-untouched.html) and I guarantee you that the untouched Nepalese rifles they are selling are in considerably worse shape than this rifle.I'm in Oak Harbor and am willing to meet halfway depending on how far out the buyer might be. I have a CPL. This rifle is an antique by law and isn't considered a firearm.HERE IS AN ALBUM OF ADDITIONAL PHOTOS: imgur.com/a/oiO2d"

Again, the firearm is still new unfired and is the full size 4.5"" model with a removable thumb safety. I'm also including in the trade a full box of Federal HST 230 grain hollow points. I will trade for and ONLY for the following items: S&W M&P Shield 9mm, Springfield 3.3 XDS 9mm, Walther PPS M2, and a Glock 43. Please keep in mind this pistol is still in new unfired condition and retails anywhere from $579-599 new at numerous shops in the tri-state area plus tax and the additional cost of ammo. All trades must happen in Mason, all local and federal laws apply, and buyer must present state issued photo ID at time of sale (fellow CCW holders take priority).

It has been worked on by me with love and care as my primary carry, it has a trigger job that is slick as glass (stock parts ,sear disconnect etc) double action was left in the design handguns weight will not trip sear BTW I know what I'm doing , the frame has been tightened as much as I want to go considering if I wanted to add a new slide etc it is tighter than it came from factory, Mag well has been beveled and polished and reblued , has new firing pin spring and recoil spring (factory) and extended safety (factory safety included needs spring) Note : no aftermarket springs available for dual recoil spring it in my opinion needs higher spring rate but it doesn't batter with moderate target load I shoot Hornady xtp I've hand loaded to fit perfectly, The gun will feed anything I've shot and I haven't left much ammo untouched the next step was to fit a new barrel and pin tighter if needed it's very tight now I waited until I got a new barrel  that being said the barrel has a great bore.I'm looking to see what is out there for trade I am open to anything but a polymer flavor. I would be willing to put paperbacks in the pot to step up. I enjoy good shooters and older firearms and designs preferably hammer fired I would probably turn down any of the striker fired flavor varieties unless it's interesting. Really would like a lever gun in pistol offerings(no stupid safety's) I have the components to reload this cartridge if u would like to work a deal on thatEmail me your number and info if interested, I don't deal with text and you shouldn't either if your into online trading and sales you never know I like to talk to the Individual at least once before meeting.Thank you god bless"

Because this is the more premium version of the pistol you get two 5 round mags, match grade hexagonal barrel, precision milling and etching on the slide, adjustable/replaceable front and rear sights, precision milled internal components, and Kahr’s legendary DAO trigger. It’s smooth as silk and breaks like glass. It tucks away easily and would make an outstanding daily carry option while allowing the use of the formidable 45 ACP round. I put about two hundred rounds through it to break it in and hadn't a single issue. Its been a safe queen ever since. I am asking $600. Reasonable offers will be considered.

I ran a box of 115 hollow points and a box of 124 hollow points through it and had zero problems of any kind. It is a dependable, accurate (for its size) little pocket pistol. I carried it in a pocket holster a few times and always had complete confidence in it. I purchased an extra magazine for it as well as a Kel-tec trigger shoe. The trigger shoe makes the trigger pull much nicer as it adds more area for your finger.  The trigger pull is the nicest I have felt on a small pistol. It comes with original box, 2 mags, trigger shoe and paperwork. As you can see, it is the rarer olive drab green frame color. I would prefer to deal with those with carry permit.
