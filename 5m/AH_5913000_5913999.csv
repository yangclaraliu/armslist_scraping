So there’s hardly any felt recoil or muzzle jump! The M.I.S. (Manifold Injection System) forces expelled gases through the bolt carrier making this the cleanest running autoloading rifle in the world. The 16.5” chrome-lined semi-heavy barrel is free-floated in a aluminum partial quad-rail forend. So you can attach any accessory and grip that you choose.

This top-of-the-line AR features a “D.I.G.S” gas-system to allow you to eliminate the gas tube and use a folding stock. This revolutionary Delayed Impingement Gas System puts the recoil system up front over the barrel where it naturally pushes the rifle back down on target instead of up into your shoulder. So there’s hardly any felt recoil or muzzle jump! The M.I.S. (Manifold Injection System) forces expelled gases through the bolt carrier making this the cleanest running autoloading rifle in the world. The 16.5” chrome-lined semi-heavy barrel is free-floated in a aluminum partial quad-rail forend. So you can attach any accessory and grip that you choose. The Para TTR won Shooting Illustrated Magazine ""Golden Bullseye Award for Rifle of the Year"". It comes in a hard shell foam lined case with owner's manual and brand new 30-round magazine."
