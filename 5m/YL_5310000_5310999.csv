The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.
 
Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed steel front sight, picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."

I would like to sell or trade the gun since it no longer fills a niche I need. The M&P Shield 9mm is Like New In Box, never fired/carried.  includes nice, black M&P single pistol range bag with slots for ammo/5 mags, eyes/ears and more.  Included with gun is factory box, OEM sights/trigger parts both factory mags, owners manual, night sights, raven holster, gun lock, professioally instealled Apex trigger action kit, all documentation, warrranty- everything from the factory.  Have over 700 in the gun, selling for 450. May trade for the right gun.Gun is like new, never shot.  Included with gun is factory box, oem trigger parts and sights that were upgraded, 2 magazines- 1 8round and 1 7round, owners manual/lock/paperwork, also includes Bravo Concealmeant ""Morrigan"" kydex Shield hoslter. I have over 700 in the gun, it's like new and never fired. . Price is $$450 firm or a handgun trade (no long guns.unless you have a Benelli Supernova Tactical in excellent condition ).  Message me if interested.  Can throw in some high end defnesive ammo including one or two boxes of Federal HST 124g or 147g premium LEO 9mm ammo, Winchester Ranger Bonded 147g, Winchester SXT 147g,  Gold Dot 147 LEO amm or the hard to find 115g +P+ 1400FPS Gold Dot for 9mm if you are interested.   Gun is like new with no wear and never shot, if I hadn't found a PPS M1right after purchasing this it would be my daily carry.  Price is 475 cash.  I'm willing to deal but can't give it away and will only sell for a fair price.  I don't NEED to sell it but I prefer to sell it as it sits in the.  No long gun trades minus the TWO exceptions listed below.  WIlling to add HQ defensive ammo if you have a more valuable trade gun you'd like to exchange, possibly cash as well..  Message me if interested and please don't be shy.   Worst I can say is no thanks.  More pictures avaialable upon request."
