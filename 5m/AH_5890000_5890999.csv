Also referred to as Salt Bath Nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion, increases corrosion resistance, and reduces barrel bore friction offering both improved performance and increased barrel service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing, for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time.Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a superior quality VOODOO INNOVATION (VDI) BARREL that is capable of producing accuracy on par with a match grade stainless barrel, while also exhibiting greater longevity and resilience which is a significant upgrade over the typical chrome lined barrel. The ADAMS ARMS SHORT STROKE GAS PISTON SYSTEM is well designed, self-cleaning, and highly rated! No hot gas and carbon fouling crud going into your receiver and baking onto the bolt carrier group and cooking off your bolt lube. Your receiver stays nice and clean and runs cool with a gas piston system making maintenance and cleaning quick and easy.$850NO TRADESSPECIFICATIONS:UPPER RECEIVER: A4 FLAT-TOP, FORGED 7075-T6 HARD ANODIZED MIL-SPECLOWER RECEIVER: FORGED 7075-T6 HARD ANODIZED MIL-SPECVOODOO INNOVATION MELONITE NITRIDE TREATED BARRELBARREL LENGTH: 16""BARREL CONTOUR: GOVERNMENTBARREL MATERIAL: 4150 CHROME MOLY VANADIUM STEELMUZZLE THREAD PATTERN: 1/2""-28BARREL FINISH: QPQ MELONITE/BLACK NITRIDE TREATEDTWIST RATE: 1 IN 7""CHAMBER: 5.56x45mm NATOM4 FEED RAMPS: YESBOLT CARRIER: 1-PIECE WITH INTEGRAL PISTON STRIKE FACEMUZZLE DEVICE: STANDARD A2 FLASH-HIDERGAS SYSTEM: ADAMS ARMS GAS PISTON MELONITE NITRIDE TREATED GAS SYSTEM LENGTH: MID-LENGTH, SHORT STROKE GAS PISTONGAS BLOCK DIAMETER: 0.750""HANDGUARD: MAGPUL MOE MID-LENGTHSIGHTS: NONEGRIP: STANDARD AR GRIPTRIGGER: STANDARD MIL-SPECSTOCK: ROGER'S SUPER STOCK DELUXE 6-POSITION BUTTSTOCKWEIGHT: 6.5 LBSPicture Is Actual Rifle For Sale!"

The VZ does use proprietary mags, but they're both lighter and stronger than AK mags. The VZ also has a less cumbersome safety that can be easily manipulated with your trigger finger vs having to sweep your whole hand like with an AK. The simpler safety has the added benefit of not exposing the guts of the gun to the elements while in the safe position. The VZ58 also holds the bolt open after the last round is fired. This would be a great truck or SHTF gun.This rifle (dubbed the VZ2000) was made by Ohio Ordnance Works to incredibly exacting standards (Google some reviews - they're all great) right here in the USA and includes four (4) mags with pig skin bandoleer, a bayonet w/sheath, cleaning kit, sling, folding stock (will come with the fixed stock on it, but it's an easy swap), manual, and I'll throw in 100 rounds of TulAmmo 154gr soft point steel case non-corrosive ammo to get you started.I have two of these rifles. One is unfired. The other has 60 rounds of non-corrosive ammo (see above) through it. Price is for each, not both.Decent video overview on YouTube at https://youtu.be/4rxiOW5bIYEBuyer must be willing to complete purchase at an FFL. Seller will pay for buyer's background check."

When Ruger first released this bad boy, Guns and Ammo called it the prettiest 1911 that they had seen in quite some time come out of a factory. Beautiful low glare, bead blasted stainless steel chroming, rosewood grips with Ruger emblem inlay, and skeletonized hammer and trigger make this an all around georgous yet intimidating looking semi-auto pistol. And being an Ruger that's all-steel (with some titanium parts), this thing is as solid as a rock. It accepts all standard after market 1911 parts. This cost me $800 with an additional $80 in sales tax, and $8 for the background check, therefore pushing it closer to $900. The retail price on Ruger's website is $939 alone, and of course that's pre-tax and fees. Get it here for a fraction of the cost, my loss is your gain. I thoroughly cleaned this gun, spending hours eliminating most of the nasty gunk and junk that comes on all handguns from the factory. Maybe just add a little lube and it's all ready to go!"
