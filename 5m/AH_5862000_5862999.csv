Manufacturing Inc. - Grizzly - Mark I WIN MAG - .45 Winchester Magnum - 6.5"" Barrel _ Checkered Rubber Pachmayr Grips - 7 Round Box Magazine - Factory Original Finish - Big Bore Hand Cannon The Grizzly Win Mag pistols were conceived, invented, designed, engineered and developed in the 1980s by the sole inventor, Perry Arnett, who licensed the patented technology (U.S. patent #4,253,377) to L.A.R. Manufacturing Inc. For a time they were the most powerful production handguns in the world. The pistols are essentially an upscale derivative of the Colt M1911 design, and many parts are interchangeable. They were developed to fire the much more powerful .45 Winchester Magnum rounds instead of .45 Acp, with conversion kits available to fire other powerful pistol ammunition, such as 10mm auto and .357 Magnum. Later models were available in .44 Magnum and .50 AE (Grizzly Mark V). Due to the size, weight and recoil of the pistol, the primary market was hunting and silhouette shooting. Production ended in 1999, though spare parts are still available from the manufacturer today in very limited quantity. The Grizzly Win Mag pistol was developed during the early 1980's by L.A.R. Manufacturing Inc ( L.A.R. stands for names of company founders - Larisch, Augat And Robinson). The Grizzly Mark ""I"" was designed around the very powerful .45 Winchester Magnum (.45 Win Mag, metric designation 11.43x30mm) ammunition, which generates muzzle energies in the 1100 joules (810 ft-lbs) region.This is a near perfect LAR Grizzly Mark I WIN MAG, chambered for . 45 Winchester Magnum. At one time, this firearm held the honorable distinction of being the most powerful semi-automatic handgun in production. This elegant fire breathing god is 100 feet per second faster and develops more than 100 foot pounds of energy than the 44 magnum. All this with less muzzle jump than a .38 Special. The serial number is a low: A001097 and she was manufactured in West Jordan, Utah. Outside of some very slight signs of wear from handling and storage, this gun is just about perfect.

No longer imported to the United States, due to executive orders against importing Russian arms. Imported by EAA Corp. Perfect for a new conversion to what you want it to be.Barrel has a 1:9 twist rate, and IS properly chambered for the 5.56x45mm, although it is marked .223 Remington. As such, it will not cause the overpressure problems (popped primers, overly high chamber pressures, etc.) associated with firing 5.56 in a .223 chamber.Rifle has usual wear marks of a used AK, but none reach into the metal, they are just surface marks. Furniture is somewhat scuffed, but will likely be replaced in a conversion anyway. In short - rifle is fine.I do not have any mags for it, it came with one magazine that was for a different caliber entirely, which I traded away, since it was not useful. As such, I have not tested reliability, but hey - it's a Russian AK. If you would like, I can point you to some sources for Saiga mags when you buy it."

It's a commercial FN action (size and style of a 98 Mauser) with true controlled round feed. My father always wanted a gun from Dale but never managed to get one for himself. Dale had a reputation and people from all over the country would have him build customs for them. He found this one somewhere and adopted it. It has a dual set trigger, right handed semi roll over check piece, and contrasting fore end tip and grip cap. The Bolt is jeweled and the bolt face is as nice as it was when new. The safety is bolt mounted. The workmanship on this is outstanding. After my father acquired it, he took it to Dale's home where Dale acknowledged making it. Aside from the barrel marking for identification there is nothing else. It may or may not have ID inside the stock under the barrel, neither of us ever removed it from the stock. This gun must date back a few years as the finish is sagging into the wood a bit as many do when they get older. If any of you have heard of Dale or know who he was, this is an opportunity to own a gun made by a master. If interested, please contact me and more photos can be provided. I probably forgot something, let me know if more information is needed. Thanks for looking."

If the ad is still up, I still have it so please don't message me with ""Still got it"" or ""Text me"". Please send me a detailed message with your location and trade offer. I'm sorry to sounds kind of rude; I'm really not, it's just that I get SO MANY useless and ridiculous messgages when trading a high-end firearm that I'd rather not get stuck in text message conversations with people trying to convince me that their DPMS AR-15 w NC-Star scope and a Ruger LCP is an equal trade.  Anyway, this rifle started life as a heavey barrel short action .308 Savage 10FP LEO (law enforcement model) and then a free-float Choate tactical sniper stock was added and the Accuracy International bottom metal (the thing that allows you to use detachable box mags) was installed. This rifle takes Accuary International .308 mags. Yes, I know they're expensive as hell (about $80 to $100 each) so I'm including 3 of them (two 5rd mags and one 10rd mag and yes they're all marked ""AI""). One of the 5rd mags is painted and the other two are mint.  The paint on the rifle is just Krylon spray paint. The original color of the stock underneath is black and OD green. The scope is a Vortex Viper PST 4-16X50. This scope has tactical turrets and an illuminated reticle. It also is a first focal plane reticle scope so that's super sexy.  The bipod is an authentic Harris 9"" HBLMS bipod and is included.  Again, I'm only looking for trades, not cash.  Keep in mind that the bottom metal and 3 mags are alone worth $550ish so please don't offer me your Glock .40 as a striagt trade. Again, trying not to be a jerk but I get a lot of silly trade offers. Also, the rough value of this package is hard to pin down and I'm certainly not trying to get every penny out of it that I put into it (that'd be silly) but the scope is roughly $700, the bipod about $110, the bottom metal and mags, as I mentioned are about $550, the rifle + tactical stock is about $1,200 so please just keep in mind the rough value when making a trade offer.  Trades can be anything. I'm open to whatever and I enjoy seeing what offers roll in. Please just keep them reasonable and PLEASE include the trade offer in your first message to me. I can follow up from there but I've never seen the point in the people who message me with ""Intersted, message me"". Again, please include where you're located too when you're offering a trade. I'd trade this for one single high end gun or multiple guns. Just let me know what you have, where you're at and roughly when you might be available to meet."
