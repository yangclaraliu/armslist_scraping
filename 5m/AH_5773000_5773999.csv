That’s why Magtech developed the Clean Range series of ammunition for indoor range use. In contrast to traditional full metal jacket ammunition, which has an exposed lead base, Clean Range bullets are fully covered in copper. This prevents lead release when the round is discharged, protecting you from inhaling potentially harmful airborne particles.The light 115 grain bullet in this 9mm Parabellum load achieves a muzzle velocity of 1135 feet per second. As a standard pressure round, it offers solid performance without excessive recoil in compact carry pistols such as the Glock 26, Sig P938, and Colt New Agent. Each box holds 50 cartridges in reloadable Boxer-primed brass cases.Magtech ammo is developed by the Companhia Brasileira de Cartuchos, or CBC, which roughly translates to “Brazilian Cartridge Company.” BCC is one of the largest ammo manufacturers in the world and operates from a massive production complex and headquarters in Ribeirao Pires, a city in the state of Sao Paulo. The 500-acre Ribeirao Pires plant features state of the art automated assembly lines for ammo as well as satellite plants to produce components such as propellant and primers. Magtech’s US offices and distribution center are located in Minneapolis, Minnesota."

The 224 Valkyrie provides extremely flat trajectories and match accuracy beyond 1,300 yards. The cartridge offers significantly less wind drift and drop than other loads in its class, as well as less than half the recoil of cartridges with comparable ballistics. Loaded in an unmatched array of high-performance projectiles, 224 Valkyrie is a great choice for both long-range target shooters and hunters.   These extraordinary loads combine the legendary Sierra MatchKing bullet with Federal's proven quality standards and stringent manufacturing controls to create a round that is as accurate as a match load, but available from the factory. Sierra MatchKing bullets have very thin jackets and are held to exacting tolerances in diameter and weight. Their accuracy has been acclaimed worldwide and they have been used to win more target competitions than all target bullets from other manufacturers combined.

The 224 Valkyrie provides extremely flat trajectories and match accuracy beyond 1,300 yards. The cartridge offers significantly less wind drift and drop than other loads in its class, as well as less than half the recoil of cartridges with comparable ballistics. Loaded in an unmatched array of high-performance projectiles, 224 Valkyrie is a great choice for both long-range target shooters and hunters.   Federal Premium ammunition is useful for everything from plinking to varmint or small-game hunting. Each round provides the shooter explosive disruption so it's perfect for competition or an afternoon on the prairie. Nosler's Ballistic Tip Varmint Bullets are designed for violent expansion upon impact. The bullet is tipped with a polycarbonate tip which rapidly drives back forcing the thin jacket to expand and fragment. The heavy base prevents deformation during firing and the boat-tail design increases the ballistic efficiency of the bullet. This ammunition is new production and non-corrosive.     Made In United States of America       Caliber 224 Valkyrie      Quantity          Grain Weight 60 Grains   Muzzle Velocity 3300 Feet Per Second   Muzzle Energy 1451 Foot Pounds   Bullet Style Polymer Tip   Bullet Brand And Model Nosler Ballistic Tip   Lead Free No   Case Type Nickel Plated   Primer Boxer   Corrosive No   Reloadable Yes   Ballistic Coefficient 0.27   Sectional Density 0.171   Test Barrel Length 24 Inches   Country of Origin United States of America"

Show your pride for your weapon while using this high quality neoprene rubber backed and cloth top gun cleaning mat to protect your gun bench, desk, kitchen table, or whatever surface you usually clean or maintain your gun on. You likely keep your gun in a soft padded case or maybe a gun cabinet with a felt lined rack or something similar to protect it so why would you scratch your gun while cleaning or repairing it by setting it on a hard surface that could easily scratch your firearm? PROTECT YOUR GUN AND WORK AREAThe soft polyester top will ensure your gun doesn't get scratched while the neoprene rubber backing on the mat will keep everything in place and prevent your work surface from sliding around. This mat will also keep harmful chemicals, oil and dirt from penetrating down to your desk, bench or the area where you normally clean and work on your firearms. After the mat begins to accumulate too much dirt, chemicals, or oil just throw it in the wash on a gentle cycle, allow to air dry and it will be virtually like new."

During the arms race of the late 1800's, the German Empire designed and built the Gewehr 1888 as the countries first infantry rifle designed for a smokeless powder cartridge. In 1905 the Gewehr 1888s were rechambered for the new 7.92X57mm Mauser Spitzer cartridge and renamed the Gewehr 1888/05. The reciever was stamped with an ""S"" to signify that the barrel was rechambered. The barrel is unique because it was covered in a sheet metal tube to keep the barrel off the wood to improve accuracy. Text only please: 315-955-two-eight-eight-six"

Sold as is with one magazine. I purchased this gun used, so I don't have a round count. Sorry. Shoots like a dream and the extra weight of the steel frame really helps tame the recoil of full power loads. Accepts 12 round magazines. If you are not legally able to possess high capacity magazines in California, I can not sell them to you. I do not have any 10 round magazines. This pistol is double and single action and can be carried with the thumb safety engaged. Comes with fantastic beavertail, that can be hard to find if you have a high grip. Comes with aftermarket hogue grips. When I bought this gun the grips on it were falling apart. So I replaced them and no longer have the set that was on it. Selling because I rarely take it to the range. These pistols are very similar to the CZ75. Buyer responsible for transfer fees. I do my transfers at Old West Gun Room in El Cerrito.
