Was just going to have my excess ammo destroyed but I figured someone might want it. Calibers include 380acp, 38spl/38spl+p, 357mag, 9mm/9mm+p, 40s&w, 45acp and 45colt. The 1,700+ round lot containes about 1,400+ in 9mm, 40s&w and 45acp alone and about 1,000 of that is JHP with a ton of premium brand ammo in there. Where my orginal intent was to just have it disposed of it will only come sorted by caliber and if its FMJ or JHP because I kept my preferred clear stackable containers to maybe re-use sometime, I kept the trade value on the lower side to reflect this. I will include at least one surplus 5.56 can for storage but you would be responsible for additional storage. Only keeping a couple boxes for myself. For trade only. Would consider trading the 9mm, 40s&w and 45acp only. Would prefer to meet in Norton or at a local FFL if needed for a transfer, not lazy but recovering from a minor injury and the ammo is very heavy to pack up and lug around. All laws will be followed. Thanks for looking."

All of the parts are matching except for the stock, which was replaced by the Swiss armory in the 1950's. This rifle does include the original ""troop tag"" that was issued with this gun along with the original leather sling, which is in far better condition than any  issued K31 sling I have ever seen. The sling is stamped with the Swiss cartouche.The bluing on rifle is all original and very nice. The bluing on the receiver is very, very strong. The cartouche is stamped very clearly and is not worn at all. Additionally, the bluing on the (original) magazine, magazine well, and trigger guard is near perfect. Bluing is also strong on the barrel and barrel bands. The bore is very bring and shiny with strong lands. The only concern is cosmetic pitting on the muzzle, however this doesn't effect accuracy as this rifle consistently shoots 1 MOA groupings at 100 yards with iron sights and surplus GP11 ammo. I'm located in St. Augustine but am willing to meet somewhere as long as it is safe. Asking price is 400."

All steel cased, not coated.   Includes Russian surplus sling and AK-74 style muzzle brake.  I also have the traditional slant brake with it.  And olive MOLLE double rfile case.  Condition of everything is good.  Asking $650 for everything.  Call or text Paul REDACTED. I live in York and will meet you at an FFL within a 30 minute drive.  If you show me your current carry permit and driver's license then we can skip the FFL transfer, but I reserve the right to still require it if I feel it is necessary.  This is a used gun and I am a private seller."

I am looking into replacing that. Honestly the few times I have shot this thing I loved it and it has been my carry gun daily since. There are tons of accessories available online for it like a laser sight, extended clips and anything else you could think of for cheap. Only reason I am selling it is because I have to pay the rest of my school tuition by the 21st and I am selling all I have to do so. If you were to buy it and decide a month later you don't want it, I would buy it back from you in a heartbeat. I have about $450 into this whole set up and that doesn't include the time i’ve spent taking care of it and cleaning it along with other small fees and stuff you pay when buying a gun online. The nice thing about this set up is, its cleaned and ready to go and you dont have to buy a single thing for it. I have reduced the price a few times and I am pretty much firm on $375, That’s the biggest loss I am willing to take on it and if I can't get that Id rather just keep it. I cant do trades.If you would like better pictures, close ups or anything like that just email me. I cant post many on here and there is too much to fit. Must have ID and be willing to sign bill of sale. Shoot me an email with your contact information and I will get ahold of you right away. Had my number up but kept getting lots of spam. Thanks."

Thank you. FAQ1. Where did ZiP™ come from? And how was it developed? Answer: ZiP™ was developed as a new Firearm from a new Company - USFA/ZiPFactory, LLC. Demand in the market is high for a fun .22 pistol which brings new engineering solutions to reduce cost and provide safety and a great day at the range where you can shoot all day without breaking the budget of cost minded consumers. At ZiPFactory™, we believe consumers just want to pull the trigger as affordably as they can . . . all day long. Developed by our own engineers inside ZiPFactory™, the ZiP™ has very few internal components. ZiP™ is both US + Foreign Patent Pending with several innovative features never before possible - until now. 2. How does ZiP™ work? Different than other .22s? Answer: Well, from a functional standpoint, ZiP™ is a “Pure” blowback design. Meant to function with a wide range of common ammunition and a few specialty .22 rounds as well. ZiP™ has no slide, so it has no ""over the hand travel"" like most other guns. And zero possibility of slide bite. Also, ZiP™ has no moving parts on the top so it allows for a very unique system of rails and adaptability. ZiPPic™, ZiPNite™ (Glock style sight provisions), and ZiPSBR™ (Approved ATF Form 1 for legal use). See #7 Below.The forward charging system provides LOAD and Re-Strike capabilities and is fully ambidextrous. Left handers simply switch sides and rotate the text panels to read correctly. See the ZiP Operator Manual + Guide for more. 3. What is the New ZiP-Action? And how many safeties are in ZiP™?Great question. Answer: The ZiP-Action™ is a simplified straight pull trigger (no winding trigger bar around a magazine well. . .) striker-fired action with 5 safeties. The ""reset"" length is among the shortest in industry (about 1/10 of an inch) and the trigger pull after reset is the same shot to shot.When you pull the trigger, the firing channel remains blocked for nearly the entire stroke, opposite of all striker fired Glock type systems. If you choose to release the trigger and not fire you remain blocked the entire time. 4. What magazine does ZiP™ use?Answer: ZiP™ has been tested with New Ruger® Rotary BX-1™ (10 Shot) magazine and CCI Blazer 40 Grain -or CCI Mini Mag 40 Grain Ammunition. Untold millions have been produced since the 1960's and for many shooters this was their first firearm. The Ruger® BX-25® will need the ZiP ZX-30 Upgrade Kit to provide enough spring pressure- that kit is NOW AVAILABLE- Contact your Local Dealer. 5. Can ZiP™ use a suppressor? Answer: YES. ZiP™ has an amazing ability to quick change barrels without fully disassembling the gun. ZiP™ Operators will simply remove one screw (using the supplied wrench stored in the standard top) and pop off the rear cover and after removing the recoil body and barrel nut, slide the barrel out to the rear.ZiPFactory™ has plans to offer a suppressor friendly accessory barrel in the near future. 6. We see rods on top of the barrel, What are these used for?Answer: These are the Load and Re-Strike Rods. They are positioned above and behind the barrel muzzle. By simply pushing the rods-- ZiP™ Operators can activate the action, perform unlimited re-strike, are ambidextrous and provide a method to decock and/or lock the striker and trigger- another ZiP™ Innovation. 7. ZiP™ appears to have several modular interchangeable tops?Answer: Yes. ZiP™ has a unique system of rails. ZiP™ Std Rail, ZiPPic™Rail, ZiPNite™Rail (Glock style sight provisions), and **ZiPSBR™Rail (Approved Form 1 for legal use). Each rail has a purpose. The ZiPPic™ allows you to attach any type of red dot heads up display on its standard picatinny rail dimensions, and is used as the locating rail for the BattleZiP™ **SBR Survival Stock. While the **ZiPSBR™ Rail allows the ZiP Operator™ to attach ZiP™ to another platform such as a AR-15 or SCAR.** Note: SBR stands for a special classification of weapon (In this case a pistol) when transformed into an SBR- or Short Barreled Rifle. As such, purchase -or- possession of a rail or a stock does not require an Approved ATF Form 1, however, USE OF THOSE COMPONENTS while in combination with ZiP™ (attached to another platform) e.g. AR-15/SCAR or BattleZiP™ SBR Stock, requires the user to satisfy two separate issues for legal use. 1) is overall length of the entire platform of 26 inches, 2) is barrel length of a minimum of 16 inches. ZiP™ has only a 5.25 inch barrel ""Short barrel rifle"" when attached) and so the Approved ATF Form 1 (cost $200) is required for LEGAL USE.  8. Is ZiP™ comfortable to shoot? Answer: Yes. ZiP™ has a blocky look, but this is deceiving. Held in the hand properly, as shown in the ZiP Operator™ Manual + Guide, ZiP™ is quite comfortable and once the ZiP Operator is familiar with its controls Operators naturally perform various chamber checks and safety SOP's quite easily. 9. How heavy is ZiP™ Answer: ZiP™ weights less than a pound, (.95 of a pound, 15.2 oz, 430.9 grams) actually, unloaded condition. Means your ability to carry useful ammo and not gun mass is important here. 10. How long is ZiP's barrel? Answer: ZiP™ has a barrel of 5.20 inches long. Impressive when you consider most .22's on the market today only have barrels of 3.8 inches for the comparable size. ZiP's frame length is only 5.9 inches and averages about 1.2 wide. 11. It says in the ZiP™Operator Manual + Guide that ZiP™ comes with 2 sets of recoil springs. Which ammo did you find worked best? Answer: ZiP™ does in fact come with (2) separate spring weights, Target (Installed) and High Velocity - However- Perform the breakin process-with the installed Low Power Spring set and adjust for your different loadings- for example- try CCI Stingers with High Velocity and test performance.Top Premium Load is CCI Mini Mag, 1235 fps, 40 gr CCI Blazer 40 Gr is a Superior Choice--.ZiPFactory™ recommends Top Bulk loads for both Target and High Velocity as well. Check the ZiP™Operator Manual + Guide for more. 12. When can I have my ZiP™? Can I choose my color?Answer: ZiPFactory™ is working to deliver to our Distributors of ZiP™ BASIC Black is the first load out color of the new ZiP™ and ZiP Operator Accessories. Other colors are now Launched- COYOTE TAN and ALIEN GREY are now Shipping.Check back often to the main site www.zipfactory.com for more information and updates. 13. ZiP available for EXPORT-?Answer: YES, but certain restrictions and ITAR REGULATIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED. Please contact your sales representative. 14. Attention PRO Mag UserAnswer: ZiP Ejection works just like the Ruger® 10/22®- The Steel Feed Lip is the Ejector.So ZiP works best with Genuine Ruger BX-1 and the New ZiP ZX-30 magazines which both have Steel Feed Lips WITH Ejectors.ZiP does not perform with “Pro Mag” -or- older type magazines due to plasticfeed lips and/or lack of an ejector especially on the Pro Mag series."
