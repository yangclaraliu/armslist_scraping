A like new (I have about 75 rounds through the gun) semi-auto .17HMR Savage A17 with bright new Nikon Prostaff Rimfire 4-12x40 BDC reticle scope ($120 retail) and two EXTRA 10 shot clip($20 each retail) . Bought everything new for about $560. Had issues with the first one I bought and Savage sent me a new one. Add some issues with feeding at first but found that these need to be broken in. The Prostaff scope is pretty nice glass for a rimfire, some issues with eye relief on 12x but once you figure it out it is right on. I have the rig dialed in at 100yrds and on a good bench and rest with a heavy rear bag had a 6 shot group (two consecutive 3 shot groups) that were all on the 1"" target. One group was just over 5/8"" and the best was 5/16'. I was blown away (as my neighbor was) when we checked the group, that an inexpensive rimfire could be so accurate. (Now it was a perfect day for shooting a .17 cool, no wind and a great stand/rest) I had my doubts about these rifles but am a believer now. IT's in almost like new, may be a few bumps from shooting from a bench but NOTHING is wrong with it. Bought the gun on a whim but decided to step up to a new 222. I had a Ruger Model 77 in 17HMR for fox hunting in Alaska and, I can't believe I'm saying this, but this A17 is dang close as accurate. The cheapest one of these I can find on Gunbroker, CheaperThanDirt, etc is $395 plus shipping. So at $399 with scope and 2 extra mags, this is a good deal so please don't try and low ball. Can't/won't go any lower. If you are a ""horse-trader"" tell your wife I was asking $510 and you talked me down $100.I'll take $399 plus $35 shipping for total of $445 and I'll send to your FFL. That is like buying a rifle retail and get a scope and Two Extra clips FOR FREE.If picked up locally have 550 rounds of CCI A17 ammo and 50 rounds of hollow points (600 rounds total) I  will give you for $95 ($149 retail). Can do PayPal and/or Money order. Paypal gets it to you quicker."

If anyone is stuck with essentially a paperweight of a lower, I'll take it off your hands for a fee.

Built around Beretta® PX4 modular technology, the Beretta PX4 Storm™ Semi-Auto Pistol delivers rapid shots with precise accuracy due to its ergonomic design and unique action. The PX4 utilizes a rotating barrel locking system that reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise by releasing recoil energy radially. The corrosion resistant fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame comes with 3 interchangeable backstraps to obtain a proper fit according to the individual shooter's hand. Non-slip texturing on the grip also aids in weapon control. An integral Picatinny rail provides rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. The PX4 Storm is a double/single action semi-automatic pistol with an external hammer. The ambidextrous safety doubles as a decocking lever. The slide features a Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating for superior corrosion and wear resistant finish, while forward and rear serrations provides a non-slip hold on the slide when loading and unloading the weapon. White, 3-dot sights provide quick sight acquisition in varied lighting. The gun's chrome-lined barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance. The Beretta PX4 Storm Semi-Auto Pistol fieldstrips quickly without tools into 5 subcomponents for cleaning and maintenance."

This is the second leading cause of preventable death on the battlefield.   WHY THE SAM® CHEST SEAL   Key features of the SAM® Chest Seal include its strong adhesive and its flexible construction which allows conformability over the wound. The adhesive properties have been tested to simulate various environments including adhesion to hair, sweat, blood, in the presence of sand, submersion in water, and during extended wear. The chest seal also adheres under extreme heat and cold.   Another key advantage of the strong adhesion is its ability to reseal, making it ideal for venting the wound. The SAM® Chest Seal addresses other military needs including a larger dressing area, and by including a highly and rapidly absorbent 5″ x 9″ pad for cleaning the wound area before application.   NSN Non-Valve: 6510-01-621-1129   NIGHT VISION OPTIMIZED   With its ultimate use in global combat zones, we optimized the SAM® Chest Seal for night vision. Both the packaging and chest seal can be viewed under no light conditions with the use of a night vision device. This allows for easier placement in all light conditions.   The SAM® Chest Seal is made in the USA   THE SAM CHEST SEAL MEETS COTCCC PREFERRED FEATURES FOR CHEST SEALS   FDA 510(k) Cleared CE Mark Sterile Device adheres despite the presence of blood, sweat, hair, and sand Adheres despite storage as defined in Military Standard 810G Easily applied in battlefield situations Has tabs to facilitate removal of adhesive [dressing] Minimum incidence of allergic reactions to adhesive Oval shape; 6-8 inches or larger in size Creates an occlusive seal Ventable through lifting a flap on the seal; reseals well after venting One-way valve design prevents obstruction from blankets, clothing Puncture-resistant packaging; lightweight and ruggedized Long shelf life; inexpensive Integrity and function maintained when stored or carried in folded configuration Configured for ease of use in low-light environments* Packaged two per package** Dressing and packaging are night vision optimized for visibility in all light conditions   ADDITIONAL FEATURES   Latex free Transparent Dual tabs to facilitate placement and removal of dressing Vacuum packed tear and peel pouch Works under extreme heat and cold Dressing and packaging are night vision optimized Elastic for conformability of curved body surfaces Oval shape with thin edge layer that resists lifting or peeling Biocompatible Rapid, highly absorbent 5″ x 9″ pad included"

$700 cash.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax and I'm sure it's a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price.
I will listen to trade offers, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.

This is the second leading cause of preventable death on the battlefield.  WHY THE SAM® CHEST SEAL  Key features of the SAM® Chest Seal include its strong adhesive and its flexible construction which allows conformability over the wound. The adhesive properties have been tested to simulate various environments including adhesion to hair, sweat, blood, in the presence of sand, submersion in water, and during extended wear. The chest seal also adheres under extreme heat and cold.  Another key advantage of the strong adhesion is its ability to reseal, making it ideal for venting the wound. The SAM® Chest Seal addresses other military needs including a larger dressing area, and by including a highly and rapidly absorbent 5"" x 9"" pad for cleaning the wound area before application.  ONE-WAY VALVE OPTION  This version features a one-way valve, when its cap is removed. The one-way valve provides for low resistance flow of air out of the chest cavity while preventing ingress. The valve is also designed to prevent blockage internally. With the cap in place, the dressing is occlusive. The domed shape of the valve was specially designed to prevent obstruction of the air channels from items such as blankets, clothing, and body armor.  NIGHT VISION OPTIMIZED  With its ultimate use in global combat zones, we optimized the SAM® Chest Seal for night vision. Both the packaging and chest seal can be viewed under no light conditions with the use of a night vision device. This allows for easier placement in all light conditions.  THE SAM CHEST SEAL MEETS COTCCC PREFERRED FEATURES FOR CHEST SEALS FDA 510(k) Cleared Sterile Device adheres despite the presence of blood, sweat, hair, and sand Adheres despite storage as defined in Military Standard 810G Easily applied in battlefield situations Has tabs to facilitate removal of adhesive [dressing] Minimum incidence of allergic reactions to adhesive Oval shape; 6-8 inches or larger in size Creates an occlusive seal Ventable through lifting a flap on the seal; reseals well after venting Puncture-resistant packaging; lightweight and ruggedized Long shelf life; inexpensive Integrity and function maintained when stored or carried in folded configuration Configured for ease of use in low-light environments ADDITIONAL FEATURES Dual tabs to facilitate placement and removal of dressing Vacuum packed tear and peel pouch Works under extreme heat and cold Dressing and packaging are night vision optimized Elastic for conformability of curved body surfaces Oval shape with thin edge layer that resists lifting or peeling Rapid, highly absorbent 5"" x 9"" pad included One-way valve provides for low resistance airflow out of chest cavity while preventing ingress Valve is designed to prevent blockage internally Valve is designed to prevent blockage caused by external items such as a blanket Cap allows occlusive option"
