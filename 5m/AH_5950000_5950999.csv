While there is some marring on the rear sight it functions 100% and could easily be polished out/blued again. These sights are super bright and easy to use. The slide had a few small scratches, and included is an unpolished slide if you wanted the stock look. Also included are 6-16rd magazines that all function flawlessly. Also includes case, manual, & first round fired at factory. This is a great self defense handgun and is essentially a glock 19 clone, would also be good for someone looking to purchase a self defense gun that is ready to go for a loved one without breaking the bank. I am open to hearing any offers because I would like to move this quickly. The worst I can say is no. For trades I would be interested in shotguns, ar parts, 10/22 or other 22 rifles, and potentionally other handguns. I may also be willing to sell the magazines separately for $25 each if you wanted to buy 2 or more. CCW permit holders preferred but I may be willing to sell to others.$450 OBO"

Was just going to have my extra FMJ and JHP ammo propperly destroyed but figured I would see if anyone wants to trade first so it doesnt go to waste. All factory, no refurbished or reloads. The total is about 1,800+ in 380acp, 9mm, 40s&w, 45acp, 38spl, 357mag and 45colt with well over 300 in 22lr and 22wmr, so grand total is easily 2,000+ but still far under the total allowed limit. Just about 1,000 is in 40s&w and 9mm JHP alone. There is tons of premium brand JHP ammo in there especially in 40s&w. There is easily more total JHP than FMJ. Where my plan was to bring it for destruction it will only come sorted by caliber and if its JHP or FMJ because I kept the nice stackable containers I use to maybe re-use and re-label and the low trade value reflects it. Will toss in at least one surplus 5.56 can to hold some but you must provide you own secure storage for the rest at pick up. Good lot to split up and trade or to keep as a backup lot when the shelves go empty like they do at certain time. Would prefer to meet in Norton mostly because ammo it is all very heavy and Im recovering from a minor injury from a biking incident but could meet at a local FFL if needed for a transfer, sorry not looking to drive across or halfway across the state and absolutely no shipping. Must have a MA LTC and ID for all trades including non firearm trades. All laws will be followed. Thanks."

It was the first autoloader to combine the repeat-shot versatility of early-century models with the sleek, modern lines and handling qualities of revered double barrels. The Remington Model 1100 has been a field-proved favorite ever since. Its superb balance, handling, durability and soft recoil from the gas-operated action are the foundation of the Remington autoloading legacy."

Limited production like new, Remington Model 1911 R1 100 year anniversary edition .45 ACP, it comes with 2 mags, all paper work & anniversary hard case to keep it in. They only made this for 1yr in 2011, so this will appeal to both gun collectors or 1911 enthusiast. I've checked several different webs sites & these are no longer available new because of there short production run & it being a full 5 yr since they were last made.

Included is the factory hard case, paperwork, and both factory 16-rd mags.The BD variant is basically just a CZ75B that instead of a thumb safety, has the de-cocking lever (MUCH better than a traditional thumb safety, IMO.)  The ""Police"" designation means it also has several additional features the standard B model doesn't, like a lanyard ring, checkering on the front strap, serated trigger, reversable magzine release, and loaded chamber indicator. Naturally, buyer must be legal to own firearms, and be a Georgia resident over age 21, with valid ID. As always, I'll show my DL and Ga carry permit.Thanks for looking......Sorry,no trades. Price is firm. Please respond with enough detail that I can be confident that you're a legitimate local buyer, instead of another scammer, otherwise I'll just ignore the message.

In terms of size and shape, the P238 is very similar to other comparable micro .380’s. Instead of a polymer frame, however, the Sig Sauer P238 uses an all metal frame with a single action design, and is almost identical in appearance to the legendary Colt Mustang.   The Sig Sauer P238 operates with a locked-breech short recoil action. The hammer must be cocked either manually, or by the action of the slide, to fire each shot. The advantage to this method of operation is two- fold. First and foremost, similar to the Colt 1911 or Mustang, the Sig Sauer P238 has a superior trigger pull when compared to similarly sized double action only designs like the Ruger LCP, Smith & Wesson Bodyguard or Kel-Tec P3AT. In turn, this leads to greater accuracy. Second, the P238’s single action design allows Sig Sauer to incorporate a high ride beavertail grip frame, which leads to greater control under recoil by safely placing the shooter’s hand higher along the bore axis.   In addition to being a great-looking pistol, the Sig Sauer P238 is much easier to load than other micro pistols on the market. For shooters that do not possess strong hands, the P238’s smooth and easy slide is one of its most highly appreciated features. There are also positive vertical serrations on the back of the slide that further enhance loading or unloading.   The Sig Sauer P238 slide locks to the rear on an empty magazine, and the slide latch release is easy to reach with the thumb of the shooting hand. Similarly, the P238 has a user friendly manual thumb safety which further enhances shooter usability. The Sig Sauer P238 has stippling on the grips for a secure hold while firing the pistol. As mentioned, the frame has a generous beavertail to protect the web between the shooter’s thumb and trigger finger, and the hammer recesses into the beavertail section, to avoid any chance of hammer or slide-bite while firing the pistol. The Sig Sauer P238 is a very compact design, and while it may be slightly heavier than the polymer .380ACP pistols on the market, it is just as small.   We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $629.99.

Description: The Model 586 uses S&W's L frame, with a K-Frame sized grip mated to a larger diameter cylinder. During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson developed its L-Frame line of .357 Magnums known as the Model 581, Model 586, Model 681 and Model 686. The Model 581 had a fixed notch type rear sight, whereas the 586 used a target style adjustable rear sight. These handguns had a major effect on both law enforcement and sporting markets. The 586 was introduced in 1980 and the 581 was discontinued in 1988.
Smith & Wesson makes it possible for you to own a piece of history-in-the-making with these Classic revolvers. They're the finest new handguns possible with designs harkening back to the most famous and collectible guns that Smith & Wesson ever constructed. Each is based on a model known for legendary performance then enhanced with modern advantages. They're the timeless best of both worlds,¬ Smith & Wesson Classics.

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****     The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11 300 finished in our Mil Spec + Cerakote has all the same modularity and functionality as our popular V11 Carbine, but was built to accommodate the versatile .300 Blackout cartridge. This caliber offers projectiles with increased bullet weight which substantially increases its effectiveness on target all while reducing felt recoil to the operator. The DDM4V11 300 features a free-floating Cold Hammer Forged, 16” S2W barrel with 1:8 twist and carbine-length gas system—tuned to reliably cycle a wide range of 300 Blackout cartridges. The V11 features the KeyMod attachment system integrated into our SLiM RAIL 15.0, which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from a Daniel Defense product. The longer 15” rail features an uninterrupted Picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachments at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions, ensuring plenty of real estate for optics and accessories. It also allows maximum sight radius, for more accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights, and provides operators with the option to extend the support hand out closer to the muzzle in order to drive the gun more precisely and help prevent over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Daniel Defense’s rugged Buttstock and Pistol Grip provide the comfort and ergonomics needed for optimal control.   The V11 300 is designed to be shot suppressed and un-suppressed utilizing various types of supersonic and subsonic ammunition.  For reliable operation we recommend .300 supersonic ammunition while shooting un-suppressed, and subsonic ammunition should only be used with a suppressor. The utilization of a “H” weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-suppressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.
