The P250 is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will, designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size (subcompact, compact, or full). After any change, the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes; there are six different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. This full-sized P250 features contrast sights and no manual safety.Manufacturer: Sig SauerModel: P250Caliber: .40 S&WAction: Double ActionBarrel: 4.5""Capacity: 14"

After 30 years of military service, the vz. 52 was eventually replaced by the 9×18mm Makarov caliber vz. 82. The CZ 52 is technically known as the vz. 52 as its Czech military designation, but is often referred to as the CZ 52 to differentiate it from the vz. 52 rifle which entered the export market before the pistol.Model: CZ52Caliber: 762x25mm TokarevBarrel: 4.7""Action: Short recoil operationCapacity: 8"

Astonishing in the sheer detail it amasses, the book is the first comprehensive attempt to catalogue and analyze the crimes of Communism over seventy years.""Revolutions, like trees, must be judged by their fruit,"" Ignazio Silone wrote, and this is the standard the authors apply to the Communist experience―in the China of ""the Great Helmsman,"" Kim Il Sung's Korea, Vietnam under ""Uncle Ho"" and Cuba under Castro, Ethiopia under Mengistu, Angola under Neto, and Afghanistan under Najibullah. The authors, all distinguished scholars based in Europe, document Communist crimes against humanity, but also crimes against national and universal culture, from Stalin's destruction of hundreds of churches in Moscow to Ceausescu's leveling of the historic heart of Bucharest to the widescale devastation visited on Chinese culture by Mao's Red Guards.As the death toll mounts―as many as 25 million in the former Soviet Union, 65 million in China, 1.7 million in Cambodia, and on and on―the authors systematically show how and why, wherever the millenarian ideology of Communism was established, it quickly led to crime, terror, and repression. An extraordinary accounting, this book amply documents the unparalleled position and significance of Communism in the hierarchy of violence that is the history of the twentieth century."""

If only this rifle can talk, the story it will tell.
 
The Rifle is in nice condition for its age. There is no rust on the metal, and most of the factory bluing is still there. Just understand that even in 1944, these rifles didn't have the best metal finish, as they were rushed out of the factory. The wooden furniture is nice, without major cracks or chips. The bore is dark with strong rifling and just need of a good cleaning.  The Mum has been ground off by the Japanese soldier themselves after the surrender. Serials do all match (bolt & receiver).  I HAVE FIRED EXACTLY 20 ROUNDS IN THIS RIFLE AND IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM.

This would make an excellent Form 1 SBR candidate.
I had intended to build this as a PDW/home defense gun, but I decided to go in another direction so this package is on the chopping block.
Everything listed below is new in box except the trigger assembly (lightly used on another gun):
- Palmetto State Armory complete 9mm upper receiver assembly (forged 7075-T6 slick side upper receiver; 7.5” chrome moly steel barrel w/ 1:10 twist, M4 barrel extension, 1/2""-36 TPI threads, birdcage-style flash hider, carbine profile, melonite finish; and PSA 6” M-LOK lightweight rail)
- 1/2""-36 TPI black knurled steel thread protector (Made in USA)
- Palmetto State Armory mil-spec charging handle (standard latch)
- Palmetto State Armory G-9 Hybrid 9mm bolt carrier group (ramped for use with standard AR triggers; works with both Colt- and Glock-pattern lowers)
- Palmetto State Armory AR-15 pistol buffer tube (anodized 7075-T6 aluminum, fluted)
- Palmetto State Armory 9mm steel body buffer assembly
- Palmetto State Armory AR-10 carbine buffer spring (provides better resistance to BCG blowback than AR-15 carbine buffer spring)
- Palmetto State Armory AR-15 castle nut
- Palmetto State Armory AR-15 receiver end plate
- AR Stoner customizable lower parts kit (includes everything but a fire control group and trigger guard)
- ALG Defense ACT (Advanced Combat Trigger) w/ 4.5-lb. and 5.5-lb. hammer springs
- Magpul MOE-K2 grip w/ mounting hardware (perfect for short length-of-pull ARs)
This package is priced at $550 OBO. Again, everything is brand new in the box except the trigger. I removed the flash hider from the barrel and replaced it with the thread protector, but the flash hider and a new crush washer are also included. I can also throw in a Bushnell TRS-25 red dot sight w/ HiRise AR mount for an extra $50.
Buyer must meet me in the Mountlake Terrace area. I’m only looking for cash at this time; no trades. Email me with questions. Serious inquiries only."
