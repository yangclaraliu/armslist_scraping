It has been my recreational rifle I have used it 3 or 4 times a year on my spare time. The Mosin Nagant is not a collectors rifle since I have painted it with camo paint with that being said  the paint job is amateur but still gives the Mosin a rugged look.

This shotgun is fully functional but not pretty. The stock could use a refinishing, there is some surface rust along the barrel (no pittting), the bluing looks thin, the butt plate is marred. The bore is clean, shiny and rust free. This shotgun is bolt action with a 2 shot magazine. I think dad shot deer slugs out of it but check with your local expert first. Here's a blog that one says they have: survivalistboards.com/showthread.php?t=16849    I believe the choke setting ""IC"" is ""Improved Cyclinder"", the others are FULL and MODIFIED choke.

I bought it NIB in 2014 with the intention of shooting match-level .22 rifle competitions, but got sidetracked into 3-gun matches (my new obsession). This rifle is in extremely good condition. I have fired about 100 rounds through it and have cleaned it thoroughly once (outside of regular maintenance). It comes with one magazine, takedown tools, and a case. Multiple features are ambidextrous: charging handles, safeties, and magazine releases. It also has solid backup sights (folding leaf sights). The RX22 enables one to practice tactical rifle skills (e.g., magazine changes, optics usage), but with a less expensive round (.22LR). For an overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz3XW09KG8Q"

It has a 2 3/4 in. pinned barrel and recessed cylinder chambers. The red ramp front sight is also double pinned. The rear sight is adjustable square notch. The very smooth DA trigger can be tuned by an adjustment ring at the bottom of the grip. This is a very well built revolver with great timing and lockup and is a very similar copy of the S&W 629 aesthetically. Not very many of these for sell online. Astra had a good reputation for building quality handguns and this example is in great shape. Comes with Hogue grip that fits good but not perfect. My online research has shown that some K&L frame round butt grips may fit. If you want more pics i will be happy to send them to you. Will not sell.
