They are built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, VEPR's are 50% more reinforced than a standard stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel. The barrel on this rifle is threaded with 14:1 LH threads with an AK-74 style muzzle brake already installed. The VEPR 7.62x39 Rifle features the following: Hammer Forged & Chrome Lined 16.5"" Barrel. Beautiful Walnut thumb-hole butt-stock and hand guards. Side Scope Rail. 1x 30 & 1x 5 Round Mags.

Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.
 
With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the double action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth. 
 
Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.
 
This Kimber Solo is ""Like-New"" with under 25 rounds fired. The Solo only omes with 1 magazine when purchased new, I have an additional magazine if interested unless sold prior to pistol. Can meet in town for sale. Buyer must have a valid NC CHP or Valid Pistol Purchase Permit. This firearm is in excellent condition and comes with everything like new.NO TRADES"

This Colt SAA has only been in the possession of one owner and is now being sold off as the second of many from this collection. This Colt SAA Buntline has never been fired nor does it have a cylinder ring. The Blue Case Hardened finish is pristine and without flaws. This firearm has been locked in a safe for the last 30 plus years.

This Colt Buntline Special (Third Generation) is a 12” long-barreled variant of the Colt Single Action Army revolver that author Stuart N. Lake described in his best-selling but largely fictionalized 1931 biography, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal. This Colt SAA Buntline is brand new in the original Colt Box as purchased in 1982. This Colt SAA has only been in the possession of one owner and is now being sold off as the first of many from this collection. This Colt SAA Buntline has never been fired nor does it have a cylinder ring. The Nickel finish is pristine and without flaws. This firearm has been locked in a safe for the last 30 plus years.

The grip cap is also missing, but it in no way affects performance or ergonomics. It is very clean though, and it comes with a gas cylinder cleaning brush for easy, thorough maintenence of the action. It also comes with the factory stock shim plates, a modified choke tube, and a red fiber optic front sight. It was manufactured in 2013. Previous owner said about 400-500 rds through it, and I've put less than a box through it. It would be a great shotgun for 3-gun competitions or home defense."

It is a replica of the old west Stagecoach guns. Thus the phrase riding shotgun came into existancel. Brother sent it as a Christmas gift, but he collects strange guns from the old West and I do not. I wish he would have just sent me a check instead. Guns are simply tools for me and this one I have no use for. It seems to be well made in the USA and quality of finish is excellant. Cabela's offered me $250 for it, but said it whole sells ~500. Therefore, I am trying to improve my chances of finding someone who would like to have it at a fair market price. Cabela's said it should bring $300-350. It is in the original shipping box, never been put together or fired. You can see it on Stoeger's website. Or, I can take it out of the box and offer some photos of the actual gun. I am not sure what the legalliaties are for shipping guns via mail. I will need proof of the buyer's identification at least. There may also be paperwork or forms to fill out, hopefully not as this is not a handgun or weapon of mass destruction. I can research that if I get an offer. I am totally new to this sight and not all that familiar with their policies. If someone has any suggestions, please feel free to comment. Else, off to Cabela's I will go and get the 250 and buy something I can use from them. Scope, ammunition, powder, whatever. I am in the market for a long range rifle and a trade may work. I like the .243 cal and plan to shoot out to 1,000 yards. Not looking for something for hunting, just one of my bucket list items to try out my skills at sniper ranges just for my own entertainment. You can email me at REDACTED if more correspondence is required. Happy shooting dlg."

I've recently slowed down hunting, and I don't go very often anymore, which is why I'm selling this bow. It comes with a hard Plano case, and the extra arrows you see in the photo. I also have a release, if you don't have one. All together I paid $600 for this setup, but I understand how quickly compound bows depreciate, so I think $450 is a fair deal.

I might consider a trade or a couple of guns on trade but I've had alot of nice stuff and I'm very picky they would have to be in the same condition New or Like New. Sorry I can't upload a photo, my cell and my pc aren't getting along at all. Looks like any other one that you'll look at except the much nicer Ace rear stock."

It is exactly how it comes from the factory with the exception of an upgraded front fiber optic sight, Wilson combat buffer block, full disassembly, clean, and lube, and about 25 rounds function fire. Not a mark on this baby. Comes with original box, all papers, and 2 mags. These ruger 1911's are hands down one, of if not the best low price 1911's out there. The fit and finish is excellent, trigger is great, runs every kind of ammo you throw at it, good groupings, and very Sturdy. They fit the hand nicely with no rough spots and have a very smooth action.  These guns retail new for $650-700. Plus this one has the front sight, buffer block, and it's all ready cleaned and lubed. So I think $550 is a good cash price."

Used in very good condition, no longer imported or manufactured. These are becoming more rare and coveted by the day.
The H&K 91/93 or G3 is part of an integrated weapon system of true interchangeable parts for a multitude of theaters, environments and platforms. All H&K parts are “drop in” with no fitting or machining required. It is designed for reliability, accuracy and ultimate durability. They are well known for being able to cycle half a million rounds with no repairs, only cleaning. This rifle is an absolute dream to own and fire. For the serious firearms user, it is the apex predator and sets the standard in the industry that all others attempt (and fail miserably) to follow. There is a reason every law enforcement community in the world (Starting with the USA) relies very heavily on H&K. There is no comparison. They are the best for a reason. If you demand the very best, look no further. Don’t take my word for it, read the history of where, how and why this weapon is chosen to serve its purpose. The record speaks for itself.

H&K 91/93 .308 (7.62x51 or 7.62 NATO)
