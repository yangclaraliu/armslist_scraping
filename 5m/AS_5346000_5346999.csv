The SKS is a gas-operated rifle that has a spring-loaded bolt carrier and a gas piston rod that work the action via gas pressure pushing against them. Also, it has a ""tilting bolt"" action locking system. The SKS is shorter and less powerful than the semi-automatic rifles that preceded it, such as the Soviet SVT-40. However, the SKS has a 4-inch longer barrel than AK-series rifles, which replaced it; as a result, it has a slightly higher muzzle velocity.The SKS's ten-round box magazine is fed from a stripper clip and rounds stored in the magazine can be removed by depressing a magazine catch located forward of the trigger guard (thus opening the ""floor"" of the magazine and allowing the rounds to fall out). In typical military use the stripper clips are disposable. If necessary they can be reloaded multiple times and reused. While early Soviet models had spring-loaded firing pins, most variants of the SKS have a free floating firing pin within the bolt. Because of this design, care must be taken during cleaning (especially after long storage) to ensure that the firing pin does not stick in the forward position within the bolt. SKS firing pins that are stuck in the forward position have been known to cause accidental ""slamfires"" (uncontrolled automatic fire that empties the magazine, starting when the bolt is released). This behavior is less likely with the hard primer military-spec ammo for which the SKS was designed, but as with any rifle users should properly maintain their firearms. For collectors, slamfires are more likely when the bolt still has remnants of Cosmoline embedded in it. The firing pin is triangular in cross section, and slamfires can also result if the firing pin is inserted upside down.In most variants (Yugoslav models being the most notable exception), the barrel is chrome-lined for increased wear and heat tolerance from sustained fire and to resist corrosion from chlorate-primed corrosive ammunition, as well as to facilitate cleaning. Chrome bore lining is common in military rifles. Although it can diminish actual accuracy, this is not a real limit on practical accuracy in a rifle of this type. The front sight has a hooded post. ""The rear sight is an open notch type which is adjustable for elevation from 100 to 1,000 metres (110 to 1,090 yd). There is also an all purpose ""battle"" setting on the sight ladder (marked ""П""), set for 300 metres (330 yards). This is attained by moving the elevation slide to the rear of the ladder as far as it will go."" ""The Yugoslav M59/66A1 has folddown luminous sights for use when firing under poor light conditions, while the older M59 and M59/66 do not."" All military SKSs have a bayonet attached to the underside of the barrel, which is extended and retracted via a spring-loaded hinge. Both blade and spike bayonets were produced. Some versions, such as the Yugoslavian-made M59/66 variant, are also equipped with a grenade launching attachment. The SKS is easily field stripped and reassembled without any tools and the trigger group and magazine can be removed with an unfired cartridge. The rifle has a cleaning kit stored in a trapdoor in the buttstock, with a cleaning rod running under the barrel, in the same style as the AK-47. In common with some other Soviet-era designs, it trades some accuracy for ruggedness, reliability, ease of maintenance, ease of use, and low manufacturing cost. During World War II, many countries realized that existing rifles, such as the Mosin–Nagant, were too long and heavy and fired powerful cartridges that were effective in medium machine guns with a range in excess of 2,000 metres (2,200 yd), creating excessive recoil. These cartridges, such as the 8×57mm Mauser, .303 British, .30-06 Springfield, and 7.62×54mmR were effective in rifles to ranges of up to 1,000 metres (1,100 yards); however, it was noted that most firefights took place at maximum ranges of between 100 and 300 metres (110 and 330 yards). Only a highly trained specialist, such as a sniper, could employ the full-power rifle cartridge to its true potential. Both the Soviet Union and Germany realized this and designed new firearms for smaller, intermediate-power cartridges. The U.S. fielded an intermediate round in the .30 U.S., now known as the .30 Carbine, and M1 carbines were fielded in large numbers but not as a replacement for the 30-06 round in general use. The German approach was the production of a series of intermediate cartridges and rifles in the interwar period, eventually developing the Maschinenkarabiner, or machine-carbine, which later evolved into the Sturmgewehr 44 Sturmgewehr, or ""storm rifle"", which was produced during the war, chambered in the 7.92×33mm Kurz intermediate round. The Soviet Union type qualified a new intermediate round in 1943, at the same time it began to field the Mosin–Nagant M44 carbine as a general issue small arm. However, the M44, which had a side-folding bayonet and shorter overall length, still fired the full-powered round of its predecessors. A small number of SKS rifles were tested on the front line in early 1945 against the Germans in World War II. Design-wise, the SKS relies on the AVS-36 (developed by the same designer, Simonov) to a point that some consider it a shortened AVS-36, stripped of select-fire capability and re-chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge.  Of course, this viewpoint is problematic, as the AVS uses a sliding block bolt locking device, while the SKS employs a more reliable tilting-bolt design, which is an entirely different style. As the bolt mechanism is one of the defining features of a rifle, having a different bolt means the SKS and AVS merely appear similar in layout, while differing vastly in bolt lockup, caliber, size, and that one has a fixed magazine and the other has a detachable magazine. It also owes a debt to the SVT-40 and M44 that it replaced, incorporating both the semi-automatic firepower of the SVT (albeit in a more manageable cartridge) and the carbine size and integral bayonet of the bolt-action M44. In 1949, the SKS was officially adopted into the Soviet Army, manufactured at the Tula Armory from 1949 until 1955 and the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant in 1953 and 1954. Although the quality of Soviet carbines manufactured at these state-run arsenals was quite high, its design was already obsolete compared to the Kalashnikov which was selective-fire, lighter, had three times the magazine capacity, and had the potential to be less labor-intensive to manufacture. Gradually over the next few years, AK-47 production increased until the extant SKS carbines in service were relegated primarily to non-infantry and to second-line troops. They remained in service in this fashion even as late as the 1980s, and possibly the early 1990s. To this day, the SKS carbine is used by some ceremonial Russian honor guards, much the same way the M14 Rifle is within the United States; it is far less ubiquitous than the AK-47 but both original Soviet SKS rifles and copies can still be found today in civilian hands as well as in the hands of third-world militias and insurgent groups. The SKS was to be a gap-filling firearm manufactured using the proven operating mechanism design of the 14.5×114mm PTRS-41 anti-tank rifle and using proven milled forging manufacturing techniques. This was to provide a fall-back for the radically new and experimental design of the AK-47, in the event that the AK proved to be a failure. In fact, the original stamped receiver AK-47 had to be quickly redesigned to use a milled receiver which delayed production, and extended the SKS carbine's service life."

Serial: 28XXX  
Description: Unconverted Ruger 3 Screws and Flattop-
This early Ruger Super Blackhawk is in pristine condition. It looks to be barely shot.  I put 18 rounds though it to test is, and it ran as smooth as butter. The trigger breaks cleanly at an estimated 4 pounds with no creep. It locks up tight and the timing is right.  Very accurate.  5 rounds in the size of a silver dollar at 10 yards.  The blueing is bright and shiny with little to know wear at all, including cylinder, and the grips are walnut, quite nice with no scrapes on either side. The revolver was made in 1962 and is a “pre-warning”, unmodified, mechanically original - 3 screw model.  It is simply beautiful and looks and functions like new.  Comes with hard case and 100 rounds of 44 magnum.  In this condition, these bring at auction $900-$1000+ in this condition.  There is little to no wear on this powerful fine work of art.  I will try to take more precise pictures if interested, however the blue is not worn, there is no holster wear, and the cylinder has a fine line  -at best, from minimal to no use.  The gun is pristine. The gun functions smooth and perfectly.
Asking Price: $895.00 O.B.O for gun and ammo or Trade + Cash.   Only trade interested in - is a used but in good condition Taurus Tracker 44mag - 4”  or 44 mag Talo plus $400.00 cash or a used Rossi 44 magnum – 2” plus $600  The value of this Ruger in this condition will only go up.

This gun grips Better and points better than a 1911. Finish is almost perfect, internals are excellent and it has hardly been shot. The Tanfoglio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you''ll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot. You can easily convert your Witness steel or polymer frame pistol to shoot .22 LR, 9x 19mm, 10 mm, .38 Super, .40 S&W, or .45 ACP. No matter what your need, one gun can do it all. No other platform gives you the choices, versatility, and value found in the Tanfoglio Witness. Whether you''re a competitive shooter, firearms enthusiast, or armed professional, the Witness product line can fill all your needs. Quality, value, comfort, accuracy and dependability. EAA Witness...No Limit ! European American Armory is proud to be the exclusive importer of Tanfoglio products in the USA."

They deliver SUPERIOR BALLISTICS, SUPERIOR HANDLING, SUPERIOR ACCURACY, and have the LOWEST FELT RECOIL in their size class.


In our pistols, the cartridge is loaded into the back of the magazine. As the slide moves to the rear of the firearm, it strips the round out the back of the magazine.The cartridge is then lifted into the bolt face, and as the slide returns to its resting position, is pushed straight into the chamber. We have eliminated the need for a feed ramp and have tightened up the chamber, reducing out-gassing and directing more pressure to the projectile.
We also utilize a rotating barrel locked breech system. By keeping our barrel, bolt face and slide one piece until the projectile is 20 yards downrange

the XR series dedicates
MORE POWER to the projectile and MORE ACCURACY from a barrel that remains stationary to the bore axis.
 

 Since we are pulling the cartridge out of the back of the magazine and then lifting it up into the bolt face, we are effectively “sneaking” the cartridge past the barrel, allowing our barrels to extend over the top of the magazine. This is how we can offer a very small 5.1 inch pistol (XR9-S, 9mm) with an astonishingly long 3.35 inch barrel! Our XR45-S is 5.7 inches long with a 3.75 inch barrel! The barrels in our subcompacts are as long as many mid and full sized semi-automatics, giving the shooter “FULL SIZED BALLISTICS” in a SUBCOMPACT PISTOL!


A longer barrel means MORE POWER and BETTER ACCURACY!


To add to that, the XR Series pistols do not use a recoil spring. Instead they utilize the lift mechanism and rotating barrel mechanism to absorb felt recoil. These two mechanical actions consume energy far more efficiently than an old school recoil spring does. The spring that runs the length of our slide is a return spring, who’s only function is to return the slide back into it’s resting position. Since we are not using this spring to absorb recoil, we can make it substantially lighter than the other folks, making the XR Series the EASIEST RACKING PISTOL in its size class!

The XR series pistols give you pocket pistol conceal ability with a FULL SIZED PUNCH, when you need it most!"""

Just sitting in the safe!  Sold another one recently, to help someone out, and now I have another reason for selling this one.  There has been stippling added to the polymer frame, the barrel has been fully polished and there has been a color fill done on the lettering. Frame and magazines have color fill.  The gun looks great! I know a few guys that have these and they absolutely love them, but I need to sell mine. The Taurus PT111 Millennium G2 comes with the factory box, paperwork, safety key, sight adjustment key and 2 twelve round magazines. The PT111 is lightweight at 22 oz, has a polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, which makes the newly designed Millennium G2 ideal for a concealed & carry handgun. The Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment! If you are unsure on this one, check out the video on YouTube by hickok45 and you will see that this is definitely a quality and dependable gun to have, without breaking the bank! It has similar features to the Glock, including the easy and & fast way to field strip it, and has similar weight and dimensions to other Glocks, like the width and weight of the Glock 26, and the overall height that is similar to the Glock 19.....................Like I said, this is BRAND NEW and I have NEVER FIRED IT! There have been a few upgrades made, including a FULLY POLISHED BARREL, POLISHED FEED RAMP, SILVER LETTERING and CUSTOM STIPPLING! Stippling was added to the sides of the frame, at the thumb areas and really helps with gun control!...................I am asking $325 (obo).  Let me know if you have questions.  417-818-6one66"

$400 firm in cash or a little better in trade.  
I will consider trades if it's a good deal as I don't need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
A few things I would not mind having more of right now would be, Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Last one I picked-up was the PX4 model new for $600 and came with five mags.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it, let me know if it has extra mags, the capacity, if it has an upgraded trigger etc.  Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts kits without trigger parts, nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY now, so ammo deals will need to be really good.
Nice scopes and optics like Aimpoint and Eotech for future projects, Aimpoint and/or Vortex magnifiers.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars, gold in grams. 
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF or will ship for $40 more in TX.  Since this is classified as a pistol it has to go UPS Overnight, I will require payment up front, of course and copy of your FFL's license before shipping.

Designed as a DMR, the MK220 retains lethal capability out to 800 meters with a varying types of ammunition.The PWS Long Stroke Piston.The PWS long-stroke piston system combines the agility of the AR-15 with the reliability of the AK-47 into a sleek and efficient design.Adjustable Gas BlockPWS four position adjustable gas block restricts gasses, rather than venting them from the side. This allows the unused gas to exit from the front of the gun, rather than the sides of the gas block, resulting in a more quiet operation.  Position One is for normal operation with standard and some military ammunition. Position Two is for use with hotter loads such as military ammunition.  Position Three is for suppressed use when running standard ammunition. Position Four is for suppressed use when running hotter loads. An ""X"" position allows for removal the gas plug for annual maintenance.  Smooth Recoil Impulse  By utilizing a one piece design, the PWS piston system creates a purely gas to metal operation, rather than metal on metal contact that you may see in other designs. That, in addition to the longer dwell time from the increased mass in the Enhanced Bolt Carrier, creates a pushing action rather than a punch. This results in dramatically reduced felt recoil.  QPQ Isonited Barrels  Utilizing only the highest quality chromoly barrel blanks, MK2 barrels are turned in house than Isonite QPQ treated for harness and corrosion.  Profile  PWS barrels are designed with a heavier profile that increases longevity and accuracy, creating a balance between weight savings and sustained durability.  Twist and Chamber  MK2 barrels are button rifled with a 1:10 twist, and are chambered in 6.5 Creedmoor  Bolt Carrier Group  PWS bolt carrier groups are machined from tool steel at strict tolerances, then nickel-Teflon coated for durability and to reduce friction.  Mass  PWS engineers increased carrier mass to extend dwell time and delay unlock. As a result the PWS bolt carrier group allows chamber pressure to be greatly reduced for easier extraction.  Minimized Contact Points  Gaps and channels between skid pads allow for fewer points of contact. This results in less friction and keeps debris from interfering with function.  Bolt  The PWS bolt system is Nickel Teflon coated and optimized for the 6.5 Creedmoor.  Free-Floated Handguards  PWS engineers designed a handguard which is ergonomic as well as durable. Featuring the KeyMod interface, the MK2 series handguard eliminates unnecessary weight and allows for a wide range of accessory placement.  Extruded  Handguards are extruded, then machined from aircraft grade 6061 aluminum.  Picatinny Top Rail  Impact extruded, then machined from aircraft grade 6061 aluminum, every handguard comes standard with a full-length Picatinny top rail and two 2 inch Picatinny sections.  QD Attachments  Integral sling swivel attachment points round out the front and back of the handguard.  KeyMod  The KeyMod Interface System was developed for multiple accessory compatibility without the need for Picatinny rails surrounding your handguard. This improved design enhanced the rail's comfort and functionality without sacrificing strength and durability.  Upper and Lower Forgings  Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is as light as possible, mil-spec 7075 aluminum forgings are used for the upper and lower receivers. Each upper and lower are meticulously CNC-machined for perfect fit and function.   Coating  After machining and blasting, all aluminum parts are Hardcoat Anodized at Type III Mil-Spec, for corrosion and wear resistance.  Magpul Furniture  All PWS rifles ship with durable Magpul furniture.  Enhanced Buffer Tube  Machined from one piece of 6061 aircraft-grade aluminum, PWS engineers were able to pack more features into the PWS buffer tube.  Goodbye Castle Nut  Eliminating the cast nut, the PWS EBT's unique indexing screw and plate system ensures secure fit and precise alignment.  Carrier Tilt  Features a lip that extends into the receiver to support the back of the carrier to compensate for carrier tilt.  QD Attachments  Unlike aftermarket items, PWS EBT QD attachments are machined directly into the aluminum for durability and weight savings.  Debris  MK1 buffer tubes are fluted, creating channels for debris, and feature four drain holes on the bottom to allow for faster water drainage.  PWS Buffer  Low contact points allow debris to fall into channels, while the Nickel Teflon coating keeps carbon from sticking. PWS machinists engrave the PWS logo directly into the 4140 carbon steel.  Specifications Weight  9lbs , 7oz  Overall Length  39.5""  Barrel Length  20""  Muzzle Device: PRC - The PWS Precision Rifle Compensator was designed to reduce the maximum amount of felt recoil while allowing the shooter to maintain an accurate sight picture of the intended target."

They deliver SUPERIOR BALLISTICS, SUPERIOR HANDLING, SUPERIOR ACCURACY, and have the LOWEST FELT RECOIL in their size class.


In our pistols, the cartridge is loaded into the back of the magazine. As the slide moves to the rear of the firearm, it strips the round out the back of the magazine.The cartridge is then lifted into the bolt face, and as the slide returns to its resting position, is pushed straight into the chamber. We have eliminated the need for a feed ramp and have tightened up the chamber, reducing out-gassing and directing more pressure to the projectile.
We also utilize a rotating barrel locked breech system. By keeping our barrel, bolt face and slide one piece until the projectile is 20 yards downrange

the XR series dedicates
MORE POWER to the projectile and MORE ACCURACY from a barrel that remains stationary to the bore axis.
 

 Since we are pulling the cartridge out of the back of the magazine and then lifting it up into the bolt face, we are effectively “sneaking” the cartridge past the barrel, allowing our barrels to extend over the top of the magazine. This is how we can offer a very small 5.1 inch pistol (XR9-S, 9mm) with an astonishingly long 3.35 inch barrel! Our XR45-S is 5.7 inches long with a 3.75 inch barrel! The barrels in our subcompacts are as long as many mid and full sized semi-automatics, giving the shooter “FULL SIZED BALLISTICS” in a SUBCOMPACT PISTOL!


A longer barrel means MORE POWER and BETTER ACCURACY!


To add to that, the XR Series pistols do not use a recoil spring. Instead they utilize the lift mechanism and rotating barrel mechanism to absorb felt recoil. These two mechanical actions consume energy far more efficiently than an old school recoil spring does. The spring that runs the length of our slide is a return spring, who’s only function is to return the slide back into it’s resting position. Since we are not using this spring to absorb recoil, we can make it substantially lighter than the other folks, making the XR Series the EASIEST RACKING PISTOL in its size class!

The XR series pistols give you pocket pistol conceal ability with a FULL SIZED PUNCH, when you need it most!"""

Like many rifles like it, it developed feeding issues that I resolved by replacing the throat, riser and spring with the Brownell’s kit.  It now functions flawlessly.  I have added a Badger Bullpup stock, vertical fore grip, red/green dot optic, and a Williams fiber-optic front sight. There are some finish issues on the barrel, and I have shown them in the pictures.  Please note that it had a Williams fiber optic rear sight, but it slid out of the dovetail holder and I lost it.  Not pictured are the sling mounts and side rails, but they are included in the sale.
You can purchase a brand-new magazine fed version of this on Gunbroker for about $270, plus shipping and FFL fees (http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=538460346).  Also, that rifle would not have the vertical fore grip, red/green dot optic, and a Williams fiber-optic front sight.
I am offering this rifle for $200.  If you do not think it is worth it, no problem.  I don’t have to get rid of it, but I would like to thin the herd before I move."

7 boxes of Monarch Steel FMJ rounds 50 per box. You can buy these on Black Friday if they have not sold out for $9 a box at Academy (after tax cost then is $9.72) .  Right now they are priced $10.99 a box.  I also have one box of these Monarch 9 MMs FJB but with brass, the box was 10 rounds short where I put in higher quality Winchester 147 grain brass FMJ to make the whole box.   Those go for $12.99 a box (with tax equals $14.02).   The three white boxes are Winchester FJM 9 mm 115 grain rounds that are brass that usually go for $13.99 a box ($15.10 after tax).  I will take $90 for all these FMJ rounds.
Additionally I have two boxes of Liberty Defense (40 rounds total) 9 FMJ +P hollow point.  These are the fastest 9 mm rounds made and are particularly effective out of a 9 mm carbine where the long barrel accelerates velocity by making use of all the powder.  Ammo Depot presently has these priced at $20.97 a box before tax, the Academy Box has $21 per box on them.  I will sell the two boxes I have for $30.   If you buy all the FMJ rounds above too, I will sell all this for $110."
