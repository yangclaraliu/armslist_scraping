I prefer a face-to-face sale, but I will ship in-state directly to you, no middleman, no FLL dealer required!  However, the money must be in my hands before I will ship.  I will also drive within a 100 mile radius of Jacksonville to meet you.
 
This is an AMT AUTOMAG III 30-Carbine, FACTORY NEW in BOX, NEVER FIRED!  Tell Dirty Harry to move over, you have this incredible Automag III! 
 
The Automag III is also called the “flame thrower” for the fire that comes out of the barrel when you shoot!  I have another one of these hand-cannons that I shoot and keep for self-defense – it is an awesome weapon, never jams, extremely powerful (the .30-carbine goes through body armor, cracks engine blocks, etc), never rusts, and the gun with its 6.5 inch barrel is super accurate!  Try a hollow point or soft point 30-carbine load, it packs a wallop!  But, then it should, this is rifle ammunition in a pistol. Go ahead, make Dirty Harry’s day, buy this hand-cannon.
 
My selling price of $1,400 is firm.  In fact, my selling price for a FACTORY NEW, NEVER FIRED AMT AUTOMAG III is less than the price a Used Automag! 
 
Hurry, this is an incredible bargain! 
 
Obviously, my selling price of $1,400 is firm!   Trades? I will only trade for an Auto Ordnance 1927 Thompson semi auto, w/finned barrel, new condition in box. Unless you have a NEW Thompson, I am NOT interested in any trade!"
