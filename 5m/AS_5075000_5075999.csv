This concept and uniform flexing and strength are related and inherent features of the spiral design. Stress concentration results in a weak point where progressive shear failure starts and premature fatigue occurs. SPIROL Coiled Pins have no weak points.  Uniform Strength and Flexibility The shear strength and flexibility of SPIROL’s Coiled Pin is not affected by the direction of force. Compression causes the pin to coil from the outer edge inwardly towards the center. As the pressure is relieved, which happens in shock and vibration, the pin action reverses thereby maintaining a constant radial force. Application of an excessive load results in compression into a solid tube. Further loading causes shear failure. In properly engineered applications, this condition should not occur.  Absorbs Shock and Vibration The SPIROL Coiled Pin design represents broad design latitude in the control and development of pin flexibility.  The engineered flexibility of SPIROL Coiled Pins provides for compression of the pin into the hole and for continued flexibility after insertion. Without this flexibility, the total load applied to the pin would be transmitted to the hole wall without dampening the impact. Since the host material is normally softer than the pin, elongation or enlargement of the hole would result. The fit between the hole and the pin would become loose, increasing the impact force and accelerating the rate of hole damage. The inevitable result would be premature failure of the assembly. In properly engineered applications, the flexibility of SPIROL Coiled Pins dampens shock and vibration, thus eliminating hole damage to all the components of the assembly resulting in maximum product life.  The smooth, concentric chamfer combined with square, clean-cut ends translates into trouble-free installation.  Inward motion from compression  Reverse motion when pressure is relieved.  Square Ends SPIROL Coiled Pins have clean, square cut ends. This has a substantial impact on trouble-free automatic installation as the square ends enable the pin to align itself with the installation punch/quill to ensure the pin remains straight as it is inserted into the hole. The cleancut ends also impart a quality image to the assembly. Swaged Chamfers SPIROL Coiled Pins have a smooth, concentric lead-in chamfer with a radius which blends into the diameter of the pin. There are no sharp angles or edges to bite into the hole wall. The swaged chamfer provides maximum compression leverage with minimum thrust resistance to ease insertion. The chamfer concentricity assists in alignment of holes.  Only Coiled Pins utilize the coiled spring concept; a recognized superior pin design. This imparts to SPIROL Coiled Pins unique features not found in other Spring Pins or Solid Pins. More than fasteners, SPIROL Coiled Pins are also shock absorbing elements which are integral, active components of a total assembly. There are other pinning methods, but when the total assembly’s manufacturing cost, quality and useful life are important, the pin of choice is the SPIROL Coiled Pin.  Closer Diameter Tolerances SPIROL Coiled Pins have a closer diameter tolerance than any other Spring Pin. At least 270° of the outer circumference is within the specified tolerance range. The minimum diameter is not averaged, as is the case with other Spring Pins. The edge of the seam is designed to be tucked below the hole diameter to prevent the edge from contacting the host. These factors combine to make SPIROL Coiled Pins ideal for hinge, axle, and dowel applications. Other Advantages Lower Insertion Pressure –  Radial Tension Standard and light duty SPIROL Coiled Pins require less pressure to insert than other Spring Pins. In addition, these pins exert less radial tension, an important factor where holes are in thin sections or close to an edge. It is also important when using soft, weak or brittle materials such as aluminum or plastic. The benefit is lower component damage and fewer rejects. An added benefit to lower insertion force is insertion machinery can use smaller cylinders, and if manually installed, the assembler is less subject to fatigue or repetitive motion syndrome.  Conforms to Hole The thin gauge material and the 2¼ coiled construction gives the pin a greater inherent ability to conform itself radially and longitudinally to the hole wall. It can be used in out-of-round and tapered holes without negatively affecting its performance. SPIROL Coiled Pins develop a mean radial pressure without excessive high points which would result in hole damage upon insertion or under loading. Other types of Spring Pins typically have three points of contact between the pin and the hole which results in focused stress over a limited contact surface area. On the contrary, SPIROL Coiled Pins maximize contact between the pin and the hole resulting in better load distribution and reduced possibility of hole damage.  Reusable When driven from a hole, the SPIROL Coiled Pin expands towards its original diameter. The same pin may be reused in the same hole. Wider Hole Tolerance Range SPIROL Coiled Pins can be installed in holes with a wide diameter tolerance. Holes can be drilled according to normal shop practices, drills can be used longer, and the feed rate of the drills can be maximized. Drilling can be eliminated completely by utilizing molded, cast, and stamped holes. No secondary hole preparation is necessary to be able to use a Coiled Pin.  Straightness Although the straightness specifications are technically the same, carbon steel Coiled Pins of longer length in relationship to diameter are straighter than roll-formed Slotted Pins. The stresses imparted during the heat treating process distort long Slotted Pins into a ""banana shape"" caused by the material stretching at the slot and contracting 180º opposite the slot. Straightness is important in numerous applications and for trouble-free insertion."

This is Made by GSG and imported by ATI. It is a model Kalashnikov and is chambered in 22LR. This is in decent shape but does have obvious signs of use and wear on the paint/finish. These could likely be touched up with a paint pen, or just leave them like they are because any gun that gets used gets marks! This comes with the gun and one 24rd magazine. I got this in trade and would keep it, but I just have too many 22lr rifles as it is. I have not had the chance to shoot this, but it actions fine from everything I can tell. These are surprisingly hard to find given what they are, and this has a real pretty wooden stock compared to the armscor and other versions and has the normal loose fit as to be expected. I would also consider trades on this. Would be open to Glock 9mms, 357 mag/38spl revolvers, or other items that catch my interest. Some trades will need boot on your end, some will need it on mine. Just be fair with your values and I will do the same. Shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Thanks for looking and happy hunting, JB"

These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission. Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.Cash/Certified Funds/Venmo Only.No Trades.Private Transfer Background check to be paid for by buyer."

Equipped with the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.Enter the GripZone: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.The GripZone doesn't stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand grip relief and High-Hand beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol's felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you'll want to pick up the new XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact.SpecificationsCaliber  9mm  Recoil System  Dual Spring with Full Length Guide Rod  Sights  Fiber Optic Front, Low Profile Combat Rear  Weight (With Empty Magazine)  26 Ounces with Compact Magazine 27 Ounces with X-Tension  Height  4.75 Inches with Compact Magazine 5.5 Inches with X-Tension  Slide  Forged Steel Melonite Finish  Barrel  3 Inch Hammer Forged, Steel, Melonite 1:10 Inch Twist  Length  6.25 Inches  Grip Width  1.19 Inches  Frame   FDE Polymer   Magazines  1-13 Round Compact 1-16 Round with X-Tension Stainless Steel"
