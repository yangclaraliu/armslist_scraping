If you're looking to buy a 1911 in Michigan, this is the best one listed by far.  The trigger is reduced from what was a 4.5 lb pull to a 2.5 lb.  It is a huge improvement over stock.  In addition, I added a full-fit Wilson Combat high-grip beavertail, which helps tremendously getting a higher grip over the standard beavertail.  The generous grip texturing and VZ grips provide tremendous control.  Forget the wood grips!  People at the range think I'm firing a 9mm due to how much control is had with these modifications.  You'll really love it!The only reason I’m selling this is to fund a custom 1911 pistol from Wilson Combat.  This Springfield 1911 was my ""gateway drug"" to Wilson.

This is an amazingly accurate long range hunting or sniper rifle for an even more amazingly reasonable price. The rifle has under 60 rounds through it and has been to an indoor range only twice.  The first range trip I zeroed it and the second I spent maybe 2 hours sinking .50 inch groups at 100 yards from a bench rest. Other than that, it has been sitting in my safe well lubed and untouched. It is immaculate with no signs of wear. This rifle will make a great deer hunting rifle or SHTF sniper rifle. I have included all the factory paperwork, box, child lock, and a sling.  As to why I am selling it, I have plenty of 30 caliber rifles and I simply don't have a need for it anymore at this point. Like the rest of you, I am trying to make more room in my safe.These rifles are currently running $370 - $390 on Bud's Gun Shop, Gunbroker, and Cheaper than Dirt websites. Throw in $15 for shipping and $30 for FFL and you are in for over $400. My price represents a 30% discount over buying this new online. As such, my asking price is fair and firm. I am not interested in trades or cash plus trades. I conduct all of my transactions at Young Guns in Apex, NC. We will conduct a proper FFL transfer of the rifle from me to you. I will pay the transfer fee."

-- This is a CA Compliant 995 which means it has a ""bullet button"" that you'll need a tool to pop the magazine out with, and also that you won't be able to buy one this after Jan 1, 2017 -- so get it while you can.  This is a great little gun -- pretty accurate, fun to shoot, and has always been reliable for me.  Already has a front grip so you're halfway there to mounting a light or a laser on the front rail, which Hi-Point makes for cheap (see yellow accessory list in pic).  Hi-Point's also have a lifetime warranty.  Reason for selling is that I don't feel like registering this as an ""assault weapon,"" and I might put the money into an actual AR platform if I want to be on the list, before they can't be purchased anymore.
This is a PPT sale through an FFL, and buyer pays all fees.  No tax for PPT though.
-----
I also have a Hi-Point C9 9mm for sale, about 200 rounds through it also. Comes with a hard case, two 8-rd mags, all original extras, and I'll throw in a box of 20 JHP rounds.  Asking $200 but if it doesn't sell I may go to $175.  I'm not gonna lie though, the C9 is kind of shitty.  Not that this particular one is shitty, they are just shitty in general.  It's not very accurate, and there are a lot of FTF or FTE issues, even with good ammo.  Still, if you pull the trigger it goes bang if there's a round in it, and sometimes that's better than nothing at all.  Reason for selling is I got to shoot a few better, more accurate handguns, and now I want one.
---------
If you want both, first $500 takes them both.  May also trade for an AR-15 with cash on my end, or for a full-size, reliable, 10-rd pistol like a Springfield XD, Beretta, or Glock.  Tell me what you've got."

Comes with a hard case, two 8-rd mags, all original extras, and I'll throw in a box of 20 JHP rounds.  Asking $200 but if it doesn't sell I may go to $175.
I'm not gonna lie though, the C9 is kind of shitty.  Not that this particular one is shitty, they are just shitty in general.  It's not very accurate, and there are a lot of FTF or FTE issues.  Still, if you pull the trigger it goes bang if there's a round in it, and sometimes that's better than nothing at all.  It was a good just-in-case gun when I didn't have any money, but now I want something better.This is a PPT sale through an FFL, and buyer pays all fees.  No tax for PPT though.
---------
I also have a Hi-Point 9mm carbine for sale, good condition, about 200 rds through it.  Includes sling (unmounted), front grip and 2 10-rnd magazines-- and I'll throw in a box of 100 rounds.  Asking $350 but if it doesn't sell I may go to $325.
-- This is a CA Compliant 995 which means it has a ""bullet button"" that you'll need a tool to pop the magazine out with, and also that you won't be able to buy one after Jan 1, 2017 -- so get it while you can.  This is a great little gun -- pretty accurate, fun to shoot, and has always been reliable for me.  Already has a front grip so you're halfway there to mounting a light or a laser on the front rail, which Hi-Point makes for cheap (see yellow accessory list in pic).  Hi-Point's also have a lifetime warranty.  Reason for selling is that I don't feel like registering this as an ""assault weapon,"" and I might put the money into an actual AR platform if I want to be on the list.
-----
 
If you want both, first $500 takes them both.  May also trade for an AR-15 with cash on my end, or for a full-size, reliable, 10-rd pistol like a Springfield XD, Beretta, or Glock.  Tell me what you've got."

Only 200 rounds through this thing and it's s blast to shoot. Only reason I'm looking to get rid of it is because I'd like to get a smaller carry gun like a Glock 19 or Glock 43. If you have a trade in mind if be more than happy to mull it over. Thanks.

The rifle shoots 105gr berger VLD's with consistent groups in the .2-.3"" range and sub 4"" groups at 600 yards. Exactly 200 rounds fired. This would make a fantastic benchrest/F-class/target/varmint gun for someone looking to do some long range work. The rifle is incredibly easy to shoot due to a fantastic trigger, very adjustable and comfortable stock, literally no recoil and significant weight making it very stable. The Nightforce benchrest scope is one of the best long range target/varmint scopes made, very clear glass and a great reticle for very precise shooting. The 6BR is a very accurate cartridge, easy to load for and has a very long barrel life. Included with the rifle are 200 pieces of once fired lapua brass and whidden gun works dies ($400 worth of reloading equiptment).Open to trades."
