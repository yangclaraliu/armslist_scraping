The SP5K is designed and manufactured to meet the definition of a civilian pistol and marks the return of the roller delayed blowback system to an HK commercial product. This operating system is legendary in its accuracy and reliability. Originally developed on the Heckler & Koch G3 rifle, it has been used on several HK firearms.
The SP5K retains many of the critical features of the MP5, including its precision machined components and attention-to-detail quality. The SP5K is manufactured completely in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany.
The SP5K is a safe, robust, ergonomic large frame handgun. For more comfortable shooting, the SP5K is equipped with an elastic “bungee” sling. The sling is easily installed by snapping it onto the sling swivel hardware located on the rear of the receiver. Using the sling makes firing the SP5K more stable and reduces fatigue.
The overall length of the SP5K is approximately 14 inches — slightly longer than an MP5K — due to its unique handguard. The SP5K hand guard is designed with special ergonomic and safety features to protect the shooter’s hand and provide a comfortable and stable grip.
Despite its size, the SP5K is well suited for sporting use. Using the proven roller delayed blowback system; the SP5K’s inherent accuracy makes it an excellent choice for target shooting and an ideal home security arm.
And a wide variety of accessories can be added to increase its functionality. A Picatinny rail scope mount is attached to the upper receiver and allows for optional sights to be easily mounted. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK SP5K is a faithful rendering of the iconic MP5K as a semi automatic pistol.We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

Great gun. Bought it for the girlfriend about 2 or 3 months ago. Turns out she likes her Glock better. Gun shoots great. We put a little over 2-300 rounds through it. It comes with 2 mags and everything from the factory (like the case and back straps) the gun has brand new tru glo TFO's ( tritium fiber optic ) night sights installed. They are really bright during both day and night conditions. All laws applymust be picked up locallytxt at nine one nine-four three four-five five two one or email.$400 the gun itself was $515 and the sights were $100 so 400 is fair. thanks y'all.

Built around our newest 18” Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel, this platform delivers the speed, controllability, and precision required to engage the most difficult multi-gun stages. The V7 Pro comes standard with the new MFR XS 15.0 M-LOK® rail, which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. An uninterrupted Picatinny rail on top and M-LOK attachment points ensure plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allow for the maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The long 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and it prevents over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnifed optics. The newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb. A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset. Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle-length gas system, this allows for shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue. The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Gun is NOT for sale at this time. Trade only!Love it or hate it, the Beretta 92/96 series is a high quality & well-made pistol. I would like to trade for something of equal quality and value.I Prefer straight trades in the San Diego area. Cash and/or ammo can be added on either side of the trade and I will travel within the county for the right deal.This Beretta 96 was made in 1998. It has all its metal parts and a straight dust cover. It is a PS model which stands for Police Special. Aside from a slightly different finish it is the same as a 96 FS + night sights and additional magazines supplied when new. The night sights are 18 years old and will need re-charging but still function well as three dot sights. Included are 2 10 round magazines and the older style blue plastic Beretta box. I’m the second owner and from what I was told from 1st owner plus what I’ve fired the total round count is 400. This was private owned since 1998, never a police trade in."

$1,000 firm in cash or a little better in trade.  At a few places I found this one still in stock, it was selling for $1,000-$1,100 before any other fees.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and the folding brace.  If you are looking for an M9 or 92FS to throw in the truck, this one may not be for you, so please make sure the value is there on any trade offers.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

$950 cash or a little better in trade.  Looking for Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"
