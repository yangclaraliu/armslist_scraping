This is one of the best combined packages for sale today. The package addresses all weaknesses of the M&P9, capitalizes on its strengths, and includes an in-waistband holster from arguably the best manufacturer in the market. Bonus, also includes an in-waistband mag-carrier!Details about the pistol:
 Smith & Wesson M&P94.25” barrelAPEX Tactical aluminum flat face trigger & sear kit (part number 100-054)Ameriglo I-dot night sightsTalon grips2 x 17 round magazines includedThe trigger kit makes this gun blow the doors off any polymer pistol from a shootability standpoint. No more floppy stock trigger and the pull is short with a crisp break. The difference in accuracy and follow-up shot speed is incredible. There is a reason APEX can’t keep these kits in stock and APEX has a huge following. It’s that good. This trigger kit is worth $170 not including installation!
True to any carry pistol, night sights are installed along with Talon grips. Please note that I only have the narrow back strap. The medium and large backstraps are not included.
Also included is a StealthGear USA in-waistband (IWB) holster and double-mag pouch. Having worn several other leather backed IWB holsters, I have found Steathgear to be the Mercedes Benz of IWB gear. Completely comfortable! The holster and magazine pouch go for about $100 and $70 respectively if bought new.
Why the sale? I’m selling this to fund the purchase of a Wilson Combat gun. So, not looking to entertain trades.
Price is $695, which is perfectly reasonable considering the combined package offer.
Buyer must have CPL.
 
Please don’t hesitate to ask me questions.

While I do like today’s polymer pistols, there is nothing like the feel of a 1911. The only reason I’m selling this is to fund a custom 1911 pistol from Wilson Combat. 
Pistol Details:
45 ACP5” Match grade competition barrel20 LPI front grip checkering30 LPI rear grip checkeringNovak-style adjustable rear sightDawson Precision fiber optic front sight (replaced stock blacked out sight)Wilson combat extended magazine releaseWilson combat magazine well3lb match grade trigger jobVZ Operator II GripsManufactured and assembled in the U.S.A.  Slide and frame are forged!2 x 7-round magazines70-series trigger system. No 80-series nonsense!!!
Steel is real! The Trophy Match is one of the best made and valued 1911 pistols every made. Springfield no longer makes this pistol today in favor of the Loaded series, which features a light rail and fixed rear sights. The previous owner of this gun had a trigger job done to it and the gunsmith I use measured it at 3 lbs. From the factory they’re around 5 lbs. Love the feel of this trigger compared to other 1911s! Light yet very predictable break. Under my ownership, I’ve added a Dawson Precision fiber optic front sight. Also, I added VZ Operator II grips. A huge difference over the slippery wooden grips that come stock. It has a few extremely minor scuffs, but they’re hard to notice unless you’re really looking for them.
Please note this item does not include a case. You should have a range bag by now!
Additional high-resolution pictures available upon request.
Price is $1150, quite a deal considering the trigger job, sights, magwell, and grips.
Buyer must have CPL.

They measure 35'x15'. Won them off govliq, and I can't come up with a good reason to keep them, nor can I store them any more. If you're not familiar with the Drash tent then you need to know that it weighs close to 700 pounds and calls for 6 people to set it up.  Everything is already attached (inner/outer liner and poles). You just need to spread out the poles, then get everybody to lift and it pops into shape. Probably only takes about 15 minutes to get it up, plus however much time to pound the stakes in. The one is well-used but still serviceable. I never unpacked the other one so I can't make any promises but I assume it's in similar shape. I have some stakes and repair parts as well. I had one sold quickly on eBay for $750 but the dude couldn't arrange shipping so I'm looking for a face to face deal. Make me an offer on one or both. Love trades. Prefer handguns, bullpups and motorized toys, but will consider just about anything.  Can help with delivery.  I have pictures when I set the one up and can dig them up and send them to you if you are interested."
