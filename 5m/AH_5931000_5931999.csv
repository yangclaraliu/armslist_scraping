Even if you aren't interested in buying it, the pictures are worth looking at and that is free ;-)Designed to be small and compact for easy carry conceal or small storage areas, this Model 36 J-frame has a pinned 1.875 inch (sometimes called a 2 inch) barrel. It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder, case-hardened trigger, and case-hardened exposed hammer with single or double action.This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a bright shiny nickel finish and has wood grips with serial numbers that match the square butt frame.This thirty-six year old classic revolver is in beautiful condition. It had 25 rounds fired through it by the previous owner, so it was not new in the box but oh so close. That gave me license to take it out this morning to the gun range to put 15 more rounds through it as I was firing my other .38 Special revolver.As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is an accurate and fun gun. While this gun is pretty enough to just put up somewhere and admire, it is dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun.Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Please contact me for several additional pictures. Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."

With only a barrel swap and resizeing standard .223/5/56 brass, users can achieve a lower cost option to other 6.5 cartridges.I stepped into this wildcat a few years ago, and have enjoyed playing with it. I've shot it from 50 out to 300 yds and had great success with 100gr Amax and Nosler BT, even took a couple of while tail deer down in G.A. with it.I've got the itch to try another wildcat, but need to sell one barrel to finance another.Included in the package: - 20"" Black Hole Weaponry p3 barrel, 1-8 twist, chambered in 6.5 PCC (SS w/black shot peened finish, threaded 5/8-24) - aprox 400 rounds fired through it.  - Your choice of A2 flash hider or brake.  - Low pro gas block (set screw).  - ASC steel 5 round mag (allows longer COL, up to 2.300).  - Custom Lee Full Length resizing die/Seating die/Factory Crimp die.  - 300 pieces of fireformed brass, resized, trimmed, cleaned and ready to load (mix of Lake City, Winchester & WCC headstamps)  - Frankford 50 round plastic ammo case (accommodates longer COL rounds)  - Several dummy rounds for setting dies (100gr Nosler BT, 120 Amax w/tip removed, 95gr V-Max, 90gr Speer TNT)Barrel was $350, Custom order Dies were $128.

My dad passed and I do not need them. The first is a Remington 760 (pump action 30-06). It does have some surface rust, but it comes with one magazine. It does not have a scope, just iron sights. I also have a Winchester Model 94 lever action 30-30. This gun was my grandfathers and I believe was purchased in the 60's. Both rifles work, and I had them appraised. The Winchester is worth $800 as is. I would like $650, might go down to $600. The 760 is worth about $400, I would take $300. The 30-06 needs some work, I could do it, but if I did I would ask a little more. Would give a better deal if you buy both.

A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.
Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.
The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.
P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger
A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.
Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.
During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures."

Both slide and frame are machined from solid steel and wear matte black KimPro II, a non-refl ective finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to wear, salt and the elements. The Warrior also has an extended ambidextrous thumb safety, plus a short (military length) guide rod for fast takedown. Kimber G-10 grip panels ensure a positive grip regardless of conditions, and a lanyard ring off ers additional retention options. Standard Kimber features like match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing ensure unequaled accuracy. Warrior pistols include a 7-round magazine with extended bumper for fast, positive loading, as well as an extended ambidextrous thumb safety that allows fast operation with either hand. The best pistol to carry is a 1911, and the best 1911 is a Kimber. The aggressive G10 Tactical Grips are a Kimber first, as is the new forward-slanting wedge shape of the rear sight. Also, the Warrior does not incorporate the Kimber Series II system."

The onl thing that is wrong with it is the lamination they used back then peeled as i was told by Remington and other than that it has very ittle scratches or dond in stock ,much less than you would expect for a 76 year old rifle.I brought  it to a gunsmith to be checked out and was informed that the rifle may of had a box or so of ammo put through it as the gun smith pointed out to me a gate inside the reciever where the rounds come op and slide into the chamber was still all blued were a used rifle the shells will wear the bluing off and this one is still blued,i have put 10 rounds through it and it shoot great with no jamming,it does have original sling mounts and come with 3 four round magazines.The bore is in perfect condition and will make an excellent hunting rifle,if someone redid the stock as far as sand of the old lamination and laminated it with a good quality clear lamination it would look almost like a brand new rifle.MUST HAVE PROPER ID AND PASS A FBI CHECK,You need to pick up in Putney VT. and pay FFL costs that are $35.00.

Magazines) equipped with full, Modified and Cylinder Bore Choke Tubes and Wrench, Adjustable Rear Sight, Manual *accepts mka-1919 extended magazines FROM THE MANUFACTURER   ""This shotgun is identical to the MKA 1919 Akdals, imported by at least two companies, and marketed in the $700 price range. Its only difference, apart from the lettering, is actually an improvement. This AR12 has a cosmetically correct gas tube linkage piece between its forend and the front sight. This is the Leader Arms AR12 shotgun. Type is Benelli style action built into an AR15 style platform. Not, mind you, that it will accept an AR Upper; it will not. Type is gas operated semi automatic shotgun. Manufacturer is Leader Arms Technology in Kizilay, Republic of Turkey. Importer is PW Arms of Redmond, WA. Distributor and Warrantor is AR57 llc of Monroe, WA. Chambering is 12 gauge, 2 3/4 inch and 3 inch shells interchangeably. Construction is steel barrel, bolt, gas tube, magazines and internal parts, with alloy upper receiver and magazine release; and polymer lower receiver, trigger, forend or barrel sheath, and faux upper gas tube. Barrel is 18 1/2 inch standard bore, furnished with a total of 4 Benelli thread choke tubes and wrench, .712 improved cylinder steel ok slug ok; .704 modified steel ok; .695 improved modified no steel no slug; and .688 full no steel no slug. Sights are fixed .140 partridge blade front with removable AR type windage and elevation adjustable, black blade rear. Forend assembly has a 27 slot Picatinny rail, with a receiver integral 21 slot rail behind it. Bolt handle is knurled Beretta type. Safety is standard AR two position lever for a right handed shooter. Gas mechanism is housed inside the forend, and operates much the same way as a Beretta shotgun, with heavy and light load settings possible. Magazines are factory steel body, with steel springs, polymer shell follower and floorplate. Each mag holds 5 rounds of 12 gauge 2 3/4 inch or 3 inch shells. Magazines with up to 24 rounds are readily available throughout the US, since this is exactly the same shotgun as the MKA 1919 except for its cosmetic gas tube above its barrel. Trigger is .325 polymer two stage, pulls in the 10 pound vicinity with moderate felt creep and overtravel. Buttstock is fixed black polymer; its length of pull is 14 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 1 inch rubber recoil pad. Buttstock has no cant or drop, since the rear sight blade is 2 1/2 inches above the comb. Weight empty is 8 pounds, with center of gravity at the breech face."""

The barrel is threaded to accept standard 3/8 x 24 RH devices, this is due to it being one of the models that did not come pre-threaded. I have put through about 50 rounds just to test function it and sight in. The prior owner was the original and put no more than 300 rounds through it, so it is still virtually new, in the life of these barrels. This rifle will need to be shipped to an FFL.

Looking for a quick sale.Stuff included and what it cost me:stock Saiga 308 rifle $800Kushnapup bullpup stock $300gas tube rail $50red dot sight $50ammunition $200-$250 (probably like 10 boxes of ammo mostly brass and a couple boxes of steel)surefire magazines ($50 each) $100rigidity plate, sling loops, stubby rails and various other odds and ends $100time and effort put into a nice paint job... pricelessanyway, there's at least 1500 into this gun. You won't find a cheaper bullpup rifle that's as tough as a saiga that shoots 308."
