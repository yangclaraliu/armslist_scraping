PLEASE DON'T WASTE MY TIME. THIS IS A HARD TO FIND GUN FOR SALE!Very nice and rare S&W 1006 in 10mm up for sale. This gun is the queen/king of 10mm pistols. Built like a tank and capable of handling the hottest of 10mm loads. Less then 28,000 made and each day they are harder and harder to find. This beauty comes with 2 mags and 3 boxes of hollow points(black talons, hydro shocks, Winchester subsonic). Even the ammo it comes with is rare(Black Talons) and what better to load into this beauty. Gun is in perfect condition and has about 500 rounds through it with most being hot 40cal and not true 10mm. It has eaten up about 100 rounds of the doubletap and underwood full power loads without a single issue. This gun can also shoot lead nose bullets unlike a Glock 20 or 29 which due to it's hexagonal rifling can't without the risk of over pressure and KaBooms. This is the one true 10mm that really started it all. Sure the Bren Ten and Delta Elite are nice and look cool but run a couple hundred full power hot ass 10mm loads through them and get the tissue ready cause you'll be crying and screaming when they break. This is the one that allowed people to use the 10mm round to its full potential and finally tamed the beast. The link below is to a picture album of this rare beauty.http://imgur.com/a/RxPv8"

The gun has maybe 30 rounds through it so it is used but like new. It has run flawlessly for me. I have only used 00 buckshot in it. Its got an 18.5 inch barrel. I used it as my bedside gun for a while. Its a nice gun but its Turkish made and I am choosing to no longer own/buy Turkish guns. Cash price is 225 plus the drive.

Batteries were just replaced for the electronic lock, and changing combinations is easy for the new owner, no locksmith required!This 1,000+ lb safe has 2"" thick walls, 4 interior gray cloth-covered shelves, commercial-grade ball-bearing hinges, massive 1 1/2 inch chrome-plated bolts and 4 pre-cut anchor bolt holes in the floor. Exterior dimensions are 59 1/4"" tall by 30"" wide by 26"" deep.If you look this up, you'll see this safe has a retail price of $3,745.00 - $4,200.00. Internet prices vary from $3,199 (Amazon) to $2,774 (safekeeper.com). These prices include a Premium Door Organizer and in some cases, curbside delivery. MY PRICE IS SO LOW BECAUSE: 1. It does not have the door organizer. You can buy one of these from Amazon for $50-$150, depending on exactly what you want. And since the interior door is covered by a heavy gray cloth, you can also sew some Velcro on a sheet and make whatever kind of organizer you want for almost nothing.2. It has shelves, not gun racks. The shelves are easily modified by a jigsaw once you remove the cloth covering, or you can get a set of 10 Rifle Rods from Amazon for $28 and position your long guns any way you want. 3. It is several years old, and although it is in very good condition, it has various exterior dents, dings and scratches from several moves. It also has one small, completely repaired patch where rust had started on the lower front corner from being stored in a damp building. IF PERFORMANCE IS MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU THAN LOOKS, THIS IS THE SAFE FOR YOU!Moving is up to you - depending on distance from my house (I live in Spanish Springs) expect a moving company to charge you roughly $250+, delivered to your curb. (I made my last move for essentially nothing with the help of 4 strong guys and a refrigerator dolly).WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS A STOCK PICTURE FROM THE AMSEC WEB SITE - I will post an actual pic as soon as I have time.TRADES CONSIDERED."
