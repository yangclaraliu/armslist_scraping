I believe that there were only about 1100 of these produced in this caliber and as far as anyone can tell this gun has not been fired except when it was factory tested back when it was produced in the mid-1980's. It was imported by Interarms and is marked as such.The PP Super is an all steel, blowback operated, double action pistol. Unlike the standard PP, the Super features an external slide stop lever and a manual decocker. The gun has no manual safety but does have a firing pin safety which allows the pistol to be carried with a round in the chamber and the hammer down ready to be fired in double action mode.This is a rare pistol and these do not come up for sale very often. The rig includes the original box, two magazines and all original paperwork. I am not the original owner but will try to answer questions as best as I can. Thank you."

This gun also comes with original stock and parts if you decide to convert it back to the original configuration. The bore on this gun is incredibly clean on this gun especially for a Mosin. I HAVE NOT shot any corrosive ammo through this gun and it is rust free. the outside has the usual ding that you would expect from this type of gun but other than the original wood stock looks good. I also have 13 rounds of winchester and 7 empty brass with the gun. Looking for cash but willing to look at trades.

The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr’s CW series (3.6″ barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3″ barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0″ barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0″. The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr’s PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.
Kahr’s seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr’s incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a “safe-cam action” and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.
Kahr’s two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr’s barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter’s hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.
The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.
Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols."

The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.
The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it. The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (6 rounds .45 ACP, 8 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use."

This firearm was machines and converted to .45 ACP ONLY. The pittina is very visible but no rust spots or pitting. Very cool gun and with it being converted, it becomes a lot easier find rounds as well as easier on the pocket compared to those .455 Webley rounds. No holster, firearm only. If you are interested pelase come in or contact us at REDACTED and ask for Chris or Darnell."

*NOTE: The .223 Wylde barrel is a proprietary rifle cartridge chamber with the external dimensions and lead angle as found in the military 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and the 0.2240 inch freebore diameter as found in the civilian SAAMI .223 Remington cartridge. Rifles with a .223 Wylde chamber will typically accept both .223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. Note that while the .223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO chambers have slightly different dimension, the cartridges themselves are identical in dimension. The chamber dimension differences are often confused with the cartridge dimensions and so it is often erroneously thought that the cartridges have different dimensions. The cartridges are loaded to different pressure levels (with the 5.56 being greater), however. (The NATO dimensions offset the higher pressure with a longer throat – often confusing some to think the cartridge itself is longer).[1] This chamber allows the use of both pressure levels safely while also increasing accuracy potential across the range of potential pressures."

The HW30S has become a benchmark by which all compact, spring piston sporter air rifles are judged. It combines an automatic safety with the precision adjustable “Rekord” trigger and a comfortable weight of around 6 Lbs at just under 39-inches long. This makes it easy and comfortable to shoot.
There’s a tunnel front sight with interchangeable inserts together with a micrometer rear sight adjustable for windage and elevation.
The quality and precision engineering that makes the HW30 air gun so popular is now mated to a luxurious gray and black laminate stock. This stock is made by Italian craftsmen and provides features including a rosewood grip cap, a full length fore end, an ambidextrous cheek piece, and a soft rubber butt pad.The rosewood grip cap fitted to the new Weihrauch HW30 air rifle with laminate stock.
