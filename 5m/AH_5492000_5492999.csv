Complete with all tools,accessories, and i also had bought an original Back-Strap from the local STIHL Dealer for $20. The brush cutter disc and the original string head is also new, Upon first use I bought A spiral line commercial grade head for it. I also have 2 extra sets of spiral trimming line for it. I have had it 1 1/2seasons but Altogether it has actually been used a total of 6 times. Hasn't been used this year since I moved. I no longer require the need for one now. Spark plug was purchased 1 month ago, has been maintained during winter months, fresh gas in it. It is in excellent condition and has been  VERY WELL KEPT. There are no scratches or scuff marks on it.It still has Consumer Warranty Valid until Feb.2020 through Sears in Kingsport,Tennessee. The Spiral twine head on it is strong enough to cut down thick brush without the need for the use of the cutting disc. It is quite impressive and well made. Originally paid $460 after taxes for the Weedeater ALONE, Willing to include all of the extra accessories as mentioned above. And I'll even include a 1gal. Gascan that's still already mixed with fresh gas&oil. I have the universal hardware (srews,bolts,etc.etc.) for the head that is currently on it. I Would possibly consider trades of something of equal value  or Cash Price I am asking is $400- And there's still 4 years left on the Manufacturer's Warranty"

I replaced the grips it came with with some reproduction red 9 grips, the safety (witch was broken when I got it) with a reproduction safety, and the magazine and recoil springs. I still have the original parts for what that's worth.It functions okay, it can jam or fail to go into battery if you don't have a firm/high grip.more photos here: https://imgur.com/a/zdxbm"

Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
