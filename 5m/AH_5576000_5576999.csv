The SilencerCo Salvo 12 is the first and only commercially-viable shotgun suppressor on earth. It represents an incredible advance in engineering and technology, and carries with it the same quality and service as SilencerCo’s other products. Every year, millions of sportsmen and women venture into the fields to hunt. While rifle and handgun suppressors continue to increase in popularity, shotgun owners have been without a real solution for ear protection. Some choose hearing preservation in the form of earmuffs or plugs for relief in controlled environments, but spurn their use in the field or in a home protection scenario, where the ability to detect other sounds is critical. The Salvo 12 is modular in nature — the shooter can add or remove sections to balance their sound suppression, weight and length needs. At its full length of 12 inches, it brings sound down to 137 dB at the muzzle — well below the 140 dB hearing-safe level set by OSHA. Whether you grab a shotgun for hunting, shooting clays or home defense, the Salvo 12 fits most common shotguns — provided you have a choked barrel. The suppressor attaches to the the existing choke threads via an adapter. Due to differences in shotgun manufacturer and choke preference, it is important that you select the correct adapter. The Salvo 12 is just one more example of the type of innovation that has garnered a fiercely loyal customer base for SilencerCo."

The gun is in 95% condition and other than one small knick smaller than a penny on the top rear of the slide, it is in awesome shape. This has factory night sights that are extremly dim due to Berreta not making this particular model in over 5 years. They work as great contrast target sights.Only reason im selling/trading this gun off is its the last of my .40cals at this point in life.

Lockup is tight, brand new level of tight, good old days of case hardened hammer and trigger. Barrel is great, no knicks or gouges on the crown, hard to get photos of it but the rifling looks new. Obvious that soft lead went through a hard steel barrel, not even the polishing on the lands that comes after a couple hundred rounds. Honestly makes me wonder how many rounds have been put through it, it looks that new. Only real drawback is someone used an engraver on the front strap of the grip. Pretty faint, only really noticeable to my eye when the light hits it right (and hard to get into a photo), could easily disappear with some elbow grease and a polishing wheel then re-blue touch up - or - put full size grips on it and it'll be hidden."

Rare and Last Chance!  **","Westside, Jacksonville, Florida","$ 1,100","Listed On: Tuesday, January 10, 2017",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Unfortunately, it has came down to a time I have to sell this rifle. This gun is new, in an extra $200+ case made for the RFB, and has fine tuning and polished internals by a special branch at Kel-Tec that isn't known by many people. ( It was purchased from their hometown location from friends through Kel-Tec ) This color is more rare than the others and usually sales for a bit more as tan seems to be the new color everyone is after on guns not to mention a lot are after this FDE 24 inch barrel combo which gets even harder to find. Only 1k of these total( colors and barrel sizes varying ) are produced a year typically ( the numbers are declining as they have started making the RDB and are phasing these out, so they may be worth quite a bit down the road as it's the only commercial semi auto .308 bull-pup on the market as far as I'm aware which is one of the reasons I haven't even fired it! I have a reliable .308 and wouldn't want to destroy the value of this if it goes through the roof for any reason )I'm not interested in trading as I just got into a car accident and need money to help cover expenses. As you can see by the picture it was originally $1,999.99 not including the paperwork and quad rail added to it. I'm not very interested in getting rid of it so please don't offer any lower ball offers as I'm ONLY selling to recoup some funds lost through this car accident. I love the gun and didn't ever think I would let it go, but now is the only chance I'm going to put it up for sale to see what happens. If it sales then good, but if not then I'm not going to cry over it as I'd love to keep it and may even take down the post if I find myself getting my paychecks steadily again and figuring out that I don't actually need to get rid of it.Im going to set the price at $1100 FIRM. ( already dropped the price and not going lower! This is almost a grand under what they are selling for on GunBroker so please don't ask )It has the $200+ hard case on the Kel-Tec siteThe quad rail for a foregrip that was an extras $50+And the rifle was $1999.99 at the time of purchase so I think that is a fair deal to get this gun pretty much brand new for I've a $1k less than what it originally costs after the quad rail, tax, and the transfer!You can email me on here or best thing to do would be to text me at 904-5zero9-0517 if interested and have cash. Please no offers for anything besides my asking price unless it's something below and comes up to the amount of my trade value.Thanks and it will be first come first serve!The ONLY trades I'll consider and trades will be worth less as a total value is a Rhino revolver in .357 , Desert Eagle , Tristar Tec-12 semi-automatic and pump 12 gauge , Spas or Spaz 12 , MPX / MCX ,  Kel-Tec SU-16C ( Only the C Model ) , H&K PSP , or a FNX-9 Tactical and I may accept other bullpups or AK chanmbered in 5.45Ill set the trade value at $1400 as that is still lower than what these are selling for new and mine is the harder to find FDE , 24"" , comes with the hard case , and has the $50+ quad rail mount so I think that is fair."

It has a 24"" barrel chambered in .308 WIN, McMillan A-5 stock with adjustable comb and length of pull, custom hard case, and Troy industries sling. Also, not pictured is a Harris bipod that will come with it! This gun shoots .5 MOA with match ammo as advertised by Kimber and the trigger breaks at a crisp 2lbs. It has a smooth Mauser style action and the rifle itself is consistent and reliable. Below is the link to what Kimber sells now as this models replacement. Don't be fooled! If you are aware of Kimber's history of high quality firearms, this gun is every bit as custom built and accurate as what they are selling now. http://www.kimberamerica.com/advanced-tactical-iiWhy is this Kimber $1200 when the newer model is selling for over $4300, you may ask? Simple! I've had this rifle new from Kimber since 2009 and I've only put 800 rounds through it! That's right, 800 rounds total on the entire system! I take care of all my firearms and shoot them for specific applications. I have other rifles I shoot more and this one hardly gets any use so it's time to let her go and make room for another project. This rifle is as high end as any custom rifle and will be great for anyone, novice or expert. $1200 for everything you see here! I'll even throw in 45 rounds of custom hand loaded match grade hunting ammo loaded with 168 grain Nosler Ballistic tips. Look around, but this deal will be hard to beat! Please ask any questions.
