I have sold off most of my 45 caliber firearms. This is my last one because it was my favorite. Comes with original box and two mags. Some hoslter wear on the slide stop, but it's an easy fix if that's not your style. Approx 600 rounds through it. Smooth DA/SA trigger. It's an HK, it's built like a tank. Description-
Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45.
Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.
The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.
Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life.
Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.
By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 and HK45C can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.
Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45C is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system, providing an enhanced double action trigger pull."

Gas system is self-regulating and does not need manual adjustments. Gun is fitted with modified AK-style safety that has additional lever that permits faster ""safety on"" operation (mostly useful for IPSC shooters). Safety lever is also duplicated on the left side of the receiver. Other useful addition that is not found in AKor Saiga 12 is bolt hold-open devicewhich holds the bolt open when magazine is exhausted. Magazine housing is provided with extended magazine tunnel, which permits for faster magazine insertion (without typical AK-style rocking movement,necessary to lock the standard AK-type magazine). Furniture includes a detachable or fixed flash hider on the barrel, a permanent skeletonized butt with polymer coating, and plastic pistol grip and forend. Bottom handguard and bottom of gas block are fitted with Picatinny-type accessory rails, additional rail is provided on the receiver top cover, which is hinged to the receiver at the front.Standard sights are of AK pattern as well, with front sight installed on the gas block and adjustable rear sight on the receiver. It is worth to note that Vepr 12 shotguns can use both proprietary 8-round magazines and Saiga 12 magazines, but Vepr magazines will not work in Saiga 12."

I believe just around 7000 were ever produced until Colt came out with the Peacemaker. Originally, it was chambered for .44 Rimfire, but at some point long in the past, it was professionally converted to shoot .44 Russian, and at the same time had the barrel shortened to 4 5/8 inches as well as having a new front sight installed. All the serial numbers seem to match, and the revolver is still in perfect time and mechanically functions as it should. The only thing missing is the ejector. I've never cleaned the finish from this revolver, only rubbed it down with an oiled rag. This gun was used and carried, and the finish shows it. It also comes with an antique handmade buffalo leather holster, made specifically for this revolver and is over 100 years old. It was owned by a friends Great great grandfather, who was a Wyoming rancher. Not looking to ship at this time. Would prefer a local sale. Price is $1000 cash or trade for the revolver and holster.

Styled in the familiar AR configuration it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything including your life. This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance enhanced reliability carbine. The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance. The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel the carrier features an integral piston strike face. REC7 Lifestyle The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7 not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance. At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided two-position forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance. The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 Class 2 hardcoat anodized and Cerakote finished. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated hammer-forged chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle

Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. - The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module which is user accessible.

The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3 6 and 9 o'clock positions. - The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended. - Made of a temperature-resistant polymer the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. - From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color that blends into any environment - every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own.

Driven by the demands of combat every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107 but is every bit as tough. - Designed to be used with a suppressor this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107 but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. - The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. - Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability. - Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side. - The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. - Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.
