The Savage 93 FVSRs are great rifles and while you can still find the 22lr and a few 22mag versions the 17hmr models seem to have disappeared. These have 16"" threaded heavy barrels. I wouldn't be selling this one, but a buddy gave me a new A17 and I can't shoot them both. I've added a cheek riser to the stock as the stocks on these simply fall away too quickly for good cheek-welds with scope use. The BSA Sweet 17 scope is a 3-12X40 and is perfect for these fast flat shooters. Quickly hand adjusts for bullet drop at different distances. I have the box and all paperwork for the rifle and probably the box for the scope. If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, look them up. You'll be impressed.

A brand new in the box never loaded, fired, or carried Glock 19 Vicker's Tactical RTF2 Black edition. This is the newest release from Lipsey's/Vickers and is the nicest pistol in the lineup. For those unfamiliar, this is a special collaboration between Lipsey's, Glock, and Larry Vicker's which are limited to only 2500 Glock 19 pistols total for the production making this a rare pistol. This particular pistol was released within the last week and is the nicest pistol in the Vicker's line in that special ""additions"" have been added that the previous Vicker's pistols do not have. First off, the front sight post is the upgraded gold bead dot over the previous fiber optic sight, the serial number prefix has been placed as LAV for Larry Vicker's unlike the previous pistols, and you still receive the same upgrades that all of the previous pistols have ie RTF2 frame, flared magazine base plates, grip plug with built in take down tool, extended slide release, extended mag release, special sights, all of the factory Glock replacement parts for the above upgrades, correct paperwork including a discount for any Vicker's Tactical training class, and all of this is wrapped in the new classic black option. Again, this is a very hard to find pistol and commands a premium and is also a higher price retail to begin with than any of the previous models. For those that check GunBroker for price comparisons, please do. Currently on GunBroker several of these are selling, not listed for but SELLING, for over $800 due to the low production numbers and the fact that this is the nicest Lipsey's/Vicker's Glock to have been release. Again, this is brand new in the box purchased by me from my FFL today. I am not fond of the Vicker's Edition Glocks but had the opportunity to purchase one new and make a few $ so here it is. My price for the pistol new in the box including a Reign Tactical IWB carbon fiber FDE holster (3 month wait on these through Reign plus a $70 charge) is 100000% FIRM at $820 cash only. If you do not like my price go elsewhere but we both know your chances are slim to none as these sold out through Lipsey's in record time or you will pay the same on GunBroker plus shipping and transfer fees. I will not, I repeat WILL NOT, respond to any offers below my asking price nor will I respond to trade offers of any kind. No I will not ship it. No I will not provide further pictures. No there is nothing wrong with it. No I will not meet you half way. If you want it, you will meet me at the Kroger off of I-71 and King's Mill in Mason with a state issued photo ID and cash in hand. All local, state, and federal laws apply, cash only, and buyer must present state issued photo ID at time of sale as well as sign a bill of sale. NO EXCEPTIONS.

This model of leupold has the scope that illuminates every time you grab it and then turns off after 5 minutes of being left alone. So you never have to worry about accidentally leaving the scope on and it dieing. Extremely nice scope. The scope alone is worth $600. I built this gun for varmint hunting and it is amazing. I wanted the bright colored stock so if it was ever set down in the woods you can see it easily. And it is a great conversation piece. With subsonic ammunition it is very quite and fun to shoot. Please fee fee free to email me if you are interested."
