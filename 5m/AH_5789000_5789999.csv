This gun uses standard Glock 9mm magazines, either Glock 19 or Glock 17 mags.  It is currently set up for Glock 17 mags, but I'm also including the two grip pieces needed for switching the grip to allow use of both Glock 19 and Glock 17 mags in case you want to do that.  It's a simple switch not needing gunsmithing skills and there are YouTube instructions for doing it.  I just never got around to it.
The gun has never been fired and the bore is pristine and shiny.  The action and folding mechanism are both smooth and flawless. There are no dings or scratches whatsoever on the gun.  I put a new, bolt tube cover on the gun when I bought it to enhance your cheek weld.  It's easily removed if you don't want to use it.  This gun has never been in the field and sadly it's lived a sheltered life in my closet because I just haven’t had an opportunity to use it. ...my loss, your gain (or maybe your gun).
I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas. I’m in College Station so the triangle formed by Austin, DFW, and Houston is OK.  Maybe we can meet half-way to reduce driving time.  Must be a legal buyer with a valid TX driver’s license or CHL/LTC permit.
If the ad is still up, the gun is still available. If I don’t answer your email immediately, it just means I’m at work and I’ll respond as soon as I get home.
I'd prefer cash but would consider trading for a recently manufactured Glock 43 or a LNIB Ruger AR556.

Accepts Glock 17 mags and comes with 1 x Glock 17 magazine. Has 1/2 x 28 threaded barrel to accept suppressors. Trigger is smooth as butter. I was going to SBR it and submit my ATF Form 1, but decided against it. I do have an all FDE Kriss Buttstock to match this rifle if you DO want to SBR it. Kriss does not even mass produce the buttstock in FDE seperately, so I bought a black one and paid extra to have it cerekoted to match the SDP. Cost me $150, but will include it with the SDP for an extra $100. So, $1400 for everything.***Please note, the buttstock can not be weaponized or assembled on the SDP.... IT IS ILLEGAL. Before the buttstock can be installed, you have to have an approved ATF Form 1. Essentially, if the package is bought, the buttstock is just a piece of polymer and rubber that should not be considered a Kriss Vector SDP accessory until all legal criteria has been met.***"

Whether it’s a moving target, dangerous game at full charge, or a fast breaking tactical  situation at close quarters. When things are moving fast and you need to get on target in  a hurry, your sight has to work faster. No matter the lighting conditions, weather  conditions, or terrain, the ROMEO4 red-dot sight has you covered-—when it counts.  You can shoot with confidence with both eyes open, on target yet aware of the situation  at all times as it unfolds. And because it is a SIG SAUER®, you know the ROMEO4  is as tough and dependable as our firearms.   ROMEO4 sights are parallax-free so point-of-aim is point-of-impact and the red dot remains parallel to the bore of your firearm, no matter what your viewing angle is relative to the optical axis of the sight Unlimited eye-relief allows you to acquire the aiming point and the target regardless of the position of your eye behind the sight Dual reticle option, on select models, toggle between 2 MOA red dot or circle dot (2 MOA red dot with 65 MOA circle) ROMEO4 utilizes an ultra-efficient red LED illumination system for daylight visibility with extended runtime and mil-spec objective coatings to limit downrange light leakage in tactical situations Features our MOTAC™ (Motion Activated Illumination System) that powers up when it senses motion and powers down when it does not. Provides for optimum operational safety and enhanced battery life 50,000+ hour battery life and the readily available CR2032 battery is side-loading, allowing for quick battery replacement Extremely strong and lightweight aircraft grade CNC Aluminum housing ensures a lifetime of reliable service Dependable waterproof (IPX-7 rated for complete water immersion up to 1 atmosphere) and fog-proof performance Available with M1913 Picatinny low mounts (standard) or 1.41” co-witness riser mounts (standard or Quick Detach) The ROMEO4 is covered by SIG SAUER’s INFINITE Guarantee™and Electronics Limited Warranty, see website for full details.

The gun has a match-grade 5 inch barrel and one of the best groups I have ever felt on a handgun. The pistol is extremely light at 26 ounces with lightning Cuts all through the slide yet the pistol has very little recoil or muzzle flip. Comes with 3 different back straps this is the new hot competition gun on the market they range anywhere from $800 to $1,100 depending Where You Are and I only see them going up it is a super accurate pistol and one of the fastest rapid fire pistols ever created. I would recommend it over the Glock 34 without question. The trigger is easily the best I have seen out of the box. You are welcome to make trade offers but they must be solid I will not waste time or respond to anything that is not worth it it is pretty clear this gun is a 10 out of a 10 please contact me by email and send pictures with your email if you are trying to trade thank you very much for looking at my ad God bless"

Scope is a SWFA 10X42 With MRAD crosshairs and Miliradian tracking. It is mounted with SWFA Scope rings. I had it professionally installed and boresighted by the guys at Stillwater Armory Gun Shop. Rifle is also completely custom painted. Will come with 100 rounds of 308 ammo as well.This is a great rifle and will make a great long range target rifle or a great hunting rifle. This is not your standard lower end rifle, it is a PRECISION carbine. The entire rifle is built around being a long range, cold bore, on target shooter, out to the effective range of a 308 bullet (approx 1100meters). So if you understand the mechanics of making a shot like that (i am not that good), then come take a look. I have over $1400 invested asking $1100. Willing to negotiate but please no low ball offers.
