The series includes the Walther PP, PPK, PPK/S, and PPK/E. Various PP series are manufactured in either Germany, France or the United States. Since 2002, the PPK variant is solely manufactured by Smith & Wesson in Houlton, Maine, United States, under license from Carl Walther GmbH Sportwaffen. In the past, this particular model has been manufactured by Carl Walther in its own factory in Germany, as well as under licenses by Manurhin in Alsace, France, and by Interarms in Alexandria, Virginia, US. The PP and the PPK were among the world's first successful double action semi-automatic pistols and were widely copied, but are still made by Walther. The design inspired other pistols, among them the Soviet Makarov, the Hungarian FEG PA-63, and the Argentinian Bersa Thunder 380. The PP and PPK were both popular with European police and civilians, for being reliable and concealable. During World War II, they were issued to the German military, including the Luftwaffe, as well as the police"

Non-slip texturing on the grip also aids in weapon control. An integral Picatinny rail provides rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. The PX4 Storm is a double/single action semi-automatic pistol with an external hammer. The ambidextrous safety doubles as a decocking lever. The slide features a Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating for superior corrosion and wear resistant finish, while forward and rear serrations provides a non-slip hold on the slide when loading and unloading the weapon. White, 3-dot sights provide quick sight acquisition in varied lighting. The gun's chrome-lined barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance.

Having said that, I was immediately impressed with the fit, feel and quality of this gun. Unlike some competing 9mm compacts, the Bersa offers a solid, hand-filling grip, thanks in part to its double-stacked 13-round magazine. That aids in control, making it easy to hold the gun on target. The gun comes supplied with two 13-round magazines. A mechanical loader is a big help when filling the magazine. The follower spring is pretty stout. I’d hate to try fully loading the magazine without some mechanical help. Measuring 6.5 inches in length and tipping the scales at 23 ounces, this is not a petite firearm. It’s bulkier and heavier than many of the 9mm “pocket pistols” on the market. The full-sized Thunder Pro 9mm has a barrel that’s an inch longer and weighs in at 31 ounces. It also features a 17-round magazine. The Thunder Pro Ultra Compact is less concealable than some pistols but provides a reassuringly solid grip and a “big gun” feel. It fits very comfortably in my hand and aims very naturally. Forget carrying it in a pocket, this gun cries out for a holster."

Manufacturer suggests 200 shells with heavy ammo. Velocity should be over 1250 FPS, to help loosen the springs. I took it to the range twice and the gun fires without fail. The gun comes with a ""light"" and ""heavy"" piston, I'm using the heavy piston for the break-in. Gun works great as long as the user follows the manual, which is included in the purchase.I'm selling only because I want to train using a pump action shotgun like we use at work - if I had the money to keep both guns, I would not part with this Weatherby. It's loads of fun, a great self-defense weapon. Nothing wrong with this gun. Has sling swivels, skull camo. Great shooting.Reply with a phone number and enjoy defending your home with a LOW RECOIL 12 gauge! I am willing to take best offer, but I'm asking less than half of MSRP."

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM RAIL 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.Kryptek patterns utilize a multi-directional design to effectively conceal in a multitude of terrains that have either a lateral or vertical flow. The bi-level layering of the patterns incorporate background transitional shading and sharp random geometrical foregrounds to create a three-dimensional effect that ensures the utmost in concealment at both close and long ranges. These components, combined with colorations selected and matched based on input from testing and observations from Operators in the field, make Kryptek patterns optimal for many different environments.      MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION  LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

The corporation's earlier designs had been Colt Peacemaker-style single-action revolvers. Ruger used investment casting for most parts in an effort to hold down production costs.[2] As with all Ruger firearms, the Security-Six revolvers were robustly designed with large, heavy-duty parts for durability and to allow for investment casting.[2][3] The ""six series"" line enjoyed sales success because of their basic features, solid construction, and competitive pricing. Various models were issued by US government agencies as diverse as the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Postal Service, the Border Patrol, and numerous police agencies. The Security-Six and its derivatives also became the standard issue service weapons of a large number of police departments, in addition many were exported overseas. While Ruger's Security-Six line has been out of production since 1988, a total of over 1.5 million revolvers were produced and they remain well-liked and respected, as well as highly sought after in the second-hand market."

First of all, this rifle used to have a cocking indicator on it, and it was replaced with a piece of steel. Only 4 examples of this rifle have ever been found with a cocking indicator, and only a limited number more have been found with a replaced indicator. THE FEATURE THAT MAKES THIS RIFLE ONE OF A KIND IS the fact that it has a thumb rest. After contacting experts on the British Militaria Forums and doing research, it is now apparent that only ONE of these pattern of rifles has been found with a thumb rest, and that is the rifle I present to you today. A one of a kind rifle will sell to a serious rifle collector fast, and what makes this rifle even more special is its condition. The internals are fully functioning, and it will easily disassemble for inspection and can dry fire with ease. The wood is tight and snug, and the buttstock is the worst condition part of the rifle, with no buttplate (the only missing part) and a crack and some wood missing. However the wood bears INCREDIBLE unit marks that are very unique. The grain of the wood and the finish of the rifle show absolutely beautiful petina. This rifle has not been cleaned which is what true collectors want- original finish!This rare rifle's value is not comparable to any others as it is one of a kind, but the estimate I received was $1,570. I need this rifle gone sadly due to financial issues, so you CAN PURCHASE THIS RIFLE FOR ALMOST HALF PRICE, $710! Also accepting trades, especially on Milsurp weapons... Thank you! THIS RIFLE IS ANTIQUE THEREFORE I CAN SHIP IT ALMOST ANYWHERE YOU WANT ME TO!IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING, PLEASE EMAIL ME FIRST AND THEN WE CAN CALL! REDACTED"
