$560 in cash or a little better in trade.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? this makes it a lot easier when considering.Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others, trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles, depending on value as I can build nice ones pretty cheap right now.
Folding brace and nice trigger/parts to fit a Sig P556.
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18"".
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus, AR15 and AR10's, AK type with 10"" barrel and folding brace, Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" model only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal, depending on value.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308, other similar 1-6x and 1-4x with nice clear glass, true 1x magnification, QD mounts are a plus, not interested in retail prices, I can buy online any time.Must be legal to own a firearm in TX."

Buy this mint condition, 1980's Winchester lever action rifle chambered in .357 magnum. The rifle is in pristine shape with a few almost invisible handling marks on the fore end. I would rate this rifle 99% except for the previous owner installed a new front sight that left some marks. So, I will down grade it to 96% + overall. Bluing is in perfect condition and bore is bright and shiny. Shoots fine and the lever action is smooth and crisp. Rifle comes with a rear peep sight that folds down. Really helps making precise shots. Rifle is compact, with an overall length of 33"" . No box or papers nor do I have any idea how many rounds it has fired other than my use (100-150). Selling to make room for other acquisitions. Asking $725 OBO. Note, lowball offers will be ignored. I know what it is worth so please - make a reasonable offer. Worst I can say is no thank you. Full or partial trades will be entertained, but cash is king. Additional pictures available. Don't miss out on this beautiful rifle at a bargain price."

Mint condition. New, reduced price!Pistol is in its original box, with an extra 13-round magazine, manual, and cleaning rod. All original parts included. Factory walnut grips, fixed sights, and the rare vented rib. Made in Hungary by FEG. After the original Browning patents for the Browning Hi-Power (BHP) expired, the Hungarian conglomerate of FÉG developed one of the most faithful versions of the Browning design ever made in quantity outside the FN factories in Belgium and Portugal. The BHP and the FP9 are so similar that many parts are interchangeable between them, including the magazines. So, like the BHP, the Fp9 is a single action pistol. This pistol feels great in the hand – exactly like my 1981 BHP - and has a similar trigger pull. Note: the non-vented rib version of this pistol was exported as PJK-9HP/P9M models. For FTF sale in VA, buyer must be 21+ years of age and have (1) a VA driver’s license, and (2) one of the following: a concealed carry permit, LEO ID, or a copy of VA gun store invoice in buyer’s name in last year. If no IDs or invoice, can transfer at a local FFL with a quick background check. For an out-of-state sale, will arrange shipment to buyer’s FFL, at buyer’s cost.

Reason for selling: I have conceal carried this Kel-Tec for two years now and never had a malfunction. I have put approximately 150 rounds through the barrel and never had any issues. I have regularly cleaned and maintained this handgun at least once a month (if had not been fired) and after every use. I have taken extremely good care of this handgun and always kept it clean and lubed up. The reason I am selling is because I want to get into competition shooting, and although this handgun is plenty accurate, it does not have the magazine capacity for competitive shooting. Also I do not have the money to right out by a new competition gun, so this money will help fund that. This gun is intended for concealed carry and is amazing at it. It is super thin and super light. With a bit of practice, this gun would be perfect for concealed carry for anyone. LOCAL only through a local FFL. I would like it if you paid the FFL fee since you would have to do this if you were buying new anyways. Thanks for reading my post. Also, although there is no way to verify, I am the first owner of this gun. This gun is on consignment at P.M.
