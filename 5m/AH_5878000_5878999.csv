Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.

The modular design is easily maintained, requiring only a coin as a tool for field stripping. The action of the 512 is composed of an aluminum alloy upper receiver that secures the barrel and bolt assembly and a fiberglass-reinforced polymer lower half that houses the trigger mechanism and detachable magazine. The 512 shares magazines and scope rings with the CZ 455 making it the perfect complement to your bolt-action rifle.
The 512 is equipped with dual guide rods for smooth operation and superior reliability. The barrel is the same accurate hammer forged barrel found on all CZs, topped with adjustable sights. An integral 11mm dovetail allows easy mounting of optics.

I carry it loaded and chambered with the safety off and hammer down, so there's the long first DA pull but each after that is SA and smooth (like a Beretta).  It shoots 380, is super accurate, and super reliable.  No FTF, jams, or misfires with either FMJ or Hollowpoints.  I've shot 200 rounds through it and it functions great. I bought this for an all around self defense/carry/home defense gun, but am moving on.  Great little gun, small and comfortable to carry, can put a whole magazine in a couple of inches at 10 yards.Everything in the pictures comes for the selling price: the original case, manual, and lock; the pistol; one 7 round magazine; one 9 round magazine with extended grips (great if you have big hands), and an ""Uncle Mike's"" soft IWB holster (I've worn this all day in shorts, jeans, etc. No printing); and one 50 round box of Fiocchi FMJ ammo.Would be interested in a trade/partial trade for a revolver with a 4"" or shorter barrel (snubs are ok), preferably in 357/38sp. Let me know what you have and see if we can work a deal.  Will have to meet at FFL for transfers/background checks. I know a cheap place or you can pick your favorite."

This is a top tier firearm which has been kept in impeccable condition. My Benelli M4 is in total compliance with all new york state laws/safe act regulations. I also have many high quality photos of the Benelli M4, I was limited to a downscaled version of pictures I originally took when I made my listing. If you are interested please reach out to me. If you wish to purchase this firearm and are local, both you and I will have to find a gun shop to run a background check on us before I can sell you the firearm.Thanks for your time."

[Carries Rifle, Bow or Crossbow securely!]
 
The TC SP14 Shooter backpack transforms from a backpack to a secure shooting platform with no need to remove your rifle from the pack!  This is the only pack currently designed to carry a crossbow because it has a deep channel and compression straps to securely hold your bow/crossbow to free your hands while you climb into your tree stand.  It has many features, to include breathable mesh back pad, padded hip panels, foldout rain cover, (9) Nine compartments and pockets, along with several other features.  This backpack is unbelievable and worth every penny to serious hunters. 
 
What you see pictured is the item you will received.  This has been sitting in my garage, in the box so it is time to go. Outstanding product!  Any questions please let me know.  I have the original box, but it is 1 ½ times bigger than the backpack.  If you want the box, I will ship it but would rather find a small more compact box to mail."

Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game. Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion.
