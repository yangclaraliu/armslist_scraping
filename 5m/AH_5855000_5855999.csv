Slamming the 7.62x39mm cartridge into a lightweight AR platform has many advantages. Think about the weapons manipulation skills developed through years of owning the standard .223/5.56 AR… now those skills translate directly into a package that weighs the same but packs a significantly larger “punch”. How about ammunition price? Depending on location, 7.62×39 ammunition is roughly 40% cheaper then .223/5.56. More bang for your buck in 2 categories! Punch and price…what’s not to love? The kicker…the accuracy. With proper ammunition, rifle setup and shooter ability, this new rifle falls under the POF-USA 1 MOA or better guarantee. That’s right, a 7.62x39mm 1 MOA rifle!"

$1,060 in cash or better in trade value.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.  
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.

Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

$900 cash or a little better in trade.  Looking for Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

I think I have properly stored this since 2001, so would also guarantee against spoilage for one year, meaning if it has turned bad I'll provide cash in return for unused portion no questions asked - taste preference however is on you.  I have solid ratings from VAGT if that helps to offset concerns. Below are links to current sales note prices are in Euros.
This is tough to find if at all, with a rare shipment from Europe for example.  Prices have to include taxes and shipping, with the below examples somewhere around $375 US.

$1,060 in cash or better in trade value.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.  
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

I bought this rifle to start competing, but just don't have the time due to job, kids and such. It's only had about 40 rounds shot through it, so it's as near to brand new as you can imagine. No nicks, scratches, rust or dents. Has a Harris 1A2 ultralight bipod up front to keep you stable on the ground making those long range kills. I'll even throw in 2 boxes of .308 for the agreed price.

Easy change in and out. For gas-operated AR-15's, simply remove your bolt carrier group and insert the conversion bolt and feed the .22 LR rounds with the included CMMG .22 LR Magazine. This conversion takes less than a minute with no permanent alterations to your firearm. It can quickly and easily be returned to its original caliber. . . . and the best part is that it is STAINLESS STEEL and very easy to clean!
For piston driven AR platforms, there is one additional step required. Remove the screw that holds the piston rod in place and the piston rod will fall out of the front of the gas block. This will allow the kit to then fit into the rifle and it will operate off of the blow-back from the .22 round. Load your 22LR mags and off you go rocking and rolling. This will allow you to practice with your AR platform and not kill your bank account.
  By having the 3 mag kit you save yourself the aggravation of trying to find others and pay for separate shipping etc etc. This way you have the kit and 3 mags to play with right off the bat, no muss, no fuss.
