The Knoxx COPstock combines a folding, wire frame buttstock with a recoil reducing pistol grip. The result is a tactical buttstock that tames even the heaviest magnum loads. The COPstock folds for compact storage, yet instantly unfolds with a simple squeeze of the stock. Recoil is reduced so dramatically that the shotgun is completely controllable, even with the stock folded.This stock is in excellent functional condition, and good cosmetic condition – clearly not new, but just a little scratched and dusty. Includes mounting bolt and ambidextrous sling stud.Knoxx #: 03200UPC #: REDACTEDHere is the official company description:________________________________Designed for Law Enforcement, home defense and sporting applications, the patented Knoxx COPstock™ Folder folding stock for shotguns cuts actual recoil by over fifty percent.Using technology developed by Knoxx Industries for the acclaimed Knoxx CompStock™, this new folding pistol grip stock takes the pain out of shooting magnum buckshot and slug loads, even with the stock folded. The sturdy folding wire-frame stock is easily folded over the top of the receiver. This allows for compact storage and increased maneuverability in tight spaces, such as vehicles, hallways and entryways.Extending the stock creates a stable platform for accurate slug or shot placement at maximum ranges. A squeeze of the heavy-duty non-slip soft polymer-coated wire frame releases the lock and allows the stock to be folded open or closed.The COPstock™ Folder pistol grip contains the unique Knoxx recoil-reducing mechanism and is covered in a soft rubber grip sleeve with finger grooves to improve grip and controllability in all weather conditions. The patent ed recoil-reducing mechanism reduces muzzle flip in addition to taming recoil. Shooters testing the COPstock™ Folder wit h 3 inch Magnum Buckshot loads have found that there is very little discernible recoil in either open or folded positions, with virtually no muzzle flip.With the stock folded, the shotgun can be held like a pistol, at arm's length, and fired with no pain or discomfort. Even beginner shooters could consistently hit a 12-inch gong at 25 yards with “00” Buckshot – one-handed! Trying this feat is definitely not recommended with other folding or pistol grip style stocks.________________________________I prefer a face-to-face deal for cash in the NW San Antonio / Helotes / Leon Springs area.

I think its CVA brand. This kit has everything included, I even bought the flints for it already and have an unopened pound of black powder I could throw in for an extra $15 (the real stuff, not BP substitute). I would love to finish it but I just don't have the patience or the time. Everything is included and the picture shows the rifle just sort of assembled together, it still comes apart. The one odd bit about this is that the barrel was from a percussion rifle so the nipple was designed for a cap. I have the nipple still but the one part that will need to be ordered is the flash hole insert that screwes into where the nipple used to be. I believe CVA used the same barrels for both percussion cap rifles as well as flintlock rifles and just used different inserts. I would actually sort of like a working flintlock rifle so if your the type of person that likes these types of projects  I could even pay you some money and a cold six pack to finish the rifle for me, sadly I'm just not the type of person to take on this type of thing. Almost forgot to mention its a .50 cal muzzleloader and I think its like a 1:62 or 1:68 twist."

Ammo is ""GP21"" ball ammo which is a SS109 / M855 type load, made to stricter quality standards than NATO requires. Ammo is brass case, non-corrosive and reloadable boxer primed. The projectile contains a steel penetrator and is magnetic, but it is not color coded with a green tip like US ammo. GGG cal. 5.56×45 mm NATO Ball rounds are being manufactured according to the requirements of STANAG 4172. In 2005 cartridges were successfully qualified at NATO European Regional Test Center (ERTC) in UK and GGG gained right to mark its cartridges with NATO interchangeability sign. GP21 is a marking of standard GGG 5.56×45 mm cartridges produced in accordance to the requirements for SS109. Products have confirmed NSN (NATO Stock Number). NATO Design number is AC/225-130A.
