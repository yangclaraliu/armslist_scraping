Though I've not seen the XCR as much in the U.S., the rifle is very popular in Canada, while distribution in the US, seems to be more limited.  In those areas of the U.S. where consumers have been able to use and learn about the XCR, there seems to be many happy owners.  The XCR's piston driven platform is extremely reliable, easy to clean and maintain, and very accurate.  The XCR has a folding stock, a quick change barrel system with conversion kits for .300 BLK and other calibers available. Unlike the ACR however, the XCR is not made of polymer but rather is made entirely of metal, including the very rugged and tough FAST stock.  The XCR has a monolithic rail system as the upper reciever and the forend/handguard are a continuous single piece.  I have owned this rifle since late 2013 and have put somewhere between 500-750 rounds down range with it.  As mentioned above, this rifle comes equiped with the FAST Stock as shown in the pictures, however I also purchased the ACE Skeleton stock for the XCR and this second stock is also included.  Though the skeleton stock is lighter, I personally prefer the FAST stock, which I find to be superior to the various stocks that are available for the SCAR or ACR.  The FAST stock not only extends to one of six positions, but it also has an adjustable cheek riser.  The r rifle's trigger has also been upgraded with Robinson's 2-stage match trigger which provides a pull weight of 3.5 lbs with a 2 lb. first stage and a 1.5 lb. second stage.  Relative to the 5.5 lb. single stage stock trigger, this upgrade greatly improves accuracy and rate of fire.  The stock single stage trigger is also included.  Another upgrade that I've added is the compensator/muzzle brake, which mitigates muzzle rise.  Finally, the stock pistol grip has been upgraded with a Hogue rubber pistol grip and I have added Magpul ""Pro Gen 3 flip-up backup sights.  The total value of these extras and upgrades is just over $500.  The rifle has a quad rail system, (though you'll notice in the pictures that I have rail covers over the rails), and a 16"" chrome lined barrel.  I have plenty of additional pictures so please let me know if you'd like to see them or if you'd like to check this rifle out in person. Included with Purchase: Robinson XCR-L in 5.56 Robinson FAST Stock ACE Skeleton Stock Robinson 5.5 lb.

There are a lot of extras in this deal, 200 rounds of  Hornady Ammo; Bushnell Elite 1500 Range Finder; and the original M1A green synthetic stock.

Please be aware that the Hugget Shroud is not made perfectly to match the Daystate Firing tube. Reason is because the Hugget shroud’s tube is held on to the firing tube with 2 set screws at the breech area. The Hugget tube has a tendency to be cocked on an angle if your suppressor is accidentally knocked on a hard surface or rough shipment. Another reason is some Hugget shroud did not have an O-ring. This happened to me when I sent my Daystate Regal to AOA for repairs and they never test fired after the repairs. When I got it back, I went to the range and found out there were no pellets coming out, just tiny lead fragments. I sent it back again to AOA for repairs & they just installed an O-ring near the threaded portion. I’m thinking that the O-ring can wear (like the O ring in the pellet magazine w/c I replaced twice already) and eventually go back to the same problem. My solution is to make a long washer which will fit the OD of the firing tube and will fit the ID of the Hugget tube. The tolerance was extremely tight to guarantee a slip/light press fit for a zero movement 360 degrees. Now, I’m confident that the suppressor will always be aligned with the firing tube. I have my friend make 3. Sold 1 & have only one left. Once this is sold, they'll be all gone. It may fit other models like Wolverine, Air Wolf, or any other Daystate model as long as the OD of the firing tube and ID of the Hugget tube are the same as Daystate Regal XL's dimensions. (I would imagine so but check with AOA to be sure)."

It is chambered in 6.5x53.5 Dutch, which can be difficult to find. This particular rifle is a converted carbine from around WWII. It was originally made in 1911 as a full length rifle at the Hembrug arsenal, and was later converted in 1940 to carbine. It is in beautiful shape and has what looks to be an untouched stock with great markings and a nice, sharp cartouche. This rifle is all matching. The stock doesn't match, but from what I understand that is normal for these converted guns. Also, the upper handguard is missing a small sliver on the part that hangs over the barrel, it also has a almost unnoticeable hairline crack on the rear portion of the handguard. The receiver is in the white, which is also correct. I have not fired this, but it looks to be in excellant mechanical condition, and has one of the smoothest bolts I have ever experienced in a milsurp. The bore is slightly dark but still has shine and great rifling. The 6.5 round it fires is also a pleasure to shoot.Comes with 229 rounds of ammo and 30 purple wood blanks. Most of the ammo looks to be steel cased, German occupation made ammo. Also includes what appears to be an original Dutch sling, and 10 en-bloc clips. Ammo can be difficult to find and often sells for $1+/round.Asking $600 for everything."

Complete Stealth Uppers come expertly-assembled and tested with Receiver, Free-float Handguard, Barrel, Low-Profile Gasblock and Tube, Mil-Contract M16 Bolt Carrier Group and Charging Handle.LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Upper is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue Upper can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual assembly. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue Upper Assemblies are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results."

This style became the foundation of American firearms engraving when his students emigrated to this country.The Walther Ernst PPK/S uses a more Germanic style Ernst pattern on the slide with a centered gold deer on a stainless pistol. The safety reflects the pattern. These were the last 200 Walther PPK/S made under contract by the S&W Houlton, Maine factory.

All rounds are factory new! Not reloaded and all are quality brands. This ammo is out of stock on the majority of major online ammo dealers. Full retail price i paid minus 20-25$ in shipping charges was over $ 150.00. I was in the process of collecting and purchasing .30 carbine ammo when it became available for storage and future use. Sold my M1 Carbine so it is no longer needed. Asking a fair price of $100 cash. No trades as im down to only shooting my hunting rifles during deer season and keeping my practice up with my carry weapon. So save some cash and of course get some ammo that is usually in short supply or out of stock at a decent price. Thanks.

The only reason I'm selling is because I'm moving to MD and can't take her with me sadly. I want $650 cash firm and no I will not budge on the price so do not ask, if you know anything about ak's then you'll know that the new production WASR's are the go to entry ak. Far better quality and much longer lasting then those cast bolt century ras c39 and IO garbage. The gun was hand picked by me at my lgs and I had to go through four before finding this one, it's straight, the bolt travel is smooth and there is no hang up no matter how slow you release it and all rivets are dam ne'er perfect. I didn't mall ninja the shit out of it like most people do and these are getting hard to find, I have over $800 in it all. Buyer must have a WV ID and sign a bill of sale, you can text me any time with questions or info at REDACTED and I'm located around Charles Town. Thanks for looking."
