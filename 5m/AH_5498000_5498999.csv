The full walnut stock and the lock are both marked with the  British Regiment Number (136).  The  .69 caliber 9""  blued barrel and the blued lock are both clearly marked with the MANTON name. The overall length is  15& 1/2"". The flintlock action is very strong, and the hammer holds on full and half cock. The barrel retains about 90% of the blue finish. The trigger guard, butt cap (with a lanyard ring)  and forward barrel clamp are all brass. There is a captive ramrod with a unique spring arrangement. The wood shows some nice graining and  has some minor dings ( remember, this was a military service weapon) with no cracks, gouges or missing wood. There are no sights and no proof marks vivible. There may be some under the barrel which I did not remove. The Manton firm was active during the period 1820 to 1832.. The overall condition of this fine weapon is EXCELLENT. Manton military flintlocks are hard to find, especially in this condition."

Uzi mags are cheap and can be bought on line in bulk. it comes with a thick barrel shroud balances out the weapon nicely and also makes it look cooler. it unscrews if you dont like it. This one has the Star of David scratched but you can see it was there. that means this was an original Israeli made Uzi. to bring it into the states the import company had to debadge the star of david on it. the Star is still there, they just ground out the center circle of it.  Some sort of old importation BS back in the day.  Then the outer shell parts were us or suprlus made, they have been replaced with Israeli parts now, and also the originals come with it. The stock folds and locks tight. it deploys with a very cool slap of the hand. The sights on this gun are amazing. I hate iron sights and always go with a scope or red dot.  on this one the irons provide a very clear and immediate sight picture, as soon as i bring it up I am looking down the sights and the front post is on target, its eas to see the target and move around as well. Uzi is like the AK of pistol caliber rifles. it is made solid, i mean really solid a huge hunk of metal, and that makes it reliable and stable. it reduces the recoil a ton, and makes for a very soft shooting accurate carbine. the action is straight blow back on a heavy brick of a bolt on a large spring system, its qucik efficient, and takes up recoil.  They used Uzis to protect the president for decades for many of these reasons. The downside is only that its a ittle heavy compared to other weapons that shoot 9mm these days.  but again if you want the nostalgia, the reliability, accuracy, and stright fun factor you wont feel the weight that much you will have adreneline helping you as you operate one of the worlds classic iconic sub machine guns- ( in semi auto)this one has been in my safe and planned to keep it forever but im kinda itching to buy a car so i need to sell some guns...will regret it later im sure. text me at REDACTED  cash only, no paypal,"

Has all it's Original early parts for an Early Pistol and has not been messed with as shown by looking close at it's Original finish. This is one of those first rarer variations making it different from the rest of the 50 some thousand being those variants stop after about the first 1000 give or take and after number 10432XX. We've seen a few other pistols in the same serial number range that have variants and the people that already are familiar with those actual facts will know about those variants on the real early pistols. Don't really want to ship it as it's a lot of trouble these days being it has to go from FFL to FFL Overnite however if you have someone that will handle that we will drop it off at an FFL and they can do all that."

This gun folds at the trigger guard in a snap and is the perfect size to stick in a pack or under a seat. I included the pack of cigs as a size reference.  Again used gun bust still functions great and this one could serve a range of purposes. Someone snatch this deal up;) lol I need this sold ASAP. That being said it's first come first served I won't hold it. This price Is firm but I might knock another $10 off if you come pick it up.

It has the usual features of the reliable 870 tactical shotguns: 18.5 inch choked barrel (I’ll include the improved cylinder choke thats in it and the ported choke that remington sends with them if I can find it, this choke patterns a lot better), ghost ring sights and weaver rail. The metal parts were painted olive drab to better protect them from moisture. It’s a great shotgun, I just don’t use it enough so it just sits in the safe (a crime I know). Price lowered to $575 OBO. Hit me up with any questions."

This pump model is a copy of the 870 Remington. This weapon is brand new, unfired. I purchased it from Classic Firearms a few months ago.Check out the reviews on Classic Firearms, or youtube. The shotgun is reportedly preferred over current production 870 express versions. I put on an after market recoil pad which will be more recoil restrictive. However, you will get the original recoil pad with it. Weapon holds 5+1 rounds. Has 18.5"" barrel. Has ghost sights. It is really a perfect home security shotgun. However, I have too many firearms, and need room in my safe. I paid $189.99 plus shipping, which brought it over $200.00. Then I paid Wash. state tax, and $30.00 for paperwork. I want $200.00 cash, no trades. No texts.  I do transfers at Quantico Tactical in Lakewood for $15.00!  Enjoy! Please don't try lowballin me. You are saving on shipping, and tax. Rick@REDACTED"
