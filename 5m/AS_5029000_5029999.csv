I bought this pistol around 2 years ago and havent put too many rounds down range. Never had a malfunction or failure with the gun. Most of the time it sat in my truck. The condition is excellent and hardly any finish wear, and in excellent condition.  I have the original box, paperwork, inspection tag, lock etc. I have three (3) extra mags that come with it, all the mags are factory sig mags. I also have some ammo that will come with it, some hornady critical defense stuff, federal and hornady hollow points and some fmj target ammo, almost 150 rounds. You can also buy a 357 sig barrel for these and run 357 sig, the mags are the same.

At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer daysPersonal Protection Made EasyThe Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.Easy to Use and MaintainThe Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA."

It came with two MAGS, one holds 8 rounds, the other MAG has an extension that holds ten rounds. I like it, find it fun to shoot and accurate. But wife says it's too big for her hand and the trigger is too hard to pull. We've shot almost a half a box of ammo and it shoots great, but she wants a smaller 380 or 9mm. And you know if "" Momms's Not Happy...""  I'd like what we paid for it $170.00, since it's practically Brand New In Box, with papers and lock. But will add a little cash to make this work. At the range she tried a Walther PK38 and a Beretta 9mm and found them lighter and smoother to pull trigger.  But their a bit pricey so we'd figure to buy one used. It just needs to work perfect, minor scratches don't matter much to us.
If you want to buy it cash great. If you want to trade it for one of the above that's great too. We'll even kick in the New Holster that holds both MAGS and the half box of 380 rounds still left over. 
We're serious and will meet you any public place you like.

handling in adverse climates. Its feature-laden olive drab green synthetic
stock is a technological marvel that looks and feels the part with Hogue
rubber overmolding featured at the grip and forend areas. These
revolutionary enhancements give you a positive grip in the slickest
environments. Shots are made infinitely more comfortable with the SuperCell
recoil pad. X-Mark Pro Trigger System gives a level of crispness and shot

This gun is in near excellent condition with just a few minor handling marks. You can use your imagination as to what the CYA means, but it actually came from the California Youth Authority where it was carried by case workers. These guns were not shot much except for annual qualification. They are very accurate and the action is typical S&W tight and smooth. This gun will make a nice addition to any S&W or LE collection or used as a concealed carry or house gun. Comes with compact Hogue Bantam grips with finger grooves and open back strap.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

This is a rifle that was built from a parts kit. The receiver is a 80% so it can not be legally sold. That being said, I can sell the parts kit legally, so that is what I would be doing. Do your research on receiver flats aka receiver blanks, and you will see what good this kit would do you. All parts were upgraded to 922r compliance, so as long as you run american mags, you are good there. This is a non numbers matching kit. The base price sale would come with all basic parts minus the lower receiver. The gas tube shown WOULD NOT come with it, the factory one would be included. The fire control group is a Tapco G2 made in the US. The barrel is an US made nitrated 16"" properly headspaced with go,field,and no go gauges. The sights have been upgraded to a peep in the rear, and a tritanium night sight front. The muzzle brake is US made. The grip is an ergo US made unit. The foregrip that would come with it is the black one in the picture that is US made. It was custom engraved It reads ""zombie antidote"". Everything was painted on the parts, so they would need to be stripped, and re-painted by you. This is the main package that would be $450 cash. If you want the USA made UltiMAK picatinny rail gas tube that holds zero after removal and instal, add $80. this is the only rail that will allow you to use a red dot with your iron sights seen through the red dot. I also have 3 40 round mags, 4 30 round mags, and 3 10 round mags that I would include for an additional $100. All prices are pretty much firm. I am in no dire need to sell it, I just figure someone else may actually use it, because it is just sitting in my safe. There are just over 500 flawless rounds down the chamber of this kit. It is just barely broken in. I can meet in either the Plainfield area, or O'hare area depending on the day of the week, and time. Because this is not a firearm when the receiver is not included, I can also ship the parts kit directly to your door. Payment can ne USPS Money Order, or Discrete Pay Pal. It would ship after payment clears. Thank you for looking."

With SIG Sauer you have a large array of firearms built to withstand the rigors of combat and duty use in the harshest extremes. SIG Sauer is known the world over for manufacturing some of the finest firearms on the planet. No wonder Special Operations, Law Enforcement, and Concealed Carry Aficionados alike rely on SIG Sauer to keep them and their loved ones safe. The P250, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....The SIG SAUER P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size; (subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.Specifications and Features:Caliber: 9mm LugerAction Type: DAOTrigger Pull DA: 5.5 - 6.5 lbsOverall Length: 7.2""Overall Height: 5.1""Overall Width: 1.3"" (Std.

Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance.Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well.With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous.Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol.________________________________________FeaturesUnlike any other pistol in its class, the P320 features a unique 5-point safety system, standard on all models:- Striker Safety- Disconnect Safety- 3-point Take Down Safety System- Takedown is prohibited without removal of magazine- System prohibits takedown without slide locked to the rear- Rotation of takedown lever allows disassembly without tools or trigger manipulation."

The gun was built using surplus G3 parts and has been reworked extensively for greater reliability. I have replaced a large number of critical components and performed many upgrades. The result is a very reliable, and surprisingly accurate rifle for half the price of an equivalent PTR and a fifth the price of an HK-91.
The following components have been replaced with NOS OEM German parts; locking rollers, roller retainer, roller retainer pin, recoil spring, buffer, charging handle spring, extractor spring, and locking lever spring. 
The rifle has also been upgraded with a South African pattern wide handguard with bipod slot, a NOS German G3 SEF trigger housing, with proper semi auto shelf installed, and a complete paddle magazine release (a must have upgrade on a G3).
The following spare parts and extras are included, complete German manufacture bolt carrier group, spare locking rollers (two +4, four standard size), slimline handguard, buttstock, pistol grip, roller retainer, and various pins, springs and small parts. Five 20 round magazines are also included, three of which have been coated in OD green Gunkote to match the rifle.
The rifle was coated in OD green when I bought it, I coated the new trigger housing to match and overall the coating is in pretty good shape. There are a couple of small scuffs and a few spots where it rubbed against other gear but overall looks really good. All critical components have been checked to ensure they are in spec; the locking piece looks brand new, and you can't tell the difference between it and a brand new factory piece, the bolt carrier is the highly desirable one piece Rhinemetall carrier, which is superior to the HK manufactured carriers, the critical bolt gap measures .019"", which is well within spec for the G3. The gun runs best with slightly oversize rollers and since installing the new parts the bolt gap has remained consistent.
Overall, this is a great running rifle. I've shot it with German DAG surplus, and Lake City surplus 7.62mm NATO and it runs like a cat on fire. If you have any questions or want to see more pictures or more details please call or text me at 928-five-eight-one-73-seven-seven."
