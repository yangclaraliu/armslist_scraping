This entry-level optic is fitted high-quality coated lenses, 1/4 MOA adjustments, and it's water, fog, and shockproof. A mounting base and rings are used to attach a riflescope to a firearm. A comfortable sight picture is contingent upon the height of the rings. A comfortable cheek-weld is the result of properly positioning the scope over the receiver. Mounting the scope close to the receiver is preferable, yet scopes with larger objectives need higher rings so the front bell can clear the barrel.

It has roughly 800 rounds fired through it. This was a carry around the homestead rifle, so there is some minor scratches on the stock as well as a little finish wear on the receiver by the bolt. It runs 100% like it should. The barrel is a Ruger OEM. I did not like the front sight so I removed it by cutting just behind the front sight collar/band. I refinished the crown with a Manson Precision muzzle crown refacing kit. It is finished with an 11 degree target crown. The color was touched up with Brownell's Oxpho-Blue. It has the following upgrades -1.) Hogue overmolded stock. This is the hard synthetic version.2.) Volquartsen target hammer. It breaks smoothly at around 3lbs. I will also include the OEM hammer and springs. 3.) KIDD charging handle and guide rod. It has the standard velocity guide rod spring installed. I will also include the spring for sub-sonic ammunition.4.) KIDD bolt buffer5.) Weaver 2.5x7x28 rimfire scope equipped with Butler Creek scope covers.I have 4 magazines in total. 3 OEM 10 rounders and one 25 round Butler Creek mag. Consider the Butler Creek mag a freebie because it has feeding problems. Also, one of the OEM mags was stored loaded for a while so it hangs up as well. I have read that this can be corrected by disassembling and cleaing the parts out. I have not done it because the other two OEM mags run just fine and I don't just sit there and plink way with the rifle anyway. I am mainly looking to trade but I will sell outright if my asking price is met. I want $400 FIRM for everything. No haggling, I am not desperate for cash.Will meet in Prattville or possibly Montgomery depending where you are coming from."

The only difference is the box that they are packaged in and these that I have come 14/case and the Military cases only have 12. So you gain 2 extra meals in each cases and these and the Military sealed meals both weigh 8 ounces. The main entrée comes with its own heater all you do is add 4 ounces of water to the heater bag and you have a hot entrée. The best by date is 09/16 which means that you still have a 5 plus year shelf life as long as they are stored in a controlled environment. Each case has 7 different meals with 2 of each meal totaling 14 meals per case. I am selling 3 cases for $90 and 5 cases for $140. These are great for hunting, camping, emergency or just in case!
