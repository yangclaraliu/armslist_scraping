The ultimate lever gun. This rifle became the Model 94 Winchester. It was the ultimate iteration of Winchester levers and, although coming at the end of westward expansion, is often called ""The Gun that Won the West.""
 
The proven performer for over a century. No greater names have ever been linked together more solidly than Winchester® and the Model 1894. Early on in 1862, Oliver Fisher Winchester began Winchester Repeating Arms Company  and followed with a series of fine rifles like the 1866, 1873 and 1876. Then John M. Browning came along with numerous other designs which became legendary Winchesters, like the Single Shot 1885, Model 86 and the Model 92 among others. Then, in 1893 he presented to Winchester a model that was a perfect match for the new 30-30 smokeless cartridge, ushering in a new era in firearms development.
 
A few good reasons to own a Model 94 Winchester. There are a number of good reasons that the Model 94 Winchester is still a solid choice for big game hunting. It is true that many hunters over the years have moved to bolt actions for longer range hunting --  like out in the West for example, where cross canyon shots are common. That is well and good. But even in the 21st century, the most hunted big game animal in North America -- the Whitetail -- is in brushier, nastier, tighter conditions than ever. In fact, the urbanization of the Whitetail is one of the most studied topics by wildlife biologist these days. If you are whitetail hunter you are likely going to be hunting in these kinds of conditions. And being able to get on target and make a good shot is something the Model 94 has been proven to do for over 110 years.
 
Fast. Very Fast. Its light weight, quick pointing characteristics, ease of cycling the next round, overall responsiveness, and choice of good calibers makes it an excellent choice for deer and even black bear. Many consider the Model 94 the ultimate rifle for training a new shooter too. There is an intrinsic level of interest generated when you put one in the hands of a young shooter. And the skills learned in loading, handling, operating and shooting transfer to every type of hunting.
 
What do I like best about the Model 94 Winchester?
     Lots of steel and wood. It's just made the old fashioned way. Lots of durable steel parts that feel solid and reliable.
    Incredible design. John Moses Browning really outdid himself when he designed the Model 94. The mechanism is smooth and precise. The ergonomics are practically perfect. The action is strong and simply not prone to wearing out.
    Solid lockup. The John Browning design was created to handle the newest type of ammunition in the world at the time: smokeless powder loads. And it is still handling them. The Model 94 has been chambered in some of the meanest calibers ever developed for fast action in brushy conditions.
    It's a lifetime gun. Some rifles come and go, but a Model 94 just builds a lifetime of memories. It is one gun that your family will appreciate long after you are gone. It's a gun your great grandson will learn to shoot with. Timeless. 
    Today's we have the ability to make great barrels for every Winchester no matter what the action type . This means the 94 is more accurate than ever. And there are more bullet choices too. And factory ammo is a lot more affordable than some other calibers, making it something you can afford to shoot.
    It' may seem like the opposite of today's MSR, but lever actions have a lot in common with today's modern sporting rifles. 110 years ago our ancestors bought 94s because they were cool, fun to shoot, fast handling and had high magazine capacity. Sound familiar.  As for us, we are certain the Winchester Model 94 is one of the most amazing rifles ever made."

This belt system offers the best features for serious competition shooters.The inner belt is designed to be streamlined and slim-profiled to prevent it from adding too much thickness under the outer belt. This helps to ensure you wear your gear close to your body in the most comfortable way. The inner belt is pointed at one end to facilitate easy threading through pant loops. Of course the inner belt carries the soft Velcro layer to prevent it from snagging on clothing or car seats when worn separately.The outer belt is simply the strongest and stiffest belt on the market today, bar none! It is constructed of a tough, web nylon outer, covering a fiber reinforced polymer core, which gives the belt its impressive rigidity. We designed the belt to be slightly thicker than most others, so that the holsters and pouches mounted on the belt will sit firmly in place and will not rock or slide around. This makes it slightly harder to thread some makes of holsters and pouches, but all types of gear will fit.Other features include:Top quality material and workmanshipIndustrial strength Velcro of the highest standardBoth inner and outer belt have their size clearly taggedCompetition width 1.5”, to fit with all shooting gear larger belts (36” and up) have a 24cm (9.5”) overlap section. This is to ensure the smaller size users have enough space on their belts for all their magazines pouches.An attractive and functional safety loop is included with belt, carrying an embroidered “AA” logoIncluded is three double stack mag holders with a magnet for even faster access to your magazine.

They are brand-new, never fired; handmade pieces by a generational gunsmithing family. A couple points for the historian out there:-Wood is rosewood, not oak. Oak is comically expensive in other regions of the world, but rosewood is just as tough and twice as pretty in my opinion.-The barrel is seamless steel, and the breech is threaded then welded. This was done for maximum safety and is decidedly NOT historically accurate. However it is hidden, and no-one will notice. Those are the only two changes to the original design. These carbines are:-.75 caliber (I use .715 Lyman mold for my shot)-Flint-lock (I have no flint to spare, sorry. Military muskets tend to enjoy 1-1.5 inch knapped flint wrapped in thin leather)-Beautiful brass fittingsPrice is very firm. I could afford them in the first place, I can afford to let them sit in a safe. Only selling because I have three and I feel that's a little greedy, since I know Bess Carbines are not exactly common. Price includes bayonet, but bayonets do NOT have scabbards. It is just the musket, ramrod, and bayonet. No leather accessories for either; I've only got the one set and that's staying with my gun.Email me anytime."

The right-handed selector paddle will be on the left side of the rifle. The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™'s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible.

It may have been used in WWI and WWII. Though it is genuine and authentic, it appears to have been sent to the US military arsenal for a 1924  factory re-build, as it has the 1924 arched main spring housing instead of the flat housing, and it has the 1924 Bakelite grips instead of the wood double-diamnond grips. It does retain the proper slide and frame, as the frame retains the accurate S14 original inspector's stamp on the left side of the frame on the trigger guard and the rampant Colt on the rear of the slide. It does not have all of the arsenal re-build stampings because some pistols made it through the re-build process without them. The barrel and slide index properly. The gun is blued, not parkarized. It does show some holster wear. It retains all visible US military issue markings on the left side of the frame and slide, and the right side of the slide and frame. The serial number is not a re-stamp. All in all, this is a real nice Model 1911 US Army issue .45 ACP pistol that has probably seen action in WWI and WWII. I AM SELLING AS PART OF MY COLT COLLECTION.
