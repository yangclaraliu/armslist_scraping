I've kept it in my pocket for no more than 4 days or so, so it is in PERFECT, flawless condition. It's the double-edged version with a black blade, and black handle. It is the out of the front automatic knife and the action works perfectly. I paid over $490 for it and since it is in what I consider near perfect condition, I'm asking $375 for it - or best offer - and I will pay the shipping costs. If you pay using paypal, let's split the 3% fee 50/50. Contact me if you are interested. It comess with the original box as well. I will ship it anywhere in the US, but no international shipments; I've run onto a lot of problems shipping to other countries and I'd rather not deal with it.
 
This knife is a steal for this price, so get it while you can. Thank you for your interest. If you would like me to send you more images, contact me and let me know. This website only allows one image to upload.
***For some reason, the listing says no shipping on it. This is not true, I will ship the knife anywhere in the US***

Bought new from PSA. 15 rnd. Single/double action. Alloy frame, steel slide. Ran about 200 rounds through it when I first bought it without a jam. The only problemit has is the magazine. The gun has a safety feature that prevents the trigger from engaging without the magazine fully seated. Evidently the top of the mag was damaged in some capacity because even though it's feels like it seats, it doesn't catch whatever release that engages the trigger; thus preventing it from firing. In other words, it needs a mag replacement. I've found them online for under 30 bucks. I've had my attention a few of my other toys so this one's been sitting in the safe. Figured I might as well let someone else put it to use"

Magazines) equipped with full, Modified and Cylinder Bore Choke Tubes and Wrench, Adjustable Rear Sight, Manual. NEW IN BOX This shotgun is identical to the MKA 1919 Akdals, imported by at least two companies, and marketed in the $700 price range. Its only difference, apart from the lettering, is actually an improvement. This AR12 has a cosmetically correct gas tube linkage piece between its forend and the front sight. This is the Leader Arms AR12 shotgun. Type is Benelli style action built into an AR15 style platform. Not, mind you, that it will accept an AR Upper; it will not. Type is gas operated semi automatic shotgun. Manufacturer is Leader Arms Technology in Kizilay, Republic of Turkey. Importer is PW Arms of Redmond, WA. Distributor and Warrantor is AR57 llc of Monroe, WA. Chambering is 12 gauge, 2 3/4 inch and 3 inch shells interchangeably. Construction is steel barrel, bolt, gas tube, magazines and internal parts, with alloy upper receiver and magazine release; and polymer lower receiver, trigger, forend or barrel sheath, and faux upper gas tube. Barrel is 18 1/2 inch standard bore, furnished with a total of 4 Benelli thread choke tubes and wrench, .712 improved cylinder steel ok slug ok; .704 modified steel ok; .695 improved modified no steel no slug; and .688 full no steel no slug. Sights are fixed .140 partridge blade front with removable AR type windage and elevation adjustable, black blade rear. Forend assembly has a 27 slot Picatinny rail, with a receiver integral 21 slot rail behind it. Bolt handle is knurled Beretta type. Safety is standard AR two position lever for a right handed shooter. Gas mechanism is housed inside the forend, and operates much the same way as a Beretta shotgun, with heavy and light load settings possible. Magazines are factory steel body, with steel springs, polymer shell follower and floorplate. Each mag holds 5 rounds of 12 gauge 2 3/4 inch or 3 inch shells. Magazines with up to 24 rounds are readily available throughout the US, since this is exactly the same shotgun as the MKA 1919 except for its cosmetic gas tube above its barrel. Trigger is .325 polymer two stage, pulls in the 10 pound vicinity with moderate felt creep and overtravel. Buttstock is fixed black polymer; its length of pull is 14 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 1 inch rubber recoil pad. Buttstock has no cant or drop, since the rear sight blade is 2 1/2 inches above the comb. Weight empty is 8 pounds, with center of gravity at the breech face. Specs  Model: AR-12 Gauge: 12 Gauge System: Gas Operated Semi-Automatic Barrel Length: 19.7 in. Overall Length: 40.5 in. Height: 7.5 in. Sight Radius: 23.6 in.
