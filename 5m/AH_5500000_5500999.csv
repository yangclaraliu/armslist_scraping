I believe it will only fit Gen 3 full size upper assemblies but it may also fit Gen 4 I am not sure, so you can do your own research or only use it on Gen 3 upper glock assemblies.I am the original owner and only shot one box of 50 rounds thru it. The glock lower is in mint condition and will last a lifetime or two of use. I would say it is a 9.5 out of 10, but you can inspect and decide for yourself.  It was a glock 22 (40 cal) but I have sold the slide separately and would now like to sell the lower to fund a new glock with the rmr cut out, those things are pricey.Thanks for looking."

This is a 22LR pistol, based on the Tec-9 design. It has a polymer grip with storage inside and comes in the original case. The 10rd mag is original and has Intratec22 on the side. The two 30 round magazines consist of one Intratec and one Ramline. It has a threaded barrel and comes with a steel thread protector as well. These are designed to take regular Ruger 10/22 magazines including the 10 round rotary mags. These don't come around everyday and this looks to be in pretty good condition. I have only put a small amount of ammo through it to make sure it works. It did not like the lead round nose ammo, but ran copper jacketed ammo including JHP copper jackets 100%. These are very easy to disassemble and maintain. The trigger on this pistol is very good, no take up and very short reset. I am primarily looking to sell but would trade for a nice firearm. Not interested in trading for anything other than firearm related items. Firearms, ammunition, and of course cash are welcome.IF THE LISTING IS UP, IT IS AVAILABLE.Sold as is, not breaking up the package. Asking price is $450 with a $500 trade value."

My loss will be your gain.  Rifle is practically brand new and was over $1200 w/tax....  Willing to take a small loss at the moment at $1000 firm, but will be pulling this ad down as soon as I figure out another method of covering the expense I have.... which I've almost all but covered since originally posting this, so I have edited since, and will probably pull soon...  Get it while it's still up!!!Details:The PTR 91 FR .308 semi auto features a slim aluminum hand guard w/rail attachments (I have a few 6"" and a couple 2"" you can add), welded top rail to assist in mounting your favorite optics and an 18"" barrel with removable flash hider (The Match Grade Bull barrel is thicker than the standard HK 91 barrel and greatly increases accuracy).  A beautiful black powder coat finish. Comes with (2)- 10/20 magazines & a padded hard case.  PTR offers a 3 year warranty from original date of purchase on all products manufactured.  All PTR products also have a lifetime or 25,000rd warranty!NOTE:  I also have another posting for this rifle all built up with HK MSG 90 / PSG1 level upgrades (very pricey) puting this rifle in HK's MSG90/PSG1-esk category of accuracy.  Rifle already gets MOA to 1.5MOA accuracy as it stands, however, with these upgrades accuracy is increased with the addition of the 4.5lb trigger group & original HK metal trigger housing & grip,  a PRS2 stock w/custom HK enhanced heavy buffer install (recoil decreased 50%), along with other compliments like a Harris bipod & rail adapter, FFP scope & mount, etc... however it's about $1300 worth the upgrades.  I'll be willing to part with the whole build as listed in that post for $2250 but decided that some people may not be in the market to spend that much, so figured would post the base rifle (which is an AWEOSME .308 battle rifle on it's own) here as well...  Whichever goes first.  I would really like to rebuild this exact build again as it is an amazing semi-auto 308 in it's full MSG 90/PSG1 form, crazy accurate for a semi auto w/hi-cap capability (consistant sub moa)...  However, if you are interested in any of the upgrades individually, I might be willing to piece parts out for the right price as well, so feel free to ask.  Other post:  https://www.armslist.com/posts/5471144/california-rifles-for-sale--hk-msg-90-clone---impressive-sub-moa-semi-auto-hi-cap--308---Any questions, call anytime before 10PM...

Comes in the Browning factory-fitted leather box, with leather reinforced corners, faux inside fur, flipup luggage locks, and brass feet for when it stands handle up. I was expecting a full complement of chokes for it and there is a big compartment in the box for them, but all you get here is what is sitting on the barrels: two long Browning goldtipped Skeet choke tubes for both 410 and 20g, and only one of the said Browning Sk choke tubes for the top barrel of the 28g set, although the bottom barrel is also threaded for chokes. Some of the choke tubes have tiny dings at their muzzles, but nothing serious. All three double barrels are perfectly matched and numbered to the receiver and the forearm, and fashioned to give similar sight picture and weight for near-identical swing feel, no matter which caliber is being fired. It features the single trigger that fires the top barrel first and readies the other firing pin, and if you don't fire the lower barrel the ejector only kicks out the upper empty. It was owned by an old skeet guy with too many guns, but he did shoot this one once in a while. It looks like his favorite caliber in this set was the 20g, as that barrel seems to be the one that's the farthest from looking unfired here. I didn't say it had the most wear because it barely shows any wear! Examining all 3 barrel sets, though, it is striking how little wear they have. You will find a tiny scratch or nick on a vent rib or the side of a barrel, but the only scratches worth mentioning here are the small ones right at the muzzle of the 20g set, about 1/16"" long or less, on both sides of the top and bottom barrels, maybe from a brief rub on asphalt possibly, but hard to notice unless you look for them. The forearm looks wonderful too, from the same gorgeous chunk of walnut that the receiver is mounted in, and of course with the same soft satin finish as the stock. The only flaw to mention on it is that the front edge of the schnabel-style curve has some very minor little dings that pepper the edge line and blunt it a bit- very minor but if I fail to mention it somebody will bitch about it for sure. Lastly, the stock looks similarly wonderful, but is also not entirely flawless. The metal there looks wonderful, no flaws or nicks to report on it, but the beautiful wood does have a few minor scratches and rubs from light field use. The low-cut, hand-checkered diamonds all look mostly as they came from Miroku, but you'll see they have very minor point rounding in places, again from low to moderate field usage. Looking closely at that region, the only real wear showing is at the pointed forward edge of the pistol grip- very minor rounding of the edge there. Moving rearward, the left has a very shallow 2-inch long minor crease near the first cheek support , but little else to mention on that side. Moving to the right side, about the same length crease is there, but farther back, along with a few tiny marks scattered around, but again nothing to arouse any alarm or ire, just minimal, honest wear that can easily be corrected if necessary. The cheek rest looks to be adjustable up and down, and the recoil pad is hard rubber mounted on an ingenious internal recoil-reducing part that slides into the stock and compresses against a strong spring to blunt and prolong the sensation, for a big reduction to the shoulder. In addition, the 20g barrels are both ported, for a further reduction in muzzle rise. An extremely beautiful and functional piece of shootable art, no less, so belly up and bid! The distance from the front of the trigger to the extended butt plate is almost 15 inches. The owner had a piece of what looks like black naugahide stuck to the entire cheekpiece upper surface, and a bit of that is starting to curl up on the left side bottom edge.
