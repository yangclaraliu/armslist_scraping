A great watch with a strong rechargeable light built-in.  I’ve used the light a lot and I’ve still only had to recharge it about every 4 months (the watch uses a separate battery).  This is an operator quality timepiece. I’ve owned three of their watches and everyone has been a champ.  I just upgraded to something nicer so I’m trying to find this watch a nice home.
 
My description doesn’t do this watch justice.  See: https://www.specialopswatch.com/products-page/vultures/black-vulture-carbon-fiber/
 
I have all the original paperwork showing proof of ownership and the battery being replaced.
 
 FOR SALE FOR $600 OBO (Retails for $1,400) or reasonable trade for firearm of greater value.I will ship USPS Priority Mail for shipping cost and Paypal transaction fee.

There is almost no wear in the green parkerized finish, even where the pump rides on the magazine tube. Just to be clear, there is no corrosion of any kind anywhere, nor has there ever been. This gun looks very clean.It has the very long magazine that holds a bunch of rounds, then a Speed Feed Stock made in the US by Davis (M500 series), and of course the factory issue bayonet. There's also a sling, and a Bandolier/Belt (also made in the US by Urban ERT) that holds 30 more rounds.I cherished this awesome shotgun for years, but now it's time to find an new enthusiastic owner. My price is firm, and I'm not looking for any trades at this time. I'm located in Skagit County, and I know a FFL in South Mt Vernon that will do private transfers for only $25. Buyer pays transfer fees. I can also ship the shotgun directly to your FFL. Thanks and have a great day!"

It has a 4 1/2"" barrel, and from the serial number, it was made in 1951. I have fired this with my kids, and it runs great with no failure to feeds. It is also remarkably accurate. The barrel is crisp with nice sharp rifling and no corrosion or pitting. This model comes apart in fractions of a second with no tools.   The factory magazine is included. The bluing is probably at 80-90% or so, with a little wear on the end of the barrel and the sharp edges of the slide. If you are not familiar with the Sport King model, it breaks down VERY easy for cleaning. It also has a new Wolf recoil spring installed. Buyer pays transer fee.  I do know one in South Mt Vernon that will do it for only $25 and no tax.   I can also sell directly to FFL C&R holders for price of shipping and no transfer fees. Shippingto your FFL or C&R holders would be about $20.Thanks, and have a good day!"

These guns were built by CZ for just a couple of years and difficult to find today. In 1998, Colt partnered with CZ to have them design a good double action pistol. The result was the Colt Z40 and, as the name suggested, it was developed for and chambered only in 40S&W. It shares the 1911's grip angle, which was a design stipulation that Colt implemented. To make a long story short, CZ produced the Z40 for Colt for about a year before the business relationship soured and Colt dropped it from their lineup. CZ continued to produce the pistol for another year or so under the moniker ""40B"". With such a short production run for this pistol under both names, there aren't many around. The only finish it was offered in is the black finish that CZ uses for its other handguns. The 1911-style grips are black rubber. The 40B is different from anything Colt or CZ produced before or since. However, like everything CZ produces, its a very well built pistol. Unlike most of the metal CZ 75 based pistols, this has an aluminum frame, not steel. Despite the fact that this pistol looks so different from the CZ 75, the action and trigger have an identical feel. When you handle it, you know you have a CZ in your hands. Like other CZ pistols, the slide rides inside the frame, like a Sig P210. The ergonomics are outstanding and the CZ 40B is very comfortable in hand. This was also the pistol that CZ later based the smaller RAMI off of, as you may be able to tell from its appearance. I shot the gun less than 50 rounds and I don't think it was shot much prior to that. The 40B features a smooth double action trigger pull and a clean SA trigger pull. In typical CZ fashion, accuracy is very good and quality is high. It comes with one Clinton-era 10 round 40S&W mag, but I see magazines available for these pistols often. The barrel length is 4.25"". The sights are the 3 white dot type and work great. The front strap features vertical serrations for a secure grip. Disassembly works just like a CZ 75B, as does the safety. You must be a NH resident with LTC and be over 21. Price is $450.00."
