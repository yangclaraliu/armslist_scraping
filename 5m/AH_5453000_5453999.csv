434,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5453434,For Sale:  Model 1855 Rifle Musket,"OR, Oregon, United States",$ 900,"Listed On: Friday, May 6, 2016",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"The widespread complaints from US Army units about the Maynard Tape Priming System led the Army to convene an Ordnance Board in May 1860 under Major Alfred Mordecai to study the problem. After examining the problem with the Model 1855 and reviewing numerous reports, the Board issued a report with several recommendations. The Board first noted that virtually all of the reports from company commanders whose soldiers were issued the Model 1855, and from the Army's Inspectors General, agreed that the Maynard Tape Priming System was unreliable for ""general service; and it appears that no commanding officers are willing to trust to the use of them separately from the percussion cap..."" Major Mordecai and the Ordnance Board then take a not-so-subtle swipe at the Ordnance Department's original decision to adopt the Model 1855 Rifle Musket when he writes that the reports from the field were ""confirming the doubts expressed by the Ordnance Board with regard to the adoption of the system, when this subject was first presented to them in 1854."" The Model 1855 Rifle Musket, which was already in the field but which was just made obsolete by the Ordnance Department's decision to completely scrap its percussion system, was only made at the United States' two national armories, Springfield Armory and Harpers Ferry Armory. With war imminent, the radical change to the principal shoulder arm of the United States Army would require both national armories to rapidly re-tool and equip to begin producing the new model rifle as quickly as possible. This plan received a major blow when, just two months after the new changes were authorized, on April 18, 1861, Virginia Militia troops captured Harpers Ferry Armory, leaving Springfield Armory as the sole national armory for the war that was just beginning. And the Union Army would not even have the full benefit of the more than 60,000 Model 1855 Rifle Muskets, with the now obsolete Maynard Tape Primer System because an inventory dated October 10, 1860, listed only 22,649 of these rifles in US Government arsenals. Of these, 7,431 of the rifles were in US armories located in what would become the Confederacy and these rifles would initially serve the Confederate, not the Union Army.modified barrel bands, a modified hammer, deletion of the retaining swell in the ramrod, addition of a ramrod retaining spring, and enlarged stock wrist. Additionally, the finish to the furniture was changed. The lock and hammer were color case hardened and, initially, the barrel bands were left in the white or national armory bright. Later in 1863, Springfield Type I production barrel bands were blued. This change in finish of barrel bands helps date Model 1863 Rifles manufactured in 1863 since those with armory bright barrel bands were probably produced from April to August or September 1863. These changes, as incorporated in the new rifle, are referred to as the Model 1863 Rifle, Type I. These changes were again mirrored in small ways by some of the contractors in late 1863 and 1864. The Trigger Plate and Trigger Guard Bow are original and are in fine condition. There is no pitting or corrosion on the trigger plate and it is assuming a pewter patina with areas of plum towards the rear portion. The Trigger Guard Bow has a few nicks on the bottom portion and it also is assuming a mixed pewter and plum patina. The original filing marks on the bottom of the guard bow can still be seen.

After examining the problem with the Model 1855 and reviewing numerous reports, the Board issued a report with several recommendations. The Board first noted that virtually all of the reports from company commanders whose soldiers were issued the Model 1855, and from the Army's Inspectors General, agreed that the Maynard Tape Priming System was unreliable for ""general service; and it appears that no commanding officers are willing to trust to the use of them separately from the percussion cap..."" Major Mordecai and the Ordnance Board then take a not-so-subtle swipe at the Ordnance Department's original decision to adopt the Model 1855 Rifle Musket when he writes that the reports from the field were ""confirming the doubts expressed by the Ordnance Board with regard to the adoption of the system, when this subject was first presented to them in 1854."" The Model 1855 Rifle Musket, which was already in the field but which was just made obsolete by the Ordnance Department's decision to completely scrap its percussion system, was only made at the United States' two national armories, Springfield Armory and Harpers Ferry Armory. With war imminent, the radical change to the principal shoulder arm of the United States Army would require both national armories to rapidly re-tool and equip to begin producing the new model rifle as quickly as possible.

Browning's finest pistol. Made in Belgium in 1981, with all matching numbers, this rare alloy frame pistol weighs in at just under 2 lbs fully loaded. It's slim profile makes it easy to carry concealed. The SFS hammer and safety system from Cylinder and Slide makes the Hi Power a truly great weapon. The trigger breaks very cleanly with just a small amount of take-up. If you don't know what people mean when they say the Hi Power ""points naturally"", you owe it to yourself to try one. Extremely accurate and a joy to shoot, it eats any ammo you want to use: ball, hollow points, home-loads, etc. Bore is clean and rifling is excellent. Has Altamont wood grips. The magazine disconnect ""safety"" is removed, but will be included with the gun. Also included are 3 magazines (one original and 2 aftermarket) and 21 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense ammo.  In person only - will not ship.  Sights have been upgraded for much better visibility than stock, and more pictures can be sent on request."
