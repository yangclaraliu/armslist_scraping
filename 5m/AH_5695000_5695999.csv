This has been my ""do everything"" gun from conceal carry, range toy, and trusty home defender. I have beaten many of my friends in shooting contests with this gun and I am very reluctant to sell it. I am selling it because I bought a new gun (HK P30) so I don't need two ""do everything"" guns. I have roughly 1500-2000 rounds through the PPQ. This gun is as reliable as a Glock and I have IDPA/USPSA friends who have gone through tens of thousands of rounds with their PPQs. I can tell you from personal experience, that this thing is RELIABLE and will eat anything you feed it. I am a clean freak when it comes to my guns so I cleaned it religiously after every range trip with premium M-Pro 7. There is holster wear around the front of the slide, the barrel, and on the sights. The sights are upgraded Trijicon tritium night sights that glow very bright in the dark. Along with the gun I will include a like new custom holster made by JM Custom Kydex and a Bravo Concealment mag carrier. I also will include 5 fifteen round and 1 seventeen round magazines. I also have the original case, speedloader and paperwork to go along with the firearm. 
Everything what I paid:
1 PPQ M2 9mm +2 mags = $600 + tax
1 Trijicon tritium night sights = $120
3 fifteen round magazines = $40/ea
1 seventeen round magazine = $50/ea
1 Right Hand JM Custom Kydex OWB holster = $75
1 Bravo Concealment mag carrier = $30
Everything I paid totals to about $995 + tax (+ shipping for certain items) so a little over a $1,000.
I am selling everything for $650. I may consider trades up to $750 value. I am open to straight or partial trades + cash/ammo/parts/etc.
I am not interested in any trades for a 40 S&W. I may consider a P30L LEM or a P30SK LEM in 9mm trades. 
Do NOT attempt to low-ball me, I am NOT desperate to sell. I am very reluctant to sell my PPQ which I trusted my life with, but I need the cash to accessorize my new gun.
You must be a legal resident of Texas. Must have a valid Texas Driver's License. CHL or LTC preferred. I am a CHL holder. I live near the Westchase area, near BLTWY 8 + Westheimer. I am willing to meet somewhere halfway in a public space."
