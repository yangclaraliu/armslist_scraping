The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm."

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.  The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional."

Comes with a Hogue Handguard and Pistol Grip and Phoenix Technology Stock with trap door storage.It has a stamped receiver, Green Mountain 4140 barrel, TAPCO G2 Trigger, and like new Hungarian AKM parts kit. The receiver has a KG Gun Coat finish, and the bolt, bolt carrier, cleaning rod, axis pins, rear sight assembly, spring guide, and Green Mountain barrel are coated in Fenocite, which provides superior corrosion resistance, increased accuracy, and reduced wear. DDI claims that this is the only finish that has passed the US Military’s 96 hour salt bath requirement and is being used on the new Remington Sniper rifles. This process is superior to chrome lining and any other finish on the market. The barrel life should be extended by a third over a regular nitrate barrel and all treated parts have a Rockwell 70 rating.This rifle has exactly 420 rds (14 mags) through it without a single issue. There is nothing wrong with it...I have another one with Magpul furniture and simply don't need this one anymore.$750 face to face cash. I am willing to drive a couple hours within the GA/AL/FL/SC area if needed. I will consider shipping to your FFL for a negotiated price depending on shipping cost.

$300 firm in cash or a little better in trade.
I will consider trades, but I don't need anything right now except a Kel-Tec SU-16C and I'll add some cash, ammo or other.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.About the only thing I am looking is a Kel-Tec SU-16C models, AR-15/10 receivers, triggers, maybe other parts.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, I have plenty, so not in need of any particular caliber.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in Garland or Mesquite or will ship for $20 more.  Thanks for looking!"

$950 firm in cash or better in trade.Wanting cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, +/- cash or other.Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns and bolt-guns.
A few I would not mind having more of, Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it.  Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts kits without trigger parts, nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  I will consider complete lowers, but I can build them much cheaper.  2 - Kel-Tec SU-16C.
Ammo in common rifle and pistol calibers to help with a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber.
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals will need to equal the cash price. Maybe nice scopes and 1x like Aimpoint and Eotechs for future projects along with nice magnifiers.Ftf in the Garland area and must be legal to own a firearm in TX or I can ship for $30 more.Thanks for looking!"

The RZ-10 is a 5″ 1911 and features a serrated Clark-style target rib machined on the top of the slide with fixed defensive sights. We fit a match-grade ramped barrel for use with the most popular 10mm loads and smoother feeding. The slide is mated to our standard forged frame with undercut trigger guard and smooth front strap. On both the frame and the slide we polish the flats to a soft brushed finish and sandblast the rounds. The gun is finished off with a nice set of double diamond cocobolo grips. Chambered in the powerful 10mm cartridge, the Razorback is a very versatile 1911 package suitable for defensive use, target shooting and handgun hunting of medium-sized game up to deer or wild boar."

This is a true Drop in Roller Bearing Trigger, the only one of its kind on the market. It's got an easily adjustable pull weight from 2 3/4 to 4 pounds. It's a super smooth, lightning fast, single stage trigger. You can effortlessly simulate full auto running this thing. ( https://youtu.be/omHTrF5UUYc ) 
 
The condition is like-new. I installed it in my AR-15 and literally only shot it on the range once. I really only bought it for emotional reasons because I wanted the full-auto like capabilities. My AR-15 however, is set up for long range precision, so I swapped the Elf out for a 2 stage Geissele trigger. The Elf is in Perfect Functional, Like-New Condition and comes with the Elftmann AR-15 Non-Rotating Anti-walk Trigger and Hammer Pins. 
 
The trigger and pins sell on Elftmann's site for $300 + shipping. You're saving $20 + the cost of shipping buying from me, and you still have the Lifetime Guarantee. 
 
The item will be shipped same or next day via USPS first Class mail.

ELF 3-Gun Trigger The ELF Drop-In 3-Gun Trigger has been built for winning competitions.

Pull weight is so easy to adjust it can be done in seconds without removing the trigger from your lower receiver. A second-to-none AR-15 drop-in trigger system that is strong and light, made of wire EDM machined, hardened A2 tool steel and lightweight aircraft-grade aluminum.

This particular rifle bears the Sako manufacturing proofs.This rifle did not have shims. I was able to shim it to achieve free floating the barrel in the handguards. 500.00 FIRM gets the rifle and the Finn leather sling along with 10 or so rounds (I won't need them anymore). Shop around...the rifle, sling, s&h, and transfer fees will likely put you over 500 for a SAKO manu civil guard rifle. If you like Mosin Nagant rifles, this is an excellent example of how it can be refined."
