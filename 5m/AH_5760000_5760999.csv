The rifle chassis is designated with an ""LE"" code; ""Law Enforcement"". The chassis was used on a Savage 110 action with a fluted heavy free-floating barrel. It has an external box magazine (holding 5 rounds), magpul adjustable stock, adjustable pistol grip, and three swivel studs for sling and bipod mounting.The 110 BA comes with a Magpul Industries PRS-G3 stock. The stock is considered a precision Rifle/Sniper stock. The stock includes an adjustable length of pull and an adjustable cheek rest for customization to the operator's requirements. The adjustments are achieved via rotating dials that incrementally move the butt plate and cheek rest respectively back and forth or up and down. The stock features a rubber recoil pad with an aluminum core for reduced fatigue and stainless steel adjustment shafts for corrosion resistance. Molded from nylon reinforced polymer. The stock includes an adapter for sling mounting.The 110 BA chassis also comes with a Heckler & Koch PSG1style pistol grip. The grip is a target-type grip which contains an adjustable palm shelf. A hex bolt rather than a rotating dial tightens or loosens the palm shelf. Loosening the bolt allows for the palm rest to move up and down to accommodate the shooters hand size. Tightening the bolt locks the rest into a set position that is now customized to the shooters hand size.Savage utilized the Accuracy International detachable five-round, single stack box magazine for the 110 BA chassis.

Over a 30 year mortgage, a homeowner faces a 96 percent chance of being burglarized, a 26 percent chance of flood damage, and 9 percent chance of a fire. The safe's anti-theft features include patented concealed hinges designed to resist prying, a programmable (use your own personal 3 to 8 digit pass-code), digital lock and 6 solid steel locking bolts. The composite construction with water tight seal prevents water damage to the contents caused by flooding or by water used in fighting a fire. This waterproof safe will float making it easy to find during a flood, and it will remain dry inside even if fully submerged. The safe has been awarded a UL classified 1 hour fire rating verifying that it will withstand an external temperature of 1700 degrees F. while maintaining an internal temperature of less than 350 degrees. The safe has been tested by an independent test lab and verified to protect electronic media including memory sticks, CD's, DVD's and external hard drives. In addition, the safe will protect documents, electronics, and other valuables. The 2096DF model is the largest of the three First Alert waterproof fire safes at 2.14 cubic feet making it a great safe for homes and business with a large storage need. The interior of the safe includes a hanging file rack for convenient organization of documents, 2 adjustable and removable shelves, key rack and small door pouch. The safe also includes an override key that will open the safe if the pass-code is forgotten or the batteries go dead. The 2096DF also includes a removable extendable handle with two wheels so that it can be easily moved. All First Alert fire safes are covered by a 5 year manufacturer's warranty and will be replaced free of charge if damaged in a fire."
