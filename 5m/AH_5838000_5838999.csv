Serial # BER24XXXX puts it at a year 2000 manufacture date. Gun is in excellent condition with a few very small, very light blemishes that I couldn't quite capture with my camera (I don't have a macro lens). One is next to the serial number on the frame, the second (barely visible) is on the slide near the muzzle, and the third is next to the right side of the slide catch. I am unsure of the round count, but judging by the overall condition of the gun, and especially the barrel, I would guess it's relatively low for being 16 years old. I comes with four factory mags, 1 US made 3 Italian, and the factory case. The mags are all in good working condition, but the US made one does have some surface rust spots.

Almost same dimensions as the Shield, but with a very nice textured grip. Three-dot sights, but front sight is large orange dot, very easy to pick up when firing. Weighs 3 ounces more than the Shield, making for softer recoil. Nice pistol, but I just don’t care for striker-fired triggers, so it’s available.

First is my Remington 700 chambered in 35 Whelen. Very nice rifle, clean and shoots great! Will be very picky about trading this gun. Next is a Remington model 8. Was firing fine until a friend of mine told me he could clean it and now it's jammed up and I can't figure out how to take it apart to get it firing again. So maybe if you're good with this rifle you can figure it out. Also have an old Remington model 6 that fires .32 short or long rifle. Pretty neat gun! And last I have some muzzleloader that I got from my dads basement and don't care about and doesn't look like its in very good shape so if you want it I'll just throw it in. I'm mostly looking for an M1 Garand or an M14. But also willing to consider other offers. Thank you!"
