This is a Colt AR15 HBAR ""Match Target"" model. It was only used for a brief period of time. It is nice clean condition, shiney bore, etc. It is a great rifle for a person looking for a relatively inexpensive Colt AR that has that ""old school"" look with the integrated carry handle/sighs and the original AR15 but stock. It is capable of great accuracy with the heavy barrel. Chambered for a 5.56 round, it will handle, of course .223 rounds.Match Target rifles have the accuracy and dependability needed to live up to the reputation of their predecessors as one of the greatest rifles of all time. Designed to meet defined government requirements, The Match Target family of rifles are excellent examples of the responsible role Colt plays in the future of firearms. They are easy to field strip, and feature comfortable accurate shooting. The Match Target are enhanced with heat dissipating ribbed handguard, cartridge case deflector and adjustable sights. Ideal for competition shooting, varmint hunting and general target shooting, the Colt Match Target is second to none."

Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. The Golden Boy rifle’s awesome 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, brass buttplate and gleaming Brasslite receiver will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America’s Old West, when Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original Henry lever action rifle. Small game hunters and plinkers will appreciate its substantial 6¾ pound heft. It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness lever-lovers long for. Get one in your hands and take aim. See what a natural pointer it really is. Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. The .22 LR version holds 16 rounds. The .22 Mag and .17HMR hold 12 rounds. Both will provide a whole lot of shooting pleasure before it’s time to reload their tubular magazines.  The Henry Golden Boy rifle is one beautiful classic that’s affordably priced so you hombres won’t have to rob a stagecoach to own one. All we ask is that you mosey on down to your local gun shop and ask to see the Henry Golden Boy. You’ll definitely agree it’s the rifle that brings out the West in you. The youth version of our award winning Golden Boy has a shorter barrel and length of pull, this compact version is ideal for most youngsters or for the gals who may find it easier to handle. Comes with a brass barrel band. Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL ruels and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this rifle online at www.copsgunshop.net."

The SA barrel dates to 4-55. The SA rifle serial number dates to 1955 as well. That, along with like condition and Patina, suggests the barrel is original to the gun. The serial number will be given upon phone conversation only. There are no visible import marks. The stainless gas seal is the only area exhibiting any significant wear. Rust is non-existent, nor are there any signs of major battle scars. Normal wear is minimal for the time frame. There is evidence of a faint ordnance cartouche stamp on the stock just below the left side of receiver.  The barrel is shiny and remains accurate. The rifle functions wonderfully and is accompanied by 5 en bloc clips.  The rifle wears an OD nylon sling, befitting of the time period in both use and appearance. The weapon has the normal matching of the major US manufacturers parts of that time:Receiver- SABarrel- SA 4-1955Trigger Group- International Harvester Op Rod- SA Bolt- Harrington and RichardsonSights (SA). The sights are in excellent mechanical condition and show minimal wear. They remain audible, tactile and precise on the firing line.This Garand is an excellent example of American Ingenuity. It retains the history of "" the greatest generation"", and will continue to be a legacy for generations to admire.*Numerous additional photos upon request.  Comes with hard case."

It was manufactured to take detachable AK-47 mags straight from the factory. No adapters no duckbills. These rifles were manufactured for the civilian market in the mid 90s to get around the import restrictions and the ""Assault Weapons Ban"". Comes with a good set of accessories including...-6 magazines(3 steel, 3 polymer)-clamp on bipod -Ak-74 style muzzle brake-Side folding stock(shown) and the wood stock(not shown)-3 Ak magazine clamps-front sight adjustment tool -72 rounds of mixed Tula/Monarch Fmj(not shown)-40 Rounds of Tula 154gr softpoint This rifle has an excellent chrome lined bore that is bright and shiny. No major pitting, no rust. The blued finish is quite worn as it was when I first purchased it years ago. It would make a good candidate for a cerakote job. Rifle functions flawlessly and shows great accuracy with even the cheap steel ammo. These rifles are getting harder to find at decent prices. Was asking $600, but $500 takes it all. MIGHT consider trades for other firearms(preferably lever action carbines, single action revolvers) depending on what you got, but I really would just prefer cash.

Model 138CABLUY(Imported by Chiappa for taylor's Co. manufactured by Armi Sport Italy)   Best known as a buffalo-hunting gun, the Sharps sporting rifle became known as the ""Old Reliable"" by those who hunted buffalo for their hides. Among those associated with the rifles were Billy Dixon, Buffalo Bill Cody, Bat Masterson and others who used the big single-shot to maximum effect on the seemingly endless herds of buffalo. Reproducing the Sharps at a reasonable price was a challenge for modern manufacturers because of its sliding breechblock and many angles and corners. It has been accomplished, however, and Taylor & Co. is proud to offer the colorful, high quality 1874 Sporting Rifle in a variety of barrel lengths and calibers for hunting and target shooting. 1874 Down Under Model Features case-hardened frame, patchbox, butt plate, and lever; blue barrel finish, hand-checkered stock and forend. Forend has a Hartford-style, pewter forend tip."

The Mk47 features all new mid-sized receivers based on our Mk3 platform carved from billet 7075-T6 aluminum. The Mk47 was designed to harness the power and reliability of the 7.62x39mm cartridge utilizing a robust bolt also based off our Mk3.

The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols."
