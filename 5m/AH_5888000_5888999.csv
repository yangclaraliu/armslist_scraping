The nicest example of the early “bright blade” Model 1905 bayonet having its original factory edge never ground down. It was made up to the start of WW1 when they began to darken the blades, and later most of the bright blade models were refinished, leaving the survivors scarce and desirable. This one was made at RIA armory in 1909. Walnut grip scales retain their rough turning texture and have only the GI oil finish. Hilt and crossguard retain about 90% of the original blued finish, Pommel and the top and bottom edges of the hilt retain most the their blue finish. The scabbard is a VG Model 1905 leather covered scabbard which originally had a Krag style swivel hook. These were converted after adoption of the M1910 belt system by removal of the swivel hook and addition of a leather collar with a M1910 hook. There are two types of conversion and this is the “type 3” discussed in Gary Cunningham’s “American Military Bayonets of the 20th Century” on pages 29-30. scabbard tip stitching has split very slightly at the end although it is somewhat scuffed.

This one was made at RIA armory in 1909. Walnut grip scales retain their rough turning texture and have only the GI oil finish. Hilt and crossguard retain about 90% of the original blued finish, Pommel and the top and bottom edges of the hilt retain most the their blue finish. The scabbard is a VG Model 1905 leather covered scabbard which originally had a Krag style swivel hook. These were converted after adoption of the M1910 belt system by removal of the swivel hook and addition of a leather collar with a M1910 hook. There are two types of conversion and this is the “type 3” discussed in Gary Cunningham’s “American Military Bayonets of the 20th Century” on pages 29-30.  Unlike most of the leather covered scabbard tip stitching has split and the leather pulled back, although it is somewhat scuffed. A far above average example of the early M1905 bayonet and the altered 1905/1910 scabbard. Very hard to find these any more with any condition at all.Reply by email call or text 7205175213"

Bought it for a deep concealment gun which it is excellent for but it just hasn't quite fully replaced my current EDC so I'll let it go for my asking price. Has factory Siglite tritium night sights. Wonderful shooter once you get used to the DOUBLE ACTION ONLY trigger. Extremely accurate and very soft shooting for a small gun. From 25 feet I can easily put a big hole in the bullseye after a few mags. Trigger feels about 8-9lbs but is very crisp. So far it has 400 flawless rounds through it (I guess that's a break in) Cleaned after every range trip. Frame has slight wear marks from the carrying in the kydex holster but nothing major, just polymer wear marks.

It is small enough to fit in a pocket, yet the thickness and large sights make it feel like handling a larger gun. This gun would be a great carry weapon for women too and people with medium to small hands as they can almost get a full pinky grip even with the 6 round mag. The tritium night sights and 8 round mags make it excellent for double duty as a house gun.

*Note* This gun is the latest model with restrike capability and was manufactured only back in April of 2016 (Date will be on the box)

Comes with:

ONE standard 6 round magazine

THREE extended 8 round mags

Kydex IWB holster, Leather holster, Pocket holster as well as factory Sig OWB paddle holster (not pictured)

Sig Piranha G10 grip plates.

Original box and whatever papers came with it.
NO AMMO INCLUDED
 

$320 cash only. No trades. Price is FIRM. Lowballers will be ignored as I am in no rush to sell this. First come first serve. Please communicate. I can meet Weekday evenings after 6:00pm around Saint Paul. On Weekends before noon or by appointment if available.

Also do not low ball me. None of these items are toys. They are designed for heavy duty real world use.  I no longer have use for these 2 items (and maybe a 3rd if you're interested as well).   FOR SALE  1. Insight Tech Gear M6 Tactical Illuminator Flashlight with Laser Halogen Bulb fits Picatinny or Glock-Style Rails (retails $260) - This is a Military/LEO grade light and I've only mounted it on a pistol once. 90+ peak lumens, 1-hour runtime, Weighs 3.7 oz, Runs on 2 lithium CR123A batteries (included), 4-position mode selector. Asking $150 OBO.   2. EOTech 4xMagnifier Flip Sight (retailed for $500 [EOTech discontinued this model]) - This sight is heavy duty, overbuilt, rectangular, aluminum housing designed for use with an EOTech holographic sight. I purchased this magnifier for use in Iraq on a deployment and it served me well there, hence the scuffed and beat up appearance. I just no longer have use for the added magnification. This sight flips to the right hand side, allowing quick target acquisition with the red dot sight if need be. Asking $250 OBO.  Maybe FOR SALE....  3. Surefire Millennium Universal Weaponlight (retailed for $500 [Surefire discontinued this model]) - Model M961XM07 with the standard m49 thumbscrew picatinny rail system. Takes 3 lithium batteries. This is a non-LED model halogen bulb with high lumen output. This light also shows use after a deployment, but it still functions well and is built for heavy duty use. Sorry it is missing the remote pressure switch. The extra cords on a weapon is a nuisance IMHO. More reluctant to sell...but I'd be willing to entertain acceptable offers."

The grip itself has been completely reworked by me, with a reduction and finger groove removal - and then stippled for a better purchase on the firearm. Also has a trigger guard undercut for knuckle relief. Pics attached are currently, but it will be getting a short touch up immediately before trade or sale. If you want the gun, and want some extra patterning or changes to the grip, I can take care of that beforehand without a problem. Comes with a few magazines, some 9mm FMJ, and a bunch of misc. parts/accessories (mostly small stuff) that I can add later or determine based on the trade. Call/text John at REDACTED"

I'm keeping the sights so none will be included. I don't know who did the frame work but it was well done.  Round count is very low as the barrel looks unfired. Please call or text if interested I don't email takes to long.  Gun is priced cheap so I'm pretty firm.  The only I would trade for would be a gen 3 19 or 17 and that's a maybe as I'm not much of a glock guy.

This is the non-thumb safety model. Very low round count (less than 50). Comes with both factory mags (flush 6 round, extended 7 round), factory box, fired casing (dated Oct 2015), lock, etc.This is a soft-shooting .40 - MUCH easier on the hands than a Glock 27. If you like the down range punch the 40 brings to the table (and easy to find ammo even in ""shortage"" times), this is a great carry choice. Includes 42 rounds of HST 180 grain JHP, 10 rounds of Hydra-Shok 135 grain JHP, and a full 50 round box of Perfecta 170 grain FMJ. I've just decided I want a smaller, more pocket friendly carry gun. Cash price with all above $380 OBO, or interested in trading for a Smith, steel Taurus, or Ruger snubnose. Pocket nines would be considered. A good .380 would even work - with extras or $$$ to help even up value. Trading ammo for ammo would be a plus. I need to stick close to home on this one. FTF only - no shipping. I'm from Argos - located in Marshall County along the US 31 corridor. I can drive as far south as Peru, east to Etna Green, west to Grovertown, north to US 6. I'll need to see the interested party's current, valid IN DL and LTCH unless you're known to me.

A true Long Tom has only the two words ""Long Tom"" stamped on the side and carries no other brand, make or model numbers.  They were made by the Crescent Tool Company (the same company responsible for the legendary ""Crescent Wrench,"") and were manufactured between 1908 and 1916 to be sold in hardware stores and the Sears and Roebuck catalog.  Some sources claim they were also manufactured under contract by other companies, such as Harrington and Richardson.  The extra-long barrel made squirrel and bird hunting possible out to 50 yards or more.  I've also shot slugs out of this gun and I'm sure it would make a viable deer gun.  This particular example was bought new by my grandfather from the Sears catalog and used mainly for squirrel hunting during most of the first half of the last century.  I still remember the taste of pan-fried squirrel taken with this shotgun, and this was the first gun I ever shot, the first gun I ever hunted with, the first gun I ever shot a squirrel with, and the first gun I ever owned.  I feel like I've gotten a lifetime's worth of use out of this gun, but now I live overseas every other two years and it doesn't fit in my gun safe and I don't get to hunt anymore and I'd rather see someone get some use and enjoyment out of it instead of just having it sit in storage for the next 15 years.  It's got quite the patina of surface rust, having never had any work done to it, and it sports some electrical tape wrapped around the wrist of the stock, probably covering a crack, along with a hand-whittled plastic butt pad that my grandfather added, I guess for a better length of pull.  However the bore is in remarkably good condition, with a surprisingly small amount of pitting, and it's still a fun gun to shoot, especially with the spring loaded ejector that shoots the empty shell out with zeal when the action is broken open.  It shoulders and points very comfortably despite the length, and it's actually in better condition than one I saw on gunbroker.  In a perfect world I'd take a few weeks to polish it up and reblue all the metal, sand and refinish the stock, and replace the plastic buttpad with a rubber one.  But I can't justify spending the time and money knowing that I won't get a chance to shoot it and won't even be able to hang it on my wall where I'll be living.  Let my loss be your gain; I can even throw in a box or two of shells.  Close up pics available upon request.CASH ONLY - NO TRADES"

Most people use a drill press with a cross vise to mill out the product, many folks have drill presses sitting in their garages, or can find someone who has one available to borrow. The frame accepts Glock17 9mm slides, as well as the Glock 40 caliber slide. The Smith and Wesson 40cal slide is also compatible with the Sig357 barrel configuration, which essentially gives you 3 different calibers to choose from.Unlike the Glock, this frame includes a uniquely extended beaver-tail, and most notably a super tactical 1911 pistol grip rather than the standard Glock styled pistol grip. Even better, this pistol grip includes a built in flared magwell for speed loading. This feature will surely be a favorite among competition shooters who require speed and accuracy.Finally, the areas that need to be milled out to complete this project include:The barrel bridgeThe top rails of the receiverThe slide guide railsOnce completed, you insert the custom locking block which comes with the kit, it provides additional metallic rails up front.Polymer80.com provides the support on this project, please do not contact LWD for support. They can be reached at Support@Polymer80.comFAQ:What generation Glock products is the frame compatible with? What are the rails made out of?This product is compatible with Gen3 3-pin components for Glock17, 22, 24, 31, 34 & 35. The system comes with a combination front rail and locking block made from steel. Are the rails polymer or metal? Front Rails are metal, rear rails will need to be milled from existing polymer. (Similar design to the 100% Ruger Pistols)?Is this product ATF approved? Yes, see the attached documentation (top left of page)What is the warranty on the PF940 80% Polymer Pistol Frame?Lifetime Warranty against any manufacturer's defect.How difficult will this product be to complete and do I need a drill press?The difficulty level is low to medium, it does require mechanical aptitude, a drill press and cross vice.Since the grip is angled like a 1911, is the pistol frame compatible with Glock mags?The magwell is engineered to accept Glock mags only. 1911 mags are not compatible.Where can I find completion parts for the pistol frame?We sell a complete kit depending on what caliber you are using. Click hereAre the pistol frames compatible with my Glock17 holster?The current Glock holsters are not compatible with our 80% Polymer Pistol Frame. There are a number of Kydex Shops that will be happy to design you a holster.?How many rounds can I expect to shoot with the 80% Polymer Pistol Frame?The life expectancy is the same as any comparable polymer frame and depends on how well you maintain the product, and how much you use it.

The metal has been refinished at some point in a flat black enamel. Stock doesn't look like it has been refinished, it has plenty of nicks and scratches but no cracks as far as I can tell. Serial Numbers do not match. The Columbian Crest is partly visible on top of the chamber, but it some of it was covered up when the gun was refinished. The rear receiver band is marked "".30"" for .30-06. Apparently the Columbians converted some of their rifles to .30-06 after getting a bunch of ammo from the US. Bore is dark, looks really dirty, but rifling seems ok. I have not fired this rifle myself, but it loads, chambers, extracts and ejects .30-06 rounds just fine. I realize this rifle is not in the best condition so I am happy to let anyone inspect the rifle before commiting to buy it, as long as I don't have to drive far. Prefer to meet at Cabelas in Columbus or somewhere near there."

This police package comes to us from an estate sale.
The revolver is a Smith & Wesson Model blued 10-5 that shows ""character"" and wears it with pride! This was the everyday carry weapon for this police officer until his retirement many years ago. Bore and cylinder are clean and everything feels tight. The rear sights and front ramp have white paint lightly dabbed on for the ""old school"" edition of fiber optic sights we have today.
The revolver has lots of holster wear and some light freckling in a few spots, but I think it is in better aesthetic condition than I would have expected from a career long everyday use and carry gun. The grips closely resemble custom-made dark walnut Bull's-eye target thumb rest grips. There is some wear in a couple of areas, primarily on the inside corners where they rubbed while in the holster.
My experience with Model 10-5 revolvers is that they are really fine shooters with nice triggers. I took this one out to the gun range tonight thinking I would shoot the handful of loose .38 caliber I had in a range bag just to make sure it fired okay. That was just a tease, as I ended up shooting that handful and a box of 50 Remington factory ammunition. It is a really good shooting gun with a nice trigger and the custom grips made for a really comfortable hold and lack of felt recoil.
The holster is a Jay-Pee Spring Lock Safety Swivel Holster that features a trigger guard click retention button to keep the pistol securely inside the holster until it can easily be removed with a push of the finger as you draw the pistol. It also has space on the belt to hold a dozen .38 Special bullets.
The belt is a Bianchi 42 with adjustable sizing and quick connection prongs.
This is a really cool police package that will easily take you back in time to when this officer carried his gun with this belt and holster.Contact me for additional pictures.
