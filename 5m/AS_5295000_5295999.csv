$500 firm without the CTC grips(I can put them on my 5"" model) or $680 with the laser grips, not interested in lower offers at this time.  Will straight trade the package for an XDM 5.25"" .45ACP Bi-tone with night sights or maybe the black model 5.25"" with night sights and you add some cash or ammo etc.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in Garland/Mesquite area or will ship for $40.  Shipping must be UPS Overnight to your FFL, will need a copy of FFL license before shipping.  Thanks for looking!"

$880 firm in cash.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.

I am mostly looking for a cash sale but will look at all trades as long as the value is there. I am in no hurry whatsoever to peddle this so lowballers will simply be ignored.Thank you for looking."

Other markings on the receiver, are: ""SKS 7.62 MADE IN CHINA"" and ""CJA SFLD.MI"". Numbers match on all numbered metal parts. There's no markings on the wood.This is not your run-of-the-mill, stamped, light-weight barrel-lugged Chinese version, like a Norinco, but an early heavy-duty Chinese example having a milled receiver and trigger frame, as well as the heavy screwed-in type barrel and Russian style blade bayonet. The wood furniture and all metal parts are in excellent condition and the barrel bore is bright and shiny. The gas tube and piston were found to be in excellent condition, not dirty or corroded. Looks as if it was never shot at all.I purchased the rifle over 3 years ago from the person that originally purchased it after importation in the 90's. He said he removed the cosmoline as best as he could, shot a few rounds through it, then kept it in his safe all these years until he sold it to me. I purchased it because of its condition and the fact that I hadn't seen such a nice early milled Chinese for sale in a long time. I've never shot it myself, but did disassemble and inspect thoroughly, then gave it a good wipe-down and oiling and put it in my safe. I had planned to hold on to this one but I need the space in my safe. The cleaning kit in the buttstock and sling are included.We can meet in the Winston-Salem, Greensboro, High Point area. Buyer must be a NC resident, have valid NC ID, and must be able to legally own a firearm in NC. I'd prefer to do a bill of sale, in duplicate, so each of us can keep a signed original. To satisfy myself that you (the buyer) likely meets the legal requirements to own a firearm, you're going to have to possess and bring with you a valid pistol purchase permit or concealed handgun permit for me to copy or photograph. That's if we do not do a transfer through an FFL. If you don't have either of these permits, we'll have to do the transfer through an FFL. You can choose which FFL as long as it's close. There's an FFL close to my location that does transfers for $20.00. I'll split the cost of the transfer. Please don't ask for me to circumvent the above permit or FFL transfer requirement, as I'm firm on this.Just add ammo and this is ready to shoot! $475.00 David.. Three3Six/8ThreeZero/ninetytwo38.

I used the lightweight design to build a tactical rifle that can be maneuvered and handled with ease. I've shot this rifle only for testing purposes and quality control and it has performed flawlessly at every corner. Along with all the attachments that I've added, I still of course have all of the orignal factory parts which were eventually replaced with ones that I felt were of an even more superior quality. Colt makes an amazing Bolt Carrier Group (BCG) but the Nickel Boron Supreme BCG is absolutely phenomenal. Nickel Boron is considered a self-lubricating metal, requires almost no oil, and can be run for much longer times and in harsher conditions. I did extensive research on the company and could not find another to match their standard. When fired, this rifle is of course, extremely loud, but outside of that it has the feel and response of a finely tailored machine. It's appearance is sleek and I could not be happier with how this system turned out. Along with the rifle and magazines I can also include the following at listed prices: -M193 5.56x45MM Bullets ($.40 ea.)-Various tools that you may want in order to make future adjustments or modifications to your rifle (Receiver Vise Blocks, Allen Wrenches, Oil, Cleaners, AR15 Master Tool, ect.)-Eberlestock Gunslinger II Pack [This is the backpack you see in behind the rifle and is by far my favorite way to carry a rifle. It has a scabbard that runs down the length of the bag and has a foldable capsule at the bottom to compensate rifles up to 60 inches long! It has a huge volume of space inside and is extremely sturdy. It's used by Marines, Airborne Troops, Spec Ops, and SEALS and is very durable. Feel free to watch reviews on YouTube if interested. ($300)]Thank you for taking the time to read all of the information I have listed. I felt it necessary to be as meticulous as possible in order to capture an accurate value for this rifle. Please feel free to send me an email, text, or call if you are interested or have any questions."

Height: 121 mm / 4.76 in. Thickness: 28 mm / 1.10 in. Weight (unloaded): 635 g / 22.42 oz. Sight Radius: 150 mm / 5.91 in. Barrel Length: 96 mm / 3.77 in. Trigger Pull: ~2.5 kg / ~5.5 lbs. Magazine Capacity: standard 6 rounds + 1 in barrelAction:  Striker Fire, Dual Action Only   Glock 36 | G36  The GLOCK 36 packs 6 rounds of .45 Caliber AUTO stopping power in a package that fits the hands of most any user. The G36 is easily concealed, and incorporates a single stack magazine. The G36 measures only 1.13 in. in width which makes controlling recoil very simple. The G36 is easy-to-use, hard to see, and tough to face.   Glock calls the model 36 a Slimline™ pistol because it uses a single stack magazine resulting in a thin and flat package. The big advantage is that you do not sacrifice stopping power for increased concealability.The grip is textured on all surfaces and has a concave channel near the top on the left side which allows you to rest your thumb. The grip is thin and fits most hands well.  The gun has no sharp edges or rough spots and carries very well. The muzzle end of the slide is tapered to aid in quick and sure one-hand re-holstering, which is an important skill to practice along with drawing and assuming a firm firing position.supplies with the G36.  Like all Glocks, the G36 is a striker-fired DAO utilizing the Glock “Safe Action” design. When the slide is cycled, the firing pin is set in a half-cocked “safe” position, and is activated only by the trigger safety release toggle, which disengages the firing pin safety allowing the gun to fire. The safety being built integral with the trigger is especially good if you are in a situation where you are on the move or engaging multiple targets. As soon as your finger is off the trigger the gun is in a safe condition and a third safety interlock prevents the gun from discharging if it is dropped. While some have criticized the Glock’s trigger safety, as opposed to a manually set safety, it is a very deliberate design. The gun only fires if the trigger is fired. No other operation is required to take it from a safe to fire mode. It is also immediately obvious if the gun is cocked. The trigger remains in the rearmost position when not cocked and moves forward when the slide is cycled. It is also easy to see and feel if a round is chambered because the extractor projects out slightly from the slide when a cartridge is loaded. This is an important visual check, as the gun could be cocked and a round not chambered. Summary:The Glock 36 offers a high-quality, accurate and reliable alternative to a full-size service pistol, expecially when carrying a .45 under light clothing. Concealability is excellent with almost no loss in performance.  The Glock 36 allows carrying that .45 in really hot weather in comfort."

Springfield Armory® engineered the original EMP® with an all-new patented short action. Seventeen re-designed parts later, the EMP® came out a smaller, more comfortable, and more concealable package optimized for the smaller 9MM and .40SW calibers. Among the community of those who know, it has earned a reputation as one of the most shootable compact pistols ever. The all-new 4″ Lightweight Champion™ offers a longer four-inch barrel that presents increased sight radius and more practical accuracy. Let’s not forget the extra velocity the longer barrel adds to any given cartridge. Better yet, the EMP® 4″ offers an extra half inch of height, providing plenty of room for a strong and positive grip. The EMP® 4″ is loaded with extras like a fiber optic front sight and two-dot, low-profile combat rear sight for effortless target acquisition. Ambidextrous safety levers, a match-grade barrel, and Posi-Lock™ grip texture to the front strap add extra high value benefits for the serious shooter. Not only is the new EMP® 4″ a controllable gun, it packs ten rounds (in 9mm) plus one more in the chamber. That’s in a slender single stack pistol, not a thicker double stack design. In fact, the new EMP® 4″ offers the same reduced grip circumference that made the original so successful. Looks aren’t everything, but the Cocobolo wood grips and two-tone forged stainless steel slide and black anodized aluminum (9MM) or Carbon Steel Black Armory Kote™ (.40SW) frame make the EMP® a looker sure to turn heads at the range. But you know it’s what’s under the covers that counts. While the EMP® 4″ might be the perfect carry gun, it’s new size makes it ideal for home defense, concealed carry or a little fun at the range."

This rifle is .5 MOA if you can shoot well. I have held that group out to 1500 yards. I wanted it as a hunting rifle, but it weighs roughly 20 lbs, and therefore hunting back country elk is not conducive. It did take two elk this year. One at 650, and one at 887. I have subsequent videos and picture I can send. I had to choose a manuefacturer, but it is not who made the rifle. CheyTac USA made the rifle."

$440 firm in cash or a little better in trade.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Garland/Mesquite area or will ship for $40 more in TX.  Since this is classified as a pistol it has to go UPS Overnight, I will require payment up front, of course and copy of your FFL's license before shipping.  Thanks for looking!"

The 870 Express® is a rugged, value-priced workhorse, making it one of the most useful tools that an outdoorsman can own. The Super Mag has a 3-1/2"" chamber to handle heavy turkey and waterfowl loads that reach out to knock birds down at maximum shotgun range; it also functions with 2-3/4"" and 3"" shotgun shells, making it an extremely versatile firearm. At the heart of the ultra reliable 870 Remington is a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength, and twin action bars that prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action. 870 pump shotguns have great pointing characteristics. They come to the shooter's shoulder and acquire targets instinctively, and swing fluidly on fast flying birds. The Remington Model 870 Express Pump-Action Shotgun - Synthetic comes with virtually indestructible black synthetic stock and fore-end that are impervious to water, and a matte blue/black, bead-blasted finish on the receiver and barrel. The barrel has a vent rib and a bead sight, and uses standard Rem™ Choke screw-in choke tubes (comes with 1 modified tube). A premium vented recoil pad dampens recoil and helps shooter to stay on target for faster follow up shots. A myriad of aftermarket Remington 870 accessories enables owners to customize the 870 Express for specific purposes. * Twin action bars prevent binding and twisting* Barrel has a vent rib and a bead sight* Uses standard Rem Choke screw-in choke tubes (comes with 1 modified tube)* Premium vented recoil pad dampens recoil$300"
