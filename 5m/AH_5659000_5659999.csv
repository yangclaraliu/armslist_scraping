Introducing the P320, a pistol that defies comparison with revolutionary features that stand alone. A smooth, consistent trigger pull. Safe, tool-free disassembly. A proper fit for any hand size—no backstrap required. Consider the mold broken.  Innovative To Its Core.  This is a gun. A gun that could only come from SIG. The P320 elevates the standard for a striker-fired pistol with an exceptional trigger and a design as dependable as it is one-of-a-kind.  Serialized, Stainless Steel Frame: The P320 slide rides on all-metal rails in a solid stainless steel frame for greater stability. The serialized unit lets you change everything from size to caliber to grip at will.   Exceptional Trigger: A smooth, crisp trigger pull and short tactile reset deliver heightened accuracy.   Safety Without Compromise.  Safety isn't negotiable. The P320 maximizes peace of mind with a robust safety system. Never again will you need to pull the trigger to disassemble your pistol. And, while available as an option, you won't need a tabbed trigger safety for your gun to be drop safe.  Striker Safety: Prevents the striker from releasing unless the trigger is pulled. 3-Point Takedown Safety System:   Must remove magazine. Must lock slide to rear. Rotate takedown lever for disassembly without tools or trigger manipulation.   Disconnect Safety: Prevents the pistol from firing out of battery.   The Most Adaptable Pistol Ever.  No two hands—or scenarios—are quite the same. The P320 can be customized to meet the exact needs of the user. No backstraps required, no excuses accepted.  Convertible Calibers: Convert to 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W or .45ACP (coming soon). Multiple Pistol Sizes: Slide assemblies and grip modules are available in full-size, compact and subcompact (coming soon). Integrated M1913 Accessory Rail: True Mil-std. 1913 rail ensures stability and peak performance with lights, lasers and other accessories. Interchangeable Grip Modules: Small, medium or large modules provide optimal grip circumference and access to controls for any hand size.

The new Walther SOFTCOIL gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. How Walther SOFTCOIL Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have The CCP’s SOFTCOIL gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.

The inside has 2 lights.  The trailer has very little use and it has new tires and 2 spare tires as well.  It is aluminum and light and I have hauled over 10k in it with no problem. I thing the axles are 6k rated.  The trailer pulls very nice at all speeds and you do not need a sway bar hitch.  I used it for atv's it held 3 large and1 small and will hold snowmobiles or anything you want. I have even hauled a car in it. I have even camped in it.  I no longer have a use for it and it will make a very nice trailer for someone. I will consider trades for a popup camper a large or couple of atv's or possibly a boat or other outdoor guy items High end."

 Selling my Remington 700 .243 built by Predator Custom Shop. I had this rifle built in 2008. I am the original owner of the action and the rest of the gun. I have the paperwork from Predator and most of the paperwork for the action.   It was originally laid into an Accuracy International AICS stock, but I switched it out early this year into a MagPul Hunter 700 with the bottom metal. Comes with three 5 round magazines from MagPul. Color is green. I scuffed the bottom forearm up so that I could apply the black grippy stuff you see.  The barrel is from a company that used to make the barrels for AI called Cooper Percision. They were based in Oak Ridge, TN. I bought this barrel before they went out of business. It is a very tight 1:6.5 twist. Must use 100 gr or heavier bullets with it.  This is a pre Xmark action/trigger. I have it set for right at 3.5 lbs and no creep at all.   The rifle is a 1000 yard gun all day. I used to shoot the grand at the Oak Ridge Sportsman's Assn. with it and it was minute of angle with my hand loads. Speaking of which, it will come with about 300 rounds of my special loads which were seated to the lands and grooves. They will not fit in the mags due to very long over all length. They are 115 gr DTACS and use IMR powder, but I don't remember which.  It comes with a Bushnell Elite 3200 fixed 10x scope with mil-dots. I have owned Leopold, Schmidt & Bender, and Zeiss scopes and this scope will hang all day with those. It is hands down the best value in a scope you can find. The turrets are easy to see and adjust and the mil-dots are very crisp. It sits on a pair of Burris Extreme XTR rings and a Seekins Precision Base. Both lens are free of scratches and are not fogged.
The rifle has been painted with Krylon OD Green. No shine to it.
When we meet, I will explain a little more about myself and this rifle build. I was explicitly trained to use a rifle very similar to this while in the Marines and have more than enough proof for it. This gun was built like this for a reason. Why am I getting rid of it? Things change and I find myself venturing into different hobbies. That's why.
Terms of sale: Must be a lawful citizen of the US. You will show me ID. You must be at least 18. Must pay cash. Must sign a bill of sale. I don't want your DL number. Just a signature is fine.

Civil unrest can cause a flash point where the only line between armed chaos and the average citizen is Law Enforcement. When this happens, the individuals called upon need weapons that are reliable and effective. That's exactly what we had in mind when we introduced the GRP. The GRP comes ready for duty, and built to stand up to rigorous use that is required to keep professionals proficient in their skills. Tough micarta Gator Grips are standard, as well as a lanyard loop integrated into the mainspring housing. The forged slide stop axle is cut flush with the frame, and the frame is chamfered around it for easy removal. The Global Response Pistol is a fighting gun, plain and simple, and is ready for duty wherever it is called upon to perform. If you are looking for a home defense weapon that meets these requirements, then the GRP is the ultimate solution.

This is serious fire power. From the factory: The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or Credit Card. Please add 3% for credit card fees. We charge $30.00 to ship this firearm UPS to the lower 48. Shipping charges are extra to Alaska or Hawaii."

Born of necessity, raised in the Army's Marksmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available. The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible. This, along with being salt bath nitride finished, equates to unprecedented accuracy and durability. The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM. The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated. The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation. The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0™ quad rail for allowing your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor. The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements. We equipped it with the Geissele SSA® 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target.
