Now we have decided to make it even better. We have dramatically enhanced the engraving with ornamental scroll and gold game scenes while not changing the price. It weighs an astounding six pounds in twelve gauge and barely over five pounds in 20, 28, and .410 gauges. Every detail is carefully considered to reduce weight and maintain balance. The frame and fore-end iron are machined from a solid forging of the best aircraft grade aluminum alloy. Durability is insured through the use of hardened steel at all high-wear points. To make the gun as light as possible and maintain perfect balance, we hollow the stock and craft the fore-end hardware from the same alloy as the receiver. If you hunt demanding terrain or just appreciate a light, responsive bird gun, the Magnus Light is the shotgun of choice.Every Caesar Guerini field gun comes with a velvet lined lockable hard case and five precision patterned flush chokes (CYL, IC, M, IM, F). A plastic choke case is also included.CONDITION: New In Box Unfired.SPECIFICS: Barrel blued 28"", action silver scrolled with inlaid gold pheasants on left, humming birds on right and rose on bottom.  Increadible balanced O/U.

    I'm Looking to buy a good Savage Model 99C for a custom project gun for a new wildcat cartridge i developed. for those unfamiliar with the different models of the savage 99. im looking for the ""C"" model, which is the model with the detachable box magazine as seen in the attached photo. As this will be used for a custom gun that will be hevily modified. the condition im looking for can vary greatly, i would prefer a gun in good working order but as long as there is no significant damage to the main components fantastic. damaged stock/forend? no problem. A few missing parts. no worries. i can replace them. trashed finish? even better considering ill have to strip the finish anyways prior to case hardening.
My budget is fair and flaxable. 
Thank you kindly for your time. i look forward to hearing from y'all soon."
