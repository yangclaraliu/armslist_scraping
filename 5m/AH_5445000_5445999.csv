(As opposed to some of the guns coming in recently with a CENTURY INTERNATIONAL billboard on the side).Included are the factory log books and original cleaning rod, cleaning kit in the buttstock, magazine pouch, sling and oil can.  This is in the same condition it rode across the boat, other than the maybe 100 rounds I have shot through it and a good cosmoline removal.Also included is a lot of ammunition as I am getting out of the 7.62x39 game for a while.Roughly (erring conservatively, there is more included than inventoried but I am tossing it all in)200 rounds of FMJBT Golden Tiger (best steel case 7.62x39 out there) in boxes170 rounds of FMJBT Golden Tiger on Circle 31 stripper clips240 rounds of Brown Bear JSPAll in a 30 cal ammo can (except what wouldn't fit).So at least 600 rounds of top shelf 7.62x39 and stripper clips are included. I will not sell the gun without the ammunition; I will no longer have a gun to shoot it out of. However I will sell the ammunition seperately if someone wants it first; $150.Compare my price with the stack of ammunition to the TWO Yugo 59s on Gunbroker right now: $900 and $600.Not interested in trades unless it is a Ruger Precision Rifle in 6.5 Creedmoor as this is what I am selling the SKS to fund (I would include cash toward the RPR obviously). Glad to provide more pictures as requested; I know they are kind of crummy my phone camera sucks."

The reason is that it was designed--and has kept evolving--to be and remain the most accurate, durable and reliable semiauto handgun on the market. Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies. Superior Reliability The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period.      Match-Grade Accuracy out of the Box Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of  match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class. Packed with Useful Tactical Features This pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its Bruniton finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning. These and countless other useful features make the 92FS the choice of military and police professionals all over the world, as well as individuals wanting the absolute best for sport or self-protection."

Today's Model 70 has the addition of the M.O.A.™ Trigger System, improved fit and finish and enhanced accuracy to go along with its classic Pre-’64 controlled round feeding. It is all there: Three-Position Safety and solid, sure handling. The M.O.A. Trigger helps the model 70 deliver the extreme accuracy benchmark 1"" group at 100 yards. It’s what you deserve. With the Triple Zero Advantage.The Model 70’s new M.O.A. Trigger System is the most precise three-lever trigger system in the world. Operating on a simple pivoting lever principle, the trigger mechanism has been completely redesigned to exhibit zero take up, zero creep and zero overtravel. The pull weight ranges from 3 to 5 pounds and is factory-set at 3 3/4 pounds. Because of the enhanced ergonomics, wide smooth triggerpiece and 2:1 mechanical advantage created by the unique design geometry, it actually feels like half that weight."

775,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5445775,"For Sale:  Tactical Thermal Imaging FLIR SHIELD Tent, Survival Shelter, Blanket Poucho MULTICAM Tarp","Goodyear buckeye, Phoenix, Arizona",$ 175,"Listed On: Monday, May 30, 2016",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Designed to reduce, confuse, and eliminate your thermal heat signature.
This is a quality handcrafted piece of gear made here in AZ. This tarp is known as a thermal shield or thermal block shaped into an 'Alpha Tent'. The primary purpose is to hide your heat signature from thermal imaging (FLIR). This is achieved by constructing the two inner layers from Heatsheets LDPE-4 reflective space blankets, made by SOL. These 'space' or 'survival' blankets are not your standard cheap mylar ones, but are much more durable and quiet. You must maintain an air gap between your skin and the material otherwise eventually you will heat up the fabric from direct touch. The two outside layers are made from waterproof 70d ripstop nylon in multicam (top) and coyote brown (bottom). The alpha tents shape is low profile and easy to conceal. Tarp weighs only 1lb.13.9oz!
This tent was designed with maximum adjustability in mind. In each corner there are 2 webbing pockets that the tent poles can be inserted into to adjust height, or for a quicker adjustment, there is shock cord running through the ends that can be cinched up to adjust the height and ventilation. As seen in the picture you can cinch up one side for observation and as a shooting/observation position if needed. There is a Velcro strap inside that secures and centers the tent poles. Mil-spec nylon webbing and thread is used and attachments are all box stitched.
The 18in tent poles are top of the line made by Easton and crafted out of lightweight aluminum which are scratch-resistant with a hard-anodized surface (12.7oz for all poles!). Standard sized shock cord is used inside the poles. Poles can be easily cut shorter if desired. Easton poles are used extensively on Everest expeditions and for USMC combat shelters.
The tent can be used as a stand alone tarp strung up with paracord/stakes in countless ways but is designed to be used with the poles as an alpha tent. Eight webbing loops are provided and one on top for many options to secure the tarp. Can be used as a survival blanket, ground tarp, makeshift litter, poncho, emergency shelter, or upside down gear raft. Look up alpha tent and thermal shield for more details on the concepts. Works against handheld, drone, or aircraft mounted thermal imaging. Add foliage/brush/ghillie on top for greater shape concealment. Can be deployed in under 90 seconds.
Tarp is appx 5ft x 8ft. Two available, more may be made in May. I live in Buckeye, come to west valley to meet.

Very nice specimens and would be great for the CZ collector or average enthusiast alike.Both have been well cared for and just given a thorough cleaning.The 52 runs FLAWESSLY (despite the talk of the 9mm 52 being unreliable) and is incredibly accurate. Have video clips if interested in seeing it in action.

In the box and unfired. If you have weak wrists and find it difficult to actuate the slide on most pistols, the CCP may be for you. Extremely easy to rack the slide on this one.Bought for the wife but I can't seem to get her to transition away from all steel pistols. Here is some info copied from Walther's website:The all new CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an ideal combination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability to conceal comfortably. The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.How Walther SOFTCOIL™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-HaveThe CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.CCP FEATURESLOW PROFILE THREE DOT POLYMER SIGHTSAdjustable rear sight, 3 front sight heights for easy target acquisition.MIL-STD-1913 PICATINNY ACCESSORY MOUNTING RAILFor lights, lasers, or other tactical devices.EASY COCKING SLIDEAvailable in black with Cerakote™ coating or silver stainless.LIGHT WEIGHT TRIGGER FOR GREATER ACCURACYSmooth, light 25 N (5.5 lbs) trigger pull for all shots, short 7 mm (0.27"") trigger travel.AMBIDEXTROUS MAGAZINE RELEASE BUTTONConveniently positioned for thumb operation.

Basically brand new Arsenal Sam7sf AK 7.62x39 rifle. I bought this thing just a few months ago, and have only put exactly 360 rounds (non corrosive) through it. Sights aren't canted at all, everything is mint. There is one small scratch on the receiver where the safety lever slides against it but that is how the rifle is built. I'm also throwing in 13 total AK magazines, all of which function perfectly. 7 are combloc steel surplus mags, in great shape and I have cleaned them. The one in the rifle is the Bulgarian made Circle 10 waffle mag. Perfect condition. The other 5 are the American made US Palm AK30 mags the work great, I just had to sand down a hump on the back of the magazine in order for them to fit into the receiver of this rifle. Also included with this bundle is the AKFST tool used to adjust your ak front sight. I also mounted the krebs custom peep sight to this ak which I loved but I will include the stock rear sight leaf as well. I will also list the rifles specs below: SAM7SF model 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 24x1.5mm muzzle right hand threads, muzzle brake, bayonet and accessory lugs, right-side folding tubular buttstock, black polymer pistol grip and handguards, stainless steel heat shield, ambidextrous safety lever, scope rail, sectional cleaning rod, and sling. Overall its its a great rifle that's basically brand new.
