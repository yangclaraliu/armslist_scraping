I bought this for 620$ a few months ago and when i got it, the front sight post was broken, and i noticed a scratch on the inside of the barrel when i got it home (the rifle was brand new when i bought it so i didn't bother checking it in the store). When i got it to the range, i was having to use a rod to push out a stuck casing every 2 or 3 shots.  I put a new front sight post on it, and have polished the chamber so that it can now get through a magazine without issue most of the time. 


The rifle is a blackheart international underfolder ak47 built on a Hungarian parts kit. Both the receiver and the barrel are made by blackheart international, an American company.

Aside from the scratch in the barrel, it has no other issues as of now, and would be good if you are just looking for a cheap ak. I'm selling it to get something a bit better in quality.

Picture is not of the actual rifle itself, but is exactly what it looks like.

Designed by Emerson and USA-built by Kershaw, this handsome auto takes Emerson’s tactical looks to the next level of refinement. The Launch 5's CPM154 powdered metallurgy blade steel offers more uniform distribution of carbides—so it takes and holds an excellent edge. It also provides good corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and toughness. The blade is stonewashed for good looks and to hide use-scratches. To lighten the Launch 5's weight, the handles and integrated backspacer are made of durable anodized aluminum. A machined texture on the handles provides a secure grip. The Launch 5 opens with a push button, recessed so that it is level with the flat of the handle. This is a safety feature and makes it harder for the knives to accidentally deploy. Left-handers can use their index finger instead of their thumb to press the blade-release/lock button. A reversible pocketclip is included and a lanyard tie-off is built into the butt end of the knife.Location: Valley CenterPrice:$112.95 plus tax"

Extractor includes crane o-ring. The requirements for assembly of our Bolt Carrier Groups are much higher than most. Before assembling the gas key to the carrier, permatex NO.3D aviation is applied to form-a-gasket around the gas hole (per MIL-SPEC). Then Grade-8 hardware is used to attach the gas key, followed by properly staking per spec. When installing the extractor to the bolt, a crane-o-ring is inserted with the spring to insure proper ejection. Then high temperature grease is applied to the gas rings before inserting the bolt into the carrier, which allows for much smoother operation.

Extractor insert installed. Proudly made in the USA!! EXO Technology creates a competitive advantage for all kinds of components, because treated parts run dramatically longer and more accurately with less maintenance. Further, EXO greatly enhances heat dissipation, so treated products run far cooler than non-treated parts.The EXO process is permanent, lasting for the entire lifespan of treated parts. A patented, nodular nickel-boron (NiB) surface treatment, EXO nucleates on the surface atoms of metals, becoming part of the metal rather than merely applied to the outside. In addition, the treated surface becomes harder than the substrate itself, eliminating the cost, weight and degradation problems of conventional hardened metals.EXO Technology is featured in firearms, weapons and support systems used by the U.S. military and law enforcement and security agencies. EXO Technology is appropriate for virtually any application where reduced friction, extended service life, enhanced performance and lower maintenance are desirable.Check out this product on my website! http://www.battlecreekarmory.com/product-p/asbcg556exo.htm"

We fired two boxes of the ammo and I kept a third unfired just in case. We had a blast with it, but after considering some financial situations and the time I actually spend at the range I figured I'd sell it to see if anyone is interested. At the moment PS90s are very hard to get a hold of, and gun stores in town do not carry stock of them, so you'll have to wait on whatever wait time is there. One place, which is a very popular gun store in town, told me the wait time to get mine would be 3 months.I have all the original packaging, it comes with 3 magazines, 2 hold 50 rounds and the other magazine holds 30 rounds (the 30 round magazine comes stock). I cleaned it after I fired it on July 4th, so everything is in pristine condition and fully functional. It also comes with the manual, and the lock and key. Pretty much what you see in the picture is what you get, I'm not sure the laws regarding ammo so I will 'state' that I have no intention to sell the ammo that I have."

The resultant new pistol is a revolutionary platform for Ruger, one that utilizes the combination of a recoil-reducing barrel cam (which is designed to better spread recoil energy over time) with a low mass slide, low center of gravity and a low bore axis to provide an unparalleled shooting experience.   CALIBER: 9mm CAPACITY: 17+1 FRAME: One-Piece, High-Performance Glass-Filled Nylon GRIP: Ergonomic Wrap-Around Grip Module GRIP MODULES: Small, Medium, Large SIGHTS: Novak® LoMount Carry 3-Dot BARREL: Stainless Steel BARREL LENGTH: 4.2"" OVERALL LENGTH: 7.5"" HEIGHT: 5.6"" WIDTH: 1.4"" WEIGHT 30 oz.

I am a Glock guy, and bought this gun mainly out of curiosity. It is a fantastic handgun and I am a little hesitant to sell it. But, I got something else tickling my fancy, and I decided to sell this out of the safe. As I said, I bought it NEW in May, and have put about 200-300 rounds of 115 gr FMJ brass casing Remingtons through it. Never once had an issue. I also picked up 2 extra Sig mags at a gun show a few months back. So you will be getting a heck of a deal. If you buy this from a shop, you are going to be paying well north of $1000 after MSRP, Taxes, and back ground plus the xtra mags. Price is $900. I am not interested in trades. Terms of sale: Must be a lawful citizen of the US. You will show me ID. You must be at least 21. Must pay cash. Must sign a bill of sale. I don't want your DL number. Just a signature is fine. We will meet in Powell at the big Ingles on Emory road just off I-75 during daylight hours. If I get the feeling you are being shady, we will not do the deal."

While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. The PMAG 10 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower for reliable feeding, and an easy to disassemble flared floorplate to aid extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.
