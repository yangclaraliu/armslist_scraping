This positive, cross-bolt safety is conveniently located near the trigger for fast operation, even while wearing gloves. A recoil pad on the wood and synthetic stock models permit greater control by eliminating slippage while firing.

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.    Manufacturer: IWI US, Inc Manufacturer Part #: XFD16 Model: X95 Model: Tavor Action: Semi-automatic Type: Bullpup Caliber: 556NATO Caliber: 223 Rem Barrel Length: 16.5"" Finish/Color: Flat Dark Earth Grips/Stock: Bullpup Accessories: 1 Mag Capacity: 30Rd Sights: Adjustable Sights"

I like this gun, I originally bought it because I thought my CZ would be too heavy to carry, but I actually don't mind it so I don't feel too bad about selling it. I've put around 800-1000 rounds through this beast and it hasn't given me any problems at all. There are a few cosmetic blemishes, but nothing very major or noticeable, the worst being a small scratch near the safety that was there when I bought the gun (it was a display model). If you aren't sure what these are, they're aluminum framed compact CZ 75 clones, and these are actually pretty well regarded by a lot of CZ fans. They're manufactures in Turkey by Canik, a NATO approved arms manufacturer (pretty big deal BTW) imported by Tristar. It sports a chrome lined barrel for enhanced durability and longer service life. That's not something you usually see in guns this price range, you really just have to fire it to believe how nice these are for the money (good bang for the buck lol). I'll also throw in 200 rounds of CCI Blazer Brass 115 gr rounds. Thanks for looking, if you have any questions don't hesitate!"

I want to say a there is more JHP than FMJ but I didnt keep track because like I mentioned my plan was to have it destroyed. A ton of the JHP is premium self defence brand. There is some 22lr and 22wmr I didnt bother to include in the 1,200 ball park but is roughly 300+ on top so figure about 1,500+ total. Also just tossed in about 35 45colt JHP, couple 7.62x39 and abouf 20 7.62x54 to the mix. Total is still far under the legal limit.

It features a proprietary rimfire bolt assembly, true 22 LR chamber and correct 1 in 16"" rifling twist, all of which ensure an accurate, reliable upper that is perfect for inexpensive practice, small game hunting, or introducing young or new shooters to the AR-15 platform. For useful, realistic sub-caliber training purposes, this upper offers the familiar operating controls and handling characteristics of a full power AR-15, but without the associated high priced ammunition.   The Forged 7075-T6 A3 Upper comes equipped with a Flat-Top Picatinny Rail for mounting optics, 16.5"" Chrome Moly Bull Barrel, 9"" XG-Pro KeyMod Free Float Aluminum Handguard, functional ejection port door and charging handle. One 25-Round Black Dog Magazine is also included.

The XD(M) has everything you want and need in a pistol—superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M) 3.8"" Full Size mates a 3.8"" barrel with a full-sized frame. This means you'll get the handling and capacity you'd expect from a standard sized pistol, but with a shorter top end for easier carry. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision.

Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there. The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it. The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.BUYER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING WITH ALL LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS BEFORE PURCHASING FIREARM.

Its been on a few hunts throiughout the time I have owned it. I am more of a duck hunter/angler so I am thinning out my collection of center fire rifles. This is a great set up and is a proven hunter. I have only taken it out in the field about 4 times since I have owned it. Pristine contition (like new) with very minimal round count. Less than 50 rounds through it. Comes set up and ready to hunt! Has a beefy Vortex scope bought new from Cabelas. (I think they are) Warne rings from Cabelas. A great folding bipod. The rifle itself is loaded with features like a muzzle-brake, fluted barrel, detachable box magazine, beaufitul Walnut stock, and more. The rifle comes zeroed (you may have to re-zero it, its been a while and I dont remember the last ammo I was using) and includes a few rounds of Barnes Vortx. Its an all in one bargain thats ready to hunt. Let me know, I can meet you at any FFL in or near the Santa Cruz County. Price is firm but im open to hearing offers. I can take more pictures too.Thanks"
