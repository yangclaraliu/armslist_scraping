Every feature of the RM380 has been fine-tuned to deliver unfailing function with unrivaled accuracy and control in the most extreme conditions on earth - the fight of your life. It's simply the most complete fusion of confidence and concealment to ever hit the Every Day Carry category.Serious Mettle.Crafted with a steel slide and aluminum frame, the RM380 delivers a rare breed of durability in the micro-pistol class. Its all-metal construction makes it inherently easier to control under stress.Tested and Proven.In an research and development process measured in hundreds of thousands of rounds, every facet of this handgun has been optimized to function smoothly and reliably in a wide range of conditions - from extreme cold to blistering heat, dirty or clean, whenever and wherever you need it most.Well Rounded.In conjunction with its extremely compact profile, the RM380 has been rounded and smoothed in all key areas to improve concealment, minimize print and enable a quick, clean draw. From inside your waistband or from your pocket, it's a smooth operator.Smooth, Light and Crisp.Compare its trigger to others in its class, and you'll instantly be impressed. It promotes both safety and improved accuracy with smooth, extended travel, a lighter pull weight and a crisp, consistent break.Full Control.To make pointing and shooting the RM380 as intuitive as possible, we started at the grip. The angle of its grip naturally places the barrel in close alignment with your hand so precision shot placement is second nature. The dimensions of the grip also give it the sure handling of a larger-framed pistol.Instant Accuracy Upgrade.Because the RM380 features the longest barrel in its class, it has a built-in advantage in shot-to-shot precision. This also helps achieve higher velocities, which translates to more effective bullet expansion and stopping power.Key Features  Rugged Fixed Sights for a no snag draw Positive cocking serrations Fully Functional Slide Stop Locks open after last round Aluminum Frame for enhanced durability and product life Long, Smooth, Light Double Action Only Trigger for safety and shootability Magazine Release ambidextrous and low profile Undercut Trigger Guard allows for higher hand hold Replaceable Grip Panels for comfort and style upgrades  Specifications:  Model: RM380 Manufacturer Number: 96454 Caliber: .380 Auto Magazine Capacity: 6+1 Rounds Barrel Length: 2.9"" Overall Width: .94"" Overall Length: 5.27"" Overall Height: 3.86"" Trigger Pull: 8.9 lbs Finish: Satin Black Oxide Slide: Stainless Steel Average Weight Empty: 12.2 oz"

Includes firearm, 2 - 10rd magazines, and original case. Used exclusively as a home protection firearm, so it didn't (thankfully) see any action in its intended use. Only a few hundred rounds through it at the range. Very clean, and night sights are still very bright (Trijicon have 12.5 year half life, see their web site). This gun is small for a .45, yet still very easy to shoot regardless of ammo and is very accurate. As a side note - the G30 will also accept the larger-capacity, double-stack G21 mags too, but these will stick out the bottom.  Cash, P2P/P2C, valid MN ID, and bill of sale required.

Starting with a titanium tube, front cap and rear plate that keep the overall system weight to a minimum without sacrificing anything in the way of strength.  The tube is designed around a 1.24"" diameter to give you a better sight picture while retaining the benifits of a cylidrical silencer.  Baffles are stainless steel and heat treated to provide maximum durability.  The patented “pig-nose” design is unique twist to the equation.  The architecture of the baffle is designed to precisely direct the gasses of a 9mm cartridge.  From our testing, the “superior sound attenuation” is a fact rather than an unsupported claim.  Additionally, the spacers (or shields) built into each baffle act as a barrier to keep carbon build-up from making its way between baffle and outer tube.  This means that after a light day on the range or a heavy week-long course, the system will still be easily disassembled.  Lastly, indexing notches and numbers engraved on each baffle make assembly a cinch. To top everything off, a Cerakote finish (available in Black, Dark Earth and Grey) to protect your investment and match the color of your rig(s).  The Ryder 9Ti ships with a black nylon pouch, assembly/disassembly tool and – as always – the SureFire No-Hassle Guarantee.

Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories."

Browning's most lasting innovations - the Model 1911 and the 380 ACP cartridge - into a modern, lightweight pistol. Unlike most of the modern ""pocket pistols"" that chamber the snappy 380 ACP cartridge, the 1911-380 is slightly larger to better manage recoil for improved control that makes follow-up shots faster and more accurate. The longer barrel increases bullet velocity for more downrange punch and improved acccuracy. The grip is compact, yet is long and wide enough to allow the shooting hand full purchase for added shooting comfort.   Specifications:  Item Number: 051901492 UPC Number: REDACTED02 Caliber: .380 Auto Barrel Length: 4.25"" Overall Length: 7.50"" Weight: 18 oz Magazine Capacity: 8 Sight Radius: 5.375"" Barrel Finish: Matte Receiver Finish: Matte Front Sight: Combat White Dot Rear Sight: Combat White Dot Barrel Material: Steel Checkering: Molded Receiver Material: Black Composite Trigger Finish: Matte Black Trigger Guard: Matte Black Magazine Type: Single Stack Trigger Material: Alloy Trigger Guard Material: Composite Case: ABS MSRP: $829.99"

The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1″ overall length and an 18.5″ cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3″ shells each, for a total capacity of 6 6 1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4″ shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil."

First and last one they got in this batch and they were told over a month before they get more. This is the all new M&P shied 45 by Smith & Wesson, that was revealed at the NRA show recently. I purchased it with the intent to make it my new CCW, but when I shot today, I just shoot my current CCW too well to consider switching. I fired exactly 12 flawless rounds through this gun and cleaned and libricated her when I was done. 100% like new, zero defects or issues all original paper work and box included along with both flush and extended magazines. I paid $479 plus tax. This is not a straw purchase, my intent was to keep. First $500 cash takes it, please note this is not profit, this is purchase price, plus tax, plus fuel to pick it up, I am breaking even. Not interested in shipping and first come first serve, minimal travel on my end. CCW or LE a must. All state and federal laws applicable, must be legal to own. I will ill consider trades in my favor, but cash is king. Call or text for fast response. REDACTEDThis is the only one you will find for sale.

The workmanship is top-knotch and you cannot even tell that this had been demilled at one point. Comes with 3 LEO/Restricted mags and authentic leather HK sling. 
 
This is an NFA item; a registered short barrled rifle, and will be sold/transfered via a Class 3 FFL dealer with all appropriate forms. However, because this MP5 started life as a ""pistol"" it can be converted back to a ""pistol"" and sold as a ""pistol"" but you will not get the stock and you'll need to give me a couple of weeks to write the letter to ATF removing it from the NFA registry before I sell it to you as a pistol. You can then do the ATF Form 1 online and when you eventually receive your tax stamp back, you can buy a stock and slip it on. I WILL NOT DO ANYTHING UNLAWFUL so do not even bother to ask. I am only selling/transfering this within the scope of the law. Period."
