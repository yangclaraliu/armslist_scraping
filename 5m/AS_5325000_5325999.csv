Asking $375 or trade.The streamline, lightweight, no-snag design of the Smith & Wesson® Model 642 Airweight® makes it an ideal concealed carry double-action revolver. The internal hammer of the 642 eliminates the risk of the hammer getting snagged on clothing, holsters, or purses when drawing the weapon in a self-defense situation. The low profile, ramp front sight and the fixed notch rear sight also aid in snag-free presentation of the weapon. The 642 is double-action only, making it an extremely fast personal-defensive handgun to deploy in stressful situations, as there is nothing to remember to do except point and pull the trigger. The synthetic grips and inherently ergonomic design afford natural pointability. The Model 642 is built on Smith & Wesson's famous J-Frame, it has a 5-shot cylinder rated for +P .38 Special ammunition. Stainless steel and alloy construction resist corrosion caused by humidity and perspiration when the revolver is carried close to the body. The Smith & Wesson 642 Airweight Double-Action Revolver carries easily, deploys rapidly, and has enough firepower to handle any self-defense scenario. Made in USA."

Zeroed this rifle, set up silloettes at 500 yards and dumped 90 out of 100 rounds into them, most as fast as I could regain my sight picture and pull the trigger. I would rather run and gun so I just don't every use it for anything and the doomsday apocalypse I got it for never came. So I am looking to sell or trade for some fun range toys."
