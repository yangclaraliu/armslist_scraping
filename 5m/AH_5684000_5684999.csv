Finally, it is equipped with an ambidextrous rear sling attachment point that moves to either side of the gun--ideal for single point slings.I'm asking $1500 for this package, which includes rifle, suppressor, and all accessories listed and pictured on the gun.  This has to be done properly on a Form 4, and will require buyer to pay for two separate tax stamps--one for the Short Barrel Rifle lower, the other for the suppressor.  In state buyers only."

It has been properly stored all these years. The dash 2 model made some key improvements over previous model and is highly valued by collectors and target shooters. I’ve read that S&W hand built the 52s and that they are extremely accurate, on par with other custom built guns. I recently took the pistol to a dealer who graded it 95-98. The original, two-piece box (with insert), manual, brown paper, and cleaning rod are all included. The box is in excellent shape and adds significant value for collectors. The two mags are in perfect shape. This is by far the nicest model I’ve seen on the auction sites. Cash only. $1,400 firm. Buyer must have TN HG Permit and sign bill of sale."

There is a cosmetic issue on one of the screws as I used a dremel to try to remove the rail...fail! It does not affect the function of the rifle. 
I have run 160 rounds through it. The barrel is melonite with a 1:7 twist. The rail accepts magpul moe from what I understand. 
I am asking $400 firm. Please do not offer me less and say cash. We already know this is a cash deal. I'm not trying to be rude it's just people low ball and they put ""cash"" with it. 
I am going to build another and I don't need two of the same."
