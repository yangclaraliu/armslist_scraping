Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns. Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers to help with a deal, but I have PLENTY already, so ammo would need to be a really good deal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics and/or nice magnifiers(Aimpoint or maybe Vortex) to help with a deal, but same thing here, I have nice optics just sitting now for future projects.Ftf in the Garland only area or I can ship.  When the online stores had this in stock they were charging $20-$30 per can for shipping, if I recall, so that's likely what shipping will run.  I will check UPS online for an estimate for anyone wanting it shipped, just need your zip code.Thanks for looking!"

Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank (PIAT) Mk I was a British man-portable anti-tank weapon developed during the Second World War. The PIAT was designed in 1942 in response to the British Army's need for a more effective infantry anti-tank weapon, and entered service in 1943. The PIAT was based on the spigot mortar system, that launched a 2.5 pound (1.1 kg) bomb using a powerful spring and a cartridge in the tail of the projectile. It possessed an effective range of approximately 115 yards in a direct fire anti-tank role, and 350 yards in an indirect fire 'house-breaking' role. The PIAT had several advantages over other infantry anti-tank weapons of the period, which included a lack of muzzle smoke to reveal the position of the user, and an inexpensive barrel; however, this was countered by, amongst other things, a difficulty in cocking the weapon, the fragility of the barrel, the bruising the user received when firing it, and problems with ammunition reliability. (From Wikipedia) This P.I.A.T. is in very nice condition with what appears to be original paint with plenty of cosmolene. It has the original canvas butt pad, cheek piece and barrel cork. In addition the adapter for the practice projectile is included as is the monopod. This launcher reportedly came from a museum via Kent Lamont many years ago, unfortunately the name of the museum has been lost.  Asking $1650.00"

It does have an A N stamped in the left side as well as a P on the grip and a couple numbers in the barrel channel and an F 82 on top behind the receiver area. The lighter stock is cracked in 2 places and would take either professional repair to use on a shooter or some time by a non professional to make it look nice for a wall hanger or presentation rifle. It does have a RIA stamp on the right side and a P on the grip area so there is some historicak value to it. Most of the finish has been stripped from this stock.I got these stocks in a tool trade with an old ww2 vet that had a bunch of m1 garand stuff. I don't need the stocks so selling them. I'm basically throwing the lighter stock in for free so price for both stocks together is 60 dollars.

It was purchesed in November and as never been shot. If you are not familiar with the 380 Concealed Carry model it is not like the standard Thunder .380, this piece a bit smaller and lighter but has a 8 round magazine instead of the standard 7. The grips are contoured for fingers, the beaver tail has been shortened a bit and the decocker and slide release are lower profile so they are less likely to catch on clothing, etc. It out-performs, out-features and out prices all others in it's class. The Thunder 380 CC has become a leader among concealed carry handguns by earning a reputation of reliability, accuracy and durability. Extremely compact and strong, the 380 CC’s quality design and engineering provide the shooter enhanced balance during those critical seconds. Features like the loaded chamber indicator, extended capacity magazine and slide sights make the 380 CC a perfect CCW sidearm. At just over a pound, you won’t even know you’re carrying it. Possessing attributes of more expensive guns, the Thunder 380 CC is truly a personal protection “Best Buy”."
