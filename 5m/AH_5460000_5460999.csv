It doesn't have night sights, and shows normal wear on the finish. I'm having a right hand outside the waistband holster being made for it by Armiger Solutions, and will have the maker ship direct to you once the holster is completed.I got it at a show and bought 4 mags for it and Put in new wolf magazine springs. One mag has some wearing of the finish, the other three look to be in good physical condition. One is marked Sig, one is marked p6, the other have no markings. All are zipper back mags. I am having a owb holster made for it that I can ship once it arrives (maker is waiting for the blue gun mold now). No malfunctions for me at all. It holds 3 inch groups at 10 yards for me, but I've only put about 100 rounds through it and am honestly out of practice as a pistol shooter. Unsure what the previous owner had through it.Open to sale price starting at $625 OBO.  Representative of the holster that is being made and will get shipped to the buyer:http://www.armigersolutions.com/product-p/owb.htm"

When I received this rifle it was in poor condition, the stock was horrible, and the entire action and barrel were canted, and not level. I test shot it at 50yards and could not get anything better then a 3"" group. That's when I tore the entire gun down, sanded the barrel channel down, bedded the barrel pillar bolt, put in a bedding block under the barrel around the pillar constructed of professional grade autobody Duraglass, after all that I noticed the rear action would still not seat properly on the stock. That's when I decided to add a rear action screw. I welded a 7/16 nut to the rear action, bored the stock, and now everything sits level, and this gun will shoot same hole at 50yds. All the bottom metal has been painted high gloss black enamel, the stock was completely redone in a beautiful cognac finish, and cleared with high gloss high build polyurethane clear. I then polished the bolt with 200grit-2000grit sand paper to add a custom look, and the bolt cycles smooth as silk now. The barrel has some wear marks but doeant have rust, the mags do however have some surface rust, i was going to sand them down and repaint them but have heard horror stories of paint build on and in the magazine springs.

Its major shortcoming is a minor barrel bulge.  It's slight,  and towards the muzzle end half of the barrel.  It usually goes unnoticed on casual first inspections,  and even the top solid barrel rib wasn't affected.  I have no idea of the back-story on it,  but the rest of this firearm is as near new as it gets. There are no ill effects anywhere else, it's been professionally checked.  Sales of this exact model (with box / no bulge) in the same overall condition have sold on GB for 5K and up.
I can’t say how much a new 4-inch, 6 1/2-inch, or 8 3/8-inch barrel would cost from a S&W gunsmith,   but just do the math.   It's little more than a bolt-on fix for the right armorer. Then it's a mint, 1950's S&W .44 Magnum once again.
The photo shows many glare spots on the bluing.   There are no actual high spots or rubs.  No box.
Serious inquiries only please.  There's a 72 hour wait period once agreement is made and valid FOID information provided.

I have taken it out and tested it has proven to be very effective. Shot at it 20 yards with 9mm and .45 and at 50 yards with a 223/5.56 rounds it had stopped the fragmentation.  The plate carriers are adjustable from Small up to XX-Large MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs. The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs. This particular armor is made to military spec and it is designed to withstand higher caliber rounds. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail as this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc"
