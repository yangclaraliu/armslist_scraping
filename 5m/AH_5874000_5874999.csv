The 1928 Thompson guns were used earlier on so these drums were used more in the Pacific Theater of Operation and less in Europe. Nobody can say where this pouch saw action but if it could talk it would tell us interesting things indeed!Use it for your drum or display it...it's cheap enough to enjoy!This one is also priced very inexpensively (compared to others I've seen for sale) to sell quickly.This price is firm - Just $75 cash buys it!!Can ship too for cost of shipping.Check out the images and if you have questions, want more pictures (I have many!) or want to take a look at it, Please email me!Thanks for looking!"

AAC's M4-2000 Mod 08 features the patent pending fast-attach Ratchet-Mount to provide precision accuracy with minimal and repeatable zero-shift. Users have the ability to install or remove the silencer from the Blackout™ flash hider/muzzle brake, or the BRAKEOUT compensator, in seconds. Includes 51T 1/2x28 Blackout® Flash Hider Mount. The compact size and light weight have minimal affect on maneuverability. The M4-2000 Mod 08s extreme durability is maximized by CNC automated fusion welding of every high-temperature aerospace alloy component used in its construction- making 100% suppressed full-auto fire possible on barrels as short as 10 inches. The back-pressure lowering design of the silencer aids in shooter comfort, reduces weapon fouling, and minimizes cyclic rate increase. As a final step, tapered-bore EDM technology is utilized to ensure precise bore alignment resulting in enhanced accuracy and maximum performance.

Financial situation requires it. This is a CMP Special Grade M1 Garand rifle. Serial #837xxx puts it at a September 1942 production at the Springfield Armory in MA. so plenty early to have seen lots of action. Rebuilt by CMP armorers with new barrel, stock set, springs and other parts as needed. Has not been fired since I bought it from CMP 2 years ago. I personally applied 3 coats of Tom’s 1/3 Mix (Natural Beeswax, Mineral Spirits and Boiled Linseed Oil) over a period of several weeks back when I first acquired it. Stock is a real beauty and now ready for any weather thrown at it. Steel Parkerizing is 100%. These have been sold out for some time and as CMP's supply of Garands has dried up so maybe never to be seen again. Lots of extras included-
500 rounds of Prvi Partizan 30-06 Springfield (M1 Garand) 150 Grain Full Metal Jacket (currently going for $420 + ship at Midway USA). Good stuff loaded to M2 Ball specs.
20 rounds Hornady 30-06 Springfield 168 gr. A-Max M1 Garand ammo. Hunting or match use.
UFH (Universal Fork and Hoe) mint condition bayonet and scabbard- WW II original not a cheap knock off. In this shape these go for $150-$200+ on Ebay.
51 eight round clips made by AEC- all mint cond. New production, AEC was an original WW II clip contractor.
3 five round clips for hunting use.
5 bandoleers w/cardboard inserts.
Wolff Repair Kit with springs/parts most likely to wear/get lost on an M1.
Complete GI cleaning kit is stored in the buttstock storage compartments.
GI web sling- mint
Canvas weapon storage bag for M1
CMP hard case
Books- both mint- ""The M1 Garand Owner’s Guide"" and ""The US M1 Garand Rifle in Pictures- WW II and Korea"".
Certificate of authenticity, hang tag and other CMP docs.
$1575 for all. No trades please- need cash or I'd never be selling this. Face to face in Montana (I'll drive halfway for a serious buyer) to an adult Montana resident willing to sign a bill of sale. Thanks for looking and feel free to ask any questions you may have."

It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness lever-lovers long for. Get one in your hands and take aim. See what a natural pointer it really is. Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. The .22 LR version holds 16 rounds. The .22 Mag and .17HMR hold 12 rounds. Both will provide a whole lot of shooting pleasure before it’s time to reload their tubular magazines.The Henry Golden Boy rifle is one beautiful classic that’s affordably priced so you hombres won’t have to rob a stagecoach to own one. All we ask is that you mosey on down to your local gun shop and ask to see the Henry Golden Boy. You’ll definitely agree it’s the rifle that brings out the West in you.The youth version of our award winning Golden Boy has a shorter barrel and length of pull, this compact version is ideal for most youngsters or for the gals who may find it easier to handle.

This is a ""T"" series gun, manufactured between 1964 and 1969. The pistol is in very good condition for its age, showing only minor wear on the edges of the slide and trigger guard consistent with storage in the included Browning black leather pistol rug. The pistol retains its original grips, complete with red color on the inside of the magazine well [this is difficult to photograph].
The original barrel [shown below the pistol in the images] developed rust in the bore at some point over its lifetime, so it was replaced with a new old stock ""T"" series barrel. Both barrels are included. The only other non-original part in this handgun is the recoil spring guide assembly. The original was damaged from being installed inverted by a previous owner, so it was replaced with the new style recoil spring guide assembly [Browning part number B515553803].
This pistol has been completely disassembled and cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner before being reassembled for sale. All parts are clean, free of rust, and within specifications. You will not be disappointed whether you are a collector or a shooter!
Asking $850.00 or best reasonable offer. Pistol must be transferred face to face at a dealer. I will not ship this handgun!Note: This discription was copied and pasted from Microsoft Word [so I could check spelling and grammar], this is NOT a scam!"

The design of the 99 is superior to lever-actions such as the Winchester 94 and the Marlin 336 because it can handle high intensity cartridges. The rotary spool magazine allows for the use of pointed bullets, which retain greater velocity downrange than the flat point bullets required by lever guns with tubular magazines. It has a cocking indicator on top of the tang and it ejects spent cartridges at an angle, which makes it easily adaptable to the use of telescopic sights. The 1899A has a straight stock and a Schnabel forend. This rifle features a fixed blade front sight and a Marble’s tang sight.BUYER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING WITH ALL LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS BEFORE PURCHASING FIREARM.
