$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, probably a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price, please do not offer less.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

This is a gen 3 version, which is my personal favorite.

I added the Crimson Trace red laser, sighted it in and it has spent most of the time in my safe. It has no flaws & is very accurate ...but then, in my experience, most all Glocks are. I love this Glock and it is a very easy weapon to carry concealed (for those with their carry permits) but I just find myself gravitating to my Glock 19 most of the time as far as carry goes. I am not looking to trade for anything at the moment. Must have valid Tn. drivers license and be a legal Tn. resident. Thanks for looking! God bless."

The holster in question is the Glock 19/23/32 model holster in a right hand configuration set for in the waist with fixed 30 degree cant making the firearm easy to conceal. The holster also was finished in Battle Drab Car on Fiber kydex and has a large belt clip and adjustable tension devices located at the bottom of the trigger guard. Reign then takes it up a notch by trimming the holster down to a minimal but efficient amount and then polishing, not sanding but polishing, all of the edges to a butter smooth finish. The holster is also made with custom positive and negative retention allowing for a smooth and positive draw and also causing minimal wear to the firearm. Currently Reign has a three month turn around for all custom holster orders. I placed an order for this holster and recently decided to carry my VP9 FDE instead of the Glock so I have no use for this. The retail price on Reign's website is $65.98 plus shipping and a three month turn around wait. My price is 100% firm at $40 cash.

$1,060 in cash or better in trade value.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.

Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.  
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

Dan Wesson revolvers were made in USA by Dan Wesson company, founded in mid-1960s by Dan Wesson, grandson of one of the founders of famous Smith & Wesson Company. The goal of the newly founded Dan Wesson Company was to build high quality, most accurate and versatile revolvers for hunters, target shooters and self-defense. Such revolvers of modular design were designed and patented by Karl Lewis, and manufactured by DW in a wide number of models and modifications. Over the time, DW revolvers were extremely popular for target and silhouette shooting, and they still have strong, if small following in USA, despite being discontinued several years ago. DW revolvers were available in two basic frame sizes – medium (based on .357 Magnum frame size) and large (for .44 Magnum and larger cartridges), in nickel or stainless steel. Stainless steel versions of the basic models had numbers starting with “7”, i.e. DW Model 715 was the stainless steel version of the Model 15 revolver, etc.  Due to easily removable barrels and cylinders, one basic DW frame could be configured for a wide variety of calibers and barrel lengths, depending on availability of components and the user’s choice. Many DW revolvers were sold from the factory as “DW Pistol pac” kits with single frame and cylinder, along with several barrels of the same caliber but in different lengths.   DW revolvers are all-steel, double / single action guns with exposed hammers and frame-mounted separate firing pins. All springs are of coil type. Trigger parts are mounted to detachable trigger guard for simplified maintenance. 6-shot cylinder swings out to the left for ejection and reloading. Cylinder latch is built into the crane, to ensure most accurate alignment between cylinder and barrel. Grip frame is formed as a stud, which allows use of replacement grips of various sizes and configurations. Most prominent feature of all DW revolvers is interchangeable barrel system, patented by Lewis. Each barrel comes with its own separate barrel shroud, which can be had in a variety of lengths and styles. To install the barrel, one has to screw the barrel into the frame, place an appropriate shroud over it, and tighten it with the barrel nut which screws onto the muzzle of the barrel, using special wrench. Early guns (like model 12) had external barrel nut, later models had internal barrel nut, concealed inside the front part of the barrel shroud. Either type requires its own dedicated barrel nut wrench. When installing the new barrel, one must not forget to check the barrel / cylinder gap using special gauge, to ensure it is not too big, nor too small. Another important thing is proper tensioning of the barrel nut.

The Mod 7 Hog saddle was designed and built by a marine scout sniper. The Hog Saddle when paired with the accompaniying Manfrotto 055 tripod allows the shooter to make precision shots at distance allowing the firearm to be held securely in the vise like grip of the Hog Saddle. The inside pads of the hog saddle are a soft rubber so there is no possibiltiy of damage to your firearm. The Hog Saddle screws into the corresponding screw mount on top of the tripod. The Saddle locks up nicely and allows you the perfect platform to sight in your shotgun/rifle, shoot at great distances, or disassemble your firearm. The Manfrotto 055 tripod is incredibly well built and sturdy. It extends all the way to 5 and a half feet. Both of these items are in excellent condition and I have many other pictures I can send you if you are interested.

Our contact # does not receive text messages.Up for sale is a brand new in the box Heckler & Koch MR762.  Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating pusher rod in place of the common gas tube in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. This method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a barrel hammer-forged of the highest quality steel with 4 grooves, ensuring superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at H&K's American facilities using both American and German-made components. The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny type rail system allows all current accessories used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled. Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. Layaway price: $3,999.99Paid in full discount: $3,459.99If you cannot pick up the firearm locally we can ship it to a FFL holder for pickup.We accept a wide variety of payment methods in order to offer maximum convenience to our customers:CashMoney orderCashiers checkVisa, Master Card, American Express, Discover (price reflects a 3% cash discount, using a card will eliminate this discount)2 layaway options (please contact us for details regarding our layaway programs)"

I bought it about a month ago on Gunbroker. I performed a take-down. It was a mess inside. A lot of dirt. I soaked the parts, scrubbed it, and lubricated it , right down to the firing pin. Yesterday, I took it to my indoor gun range. I loaded 4-7 rd. mags. (BTW: Included will be 2 - 7 rd. mags, one of which is a Colt original.) I fired a round every second, dropped the mag, shoved the next one in, did the same, etc. I did this 4 times: 16 - 7 rd. magazines. The gun did not misfire one time, every trigger pull was a success. It did as well as my other 2 mustangs that are from the same era , but have less wear and are SS. No complaints. I wasn't doing a 2"" group at that speed, but I did manage to keep most rds. within 7 inches of bullseye, not too shabby. The gun is used. It could be anywhere from a 20 to 30 yr old gun. You wouldn't know it from the exterior. That is well preserved. The interior shows all the usual signs of wear indicative of a gun of this age. But the gun works great."

The MTAC is designed to stand up to the hard use of tactical shooters. This scope features a superior light gathering glass than the TAC30. These high quality lenses with hilume multi-coatings provide a crisp, clear picture from dusk to dawn. Another major improvement in the MTAC is the independently moving power ring, separate from the ocular bell. This improvement lets the shooter adjust the power range without any visual interruption. Double-spring tension and an oversized ball-joint secure the hand-fitted internal zoom-assembly. The main tube is constructed of aircraft grade 6061t6 aluminum. Each scope is purged with laboratory-grade nitrogen to eliminate internal moisture and sealed with Burris-exclusive quad seals. The adjustment system is positive and repeatable with audible clicks ensuring unfailing shot-to-shot accuracy in all environments. Another key feature is the ballistic cq reticle which allows for rapid engagement of close quarters targets while also providing holdover points out to 600 yards when shooting a 62 grain 5.56x45mm load."

This scope has superb glass.  The color correction and sharpness have to be seen to believe.  These scopes were built by Leica Camera in the USA using German made glass and it shows.  Some of the features on this scope are Adjustable Objective for parallax, finger adjustable turrets, real Titanium turret caps and objective ring.  It has to be one of the most handsome scopes I have ever owned.  There are very few of these around and they are getting collectable. This one has been setting new in the box since I bought it 6-8 years ago.  If you are building a high class sporter or an ultralight, this is a great scope.  Leica are the only optics I have ever seen consistantly outclass Swarovski and Zeiss. Not by much, but they are the best, just ask any African PH. Its Leitz/Leica all the way."
