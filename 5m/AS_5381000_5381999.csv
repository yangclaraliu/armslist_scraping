For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****   The Winchester® Model 1892 has been featured in many Western movies and was the favorite of John Wayne and Chuck Connors. It is considered by many as the smoothest, most compact, handiest and most handsome lever-action ever offered. The Model 1892 is the compact model of the venerable Model 1886. This exquisite rifle features a 20″ round, deeply-blued and polished barrel, receiver and large loop lever. The full-length tubular magazine balances the rifle perfectly. The stock is solid walnut, cut in a straight grip style for fast handling. Not many firearm models today can boast of having had over one million produced. The Winchester Model 1892, very similar in construction to the Winchester Model 1886, is one of these famous lever-action rifles. It is much like a compact or carbine model of the famous 1886 and has the same dual, vertical locking system for impressive strength. Many of its components have been scaled down and simplified to handle the smaller calibers, and here is where this nostalgic rifle shines. It is famous for its light weight, low recoil and responsive, easy handling. It displays a genius of design that makes it a modern-day treasure. The Winchester Model 1892 features a beautifully finished walnut stock, blued barrel and receiver, finely fit with precision and pride.  We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $1,009.00.  Mfg.

The dark, almost black and appears to be in excellent condition. The frame is stamped United States Property.

I'm not a great shot, but at 7 yds can consistently group in 3-4 inch circles. Only one mag, but apparently from what I've read, Browning HP mags can be pretty easily altered to lock in place.  This is an all steel, full-sized, 9mm handgun-- it's not a Ruger LC9 or a Keltec PM9 or other ""light"" carry gun.  Must have valid NH drivers license and current permit for concealed carry, or we meet at a FFL and I'll split the cost."

I picked up a spair wood M44 stock and shaved it down to a minimalist stock with a perminatly attached double cobra paracord sling that is over 150 feet of one long continous piece not melted and spliced together.  And finally this guy has a 10 round mag extention  I also still have the factory mag base plate as well if you want to swap it back to a 5 rounder.  This is a flame throwing heavy hitting blast of a rifle to shoot and is an absolute hog dropping beast.  Asking 450 for the rifle and both stocks which isnt bad when taking account of all the custom work done you get and it being a one off rifle.  Deduct $100  if you dont want over 500 rounds of ammo, spam can opener, 16 stripper clips, and 2 ammo pouches.  . I will not sell the ammo without the rifle selling first."
