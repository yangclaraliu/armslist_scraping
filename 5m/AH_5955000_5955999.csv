This is a 1944 Rifle in great condition. Both Muzzle and Throat Erosion are great and well within spec. The bore is crisp, there is some wear on the wood, but that is to be expected. Barrel dates Feb 1955. I know the wood is original, but no cartouches that I can visibly see. The wood is somewhat worn, but not bad. No cracks or deep scratches. Included with this rifle (if I don't have to lower my price) will be a treasure trove of spare parts to include bolt, op rod, springs, triggers, pins, safety, (un opened adjustable gas system) pins, swivels, butt plate, 2 op rod springs, NM op rod installed, original op rod included also, firing pin, etc etc... I paid $250.00 alone for the box of spare parts.
I am asking $1450.00 OBO for the whole lot. Any crazy low ball offers will just be ignored. I don't have time to respond to $200.00 offers for this rifle. I don't say this to offend anyone, but I just don't have time for the nonsense. I recently advertised a Ruger Gunsite Scout in NEW condition, and someone had the nerve to offer me $150.00 for it. 
Thank you for your time and looking. Please feel free to call or text my cell at REDACTED if you have any questions or reasonable offers.

The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCK history. Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size.     When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.     Specifications:     Item #: PI-43502-01  UPC_Code: 764503002533  Description: GLK 43 9MM PST 6RD FS  Manufacturer: Glock  Model #: 43  Type: Pistol: Semi-Auto  Finish: Stainless Steel DuraCoat  Stock: Electric Cherry and Pearl DuraCoated Polymer  Sights: FT: White Dot RR: White Outline  Barrel: 3.39""  Overall Length: 6.26""  Weight: 16.19 oz  Caliber: 9mm  Capacity: 6+1  Action: Safe Action  # of Mags: 2  Packaging:  Black Plastic Case  Receiver:   Electric Cherry Pearl DuraCoated Black Polymer  Width 1.02"

I took it out shooting to try out the makeshift sight and it worked just fine and I was able to hit 1 foot steel plates at 300 yards with ease. So if you are able to overlook that small issue then this is a well worth it gun. The lowest price that I can find this rifle at a gun show nowadays is around $850, and that is if it is in fair condition.

Up for sale is my USP clone by Sarsilmaz, the coolest gun I've ever owned.
This solid hunk of metal is surprisingly well-balanced, utterly reliable, and soft recoiling with H&Ks fantastic buffer system. SIX MAGS. The D/SA trigger pull is smooth and solid, ideal for a carry or duty piece. The quality of the machining is A+, the stippling on the grips is top-notch, and she shoots tight groups when I do my part. Factory sights are adjustable with photoluminescent paint. The slide is tall with deep serrations making it a dream to run fast and hard. Takedown is the easiest of any handgun I've ever handled. I have almost no complaints.
However... my favorite glove just won't fit. I'm Glock. She's Sig. I'm luger. She's 1911. Either I contort my grip or shoot the floor. I also bend my thumbs down into a 90 degree crush grip rather than ride the frame like everyone else... her panels won't cooperate. After one final range session last week with crampt fingers and a red thumb, I give up.
This gun is for you if:--1. Sigs, M&Ps, or XDs point well in your hands.--2. You have medium or larger sized hands.--3. Want a shooter for the range, home defense, or belt carry/duty use.--4. You want a D/SA hammer-fired gun or are comfortable with cocked-and-locked carry.--5. You shoot like a normal person with thumbs forward, not crushed down.
CAL: 9mmCAP: 15 FRAME: Blackened Aluminum SLIDE: stainlessWT: 33ozLENGTH: 8”HEIGHT: 5.6”WIDTH: 1.3”SIGHTS: Photoluminescent adjustable Three-Dot
PRICING AND BARGAINING: Buds sells this model for $533 new but you can find used and abused ST10s for $350-400 online. New mags are unobtanium and I've got four extras; $20 a piece is fair, no? I don't have the box and chintzy nylon ""holster"" but bought a much nicer carry case for gun, mags, manual, and brushes. You're a good guy with needs; me too, I feel ya. Given that $430 is not un-reasonable, $390 is certainly fair but I'm open to reasonable, friendly, respectful bargaining.
Just a reminder, I value keeping everything above board and will be going through an FFL. If you have to travel a long way to get to Burnsville, I'll help with your gas. Cops with good stories also get lunch."

The gun was originally purchased from the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP) and then sent to Schuff's for the ""Mini-G"" modification.  Finally, a customized rear sight adapter (by Hopco) was installed to accomodate the Burris FastFire III Red Dot optic.  This is a very rare set-up as Garands go and is a head turner at the range. For those that love the M1 Garand, this gun will knock your socks off...compact (36"" total length), lighter weight and faster sight aquisition.  This is the perfect ""old school"" tactical rifle...modernized historic perfection!Details about the Schuff ""Mini-G"" mod can be seen here:  http://shuffsparkerizing.com/services/the-mini-g/"

Now, these rifles have been banned from importation for the foreseeable future if ever.It was converted by Texas Shooters Supply earlier this year and I purchased this rifle from them. It lacks the magwell dimples but that does not affect function or reliability. This rifle has been converted professionally. It has the correct bullet guide, 24mm threaded front sight block, all holes welded that were left over from conversion, and it was parkerized then duracoated.In the three months I have had this rifle, I have put about 500rds through it. It is in excellent shape but it does need a good cleaning (it has NEVER been fed corrosive ammo).It comes with U.S. made plum polymer furniture and five steel surplus magazines (Polish and Romanian), green surplus sling, hard-side carrying case, and a chrome lined muzzle brake. I am asking $1,300 or best reasonable offer. NO trades, just cash.I am flexible on the price but do not low ball me. This isn't an inferior RAS-47, Century C39, or I.O. Inc. AKM so the price reflects that. This is a Russian AK made at the famous Russian factory in the town where M. Kalashnikov was built his legacy and as I mentioned, these rifles are no longer imported and they are only increasing in value as supply decreases.Please contact Dave any time by email or call/text at (313) 287-288four for more pictures or any questions you might have.

Then they were imported by a company called Armory USA, in Houston, TX. These are not ""parts guns"" that were imported as kits and then assembled in the US -- they are genuine Eastern bloc AKs. The receiver is a bit thicker than the standard 1mm AK receiver. The gun has a 16-inch chrome-lined barrel, and it has all matching parts (receiver, bolt, and rear sight leaf.)On the left side of the receiver, it says ""SSR-85C-2, Cal. 7.62x39 mm, Armory USA, Houston, TX."" On the right side of the receiver under the trunnion, it says ""ISD Bulgaria LTD, Made in Bulgaria.""The gun is in great shape, and I've updated it with the following items:1) Hogue pistol grip2) ATI Strikeforce 6-position adjustable stock with adjustable/removable cheek rest3) Tapco G2 trigger group (eliminates the infamous AK trigger slap)4) A rear sight with a slightly widened notch, for easier target acquisition. (The original numbered rear sight is also included.)The gun also comes with the original cleaning kit, a standard US-made plastic buttstock, six 30-round Eastern bloc steel magazines (five of which are like new), two 20-round like-new Tapco magazines, and a Maglula magazine loader/unloader. Three of the mags have followers installed that enable you to lock the bolt open.This is not an ""entry level"" AK; these guns have a reputation for very solid build quality and very good accuracy. Feel free to read up on them.Asking $850 shipped to your FFL anywhere in the Continental US. I will not break up the package. No trades. Paypal is preferred.I have more pictures, so if you are interested or have any questions, contact me and I'll send you all the photos.Thanks for looking."
