The scroll-engraved receiver is a functional work of art in itself, with its interesting geometry blending perfectly with the stock and contributing to the gun’s graceful lines. This is a shotgun that has all the elements of a treasured heirloom, without the price-tag to match.
 I have about 6 rounds of skeet thru this shotgun. Always cleaned afterwards and can not find a scratch on it. I ended up with a Citori 725 so this one has just been sitting in the safe. I bought new for over $2100 so my loss is your gain.

So with the accessories and ammo bringing the value to around $700, I hardly think the price I'm asking is unfair. This is brand new, people. Also comes with the soft case as seen and all original paperwork. I will require you to sign a bill of sale. Also you must have a CCW (or I must be able to confirm that you are in the process of earning one through a VERIFIABLE firearms safety class).

The wood is really nicely figured as you can see in the pictures, however it is a used rifle from back in the mid 80's so it does have some dings and dents, the lefts side of the stock is pretty much where the dents are due to rubbing against a knife sheath while shouldered on a sling.

A bright new optical system, remarkable hand-turn reticle adjustments with Spring-Loaded Zero-Reset turrets, and a convenient quick-focus eyepiece with a 4x zoom ratio, make adjustments while in a shooting position a breeze. The PROSTAFF 5 4.5-18x40 outfitted with the BDC reticle is beneficial in a variety of hunting situations and can be used with Nikon Spot On Ballistic Match Technology to take the guesswork out of compensating for bullet drop.  With enough power for the longest-range shots, the PROSTAFF 5 4.5-18x40 will keep you on target even when shooting through thick brush and timber.  This is one scope you can truly count on in any situation.  In addition all PROSTAFF 5 riflescopes are built with fully multicoated optics for maximum light transmission, even in extreme low light environments.$10 shipping within United States or free local meet/pick up.Can accept Paypal or cash payment.Please email me with any questions."

My P380 will come with talon grips, box, paperwork, 1-6rd magazine and either another 6rd / 7rd or 8rd magazine your choice. In my honest opinion this is the finest pocket 380 on the market that has no thumb safety. The size is neck and neck with the Ruger LCP but has a great trigger and actually dove tail sights. Only reason that I am trading it is due to me walking into another P380 with night sights and would like trade it to fill another role. I am looking to trade for one of the following, depending on trade offer cash may be expected or given.

I can't say for sure though, I'm no expert. That being said, It's still a functioning rifle. The breech locks up tight, and the hammer, trigger and firing pin seem to be in great shape. I've never fired it becaue I could never find the ammo but I've read that people make their own using 24 gauge brass shotgun shells. The rifle alone is longer than a Mosin 91/30 and with the bayonett it stands at just over 6 foot 5 inches. I'm interested in trades as well, just text me what you have, I'm willing to consider about anything. Text me at REDACTED for more pics or any other questions you may have."

They were sold commercially but most were produced for police agencies under the control of the Ministry of the Interior. After the Second World War, Czechoslovakia’s Ministry of the Interior requested a new pistol design from Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod. The resulting gun was chambered in .32 ACP and designed by two brothers Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl. It combined elements from both the Walther PP and PPK. The pistol is fed from an 8-round single-stack magazine, located within the bakelite paneled grip. Small fixed sights are located on top of the slide. The pistol functions via the blowback principal – recoil causes the slide to move backwards, thereby compressing a spring around the fixed barrel. After it reaches the end of its rearward travel, the recoil spring returns the slide to its forward position, stripping and chambering a new round from the magazine as it does so, rendering the gun ready to fire again. Hammer and trigger operation is first shot double-action – that is, the hammer can be cocked and released by a squeeze of the trigger. Due to the fixed barrel, it is a very accurate pistol and fun to shoot. It has been refinished with DuraCoat firearms finish in a two-tone matte black and gold finish. It is attractive, mechanically sound and 100% reliable. It is a top quality firearm. I will sell only to holders of a Tennessee handgun permit or a licensed FFL. Im will ship licensed FFL for a $20.00 fee."

It offers a half inch more eye relief, positions the windage and elevation adjustments inside of the optic rather than in the mount, less moving parts in the mount which makes the mount even more stable, and has a quick release thow lever on the bottom of the mount which allows the quick removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights. 3x magnifier with Flip-To-Side mount and quick detach. Works with all existing HWS units.

My trusts are 20+ pages and cover the numerous issues related to NFA items for you and your beneficiaries. A gun trust enables you to purchase suppressors, short barreled rifles and fully automatic rifles without the hassles (and often impossibility) of a chief law enforcement officer signature as well as other bureaucratic red tape. As a firearms enthusiast, I want to see more people enjoying the benefits of NFA items and, because this isn't my primary source of income, I can offer my services at $199 for a trust. This includes an initial in-person or phone consultation to determine how to best serve your needs, all fees and documents, an electronic copy of your final trust documents, a guide to how to best use your trust as well as an appendix of ATF advisory letters and forms. While there are cheaper “fill-in-the-blank” trusts available online, the ATF has given negative feedback on many of these as not being well drafted and having the potential to expose the user to criminal and civil penalties. Not only am I licensed and in good standing in Arkansas, but I am also licensed and in good standing in Florida and Texas and can assist with trusts in those states as well. I prefer cash, but am willing to accept trades of equivalent value at my discretion. Please contact me, David Kronenfeld, at razorbackguntrust@gmail.com to inquire about my services."
