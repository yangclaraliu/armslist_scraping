1,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5821001,For Sale:  Palmetto State Armory KS-47 Factory New AR-15 7.62 x39,"Denver, Denver, Colorado",$ 900,"Listed On: Saturday, January 14, 2017",Rifles,Palmetto State Armory                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"The Palmetto State Armory KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK. While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 lets the AK shooter capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR-style platform. Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver, the KS47 features an AR-style modular configuration which consists of a barreled upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. The modular configuration allows customers to have several different barrel configurations with one lower receiver, just by releasing two pins.  Lower: The 7075-T6 billet lower receiver is hardcoat anodized, and accepts standard AR15 fire control groups. The extended magazine release is outside of the trigger guard for safety, which allows for an AK-style release movement, but also features oversize side paddles for fingertip release by the trigger finger. Fitted with a standard PSA A2-style grip and M4-style stock, the receiver also features a standard, mil-spec diameter, 6-position 7075 carbine buffer tube. The KS47 lower has steel reinforcements to accept AK style surplus magazines including drum-style. Upper:  The KS47 hybrid upper receiver is precision machined out of billet 7075 T6 aluminum, and then hardcoat anodized for durability. While retaining the look of a standard M4 upper, the KS47 hybrid upper is designed to work with either the KS47 lower, or the standard AR47 lower. The chrome moly vanadium barrel is chambered in 7.62x39 with a 1 in 10 twist, has M4-style feed ramps, is nitride treated for accuracy and durability, and is finished off with a 5/8-24 thread A2-style compensator. The forward, assist, dust cover, charging handle, and safety are all standard AR15, as is the PSA Slim Keymod free-float rail and barrel nut. BCG: The hybrid KS47 Bolt carrier group works with either AK47 magazines or AR47 magazines, and features an extended firing pin. The carrier is made of 8620 steel, chrome lined and phosphate coated, and the chrome lined gas key is attached with grade 8 bolts and properly staked. The Bolt is made of phosphate coated 9310 steel.   The KS47 Upper and Hybrid BCG are compatible with standard AR15 lowers for use with AR47-style magazines.   Barrel Length: 16"" Barrel Profile: Mid-weight Barrel Steel: 4150 Barrel Finish: Nitride Chrome Lining: No Muzzle Thread: 5/8-24 Chamber: 7.62x39 Twist Rate: 1in10"" Barrel Extension: M4 Gas System Length: Carbine Diameter at Gas Block: .750"" Gas Block Type: Low Profile Muzzle Device: A2-style Receiver Material: Billet 7075 T6 Receiver Type: M4 KS Hybrid Hand Guard Type: 13"" Slim Keymod Bolt Steel: 9310 Bolt Carrier Profile: Semi-Auto Fire Control Group: PSA Standard AR Grip: A2-style Stock: M4-style Buffer Tube Length: Carbine Buffer Tube Diameter: Mil-spec Overall Length: 32"" Weight (unloaded): 6.6 lbs."

The tang bears a signature though I believe it was half carved and half wrote on, and only the carved characters remain, as this appears to be a later war sword with a depiction of a demon creeping up on the warrior signifying the enemies close proximity. The sword is in immaculate shape aside from the missing handle as is the scabbard. The guard is as well and is by far the coolest tsuba I have ever seen.

It's got the large latch BCM charging handle, the famous RRA two-stage match trigger, and the factory tuned muzzle break. The lower is factory built, but I ordered it without the winter trigger guard or the upgraded stock normally associated with the R3.I got it in September of last year and since then I've put just under 1000 rounds of factory ammo through it. I've never had the chance to put it in a vice to test it, but like other RRA rifles, it has a guaranteed accuracy of 3/4 MOA at 100 yds with factory box ammo.I've got some cheap flip up back up sights on it that have served me well and held zero through the 1000 rounds I've put down range.Besides the rifle, I'll include a 10 rd and four 30 rd magazines by Magpul. One of the Magpul magazines has some pretty God awful stippling... but if you ever need to practice your stippling, you could use some of the free space left on it. The mag holders and the rifle case in the picture are not included.I'll also include a small amount of the ammo I've used almost exclusively with this rifle since it performs so well. It's the cheap Fiocchi 223A that's about $20 per box at Cabelas.  I've found it to work better out of this rifle than some of the more exspensive stuff.I'm selling this to fund a very specific project gun, and I probably won't be able to use what you have to offer on trade, so I'll just say it's a blanket no on any trades to save us both time.Thanks for looking!Tags for people to find this post:RRA; AR15; DMR; SPR; Wilson Combat Barrel; Stainless Steel; Fluted; Free Float; sub-MOA;"

Almost same dimensions as the Shield, but with a very nice textured grip. Three-dot sights, but front sight is large orange dot, very easy to pick up when firing. Weighs 3 ounces more than the Shield, making for softer recoil. Nice pistol, but I just don’t care for striker-fired triggers, so it’s available.

It is the shortest rimfire silencer on the market, has the quietest 10-round average of any silencer in its class, and can go 2,000 rounds between cleanings. Patented Multi-Part Containment (MPC™) technology facilitates ease of disassembly and reassembly – an essential function of .22LR suppressors. The internal MPC™ construction uses two half tubes that pull away from a monolithic core, which ensures that the Sparrow 22 will remain easy to clean after extended periods of use with notoriously dirty rimfire ammunition. The Sparrow 22 is compatible with multiple calibers up to 5.7mm and is full-auto rated for .22 long rifle. Stainless Steel .22LR: 112.7 dB .17HMR: 124.5 dB 5.7mm: 127.7 dB This is an NFA Item.
