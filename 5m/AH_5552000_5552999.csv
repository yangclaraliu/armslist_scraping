Bolt action, tube fed, 15 rounds. VERY nice rifle. Full stock, peep sight. I've had it a month or so. I keep buying .22 rifles but keep forgetting I don't really like .22! Maybe I'll try a 10-22 next...who knows.Anyway, gun shoots perfectly. Extremely smooth, no issues with it. It's tube fed, holds 15 rounds. Rear peep site swivels out of the way to look down a scope, front sight has a cool 5-sight system where you can flip up multiple different front sight posts. The front posts are a bit worn out but at least 2 of them still lock into place. The stock has a small chunk missing off, looks like the previous owner glued it back on but it just fell off when I was firing it. Does NOT affect function, just cosmetic. All parts for this thing can be purchased very cheap from places like Numerich and Havlin sales. This also comes with a soft case, and a 100 round box of Remington Golden Bullets. Not the best .22 ammo, but that's all Cabela'ss had! Runs fine out of a bolt action.I'm asking $150 FIRM for this. For $150 you won't get a better rifle. From what I've seen them online go for lately, they sell usually over $325 in beat up condition plus shipping, FFL fees puts you at about $400, and that's without a case or ammo. Only listing low because of the slight stock damage and because I want to sell it fast to buy something else. Not interested in trades at this time.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED"

From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

It is obviously not a genuine 1903A4 and that is precisely why I started with a 1903A3 so as to not ruin a rare piece of history that is every genuine 1903A4. Its an original custom, built 1903AA.The stock was hand fit to the original receiver to increase accuracy and consistency from shot to shot. The trigger also received attention and was smoothed up quite substantially from its original condition. The bolt was hand fitted, trued, and stone lapped to insure the smoothest operation,The SKB rifle case pictured below is included with the auction and is what the rifle will come packed in, In the right hands this rifle is capable of less than 1 m.o.a. accuracy at 100 yards with match grade ammo. It is a phenomenally gorgeous rifle and a blast to shoot and I regret needing to sell it due to some personal issues. You might be wondering why this rifle is priced as much/or more than an original then. The answer is simple: you get what you pay for. If you love the original look of the historic 1903A4 but also want a tack driver, then this is the rifle for you."

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5552998,For Sale:  ** Rare French MAS 49/56 in prestine condition!,"30 minutes west of Jax, Jacksonville, Florida",$ 675,"Listed On: Monday, June 6, 2016",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"French MAS 49 / 56A very nice, clean example of the scarce French MAS 49/56 semiautomatic military rifle. The production was seized after the war was over and they didn't have enough parts, time, or men to make many of these before the war ended. Making the 49/56 rifle a desirable collectors piece that was barely beat out by the M1 Garand as the military service rifle.This rifle is chambered for the 7.5 x 54mm French cartridge and includes one magazines and accessories. ( You can buy 308 and 7.62 conversion kits, but they tend to drop the price on them when they are this clean ) The parkerized finish is in 95% condition with minor wear on the moving parts and on the receiver where the magazine catch rubs. The bore is in very good condition with some wear on the rifling. Being a military surplus rifle, they do not get much better than this! The ONLY flaw in the entire gun is one of the ears that protect the front site post was broken during shipping. I have an entire front sight for the replacement to be fixed, but haven't had time to do it. The front sight alone sell for close to $100.It includes the original leather strap in pristine condition ( which should tell you how good of condition this gun is in because leather is hard to keep from cracking or splitting over many years ), 1 magazine, the spare parts pouch, an entire front sight set that has both protective ears along with the post and grenade sight attachment on it as well for it to be fixed. Once that is done I don't think you will ever see another MAS 49/56 as mint as this one in person.They usually sell for $750 minimum easily on gunbroker if you find them in this condition. That's and if and they don't pop up very often. Feel free to check prices on parts for it and you will see what these are worth even if there aren't any guns for sale. These bring in a premium which in turn makes the parts to fix them the same way.There are 2 of them on gunbroker right now listed for $800 or more and they are converted ( which depending on the person are actually worth less than mine to collectors ) I'm listing mine at $675The ONLY reason I'm selling is because there is a limited production gun out right now that I have a chance to get my hands on and need the money. Once the 1,000 they are selling are sold then I will be taking this ad down.I live 30 minutes west of Jacksonville in Macclenny and if you have any questions or are interested text me at 904-5zero9-0517. ( I'm usually working so it's easier for me to reply by text )Thanks"
