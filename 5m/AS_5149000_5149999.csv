The reciever is stamped Interport, Delta UT Portugal, and is no doubt stamped fron Heckler Koch tooling. It looks to have all virgin ""FMP"" parts in it, which is another Hk contract outfit. It's a good gun, and cycles flawlessly. Comes with at least 3 magazines, and I think there may be more floating around here as well that I can throw in. Asking $1,250 and it's worth every bit of that, but I might be open to possible trades of some sort. I also like guitars.

It is a 12.5 inch upper that would be great for an AR pistol build or short barreled rifle. I was going to do a pistol build but changed my mind. This upper has not been used in any way. I only took it out of the box to see it. It comes with the Noveske KX 3 ""Flaming Pig"" flash suppressor on the barrel and the barrel has a double thickness chrome lining. The barrel is beadblasted on the exterior and has a Vltor 9 inch VIS upper receiver assembly. It is free floated. If you are looking at this, you probably know how awesome Noveske AR's are. This upper is incredible...the workmanship is the best i've ever seen. If your intention is to make an AR pistol, all you need do is acquire a milspec AR pistol lower through your dealer or find a used one, add the pistol buffer tube & appropriate spring and your ready to go since this comes with bolt carrier group and bolt. Everything you need to know about an AR pistol, literally, you can find out on You Tube.  Thanks for looking and let me know if you have any ?.s"

Insight Technology M6X Pistol Tac Light wtih Red Laser, Rail-Grabber (150 lms) The M6X Tactical Laser Illuminator was built for U.S. Special Operations personnel and designed to perform under the most rigorous conditions and survive the harshest environments. Because of this, the M6X is built to go as deep as 66ft. and still remain waterproof. Now equipped with a high performance LED that delivers a peak output of 150+ lumens, the M6X LED is built to these same tough standards. Powered by two (2) 3V 123 lithium batteries, the M6X LED has a run time of two (2) hours. The M6X LED utilizes a Red, class III visible laser with a range of 200 meters. The laser is adjustable for elevation and windage using the supplied tool allowing the user to zero in the laser. The M6X LED features a 4 position selector switch in conjunction with an ambidextrous rocker switch located on the removable backplate. The selector switch turns to Lock Out, Laser Only, White Light Only or White Light and Laser combined. Once the desired output is selected the M6X LED is activated by using the rocker arm toggling down for Momentary On or locking up for Constant On. The rocker backplate on the M6X LED is interchangeable with any other backplate designed for either M3X or M6X models, giving you greater versatility of application. L-3 Insight Technology Incorporated offers three options for mounting the M6X LED to your firearm. The Rail-Grabber mount fits most rail configurations whether for a rifle, shotgun or a pistol. The Rail-Grabber interface utilizes a screw-adjustable locking plate that can be tightened to insure a rock solid fit. The Rail-Grabber mount is particularly recommended for heavy recoiling firearms.

Like the Ruger 10/22 Takedown, the beauty is in its ease of use. To remove the barrel from the upper receiver, simply move the slider bar toward the breech, rotate the barrel and pull it free—no tools required. Installation is just as simple: Slide the barrel into the upper and twist until it locks. The takedown mechanism provides a repeatable point of impact and employs a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system for a cleaner, cooler running firearm.The removable 16.1"", chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel is chambered in 5.56 NATO. A factory-set headspace requires no adjustment. The barrel assembly includes an elevation- and windage-adjustable flip-up front sight so that the zero stays with the barrel. The SR-556 Takedown also sports the shorter Ruger flash hider on the ½""-28 threaded muzzle.The SR-556 Takedown maintains the best-of-class elements of the SR-556 and comes standard with a host of accessories: Slim lightweight Keymod hand guard; slider bar for removing the barrel; upper receiver dust cover, forward assist, and metal flip-up windage adjustable rear sight; haricot anodized aluminum parts. The Ruger Elite 452 two-stage trigger is installed in the standard mil-spec pattern lower receiver. At 7.1 lbs., the SR-556 Takedown handles easily with Magpul's MOE grip and MOE SL stock on a mil-spec buffer."
