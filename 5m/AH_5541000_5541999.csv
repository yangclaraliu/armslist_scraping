I do take it out of the cabinet 2 times a year and give it a good cleaning and oil it to keep it in great condition. I put the laminated 3-tone thumbhole stock on it a few years ago, and just resighted it in after that. The stock has a pachmayr recoil pad, and that, along with the ergonomics of the thumb hole, GREATLY reduce felt recoil over the original stock. It shoots sub MOA groups (.88"" @ 100 yards) with factory Winchester rounds, and is a dream to shoot, I just never have time for it anymore. I keep it very clean and oiled and have had no issues with it at all. I have all the boxes and papers.

You can text me at REDACTED SeanThe Benelli Super Black Eagle II Semi-Auto Shotgun sets the standard for high performance and versatility in semi-automatic shotguns meant for hardcore hunting. The SBE II features a rugged, weather-resistant composite stock, finished with the Realtree Max-4® camo pattern designed specifically for waterfowl hunting. Filled with cattails, swamp grasses, and cane, Max-4 blends in with marshlands as well as corn stubble and other agricultural cropland. At the heart of the Super Black Eagle II is Benelli's ultra-reliable Inertia Driven™ operating system, consisting of just 3 main parts: the bolt body, an inertia spring, and a rotating bolt head. The Inertia Driven action cycles 2-3/4"", 3"", and 3-1/2"" shotgun shells interchangeably without adjustments. This super simple design does not use gas to cycle the action, so smoke and burnt powder residue do not enter the gun's mechanism, allowing it to remain cleaner than a gas-operated semi-automatic shotgun. The smaller mass of parts in the action, and no heavy gas operating components housed inside the forend, make the SBE II an extremely trim, and fast handling semi-automatic shotgun. The ComforTech® recoil reduction system tames recoil from magnum waterfowl loads and reduces muzzle rise for fast shooting on multiple targets. Benelli manufactures all Super Black eagle barrels and choke tubes with their Crio® System, which creates an even-grained, slick surface resulting in less resistance against wads and shot for uniform shot patterns and cleaner barrels. A red-bar front sight and metal bead mid-sight, and 5 Crio choke tubes (C, IC,M, IM, F), give hunters a versatility. Comes with integrated sling attachments, and a hard case. The receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope base (not included). The Benelli Super Black Eagle II is a rugged, ultra-reliable Semi-Auto Shotgun that is ideal for goose and duck hunting, as well as all-purpose use for any hunting situation.Realtree MAX-4 finish matches waterfowl habitatSimple and reliable inertia operationCycles 2-3/4"", 3"", and 3-1/2"" shellsComfor Tech recoil reduction systemCrio System barrel and choke tubesDrilled and tapped receiverComes with 5 choke tubes and hard case"

This is an early version, with an unaltered factory recalled, ""paddle” style safety. Shotgun has the factory folding stock with, original one-handed, "" hook"". These shotguns were made famous by such movies as, ""The Terminator"" and, ""Jurassic Park"". Shotgun fires 2 3/4"" 12 GA. Can fired either pump action or semi auto with the flip of a switch.Only roughly 1600 were ever imported into the US before multiple crime bills in the late 80's and early 90's banned any future import. Legal to own in NC. I purchased this shotgun from a FFL in Raleigh around 14 years ago. Shotgun is in excellent condition. I have not fired it in years, however it cycled flawlessly the last time I shot it. Kept in climate controlled safe for years, cleaned and oiled twice a year.  I purchased this shotgun to, ""scratch an itch"". Enjoyed it, has been an interesting conversation piece. Shotgun is just taking up valuable space in the safe. Rather someone else enjoy it like I have. Weapon is complete. No box or any other accessories. Shotgun does come with additional factory fixed stock (pictured), which has never been mounted or used.  Open to trades, prefer to sell outright. Price is negotiable depending on the buyer. I deal with serious people, not wishy-washy like you sometimes deal with on armslist. Don't need the $, don't need the headache. You want to do business, I'll do business with you. If not, don't waste either of our time.  Willing to travel reasonable distance from Ashe/Watauga Co. All laws followed. Please do your research on these shotguns if you're interested. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you for looking."

The Knights Armament quad-rail is the same one used on the military M4's, and retails for $350.The magazine shown is a gen2 Mag-pul Pmag, also in FDE. I can possibly sweeten the deal with a couple mil-surp magazines, and/or a few boxes of blasting ammo, depending. I've fired the rifle twice now, and it runs like a sewing machine !! It took a single 5-click adjustment on the rear sight to have it shooting dead-on. It's a great rifle, guaranteed.Trader must be legal to own firearms, and a Georgia resident, over age 18. I'm a regular here on Armslist, with my Georgia carry permit, so I'm good to go.Thanks for looking.......(If the ad is still up, then YES, I still have it!!)"

When Classic Doubles International discontinued business, the principal owners still believed in the Winchester 101 design and concept. On returning to New England, they formed Connecticut Valley Classics to continue the 101 design in an American made gun. The mechanical design was near identical to the Japanese version; the most significant deviation was changing all threaded parts to American thread sizes, and changing the frame and forend material to 416 stainless steel. Most mechanical parts are, again, directly interchangeable with the Winchester 101 OR the Classic Doubles 101. Competition proved to be too stiff, and stateside costs to high to maintain adequate sales. CVC discontinued operations in about 1997."

It comes with 2 magazines.  Buyer must be resident of Alabama, and legally able to own firearms. Serial number matches on case, barrel, slide, and frame.Unlike laser sights that attach to a pistol's exterior, this LaserMax sight sits inside your firearm's recoil spring – replacing the spring guide and plug. The on/off switch replaces the slide stop lever. That means the sight is an integrated part of your pistol that won't be affected by drops or bumps. It also ensures absolute alignment with the bore for consistent point-of-aim. Constructed of high-strength aircraft aluminum with a weather-resistant, sealed BK-7 window glass projection port, it projects a pulsing red-orange 5mW, 635 nM laser beam onto the target. This facilitates fast target acquisition and increased accuracy, particularly in low-light conditions. Installation is easy using the included instructions. Because the laser is internal, your firearm can be carried and drawn from its usual holster without any modifications. It also frees up the accessory rail on pistols equipped with one so that a separate light or accessory can still be mounted. Power is supplied by three silver-oxide watch batteries.  Five-year limited warranty."

Designed as a low-cost version of their popular PM9, Kahr's CM9 pistol is a top-of-the-line performer when it comes to accuracy and reliability. The CM9 differs from its predecessor by having traditional rifling rather than the PM9's polygonal rifling, a change that greatly reduces cost without sacrificing accuracy. The CM9 weighs in at only about 14 ounces, but its built to be extremely durable. Its black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin.

This gun was made in 1988 but for the most part looks brand new, that being said it is a real Marlin and not a newer Remington made Marlin it has the JM stamped on the barrel to prove it, so this Marlin's quality, reliability/dependability will far surpass a ""Marlin"" that you would buy brand new today. I don't shoot it much and am looking to give it a good home, I'm asking 475 for everything included. Thanks for looking, email me with any questions or offers.

Original PK-01 VS Military Red Dot Rifle Weapon Scope w/ Brightness Adjustment, Low Profile Cowitness AK Side Mount. The PK-01VS is a newest, mil-spec, light scope simple in design and construction made especially to use with NV goggles. It is particularly reliable and sturdy. It is designed for accurate firing by hunting rifles in daylight and dusk conditions and is guaranteed to significantly increase your accuracy. It has an universal mount so it can be attached to virtually any weapon. It has a traditional bright 1 MOA red dot. The PK-01VS has a special 8 setting (first three positions are to use with NV equipment), discreet built-in variable brightness control allowing you to regulate the brightness of the dot manually. There is a special position of the switch - K - to control the battery condition. When you put the switch to this position and the dot is not seen, you should change the battery. It is overbuilt to handle the strongest of recoils and can be attached to any weapon regardless of caliber. The sight is waterproof and dry nitrogen purged to prevent fogging. It works well with night vision optics. The open windage and elevation knobs are easily accessible for adjustment and have clear, pronounced .5 MOA (1.5 cm at 100 m) clicks. Russian sights are particularly popular for having open uncovered knobs that are finger adjustable. It comes with a full set of accessories including lens caps, tool, sun hood, battery, fire card and a soft carrying case. """
