This is a Para Ordnance Expert Carry 1911. This gun has a match grade stainless barrel, fiber optic front sight, sloped two dot rear sight, Wood grips with “The Comedian” medallion inlay, Clipdraw built on belt clip, Adjustable trigger, padded hard case, two mags (one with polymer floor plate, one Chip McCormick). I also have a decent amount of either FMJ or Defensive carry ammo for sale at an additional cost. This is used and does have carry wear, but is still a beautiful gun.  Mainly looking for cash, so not really looking for trades on this, but may consider some if they interest me. Would consider a PLR16, 4 or 6 inch 38/357 mag revolvers. Rugers, Smiths, etc. Also would take very partial trade for Stripped Metal Ar lowers. Most trades will need boot on your end, but for the right deal i may consider it on my end. Need to meet in Norman on this."

It's seen a couple boxe of target ammo, and I tested some PDX-1 Defenders, Remington Golden Sabers, and Fioochi XTPJHP and JHP ammunition through it, all functioned flawlessly. Trigger is excellent along with everything else. Comes with everything it did from the factory, and a lock. I purchased it to use as a BUG and I hate to sell it but I have to make room. Price is firm, not interested in any trades at this time. Buyer Must meet in NKY and be a KY Resident 18 or older whom can lawfully and privately purchase handguns. Newport is generally my preferred meeting spot, and I usually cannot travel much further. Aside from the two mags and factory goodies, it comes with a Blackhawk A.R.C IWB Ambidextrious holster and lt comes with One 50 round box of Fiocchi 90 gr JHP ammo, 16 rounds of Winchester PDX-1 Defender Bonded 95 Gr JHPs, 14 rounds of Remington Golden Saber 102 gr Brass Jacketed Hollow points. At the price I am asking, you won't find a better deal for a set-up that's good to go for defense right off the bat.  30+ dollars worth of ammo and 20 dollar Polymer concealment holster for pretty much free. This thing shoots like a G19, smooth as butter and the factory trigger is really something special."

I'll go over the main points and if you're still interested and have any questions, you can ask. I built this AR to be a CA compliant varmint rifle. It's built using an Aero Precision (AP) upper and lower, AP 18"" SS barrel chambered in .223 Wylde. In case you don't know much about this chamber, it allows you to SAFELY and ACCURATELY shoot .223 AND 5.56mm ammo. This is a very accurate rifle. On the muzzle is a Witt Machine Muzzle Rise Eliminator (MRE). Since I wanted this rifle to hunt, I installed an A2 style buttstock. I will include a 10rd PMAG. For an optic I have a Leupold 2-7 X 33 VX-R Matte Ballistic FireDot scope #111233 mounted using Leupold rings. The foregrip is nice and small and made from aluminum. I have over $1700 invested.

Description:
Serial #446115, .32 ACP, 3 3/4” barrel with an excellent, bright bore. This is a Type III pistol that has matching numbers on the frame and slide. The metal retains 98-99% of the original commercial blue finish with some mild silvering along the edges and projections. The safety and trigger retain a commensurate amount of their high polish blue finish and the checkered, hard rubber grips are in excellent shape as well. The checkering is still sharp with only some very mild flattening of the points and a few negligible surface scuffs. The pistol comes with an earlier, but still correct, two-tone, unmarked, pinned-base magazine. This is an excellent condition pistol that would make a great addition to any collection. FFL or C&R
