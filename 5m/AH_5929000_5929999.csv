I regret selling my guns but I simply an not financially able to keep them. Have to keep my power on by any means.Based on my research this is a late firlrst run production Model 1906. Fires both 22SR and 22LR. It has the straight stock and smooth foregrip as an in the photo. Most of the internals, furniture and barrel are the same as it came out of the factory i can't see any signs of replacement parts, or if there are it was a very long time ago. You are welcome to check .The finish is the only questionable part of this. It's not paint? It's not an epoxy either. Maybe cerakote? I'm not sure, I know it takes from the value. It was probably some product from long ago my grandfather applied to protect the metal or had it applied.He hated blued guns for some reason and he'd never want to sell any guns.Gun works perfect, great take down rifle. The butt stock and foregrip are worn in, but not beat to hell. It's obvious this 22 is a rough gem, if that finish were to be removed and the metal blued it plated it would look wonderful.If it sells today I will take 300, I need to pay my power bill and phone bill by Saturday. I remove this tomorrow if there are no takers and come up with the funds I need some other way."

No import marks. There were only 7200 of these manufactered in 1940. Comes with 3 Walther manufatcure mags (not serial numbered matched), that function flawlessly, and a high quality leather reproduction holster that fits the pistol and mag perfectly. Awesome pistol to have as a shooter at the range, home defense, or as a conversation piece. Face to face cash or trade only. $800 OBO, or will consider trades. I have an unopened 500 round case of 9mm that I will throw in on the right deal.  Honestly would rather do some local trading than sell outright.

Just had to say that because I've been screwed over so many times on this site, I'd be embarrassed to say. However, I've also met some of the best people in Tennessee here.  In an effort to do my part to keep our 2nd Amendment rights intact here in TN, I require a TN driver's license, but carry permit is preferred.  I just need to do my part to show that I'm not selling my gun to a felon.  I will provide my license and carry permit info to the buyer for his/her records.  This rifle was purchased from a dealer so you don't have to worry about its background (stolen, crime gun, etc.).  Please call or text Matt @ (732)213-seven nine four six.  I'm located in Cedar Creek, but I'm willing to split the difference in travel with you within reason.  Thanks for your interest."

I used the federal for all my target practice to save money and the hunting rounds are so close in ballistic trajectory that 1 or 2 rounds and you’re ready for hunting, with minimal cost.
All have been stored in ammo cans with desiccant, in a gun safe with an electric dehumidifier constantly running, and all have been purchased in the last 5 years from the local fleet farm.  This is 100% reliable ammunition. 
 
Why am I selling, new girlfriend, doesn’t like guns, so sold the rifle (I know my priorities are messed up what can I say) so I don’t need the ammo.
 
I will sell smaller amounts but done expect as much of a total discount as im offering on the full pile, this is the “make the transition simple” amount.
Along those lines, check the price, check online pricing this is a good deal, so im not interested in haggling the price is the price unless you want part of the pile …. Then the price goes up J  and this is the CASH price."

The upper receiver and handguard are both Aero Precision. The upper is their enhanced model and the handguard is their 15"" Quantum Keymod. Both brand new and have seen no use yet. I previously had this barrel in a Trojan Firearms upper and was experiencing issues with how the upper and handguard mated. Their customer service sucked and their warranty policy is crap, so I just did away with their upper and handguard. How Aero Precision's handguard attaches to their enhanced upper is a lot more solid and just a better design. I also have 800 rounds and 5 BCM magazines to include with this upper. I have replaced followers in 3 of the magazines with magpul anti-tilt followers. The other 2 still have the original followers in them, but I will be including 3 more magpul anti-tilt followers.
