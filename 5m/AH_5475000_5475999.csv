Comes with a bipod, and the original case and manual. Also throwing in the 173 rounds of TULA .308 I have left in a 30 cal can. Have done 2 inch groups with good ammo at 100yds. Mounted on the gun is a Vortex 2-8 Crossfire which holds a zero but Is having issues with the reticle staying completely verticle. For that reason Im also throwing in a Bushnell AR-optics 4.5-18 that Im not using anymore, scope works fine and is in good condition. Total investment into the gun as it sits (1200 for the rifle, 125 for mags, 250 for the bushnell scope, 80 in ammo, 50 for bipod) is around 1700.... Currently asking 950 and the gun is basically new, only bought it 3 months ago. Also note that the gun was specically made to be NJ compliant. the muzzle device on the end is a faux flashider that is welded to the end.

3. It's been running an after market firing pin and bolt which are not included in the package.

The sights are phosphor, not tritium, obviously. I still have the box of ammo that he apparently bought at the same time that he bought the 1911. It is Speer Lawman and it looks about 12 or 15 years old. There were like 5 rounds missing from the 50 round box. I don't think there is any way he put a newer box through it since the time he bought it when he was at Quantico. I've put maybe 5 boxes? through it. Flaw. Less. Every. Single. Round. It is very tight and I have kept it very clean and used ONLY FrogLube. There are some small scratches and a little wear in the Parkerized finish at the dustcover of the frame. By the way, the frame is made by the same company that makes the best FAL receivers. I have plenty of ammo and will beat any online or brick and mortar price for ammo that you find anywhere if you buy the 1911A-1. I'd be interested in an H&K VP40, anything by Sphinx, anything by Boberg or an Arsenal Strike One. I would be adding cash to the deal, of course.  There is nothing wrong with this 1911 at all, but my wife already thinks I'm crazy, so I have to sell something before I can buy something.

Here's whats for sale:Saiga 12, post-conversion, for 650. It DOES NOT have the bolt hold open reinstalled and DOES NOT include the sling.Century Arms M74 Sporter for 830. This includes the Damage Industries mkII modular forearm assembly, Magpul AFG, Magpul Zhukov stock, the Inforce WML, and the Hogue pistol grip. I took off 100 for this item because that'd be about the price you'd pay if you want to reblue it. I really hate to see this go considering it was my first AK and my first semi-auto rifle, but I hope somebody else can enjoy it in my place.Saiga 74, post-conversion for 720. I never really got around to doing what I wanted to do with this rifle, and I doubt I'll ever get around to it. The only thing I've done to it is restore the pistol grip and stock configuration from what it is NIB. I will include an extra pistol grip and plum handguards with this, though I will have to keep to sling.Roughly 450 rounds of Hornady 5.45 V-Max 60 gr for 250. Ammo can not included.2400 rounds of milsurp 5.45 for 450. One can IS open, but nothing is missing from it. I have a can opener included.Two bakelite 5.45 mags for 80. Four milsurp polymer 5.45 mags for 120.Nine Promag 5.45 mags for 90.Saiga 12 mags are as follows - two five-rounders for twenty dollars, a Promag 10-rounder for 25, and a Promag 20-round drum for 40. The drum has a crack in the rear, but I have never known it to fail me. The Saiga 12 has had less than 100 rounds through it and has functioned flawlessly with buckshot. It is not a fan of much else.The M74 Sporter has had a couple thousands rounds through it, but it was been well-maintained and the only times I have had malfunctions is with Monarch ammunition. The rifle itself is fine.The Saiga 74 has had one round through it and one round only to my knowledge. I was comparing the recoil between this and the Century M74. I did buy the Saiga 74 used, and it seemed to be in mint condition when I did buy it. I have the original box if you'd like that.I will sell the entire lot for 2775, the average market value of everything together would be roughly 3275, based on my calculations. I'm willing to travel within the state of GA, especially if you are willing to meet me somewhere convenient for the both of us. I'd prefer cash over card unless you bank with Navy Federal, like myself.Contact me at four seven eight two three zero five eight one two. Texts are very much preferred and will get responded to immediately unless I am asleep. Calls won't go ignored, but I am typically rather busy."

I'm selling my Glock 43 with a Streamlight TLR-6 laser/light attached, Glock MH3 night sites, as well as 3 magazines with mag extensions.  The gun shoots flawlessly and has never seen a jam or malfunction.  I love cleaning guns strangely, so this has been well kept.  It shows a few signs of use on the slide from holstering and has been Stippled which is very clean.  
The mag extensions are a Hyve Technologies +1, Hyve +2, and a Taran Tactical +1.  The laser has seen almost no use at all.  The gun was a gift from my father-in-law who is a SLC police officer and owned it previously for a short time.
 I haven't even carried it yet and am selling it to get a pocket pistol because I want the smallest possible gun (Although this is really small for a 9mm).  The laser is 1 month old, and the mag extensions are 2 months old.  
Also comes with the original Glock hard case and lock and some manuals.
