This is a great carry gun with the 9-round flush mag in it. It also comes with a 13-round extended mag, which makes it better for those with bigger hands, at the range, or for those who just like to have the extra rounds with them at all times.
The XDM series is Springfield’s upper-line models and include carrying case with mag and pistol holster, three interchangeable backstraps, match grade barrel, and a rail.
I’ve put about 50 rounds through this, and it shoots great. It does have a small flaw in the left-rear white dot as shown in the photo. It came from the factory like that, but it didn’t affect my aim at all.
These popular guns with the extra mag and kit retail for at least $580 before tax, shipping, and FFL fees.
If this ad is posted, then this pistol is still available, so please don’t ask. Copy of NCDL and CCW or original purchase permit along with Bill of Sale required.... you know the rules and all laws followed.

They stack nicely and do not crush as easily as the standard flimsy cardboard bulk ammo boxes.  Also, no need to store them in big, heavy steel ammo boxes.NOTE:  when you add on the cost of shipping/insurance that the CHEAPEST other seller of 9 mm Luger ammo (that I could find today) was charging, the cost was 18.92 cents per round, which is almost 1.5 cents per round MORE EXPENSIVE than my offer.  Hence, for 4000 rounds, his deal would cost you $56.96 more than my offer for 4000 rounds.--------------------------------------------OPTION #4:  $1,175--PACKAGE DEAL INCLUDING EVERYTHING ABOVE--GUN, 1 33-rd mag + 4,000 rounds of factory 9 mm ammo; saves you $55 compared to buying each item separately ($500 price for gun alone + 1 33-round Glock factory 9 mm magazine--$30 (normally $45...but FREE as part of package deal if you buy the gun & ammo) + $700 lot of 4,000 rounds of 9 mm ammo = $1,230).-------------------------------------------(PRIVATE PARTY)--NO SHIPPING--NO TAX--NO TRADES--MUST TRANSACT SALE FACE-TO-FACE IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA[END]"

478,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5413478,For Sale/Trade:  1855-1866 Vintage Ward & Sons Coach Gun,"Durango/Cortez, Colorado, United States",$ 350,"Listed On: Saturday, April 23, 2016",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm looking to get rid of my vintage Ward & Son's coach gun (properly called a ""guard gun"" in the UK). Original EVERYTING. We recently found it in my grandfathers safe and did some research on it. Despite the appearance, this is a legal-length shotgun in the USA - Barrels measure in at 18.5"" and overall is 34"". Ward & Son's was a Birmingham gunmaker (William Ward) between the warly 1800's until just up to prior to the start of WWII. This particular piece is a ""Bar-action hammer gun"" with a ""Fine London Twist"" damascus barrel, and is thought to be an authentic ""coach gun"" or ""guard gun"". I have photos of all the authentic Birmingham proof marks to verify authenticity, and many more phtos of the gun. While more common in the early western US, the ""Coach gun"" or ""Guard gun"" as it is referred to in the UK is a shotgun with a barrel length of around 18 inches, usually with a partial pistol grip or horned stock, designed specifically for concealment by law enforcement. While it is thought that Ward & Son's did indeed make a few of these with original short barrels, none of the Birmingham gunmakers of the time specifically documented this, nor did a proof specific to barrel length exist yet. Because of this, while I am saying this is ""original everything"" I am only asking for the ""wall hanger"" value, as I have no proof that the barrels weren't modified at a later time. YES this gun is over 150 years old, and YES it still fires. That said, I will be removing the firing pins and packaging them separately for whomever purchases them. You will only reassemble and fire this with the understanding that modern shotgun shells fired through a gun like this can MAKE THE BARREL EXPLODE. IF YOU INTEND TO PURCHASE/TRADE THIS TO FIRE IT, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR INJURY/DAMAGE/DEATH OR AYTHING ELSE. DAMASCUS BARRELS ARE PROOFED ONLY FOR BLACK POWDER, NOT SMOKELESS, AND SHOULD ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY BE FIRED BY/UNDER SUPERVISION OF SOMEONE FAMILIAR WITH VINTAGE FIREARM SAFETY!That said, I'm looking to sell or trade this for something I can safely hunt with. I'm interested in decent shotguns for turkey season, or a rifle of a caliber I can at least bag a deer with."

Here are a couple of general rules to help you determine if your pistols sights will be visible over the Osprey: If you have a .45 pistol with high sights, you'll be able to see your sights even with the Osprey installed. Most metal-frame pistols, like the Sig P220 or 1911 fall into this category. If you have a polymer pistol (like a Glock or M&P) - or are using the Osprey with sub-calibers, then you probably won't be able to view your factory sights with the Osprey.

This pistol also comes with the XD Gear System that includes an XD Gear belt holster, double magazine pouch, magazine loader, and cable lock.
I bought this pistol new on January 30 of this year. Exactly 300 rounds of brass jacketed ammunition has been fired through this pistol at the local gun range. It has been carefully and thoroughly cleaned and lubricated after every firing and has never been conceal carried. I have never had a failure to feed or fire with this XD Subcompact. These are great pistols...accurate, comfortable to shoot, durable, and easy to clean and carry. 
Included are the items that came with this package including the pistol, hard plastic case, 16 and 13 capacity magazines, paperwork, bore brush, and gun lock. I am also adding an additional 16 round new-in-package high capacity magazine with an additional X-Tension sleeve and a 13 capacity magazine that has been used one time, and additional $60 value. I have also added two strips of shaped rubberized grip tape on the side of the grip. It makes the grip more comfortable and easier to hold, but can easily be removed if the new owner would prefer.
This pistol features a lightweight, ultra high-impact polymer frame. It has a USA action trigger safety, firing pin safety, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, striker status indicator, and ambidextrous magazine release.
The gun has oversized, heat-treated slide rails, captive dual recoil spring guide assembly (steel guide rod), oversized steel slide stop/release, front/rear slide cocking serrations, and cold hammer-forged barrel. It also has 4 chrome-plated, steel, easy glide magazines, checkered front & back strap, and XD-frame/dust cover w/light rails.
Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."

Constructed using the highest quality materials, built on our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI™ raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance- delivering the highest level of performance.The IC-Enhanced with one-piece Monoforge™ upper design includes an integrated rail-base that is stronger and lighter. The 9” user configurable rail system with individual rail sections allow the shooter to place accessory rails where they are needed while maintaining its low profile ergonomic fit and function. Dual Control fully ambidextrous lower receiver includes bolt catch and release, magazine release and fire control access from both sides of the IC-Enhanced Rifle. LWRCI™ Enhanced Fire Control Group comes standard. Our investment castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset. The IC-Enhanced comes with a two-position gas block with normal and suppressed settings. Gas block is easily accessible enabling the user to pre-restrict the gas flow to the piston system, allowing the rifle to run smoothly and compensate for the added back pressure from running a suppressor. The IC-Enhanced includes a Picatinny rail at the 12 o’clock position, a bayonet lug, and is compatible with accessories like the M320 grenade launcher and the M26 shotgun. Gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws.Our IC-Enhanced uses LWRCI™ manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged spiral fluted barrel that is 20% lighter than unfluted barrels of the same diameter. The increased surface area reduces heat – speeds up cooling. Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity. The LWRCI™ IC-Enhanced comes complete with, LWRCI™ Skirmish Back Up Iron Sights, Ambidextrous Charging Handle, Magpul® MOE+ Grip and LWRCI™ High Efficiency 4-Prong Flash Hider.IC-Enhanced- the Individual Carbine – impressively improved- showing that, at times, evolution can be accelerated.
