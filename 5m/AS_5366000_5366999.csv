Asking $950 obo (these cost over $1200 new).Here is a list of the factory specs.The 5-25x50 Conquest HD5 Riflescope is designed for use at medium to extra-long-range use with excellent low-light performance, by combining a wide zoom range with a large objective lens. Its optics are fully multicoated with Zeiss' T* anti-reflection lens coatings to increase light transmission for bright and clear images with true color rendition. To get on target, it has 1/4 MOA per click impact point correction. 40 MOA windage and 65 MOA elevation adjustments allows for shot adjustments in most weather and terrain. Adjustments are made using the low-profile exposed target turrets with zero stops.Designed for the rigors of outdoor use, the aluminum housing features a 1"" one-piece maintube, and a scratch and corrosion-resistant anodized matte black finish. It is nitrogen-filled and o-ring sealed for water and fogproof performance in all weather conditions. To further protect the optics, the lenses have Zeiss' LotuTec coatings that bead water and oil off, and provide scratch-resistance.Optical Performance5-25x zoom magnification50mm diameter objective lensAnti-reflective T* fully multicoated optics increase light transmission for bright and clear images with true color representation21-4.2' field of view at 100 ydZ-Plex ReticleReticle located on second (rear) focal planeUtilitarian, general-purpose hunting duplex style crosshair reticleMedium-thick posts sharply taper to draw eye to the thin center hairsIn full daylight, the hairs are visible, but won't obstruct target, while the posts are still visible in low-light conditionsUse and HandlingLow profile exposed target turrets with zero stops1/4 MOA per click impact point correction40 MOA windage and 65 MOA elevation correction rangeParallax-free from 50yd to infinity, with side correction turret3.5"" long eye relief with fast focus eyepieceConstruction Details1"" diameter main-tubeAluminum alloy housingScratch and corrosion-resistant matte-black anodized finishNitrogen-filled and o-ring sealed for water and fogproof performanceLotuTec protective lens coatings"
