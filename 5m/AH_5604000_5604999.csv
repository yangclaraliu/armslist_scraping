Winchester Sporting Clays Choke Tubes
Our Sporting Clays Choke Tubes are made from 17-4 stainless and precision machined to produce a choke tube that patterns better than standard choke tubes. These choke tubes feature a 25% larger parallel section in the choke thus throwing more consistent patterns than conventional choke tubes. Each choke tube is knurled on the end to allow for quick and easy removal. Each choke tube has the constriction laser marked on the end for easy reference. These choke tubes are backed by our lifetime warranty.
Lead shot, Steel Shot, Copperplated Shot, Nickel Shot, Hevi-Shotshells™, and Buck Shot can be used in our Sporting Clay Choke Tubes. Steel shot larger than BB should not be used in any Sporting Clays Choke Tube tighter than Full Constriction. Our Sporting Clays Choke Tubes will throw tighter/denser patterns than Flush Mount Choke Tubes due to a longer parallel section.

All of the mags function perfect. The barrel is cold hammer forged and chrome lined. It says it is chambered for .223 Remington but will function (and actually is chambered in 5.56 NATO)as per Saiga.

This gun is not in working order and I would not advise the buyer to shoot it until it has been repaired. One of the problems with this gun is that when shooting the rounds don't always line up with the barrel also the barrel is loose. I think someone might be able to fix it and I know that will cost money so that is why I am selling it for only $30. It would also make a good display piece.

This is a beautiful rifle and ready for the long as your shtf weapon. The piston driven fire control is unarguably the most durable system around for AR type weapons. We today's political madness, you are going to need a platform that will last as parts will most likely be unavailable. I lived through Clintons first AR-Ban and it's no joke. Parts will be tough to come by. That's where this SR/AR will come into its own. This firearm is a one owner gun and has a brother that I am keeping. It was taken to the GA gun club 1 time for testing and put back in the safe. It's perfect..Buy while you still can and I put some info below.. The Ruger SR-556 comes equipped with a new, lightweight, adaptable handguard which provides multiple options for mounting optics and other accessories. This new, round handguard features a full-length Picatinny rail at the 12:00 position, which aligns with the rail on the flattop receiver. The handguard also accepts sections of rail or handguard covers, available at ShopRuger.com, which allow the user to configure the handguard to their exact requirements while minimizing size and weight. The two-stage piston operating system runs cooler and cleaner than gas driven rifles, and the multi-stage regulator allows the operator to tune the rifle to the specific ammunition. The cold hammer forged 41V45 barrel provides outstanding accuracy and longevity. The barrel is threaded 1/2-28 and is capped with the Ruger flash suppressor. The regulator, piston and piston bore are chrome plated, the transfer rod is nickel-Teflon coated, and the balance of the rifle is hard coat anodized or black oxide treated."

I live about 10 miles west of Jefferson City.It comes with five clips, and is chambered in .45 ACP. It has had around 500 rounds put through it, and has been well maintained. Comes with the original case, and documentation that came with it. It is everything  you would expect from any 1911.From the pistol's description:
The Taurus PT1911 is a clone of the US Military model 1911 single-action recoil operated semi-automatic pistol. It was designed and manufactured by Taurus in Porto Alegre Brazil, and distributed in the US by Taurus USA. Announced at the 2005 Shot Show, it was released to the consumer market in the fall of 2005.The PT1911 differs from its many competitors in the 1911-style market in that the basic model offers a package of features found on top-end models from more expensive semi-custom pistol manufacturers such as Springfield Armory, Para-Ordnance, and Kimber Manufacturing at a significantly lower cost.Featuring a forged steel frame and slide, the PT1911 was originally marketed with a blued carbon steel finish, but as of late 2007 a stainless steel version was released. The standard PT1911 is hand-fit in the Taurus factory and includes popular combat and competition custom features such as a ""Beavertail"" grip safety with memory groove, extended ambidextrous thumb safety and slide stop controls, lowered and flared ejection port, frame checkering, and other niceties unusual for a pistol of its price range.
Specifications:* length: 8 ½ in* width: 1 ½ in* height: 5.45 in* weight: 38 oz * trigger pull: 3–5 lb . 45 ACP caliber  5 in 1:16 twist, * 6 groove barrel * single action semi-automatic * trigger actuated ‘California spec’ firing pin, drop safety* 8 round detachable steel single-column magazine * blued carbon steel finish Price is $550 obo. I will meet a reasonable distance.

At the heart is a Douglas 18 inch SS 1:7 barrel purchased from the same lot used to build the Real MK12 at Crane Naval Special Warfare Center.  It is matched to a JP enterprises Precision lightweight bolt and bolt carrier which is Black Nitride coated. It is paired to a JP Silent capture spring system (I will include a JP spring tuning kit for buyer to customize recoil impulse to their liking) adjustThis combination is a sub MOA shooter out to 500yds with Black Hills Match 77gr (MK262 spec). The rifle is built on a used Rock River Arms match quality receiver set which has been cerakotes black and been custom trued where the receiver meets the barrel to ensure maximum accuracy. Rifle includes a mil-spec Buffer tube with LMT SOPMOD 6 position stock. The rifle is fitted with a JP Enterprises custom tunable single stage match trigger with a glassy break. Rifle is fitted with a BCM Gunfighter charging handle with medium latch and a Phase 5 tactical battery assist device which is one solid part, not an add on like the Magpul BAD lever.  Per MK12 Mod 0 spec, rifle for end is a 15 inch Gen 3 PRI carbon fiber tube with rail pieces for mounting lights, foregrip said, etc. The PRI tube and receivers are linked on top with an A.R.M.S. Full-length SWAN sleeve to allow a solid mating service for inline optics and laser designator  if needed. Barrel is finished with a MK12 specific OPS Inc. Mounted on that is the A.R.M.S. Low profile flip up back up sight, in line with the barrel mounted PRI flip up front sight.  Muzzle brake and collar which accept the Ops Inc suppressor designed for the MK12 rifle series.   Rifle is fitted with a very comfortable Larue precision rifle grip and Knight's Armament vertical foregrip. Included is a GG&G XDS bipod which adjusts from 8-13 inches, ideal for shootings from the prone. Bipod has 25 degrees of cant, 20 degrees of swivel, and can lock the legs in at 45 or 90 degrees for a variety of firing positions (this is the bipod recently selected by the US Army for all 5.56 weapon systems). The parts alone on this rifle would cost over $3000 to replicate, if you could source them all.  I have a pelican hard case with custom cut closed cell foam for this rifle for an additional $200 if interested (foam is cut to accommodate the MK12 correct Leupold optic - not included- when mounted to rifle and for a sling, multiple magazines, and sound suppressor as well as a small cleaning kit)Rifle has only 200rds through it as built (receiver set had appx 800 rds on it prior to being refinished) I'm leaving the country and cannot take it with me.

I have $715 in the build. He gave it a ""custom"" paint job, that doesn't look bad but hopefully that's more your thing than mine. He put 150 rounds thru it, and sold it back to me because he sucks with money. I would really like to trade it for a 9mm, particularly a Sig 320 or sig 250, a gen 4 17 or 19, or a springfield xdm. Open to trade offers, but I'll be fair with offers. If yours is really nice and I want it, I can throw in more mags or ammo, or if you have a nice cheaper pistol I will expect extra with it.

Solid, pear shaped bolt (not later hollow type) and fine line grooved receiver top. Strokes up correctly & holds. Very powerful and accurate. Blackened bronze pump tube & barrel still has about 90%+ original finish as well. Caliber is standard Sheridan 5mm (.20 Cal) and this vintage Blue Streak model is marked on right side of reciever with older, fine line inscription reading: ""Sheridan Products Inc."" ... ""Racine, Wisconsin"" ... ""Made In U.S.A"" of course, and probably dates from the late 1950s or early 1960s era. Condition is excellent still with NO cracks or dings and only some incidental wear. There were NO serial numbers on these early Sheridans, and the stock was built for adults (not youths) and this rifle measures about 37"" OAL. Other than the Model A & B Super-grades which immediately preceded these early Streaks, Sheridan never produced a more svelte & powerful pneumatic arm.  Missing one of these early Blue Streaks of this early style & configuration from your private collection or display? Well look no further 'cause this vintage, high quality Sheridan Blue Streak is the real deal, still in superb overall condition, for the astute buyer or collector. They haven't made 'em like this gorgeous example in well over half a Century, and they do not come onto the market in this condition often ... so it's really a no-brainer.I've seen them sell (not just listed) for over $200 online."

It comes with all factory hardware needed to install that was included with it from the factory.  This rail was only used on a display rifle indoors and never saw outdoor use.  Installation screws show remnants of the factory loctite as can be expected. This is a perfect lightweight option to extend the notoriously short Scar rail while still being able to keep the factory front sight attached. It drops the top rail down in front of the sight for attachment of a laser aiming device or light that will not interfere with the sight plane of the flip up fron sight. These retail for $200. This is offered at a substantial discount. Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Bore is so shiny it looks new. A few light scratches and a ding or two. I have taken this revolver apart for inspection of all moving parts, frame etc. Little to no wear inside with no issues. Original grips with the right grip having  chip out of the corner. This is a c&r so I do not require a transfer.
