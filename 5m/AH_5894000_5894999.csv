It's super affordable and has always gotten the job done. I have never had a FTF, misfeed, or even a stovepipe. It has only shot 115gr target ammo - always brass. It comes to the range with me all the time, but the last couple times I barely took it out because I was busy plinking with my 22 and getting much needed practice in with my smaller edc sub compacts (this was my edc for a couple months). It maybe, on the high end, has 400 rounds through it. Its a good training gun - a good size in between the ultra tiny concealables out there and full size range guns. It's the first gun I let my mom shoot when we went shooting together, same with my girlfriend, and a couple other newbies. Firearm had always been cleaned and lubed after taking it shooting, except the last two times where less than two mags were ran through it each range trip.Asking $275 OBO. No taxes or CC fees.

I warmed it up off hand with some XM193 using the Noveske branded Troy manufactured iron sights and then mounted a Leupold scope and dialed it in on the bench with some Black Hills MK 262 Mod 1. These stainless Noveske barrels really love the heavier grain Black Hills 556. I'm the original owner and even had the privilege to cut the factory seals on the new box before I took possession of it from my local gun shop. This is not a chain saw build or frankenAR. This is a factory gun! Moving along, you get all the typical goodies included that Noveske fans expect in the box like the scorpion sucker, the hat, 1 30 rd. Pmag, chamber flag, and a numbers matching barrel to gun signed Noveske certificate of authenticity. I have not changed or modified anything on this weapon. It is exactly how it came from Noveske. Cosmetically it's in 99.9% condition and 100% mechanically. It's not even broken in yet. Now for the pot sweetning extras. I'm offering extra with the gun two open Johnny memorial Magpul Pmags (thats three 30rd mags) and 4 NSR keymods (for all your mall ninja mounting needs) in varrying lengths two 9 slot and two 4 slot and plenty of the plastic NSR snap in panel covers if you choose to use them.

The CMR-206 Rail Master® is compact, yet powerful, universal green laser sight designed to fit rail-equipped pistols, rifles and shotguns. The laser sight fits onto virtually any firearm with a modern (M1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style) accessory rail. Ambidextrous control tabs allow the user to instantly activate or deactivate the laser.

The CMR-206 Rail Master boasts 2 hours of (constant) run time on a single 1/3N Lithium battery, and features a 5 minute auto shut-off for power conservation.
The CMR-206 offers 3 modes of operation: Momentary, Strobe, and Constant-On. This allows the user to easily set their mode based on personal need or preference. The unit is quickly and easily user-installed in moments and can be painlessly transferred from firearm to firearm. The CMR-206 is securely fastened using Crimson Trace's Secure Lock Technology (SLT™).

As a matter of fact, the XTR-12 is a short-stroke piston-driven gas-operated shotgun and comes with a rotating bolt head and six locking lugs; the XTR-12 bolt is indeed an AR-10 type bolt beefed up in size for the 12-gauge shotshells. Feeding through single-column detachable magazines holding two, five or seven 12-gauge shotshells with a 76mm/3"" (""Magnum"") case, the UTAS XTR-12 semi-automatic shotgun comes with a 18,5"" long 4140 stainless steel machined barrel adapted to use several types of chokes; the bolt is manufactured of the same 4140 stainless steel, while the structure is manufactured out of lightweight aluminum alloy and magnesium, in order to keep the weight under acceptable levels. The UTAS International XTR-12 semi-automatic shotgun comes with an M4-type ergonomic pistol grip and a five-positions collapsing polymer stock, and strips in two receivers just like an AR-15; its total lenght ranges between 96,5cm and more or less 1 metre, depending from the stock extension. The XTR-12 is 3,6 kilograms long and sports fully ambidextrous controls and several MIL-STD-1913 ""Picatinny"" rails for several types of aiming devices or tactical accessories. There's no word yet concerning availability or pricing.    Manufacturer: UTAS Model: XTR-12 Action: Semi-automatic Caliber: 12Ga   Barrel Length: 18.5"" Finish/Color: Black/FDE Grips/Stock: 5 Position Collapsible Capacity: 7Rd Manufacturer Part #: XTR12FD1"

M91/30 Tula Arsenal Mosin-Nagant made in 1939. She was bought as a sporter and further modified by me and some friends. Gun has had a front sight from an M1 Carbine fitted onto the barrel along with an M1 Carbine conical flash hider similar to the kind used in Korea welded on. Weld could be prettier but its sound and I've put at least a hundred rounds downrange after this modification. The idea behind the project was to affix a pistol grip, folding stock, and scout scope to it and use the M1 sights as backup, they perfectly line up with the Mosin's rear sight but I'm not going to lie, at some angles it can be hard to see over the cone. Rifle does shoot high but rifling is good.The stock is original and very dinged up, very large gash towards the end of the barrel which was covered up with electrical tape, the idea was to make the rifle look like something out of ""Mad Max"" and in combination with the battle worn stock and tape, it looks very weathered. I simply don't have the time or money to finish this project so I'm selling it.Hoping she finds a new home with an owner who will continue work on ""Mad Maxing"" her and accurizing her or take the gun in a different direction.I understand that the modifications may not be to everyone's taste, accordingly asking for $120 OBO"

I purchased it new for 325 and added on allot of accessories along the way. The gun brings the original box as well as the manual, pouch, and approximately 60 rounds of ammo.It has a mounted TR1 laser from ArmaLaser that cost me 130. What makes the laser unique is the true touch activation, which means that there is a sensor built in it, so when you go to grab the pistol, the laser is already armed. No fumbling for switches or anything. The laser does have a master kill switch, so you can keep the laser off when needed. The laser is designed and assembled in florida as well.I purchased a grip extension for the standard magazine for about ten dollars.I also installed an ambidextrious belt clip that acts as a holster. It can be installed for lefties or right handed people. The maker is Techna Clip, and it cost me a little over 30 dollars.Also included is the extended magazine that holds ten rounds instead of the standard seven rounds. I paid 25 dollars for it.All together I spent at least 520 on the pistol itself, not to mention the box of ammo and an extra battery for the laser. I've fired maybe 140 rounds on this pistol and its been vey reliable. It has been well maintained.I have 20 pictures, but the site only allows me to upload 3Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have"
