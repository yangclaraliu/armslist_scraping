Rapid response, maneuverability, and enhanced firepower play a major part in joint and coalition operations in modern warfare. Colt’s M4 Commando carbines epitomize modern warfare’s emphasis on “Get In and Get Out”. They were both designed to exploit firepower capability in confined spaces where lightweight mobility, speed and violence of action rule. The Commando can be comfortably carried with its 11.5” barrel, yet be instantly available to provide the type of firepower required to outmatch combatants. Because it provides full 5.56mm power and accuracy in a very compact sub-machine gun size weapon, the Commando is often chosen over smaller less powerful sub-machine guns. Regardless of the application, the Colt M4 Commando provides the superior qualities that will enable operators to accomplish an increasingly wide range of combat missions.serious buyer only."

They not only sent me a brand-new gun of my choosing, they installed factory Glock MH3 night sights for me as a surprise upgrade (case shows GNS on the label.).This Glock has only been fired at a gun range and was never carried or holstered. It is in excellent condition, having only two boxes of fifty round factory ammunition through it. Not a single failure to feed or fire and the shots downrange were right on target. Once I was satisfied with its performance, I cleaned, lightly lubed the recommended areas inside the gun, and applied a fine coat of protection to the exterior of the gun before safely storing it in a protective gun-friendly environment.This Glock has a great feel to it, is extremely accurate, and would make an exceptional carry and conceal or home protection pistol. This Gen 4 Glock 26 comes with factory installed night sights, three 10-round magazines, Glock protective case, modular back straps, lock, brush, tools, and paperwork.The Glock 26 Gen4 9mm pistol introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""baby Glock""—the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."

Comes with two magazines, case, and I should have the original box. It really is a remarkably thin gun, feels pretty good in my hand with the magazine with the baseplate extension on it. The other magazine only allows a finger and a half grip but absolutely disappears in your pocket. Sticky holster gets caught on the sights when you draw so I'm not enamored with that. I do love how it makes the weight of the gun vanish when carried IWB.$300/bo with everything, or if you don't want the ammo we can work something out.  Trade for a shotgun, or an AR upper or parts. Or maybe another pistol. Just ask.  You are responsible for xfer fees."

Features an engraved Ruger logo and patented latch that is flush with the trigger guard to avoid accidental dumping of cartridges.    Three-position safety is easily accessible and allows the shooter to lock the bolt or to load and unload the rifle with the safety engaged.    Cold hammer-forged barrel results in ultra-precise rifling that provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning.    Shallow ""express-style"" windage adjustable ""V"" notch rear sight and large white bead front sight for instant target acquisition.    Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver, provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field (scope rings included).    Rugged Green Mountain laminate stock is dimensionally stable through environmental extremes, features a soft rubber buttpad with buttpad spacers that allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters or varying levels of outerwear (three 1/2"" spacers included) and wrap-around checkering that provides a sure grip in any weather.    Also includes - rugged one-piece, stainless steel bolt; barrel band mounted swivel stud; optional forend swivel stud.    The Ruger® Muzzle Brake System includes a removable, radial-port muzzle brake that significantly reduces felt recoil. For times when the brake is not preferred, it may be replaced by the included dynamically-matched muzzle weight. Switching between the brake and the weight will not change the bullet's point of impact for a particular load.

I brought this beautiful revolver a few months ago because I couldn't afford a Colt Python which was/is my dream gun. My intention was to never fired it as I wasn't going to fire the Colt and let it be a collection item. So, I finally went out to shoot it and it was freaking AWESOME! I swear it's more accurate than my glock and any weapon I've shot in the military. So, I get home and I clean it, I'm cleaning, cleaning, cleaning all freakin night to get it back to it's beautiness. Guess you wondering why I'm stressing how beautiful it is. Well, let me give you the facts that I failed to mentioned earlier. I brought this revolver brand new on a Saturday at a place to shoot,,, and need I mention that I didn't even fire it that day cause I was zeroing in my glock that day. Anyways, brought it that Saturday,, the following Monday I dropped it off at Nagels to have it polished and trigger work done. Two weeks go by and the gunsmith had only completed smoothing the trigger out and some of the polish job. So, since it took so long I decided to go ahead and take it off their hands. So, it was really clean,, until you shoot it and the gunpowder ruins it. Honestly, I shot it 3 times and I've gotten tired of cleaning it,,, plus I've gotten into a new hobby which don't allow me time at the shooting range anymore. So, getting rid of all my guns starting with the one's I can do without 1st. Comes with original box, paperwork, speed loader, original rubber Rouge grip, classic wood grip and its super sweet, and a Galco combat black holster which is hard as heck to find for this weapon. Oh yeah, try finding a holster for S&W 686+ 4'in. I been to every gun show in San antonio trying find one, absoluty no luck. So, ordered one on back order which took 2 long months to be shiped. Asking $700 but will accept a fair and reasonable offer."

Mint condition. New, reduced price!Pistol is in its original box, with an extra 13-round magazine, manual, and cleaning rod. All original parts included. Factory walnut grips, fixed sights, and the rare vented rib. Made in Hungary by FEG. After the original Browning patents for the Browning Hi-Power (BHP) expired, the Hungarian conglomerate of FÉG developed one of the most faithful versions of the Browning design ever made in quantity outside the FN factories in Belgium and Portugal. The BHP and the FP9 are so similar that many parts are interchangeable between them, including the magazines. So, like the BHP, the Fp9 is a single action pistol. This pistol feels great in the hand – exactly like my 1981 BHP - and has a similar trigger pull. Note: the non-vented rib version of this pistol was exported as PJK-9HP/P9M models. For FTF sale in VA, buyer must be 21+ years of age and have (1) a VA driver’s license, and (2) one of the following: a concealed carry permit, LEO ID, or a copy of VA gun store invoice in buyer’s name in last year.

The chevron reticle of the Trijicon Riflescope is designed to be zeroed using the tip at 100 meters. The width of the chevron at the base is 5.53 MOA which is 19"" at 300 meters. This allows range estimation for silhouette targets. Trijicon TA55 5.5 x 50mm ACOG Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights hit fast in any light. Trijicon ACOG 5.5 x 50 Riflescopes are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. Trijicon 5.5x50 ACOGs combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Although Trijicon ACOG 5.5 x 50mm Rifle Scopes TA-55 have many features which are very advantageous for military use, they were developed by Trijicon without government funding. Designed for use with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions - without failure-prone batteries.
