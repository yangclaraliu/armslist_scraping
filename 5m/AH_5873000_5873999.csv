This police package comes to us from an estate sale.
The revolver is a Smith & Wesson Model blued 10-5 that shows ""character"" and wears it with pride! This was the everyday carry weapon for this police officer until his retirement many years ago. Bore and cylinder are clean and everything feels tight. The rear sights and front ramp have white paint lightly dabbed on for the ""old school"" edition of fiber optic sights we have today.
The revolver has lots of holster wear and some light freckling in a few spots, but I think it is in better aesthetic condition than I would have expected from a career long everyday use and carry gun. The grips closely resemble custom-made dark walnut Bull's-eye target thumb rest grips. There is some wear in a couple of areas, primarily on the inside corners where they rubbed while in the holster.
My experience with Model 10-5 revolvers is that they are really fine shooters with nice triggers. I took this one out to the gun range tonight thinking I would shoot the handful of loose .38 caliber I had in a range bag just to make sure it fired okay. That was just a tease, as I ended up shooting that handful and a box of 50 Remington factory ammunition. It is a really good shooting gun with a nice trigger and the custom grips made for a really comfortable hold and lack of felt recoil.
The holster is a Jay-Pee Spring Lock Safety Swivel Holster that features a trigger guard click retention button to keep the pistol securely inside the holster until it can easily be removed with a push of the finger as you draw the pistol. It also has space on the belt to hold a dozen .38 Special bullets.
The belt is a Bianchi 42 with adjustable sizing and quick connection prongs.
This is a really cool police package that will easily take you back in time to when this officer carried his gun with this belt and holster.Contact me for additional pictures.

210,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5873210,For Sale/Trade:  Leupold VX-6 Firedot CDS 2-12x42mm,"Myrtle Beach, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina",$ 775,"Listed On: Thursday, January 19, 2017",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Assume that this scope is available for sell if you see this listing.  If just getting a response asking if scope is still available I'll just assume the response is fishing for e-mail addresses.  Ask a legitimate question if responding, thanks.  This is a new, still sealed in the box, Leupold model 111979 VX-6 2-12x42mm scope with the Firedot Duplex reticle and the (CDS) custom dial system.  This is a 30mm tube scope that has 70 MOA of internal adjustment and comes with elevation and windage adjustment dials marked in true ¼ MOA, not ¼” @ 100 yard adjustments. Leupold will give you one free customized dial when you contact them with your specific rifle cartridge information. They'll send you a custom made elevation turret dial that is marked in yardage that will allow you to very accurately dial in for bullet drop compensation of your specific bullet trajectory drop.  This is a much more accurate method than using BDC style reticles and has a much less cluttered \ confusing view through the scope as well.  BDC reticles are built using an averaging method of various rifle bullet velocities and ballistic coefficients so they may get you close to target out at range but are far from ideal to really depend on for bullet drop corrections. I have played with these VX-6 scopes enough to fully trust their adjustments. I have all my VX-6 scoped rifles zeroed in at 100 yards and have played with them out to 530 yards so far and every time the adjustments are right on at various ranges out to 530 yards. They all return my point of impact back to 100 yards when dialing the turret back to its zero mark. 530 yards just happens to be the max distance I have available to me to shoot but I sure wish I had access to a longer range.   More dials can be ordered through Leupold for this scope at any time in case you wanted to use different loadings for your rifle later on or even use the scope on a totally different rifle and caliber.  The Firedot on these scopes is awesome in low light or during day time use. When the scope is set to 2X magnification it can be used as a red dot optic for quick target acquisition. On 2X it has enough field of view I can see the last couple inches of my 22” rifle barrel that it’s mounted on.  I have a 1-6x24mm VX-6 mounted on a 16” AR and I can see the whole flash suppressor when it’s set on 1X.

I bought my first VX-6 Firedot a year ago and liked it so much I ended up buying 4 more recently to re-scope all my rifles with but after thinking about it I've decided to not re-scope one of my rifles that I rarely shoot so I'm offering this brand new scope up for sell at a discount to someone wanting a top end optic for their favorite hunting, target or AR rifle.  Look around, check prices and reviews of these scopes and you'll see this is a very fair deal for this top end optic.

I have been swamped with trade offers for this scope so unless you have SPECIFICALLY one of the firearms that I've listed below as being interested in then don’t make trade offers. If you still feel so inclined to make a trade offer with something other than what’s listed then be willing to part with your item at a bargain price and include what that price is so I can consider; otherwise I will not waist time with responding. Thanks

Comes with IWI cleaning kit and (1) 20 round magazine and (1) 25 round magazine. From the factory:The UZI PRO pistol is a modernized Micro UZI semi-auto pistol based on the world famous UZI sub-machinegun, variations of which have sold in excess of 2,000,000 units worldwide. The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location. Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel. Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms: Manual thumb safety, Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firing Firing pin block. Each UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round in states that permit these magazine capacities. Fully adjustable front and rear sights are standard."

I bought this a few years ago from a family member who purchased it brand new in the late 90's. From what I understand this model was only made for one year and this pistol appears to have a low serial #. (THIS IS NOT THE POCKETLITE MODEL). This is the all Stainless Steel Pony. There's not a lot of info out ""there"" on this gun but I have seen them go from $600-1,000 on other auction sites and Colt forums. This model seems to be pretty rare as you mostly see the pocketlite or the steel Mustangs. My uncle shot this gun maybe 200 or so times and then it sat in his safe for about 15 years.  Then I bought it and put one box of ammo through it (50 rounds) and it too has sat in my safe for about 3 years. I want to trade this gun for a 1911. No imports. I am open to any size but prefer the larger guns as I do not carry. I am not big on the whole "".380"" caliber and really don't enjoy shooting compact pistols. I am sure there is someone out there that can give this a better home than me!"

I just decided to go with a different site on my AR.
EOTech is one of the most trusted manufacturer of military and civilian weapon sights and accessories, and the  is the perfect example of why. The HHS II combines the popular EXPS2 with the innovative G33 3X magnifier and Switch-To-Side mount. Both of these units work seamlessly together and offer quick-detach, locking mounts. The EXPS2 is among the most compact units available requiring minimal rail mounting space. When combined with the G33 magnifier the entire HHS II units measure a mere 8.1"" and requires only 2.75"" of rail space for mounting. When faced with variable situations the HHS II is the ideal choice with the ability to quickly switch from 1x to 3x with the flip of a finger. The G33 is held in place with a strong detent that maintains its perfect alignment with the EXPS2, and hold the unit out of the operator's way in CQB situations. Perfect for any situation, the HHS II offers 20 illumination intensities, anti-glare coatings with high light gathering capability, true holographic transmission for a parallax free optic that features a true heads-up display for shooting with both eyes open. The only thing that will outlast the 600 hour battery life is the EOTech Limited Lifetime Warranty."
