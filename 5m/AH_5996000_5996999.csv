A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

This firearm ideally should be in a museum or on public display, but has managed to remain in private collections since 1957. I am only selling it to fund more urgent projects.Historically speaking, the gun is priceless, but I am open to cash and trade offers.The gun: A model 1853/67 French military 'Tabatiere' breach-loading rifle converted by the Belgians in the 1870s to a 10 gage shotgun and exported to the US, marketed to budget conscious homesteaders and pioneers under the ""hunter"" model designation which is stamped on the barrel forward of the breech. These firearms are sometimes refered to as ""Zulu"" shotguns.The history: This firearm belonged to Irish immigrant Thomas E. McGovern Sr. who was a placer miner turned pioneer stockman who settled a 500 acre ranch in 1880 at the head of Flathead lake along with his son Thomas McGovern Jr. a full 11 years before Kalispell was plotted as a townsite. McGovern brought the rifle with him to the Flathead when he settled there. In the late 1890s, John O'Brien of the O'Brien Lumber Company was sent by tycoon James H. Hill of the Great Northern Railroad, to build a lumber mill at the head of Flathead lake to supply the railroad with ties for the westward expansion of the railway. McGovern sold 350 acres of his homestead ranch to O'Brien for the sum of $10,000, and O'Brien proceeded to build the mill along McGovern Bay, which was later renamed Somers Bay after the company town of Somers O'Brien would establish there. Upon his death in 1898, McGovern's son Tom Jr. resettled in the newly established town of Kalispell where he built several rental properties along with a house for his family on 2nd Ave. which is presently on the National Historic Registery as the Mcgovern/Karcher house. At some point, fellow Irish immigrant and amateur historian Samuel E. Johns of Johns Hardware in Kalispel, acquired the McGovern rifle which he displayed in his store along with hundreds of other firearms belonging to other noteworthy settlers and pioneers. After Johns passed away in 1945, his son donated the historical firearm collection to the Montana Historical Society Museum in Helena along with his pioneer journals which became the Sam E. Johns Collection. McGovern's rifle has the characteristic Johns catalogue tag affixed which in addition to identifying it as belonging to McGovern, states that it was loaned out from the Johns collection in 1957, two full years before MHS received the balance of the collection. To whom the rifle was loaned in 1957 is unknown, but at some point it was given away in compensation for some work done for which the individual in posession of it could not pay. The rifle remained with a single family as an heirloom and was passed down from father to son (from whom I purchased the gun). I have done thorough research on the history of the gun and have all the relevant provenance paperwork attesting to the guns lineage including a sworn affidavit as well as photos, copies of historical documents and my coorespondence with the Montana Historical Society.The details: I'm interested in selling the firearm to the right collector or trading for other firearms. The price and trade value is negotiable. The rifle comes with the pictured wall mount and all the provenance paperwork and documentation."

New quiver, new scope(same brand, better quality), limb and string silencers, (4) custom 14"" bolts with Lumenoks, (10) or so Quill bolts(one unopened pack), 150 grn Slick Trick broadheads, fitted soft case, extra string, string changing tool, cocking rope, arrow puller, string wax, rail lube, you name it I bought it.
