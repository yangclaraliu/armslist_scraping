$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, probably a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price, please do not offer less as you will not get a response.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.

This gun was developed by Mack Gwinn in the early 1970's and I believe it was Bushmasters first gun ever produced. It is the original logo of Bushmaster with the snake above it. The gun is small enough to fit into a saddle bag of a bike. Quite a defense weapon if SHTF. It also can be fitted with a laser which made it quite deadly accurate. This gun is 40 plus years old and is not in great condition by any means so price is reflecting that. I will leave it original until I walk the show this weekend, if it don't move I'm gonna have it cerecoated black. P.S. There is another one of these on Armslist Colorado in great condition for $2,250.00."

For those who don't know, these are great little guns and were used by foreign police agencies for many years. They are easy to conceal and are still very accurate thanks to the fixed barrel design. Chambered in 9x18mm basically right in between a 380 acp and standard 9mm. Ammo is easy to obtain both online and in local stores around stl. This pistol is very reliable, accurate, easy to conceal, easy to take apart/clean. Comes with one 8 round magazine but others can still be purchased.  It has a decocker/safety so can be shot in both single and doible action. Also I have two bags full of parts for this gun, an extra slide, grips, springs, trigger, pins, pretty much everything you need to build a second makarov minus a frame. This will not last long at this price they normally fetch much more and do not come with any extra stuff. $250 obo let's get it a new home!=) Any questions, need more pics? Just ask"

Please check my other listings. Can call / text me at 314 nine74 8051 or email. First come first served, would like to sell today if possible.  Any questions or want more pics just ask. This is a Yugo m24/47 8mm mauser rifle. It is in good condition for its age and is an absolute fantastic shooter. The bolt cycles very smoth and it has no problem with a variety of ammo from the cheap surplus stuff to the new match grade ammo. For those who don't know the 8mm mauser is basically the European 30-06, ammo is very easy to obtain and the rifle is very powerful. I have shot both deer and hogs with it.  I had a mojo peep sight professionally installed in the rear and I painted the front sight. This was an awesome upgrade and is now very easy to get on target. I can shoot 4"" groups at 100 yards with it. Makes an awesome hunting gun, or just a peice of history to shoot every now and then. I will include some loose rounds of match grade 8mm as well. This rifle won't last long at this price, they normally fetch more but I need the cash. $225 let's get this a new home=)"

All Springfield Armory® XD®’s have several features that make the XD® easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator let you know without a doubt, by touch and by feel, whether or not the pistol is loaded and cocked. The grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, and the firing pin block safety combine to prevent accidental discharges.

The other items have to be bought with the gun. So Gun  = $525 + Scope $125 +ammo $100 + holster $25 = $775 for total package. I really dont want to break up the set.  But I have got a few responses just wanting the gun. So if anyone else wants the scope, ammo or holster. let me know. I may  break them up that way. Thanks. And if you reload, I have about 200 - 44 mag shell casings you can have. . I'm selling becasue I never use it. I am not looking to trade For any rifles or shotguns. I will trades for great to escellent condition Sig 226 or 229 and I will consider a Glock 20 or 40.  *** please don't waste my time with low ball offers.  If you have an interest in this gun, please reference what the gun is and tell me anything about how you would like to carry out the transaction. If you just ask ""you still got it?"", I won't respond.*** Please have a valid SC Conceal carry permit. Or SC drivers license."

They are made from Phenolic G10. G10 is only 1/2 the weight of aluminum but nearly as strong with a grippier texture. G10 won't crack or shatter, like the cheaper polymer and acrylic grips are known to do. The color is dyed into the material, so scratches aren't an issue.

The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. Magpul® flip-up sights included. The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or Credit Card.

Ever wanted to rebarrel an AR10-style rifle without changing uppers? It’s a possibility that exists with the Lewis Machine & Tool MRP (Monolithic Rail Platform). Conceivably one could go from a CQB (close quarter battle) carbine to a short barrel rifle to a special purpose rifle by changing only a barrel. A designated marksman needs different optics than someone engaging in room combat, but it’s still easier to tote than three different uppers."
