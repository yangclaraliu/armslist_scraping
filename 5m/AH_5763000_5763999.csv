In most cases in the US, just the sight of a gun will normally prevent someone from advancing on you. But if you fired a shot in the air most will take off in the other direction. If it comes down to aiming and shooting this thing will release a powerful cloud of pepper gas that will disable a attacker for at least 15 mins. The sound of one of these is the same as a real 9mm being fired. Other countries with strict gun laws have effectively used blank guns for self defense for years. I have used one in a very real situation recently so I can say without a doubt that it's extremely effective. I have a few different guns to choose from so prices will vary. Depending on the gun you want you will receive between 7-12 pepper gas blank rounds. Please check your local and state laws on blank guns and pepper spray. These guns are not classified as a firearm because they cannot fire or be converted to fire real ammo. By law I have to ship it with a orange tip on the front.
