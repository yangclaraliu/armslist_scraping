This is by far the most accurate handgun I have ever shot. I can shoot a full mag into a 8.5 x 11"" paper target at 50 yards, my friend shoots with this gun a full mag within a 6"" circle at 50 yards. (He is 11 years younger than me.) He has never been able to do that with his H&K. Eats any ammo, never jams and never had any extraction or ejection issues. It hits what you aim at every time, reliably. Fast on target with the Novak sights and because of the tame recoil and muzzle-flip it is just as fast on follow-up shots. This gun outshoots any $3,000 big brand name 1911.A small fortune was spent on this 1911 to make it as close to perfect as possible: See the list below.Barrel Length - 5""Frame/Material - SteelCaliber - 45 ACP2.5-lbs Upgraded Trigger Sights - Novak Target SightsGrips/Stock - Hogue Grips2-piece Stainless Steel Guide Rod and Spring SetPolished Feed RampLowered and Flared Ejection PortExtended Beavertail for maximum comfort & safety Combat Hammer, Skeletonized Trigger and magwellAmbidextrous SafetyAn awful lot of work of meticulous hand-fittingComes with 1 factory and 2 Stainless Steel Kimber magazines, a magazine loader, factory box and instruction manual.I am looking for either the best cash offer or will consider a trade for: 1.

Let me know what you have.Prefer local, in-person transaction but will ship if the conditions are right. Will only sell through an FFL.A note to those who intend to send a low-ball offer: If you are looking for a cheap 1911, this is not it. I recommend that you read all the above again. This gun is easily worth 3+ standard Glocks or a couple of Sigs or H&Ks."

My other G19 Gen 3 is the 'TALO' Boron slide finish model, and is one of the most accurate CCW guns I have ever carried for my personal protection, but it isn't for sale, so don't ask.Most people don't know, but the G19 Gen 3's are still the most sought after 9 mm pistol by professionals, and ones in the know about CCW guns.Why is that you might ask? Because the Glock 19 Gen 3 model has a track record, and was sold by the 10's of millions world wide. They have also consumed 100's of millions of rounds through them, and have probably the best reliability record in existence, for when you pull the trigger they go “bang.” The Gen 3 also has a thicker polymer frame than the Gen 4. Glock hollowed out some of the polymer frame, to make room for the double spring that was un-necessary, for an already easy shooting pistol. Unless you need the ambidextrous mag release, there is no reason to go to a Gen 4.I'm looking to trade up with “Boot” for a DA/SA 9mm compact pistol with a hammer.I have a special need for one of these. I like the HK P30SK DA/SA V3 9mm and/or a SIG P224 DA/SA 9mm. Looking for one in LNIB condition.If you want to make a CASH offer for my gun, the magic number is $495. Just not interested in selling a New G19 Gen3 for anything less. Will ship to your FFL dealer as long as it is legal for your state to have high capacity mags."

Box is somewhat roached, but it is there which is rare. Comes with 12 original crosman 25' targets. What I assume is an original tin of crosman pellets. 1 box of what I assume are original crossman CO2 cartridges - one short and surface rust on the cartridges as pictured. Does NOT have the bell ringing target. Has the original crosman product booklet with different guns and tips for target shooting;in good condition showing wear/age; kind of wavy so possible light water damaged. Comes with the original dated Nov. 1, 1958 Crosman authorized repair station booklet stained with part of the paper from the shooting manual for the gun - light waster damage and the manual for using this gun, again, light water damage.Gun itself is heavy and appears very well made. Has some very light spotty surface rust on the screw thing in the front - in the ridges. Has a scuff on the gun under the sight and opposite the area where you load the pellet showing the gun was used. A little paint lost at the bottom edge of the trigger guard. A chip of paint/rough area (does not look like its dented) on the bottom of the barrel near the front; about a 1/8"" overall diameter. Very light and spotty surface rust area. All the surface stuff should clean up with a good oilingGun is in remarkably good condition for a used crosman pellet gun of this age. This is not a common model, and not one that is common with the box. Gun is untested. Sold as you see it pictured. Unfortuately, 3 pictures is simply not enough for an item like this, but it is all that I have.This item condition is overall very good condition; Gun is very nice antique condition requiring minor clean-up and oiling, untested firing. Papers; good condition with water damage issues. Box sketchy, but there, one fold on side torn, faded and worn with edge wear. Tin of pellet; very good condition. Targets; Very good condition.

This version is much more desirable. Also note: I will consider trades if they are in my favor, but preference is given to cash offers.

It comes with the 1 mag supplied by the factory and 4 other brand new steel mags.  2 the same as Kimber and 2 mec-gars.  Also added the fantastic blue and silver grips. Their richness needs to be seen also and matches the gun perfectly.  They are thicker than factory grips and make it feel more like a rounded double stack.  Factory grips are also here and adding a nice blue knife to go with it. $1900.00 in this but only asking $1300.00. I will sell just the gun with factory grips for $1200.00. No extra mags, grip or knife.  Not a mark on this. Not looking for trades and will not ship.  Mike REDACTED."

Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement of conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. Using the HK- proprietary gas piston system found on the HK416 and G36, the MR556A1 does not introduce propellant gases and carbon fouling back into the rifle's interior, making it the most reliable of any AR-type firearm. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. This handguard system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR rifles. The HK rail system can be installed and removed without tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR566A1 will be produced in the USA from both American and German-made components. Additionally, subassemblies like the MR556A1's upper receiver will be fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this manufacturing process, producing a long life barrel that provides superior performance with minimal degradation of accuracy and muzzle velocity after prolonged use."

01 Crimson Trace CMR-204 = $350
