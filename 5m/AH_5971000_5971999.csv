Rifle comes new in the factory box with (2) 30 round magazines. From Kel-Tec: The Kel-Tec CMR-30 Rifle is chambered for the .22WMR cartridge (22 Magnum). The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16” barrel is threaded 1/2”-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7” with the stock collapsed, and 30.6” when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides. The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. Magpul® flip-up sights included. The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle.

Perfect condition LNIB. Great 5"" inch barrel edition of the Navy Seal 1911 Commemorative model. It is a numbered edition one of 500 manufactured. The DLC coating on the slide means virtually indestructible quality with a black mirror like finish, very sharp. With Ruger reliability and the advantages of the series 70, this gun is not only a looker, but can be used with no fear of damage at the range, or carry. Has been fired, very low round count and cleaned and in my safe afterward. Will come as shown with retail box and all paperwork. 2 of the 7 round flush mags and 1 of the 8 round extended mags with extension. All 3 mags are genuine Ruger.  The Magpul grips are installed for ease of carry and range use. Of course the wooden grips shown are included along with barrel wrench etc. Price new was $1249.00 without the grips, so I think the price is pretty good. This gun is comparable to the TALO Edition in upgrades from their standard manufacture guns. Check out the reviews and compare, you will see the reliability and functionality of this weapon. this is not a cheap gun by any means."

They are a Veteran owned company that produces high end AR's that are 100% US made parts and are made 100% here in the USA. This is an easier side charging carbine which makes this one especially well suited for practical/tactical and home defense. Instead of the standard ""T"" shaped charging handle, this one is charged from the side with your non shooting hand, so that you never even have to shift your grip. The charging side handle is also reversible so that you can easily move it to the other side in case your are left handed. The bolt release is a factory installed ""Phase 5"" extended bolt release so that you can release the bolt with your trigger finger also without shifting your grip. The trigger is milspec.
All of the furniture is factory installed ""B5 Systems"" Flat Dark Earth. The slim handguard has keymod cuts so you can mount anything you want on it. The trigger guard is extended so that you can easily fit gloved fingers in there. The barrel is 5.56 Nato spec 16"" M4 Profile 1/7 twist chrome lined. It is chambered in 5.56 so you can also shoot 223. The flash hider is A2 milspec. I watched several videos on these rifles and they said that these rifles digest anything you feed them including cheap steel ammo which is why I bought it in case the ""poop hits the fan"" and you can only find cheap ammo. It will come with the factory included new in wrapper ""C-Products"" magazine, owner's manual, lock, and box.
I purchased this brand new from Academy a year to a year and a half ago to shoot carbine matches with and I never did. It is just taking up space in my safe so I am looking to either sell or trade it. I paid about 1200 dollars for it not including tax and would take $1000 for it. I would trade even for an Arsenal AK preferably in 5.45x39 but would consider 7.62x39. I would also trade for a Stainless 7.5"" original Vaquero (not the new Vaquero) in 45 Colt plus cash, or a Smith 460 XVR. I also like Colt M4 Carbine le6920's.

The plates are AR500 with anti spalling coating on them. They are curved in order to fit the shooter comfortably. It comes with 2 double M4 mag pouches, 2 pistol mag pouches and a chest holster for a handgun. I am selling it because it is too big for me. Apparently is size M-XL but I feel like its more of a L-XL. (I might just not be as swole as I thought though)It was bought for 450 2 months ago so Ill let it go for 300. Everything still has the tags attached to it. If you message me about trades I wont even respond. Honest opinion- Very good protection (steel is stronger than ceramic) and steel is lower profile. Steel is a little heavier than ceramic though. Ceramic plates on the private market tend to be about twice as expensive. Come try it on for yourself, im flexible with my time. Use google and feel free to ask me questions about it. This is what the plate carrier looks like (minus all the pouches)REDACTED"

It was ordered from Classic Firearms, came smothered in cosmoline and was cleaned very well and then lubed and stored. As you can see from the pictures there isn't a spot of rust on this rifle, the rifling is both bright and deep, the stock is a pre-war with a few dowel repairs but in excellent shape (very common) and the bluing is (in my opinion) 95-100%. Sights are sharp with no dings, bolt operates smoothly and locks up/releases flawlessly, cycles rounds very smoothly and ejects effectively several yards away consistently. There is one very minor issue with this rifle, if you would even call it that. On the sling attachment on the stock one of the screws was missing when it arrived from the factory. I've not replaced it because frankly I don't care about a screw and I don't have a sling on it anyway but if you wished to replace the missing screw it would be a nickel at a hardward store unless you ordered an original. I ordered an original leather sling with the rifle when it was purchased and assuming I can remember where it is it will be included in the sale/trade of the rifle. Also included will be a ton of stripper clips (20-30) and roughly 35-40 rounds of Silver Bear 203gr SP hunting ammo that I had planned to shoot but haven't had the time. Valued at $400 sale and trade and am willing to negotiate. Rifle was $384 shipped and I've invested a small amount in the original sling, stripper clips, ammo and general labor getting it as clean as it is therefore I feel that my asking price is fair. If you wish for more pictures please don't hesitate to ask. You may call or text me at REDACTED or you can respond by email and I will answer there as well."
