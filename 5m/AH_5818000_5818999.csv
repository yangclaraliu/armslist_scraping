Call 386-742-7105Visit our website to see our other fine products: http://www.sitargets.com/ We want you to be safe!  When using steel targets safe shooting distances are as follows: Handguns - 15 yards or greater, Rifles - 100 yards or greater. Steel targets should never be shot with a 50 BMG or steel core bullets. Any bullet with steel in jacket could dimple AR500 when shot at close range. (If bullet projectile is magnetic it contains steel).BB, pellet and airsoft guns should not be used. They will bounce back.  AR500 Steel targets are great for AR15, AK47 and other assault rifles at 100 yards. They will last virtually forever with various handguns, including Glock, Browning, Ruger, Smith & Wesson, 1911, Springfield XD, Sig, etc. at 15 yards or greater. Superior Ideas, Inc. assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for use or misuse of targets. You are agreeing to these terms as buyer."

When using steel targets safe shooting distances are as follows: Handguns - 15 yards or greater, Rifles - 100 yards or greater. Steel targets should never be shot with a 50 BMG or steel core bullets. Any bullet with steel in jacket could dimple AR500 when shot at close range. (If bullet projectile is magnetic it contains steel).BB, pellet and airsoft guns should not be used. They will bounce back.

It has a 3"" ramped match grade barrel, commander hammer, beavertail grip safety, extended mag release, extended ambidextrous safety, hi-vis 3 dot sights, and Pearce finger extensions on the TWO 10 round double stack magazines to help hold on to the SHORT FAT grip. This Black STEEL .45ACP is almost exactly the same size as my Glock 26 but has a touch LESS snap than the plastic lightweight 9MM because it's a bit heavier (a good tradeoff in my opinion). I carried it in the car on a couple of vacations and shot several ""mouse gun"" fun matches with it (biggest little gun there!), but it's basically been a safe queen of the .45 collection for over 20 YEARS.

As produced in those days, this was a very high-quality piece, particularly in the sense of shooting very tight groups. Every one of them was fired for accuracy and very few if any were rejected. But the factory staff began to notice that a few delivered accuracy bordering on the spectacular. They hit on the idea of culling out the most accurate ones and marking them differently. Eventually, the shooting evaluation was performed before the markings were applied. If your version of the gun wears the barrel marking of “Classic DX,” you have one of the better revolvers that ever left the plant in modern times.Price: $1,280.00"

Answering a previous question:  Colt Commanders have a 4.25 inch barrel. I've really tried to enjoy the .45 cal. (now for my ump-teenth time) but it is just too much gun for this fellow so I'm making it available for others who love the caliber and platform.  I've shot 228 problem free rounds thru it, divided over 4-5 sessions.I've just updated the pictures, I hope you enjoy them - she is a beauty, just not for me.Unfortunately this site is beginning to attrack email scammers much like craigslist; I've received several emails with only a few words like ""is this item still for sale"".  If it is posted then it is still for sale.  If a sale is pending but not complete I'll state that.  And once sold I remove my ads quickly; with that said I won't reply to those type emails any longer.EDIT:  IF YOU'VE BEEN ON THE LINE I HAVE A POSSIBLE TRADE OFFER, MEETING UP THIS WEEKEND.  I'D RATHER DO A CASH DEAL BUT THE TRADE IS FAIR.  CASH TRUMPS ANY TRADE AS I DON'T NEED ANYMORE GUNS."
