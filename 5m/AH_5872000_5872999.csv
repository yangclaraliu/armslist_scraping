It had less than 50 rounds through it at that time and I've shot less than 200 rounds of my own.He put on the night sights, changed the grip and added an adjustable trigger set to one of the cleanest breaks I've ever felt.I don't know the name of the manufacturer for the grips, I found some one time long ago though that were selling for $60. These bad boys are like holding on to a pine cone. Think back, have you ever lost your grip on a pine cone? I dare say not! These grips ensure the same confidence in your hands.I don't know the brand of trigger either, but he said he paid $100 for it. Again.... it's got a beautiful break. It's adjustable with a little set screw.I think the night sights are Meps, but can't be sure. While they're not as bright as new, you'll have no issues finding aim at a target in the dark.There are 2 Wilson Combat 8 round magazines included, 1 8 round Cobra and the original 7 rounder. I rotate my mags every 2 weeks to keep the springs fresh. It's almost a ritual.The holster is an awesome CompTac MTAC right handed and it comes with both C clips and the standard clips.Make sure you have a good strong carry belt and you'll have no issues tucking around this guy. I wore it this one time for a business meeting with a suite and no coat and had no issues for a solid 8 hours. Of course, if I went to use the bathroom I'd just retuck. I've worn it plenty at other more casual settings and never had an issue. Just read the reviews on this holster.This holster is $80 + S&H plus the extra for the other clips.There's just something about carrying a full size .45 that gives you a boldness. It's not hubris, but rather the assurance of your ancestors, knowing that they too trusted their lives to such a fine piece of workmanship and certainly won many of victories with it at their side.So, brass tacks. Why am I selling it?Honestly, I don't really want to. I'm not strapped for cash, it isn't buyers remorse, wifey isn't making me.  It's just that someday soon I hope to start a trust, maybe get some cans, etc, and this gun just won't accommodate that. I thought if I could get close to what I have in it, I could get the Sig I want to put a can on and have some left over for the family lawyer to start the paperwork.And I don't really shoot it enough. A machine such as this deserves to be used, loved and appreciated!How much? $1,000. Prettttty firm unless you're trading a full size Sig in .45.Base gun is $750 + taxes.Trigger, $100Night sights, $100Grips, $602 Wilson mags are $80, Cobra is $30MTAC is $100 shipped with extra clipsFobus single mag holster, $30That's $1,250.-17% for 'used,' I think it's fair.I'm happy to meet just about anywhere in public in the daytime within 15 miles of 30046 and 30680 after 6pm. I prefer to see a CWP on purchase to make sure you're not a felon.We live in a scary and sinful world were there are a lot of cheats and thieves trying to steal from everyone and a certain level of lowness surrounds those who buy and sell firearms. If you don't bring personal protection to a cash transaction of $1,000, you have more faith in humanity than I do. I say that so you know I won't be alarmed if you come with caution. Just know I will too.Let me know if you have serious inquiries and I'll do everything to help!"

The gun was bought new from Buds Gun shop in Lexington, about 4-5 years ago, for around $230 (gun alone). I shot it maybe 10 times to get a feel for it and intended to use it on squirrels but, that never happened. Time to it find a home where it will get some use. I took a few detailed photos of the gun and the accessories but I'm limited to only on on here. Visit: https://flic.kr/s/aHskGtBW7F to see the album of photos I just took for this ad.I’m meticulous about my guns, this one included. It is very clean and well maintained.  I’m including the factory Modified-choke plus, a brand new Remington brand Full-choke and choke wrench! Plus the two new boxes of shells, #5 & #6 shot go with the gun, as shown in the pictures.  I’m also including a brand new, camo, rubber pad sling. It will snap on to the sling mounts installed on the gun, another add-on that is included. The factory finish on the stock typically leaves you wanting a little more so, I had it de-burred, sanded to strip the clear coat and the factory color stain was evened-out. Then it was refinished with a few layers of gloss tongue oil and polished to a nice smooth finish. It looks much better than other comparable 870s out there, a lot better actually.The sight ball has been replaced with a slightly bigger, stainless one. No damage at all. I can't imagine anyone finding something to complain about.First person with $200 cash, leaves with everything shown. NO OFFERS!!! NO TRADES!!! NO SHIPPING!!!Located in Verona KY 41092. It's about 15 minutes south of the Florence Mall.Serious calls only please but, call anytime: REDACTED"

Comes with everything above and rifle, the owners manual, hard case with POF symbol, Otis Breech to Muzzle cleaning kit made for POF with their Symbol on it(cost $60), Red dot sight w/mount that I'll throw in(cost $100), 4-30rnd Pmags, 2-42rnd ProMags, & a 10rnd Pmag for shooting prone(about $125 in mags). The Cerakote job was $400 for entire rifle, so like a bonus as its not really included in the asking price & 1 reason I'm firm on $.   POF guarantees 1 MOA or less. I get 3/4 MOA regulary and occasional 1/2 MOA with 60gr Vmax, & 69gr-79gr BTHP in factory match ammo like Hornady, FGMM, Winchester Match, DRT, & Black Hills, but also shoots 64gr Winchester SuperX hunting ammo in 1"" groups @ 100 rather easy. With good hand loads I'm sure it'd group regulary at 1/2 MOA. A 1:8"" twist can shoot up to a 79gr bullet and I know some who shoot 85gr Barnes OTM out of thier match 1:8 twist barrels. Unless ur shooting 500+ yards regularly u will b good with 60gr-77gr bullets.    NO TRADES, need $ to go towards an F-class rifle build in 6.5x47 Lapua thats going to cost about $2,500. U can email or text but due to work it may take 2-3hrs to get back to u. This is a awesome rifle that literaly has any upgrade ud want already done. Just pick what optics u want and the stock and grip u prefer, but the 1s on it are the choice for many. $1,400 Firm. A new POF P415 cost $1,800-$2,150 plus tax & thats stock, without a $400 cerakote job & $350-450 in mags and other extras.Thanks for looking, and ONLY SERIOUS inquiries please, do not ask to trade. No offense to anyone, but due to past experience with some people, it seems this needs to b said. If after everything checks out and u want the rifle, but you are not prepared or able to actually buy the rifle when u contact me. Then please do not contact me until u are.  I've had my fill of people wanting to see pics and conversate but not b able to buy it yet, I will not hold the rifle for u. If u want it act quick bcuz im only going to have it on here for about a week longer b4 I take it off and list elsewhere, or just keep it. My number is REDACTED."

It also has picatinny rail on the top and bottom for all your desired attachments. The stock has three different positions and there are also two different options for whichever sling you prefer. Another great advantage to this gun is that it accepts standard Berreta magazines so even 30 round magazines are cheap, well made, and easy to come by. This gun weighs almost nothing, and folds down to just over 16 inches-making it easily stored in backpacks or inside of a car or a pack. Less than 50 rounds have been fired through this particular firearm, and here's the kicker-I'm throwing in 100 rounds of 9mm ammo for free.

The gun was bought new from Buds Gun shop in Lexington, about 4-5 years ago, for around $250 (gun alone). I shot it maybe 10 times to get a feel for it and intended to use it on squirrels but, that never happened. I took a few detailed photos of the gun and the accessories but I'm limited to only on here. Visit: https://flic.kr/s/aHskGtBW7F to see the album of photos I just took for this ad.I’m meticulous about my guns, this one included. It is very clean and well maintained.  I’m including the factory Modified-choke plus, a brand new Remington brand Full-choke and choke wrench! Plus the two new boxes of shells, #5 & #6 shot go with the gun, as shown in the pictures.  I’m also including a brand new, camo, rubber pad sling. It will snap on to the sling mounts installed on the gun, another add-on that is included. The factory finish on the stock typically leaves you wanting a little more so, I had it de-burred, sanded to strip the clear coat and the factory color stain was evened-out. Then it was refinished with a few layers of gloss tongue oil and polished to a nice smooth finish. It looks much better than other comparable 870s out there, a lot better actually. The sight ball has been replaced with a slightly bigger, stainless one. No damage at all what so ever. Better than new!First person with $200 cash, leaves with everything shown. NO OFFERS!!!

As always, all offers will be considered! I can email additional pictures upon request.
It has a 16"" chrome lined barrel that looks great--as do the bolt and all other parts-- and has the side rail for mounting optics. The previous owner had started the conversion and had filed the handguard retainer slot too far forward, so it was welded up along with the holes in the receiver from the sporter furniture and everything received a fresh coat of paint. It comes as seen here, with the stock 10 round magazine, wooden buttstock, handguards and pistol grip. 
Payment by CASH or USPS money order only!! If you feel like I'm way off base feel free to make an offer, but 'd like $750 ($800 if I have to ship) for it, and may be interested in partial trades plus cash, including the following: AK parts kits, Zastava m90np, a converted OR unconverted Saiga in .223, x39 or 5.45; VEPR converted OR unconverted in .223 or 5.45; left-side folding trunnion and triangle/poly stock; barreled yugo m64 kit. Feel free to make a trade offer, but I'm primarily interested in AK pattern rifles and kits, maybe magazines. Thanks for looking!"
