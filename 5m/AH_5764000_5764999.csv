The blocks are clunky and the bolts and hammers did not always play well together. This build eliminates several of the most common points of failure by using a billed dedicated lower and an upper made specifically for the 9mm with a Hybrid bolt and top shelf trigger system!The 10.5"" barrel is an FN cold forged unit, with a KAK flash can partially recessed into the slant cut 10"" guard. The bolt is a G9 hybrid bolt that will work reliably with Glock and Colt magazines. The buffer is a Kaw Valley one piece unit for enhanced reliability and no buffer rattle. The Lower is a Thor unit that is Glock dedicated and will accept pistol, 33 and drum mags with no problems. The trigger system is a Geiselle tuned ALG NibX coated unit for the perfect balance between trigger feel and reliability.The overall result is a great SMG length pistol that is ideal for home defense, SHTF and patrol use owing to the simple fact that if you run a Glock pistol you have ammunition and magazine interchangeability. It will even run fine with .40 and .357 Sig magazines should you ever need to scrounge around. It was a fun project but I am on to the next one. Built from all American made products by a vet with dozens of builds and the positive reviews to back them up.F2F with VA resident non-felons within about 45 minutes of Charlottesville.

I paid $220 + tax at cabelas wanting $80 first come first served. I won't hold it until tomorrow. Please call/text at 314 974 eight0five1 or email. Check the reviews on these targets/guns super nice but I need a different model.  as the title says I have a laserlyte blue g23 and the color guard e-target to go with it. Both of these have been lightly used and are in 100% working condition. These are actually awesome practice especially for those who own a g23. The pistol shoots a laser beam that can be used with the e-target or just anything that comes to mind. It is the exact same size as a g23 so will fit your holster ect. The trigger pull is very realistic and it is indeed a challenge to keep the shots on the 4 inch circle.  Battery life is super long on these and both are honestly in good shape. The target has different modes and will keep your scores."

It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.
The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

Brand new in factory carton, mint condition, unfired, all parts, manual, range test results, etc., still in sealed pouches. Front sight inserts in cosmolined pouch.The US military has long used rimfire caliber rifles for basic marksmanship training as well as JROTC/ROTC/CAP/CMP programs. These rifles are among some of the best you can get, are rare, and are widely sought after by both collectors and target shooters alike.Produced for the US Army from 1987-1990, Kimber of Oregon contracted these single-shot rifles. This is a single shot .22 LR (only) heavy target rifle than has a 25"" free floating barrel, an overall weight of 10.75 lbs., a length of 43 inches, an adjustable trigger, three butt plate spacers and a hand stop assembly. They were issued with a very precise Kimber rear aperture sight, a front sight with ten inserts, and are renowned for their accuracy. Accuracy results showed the Kimber test rifle capable of staying well within the 10ring of the 50-yd. and 50-meter targets used in conventional small-bore competition with standard ammunition.For whatever reason, the Army chose to keep them in arsenal storage for more than a decade and not use them. Most were passed on to the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP) a non-profit based at Camp Perry, Ohio, for disposal to pre-qualified civilian shooters. As soon as they hit the CMP's shelves, they rapidly sold out. Kimber 82 Government models are excellent shooters and are extremely collectable. A quick search of Gunbroker shows these rifles garnering prices of up to $1600. You would be hard-pressed to find a comparable match rifle for this price and this gun would round any serious Kimber oficiandos collection.Asking $1175- CASH ONLY, NON-NEGOTIABLE NO TRADES.YOU MUST BE A TN RESIDENT – NON FELON, NO EXCEPTIONS.

Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific up front as it makes it a lot easier.  I don't mind questions at all(cash buyers no problem), but please don't string things along with 10-20 messages only to offer a crap trade in the end.  State the details up front if it's a trade, so I can tell you if I am interested or not.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  A few things I can think of right now for trades:  
Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts(no std. triggers wanted), nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  FosTech Echo trigger.
Quality stamped AK-47 with side rail for optic mount, preferably with a nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock would be a plus.  I really like the RAS47 with the nicer trigger groups and Zhukov furniture, but I've read about too many problems with their cast trunnions an bad/faulty rivets.
A couple of Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Maybe a quality 9mm or 45ACP pistol with ""arm brace"", Ideally a good deal on a Sig MPX Gen 2 with folding arm brace or similar, so I can change out the trigger easily, I like nice triggers, otherwise, I would consider the CZ Scorpion or others.  Maybe a KRISS in either caliber.  I want something with a good trigger, so thinking a piston AR 9mm pistol will be easiest and best value, again, I want something compact.  
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56, Federal preferred.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech or Vortex magnifier, maybe two Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle and 1-2 with 7.62x39 reticle.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship for $30 more.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"
