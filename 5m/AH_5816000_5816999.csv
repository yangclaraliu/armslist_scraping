The history on this gun is simple, made in Japan and purchased in New Zeland in the early 70s. Was ordered to be used for skeet competitions, and was used in a number of competitions around the world, and mostly here in the states. It was used by my step grandfather, an all Navy pistol champ, and world class skeet shooter with the national skeet shooting foundation.

 

THIS ONE IS NOT MARKED BC, OR ANYTIHNG OTHER THAN MIROKU, VERY RARE IN THE STATES. 

the chokes are full and modified, it has the safety that will allow you to choose which barrel is shot first. the stock is 16.5 inches long, which is longer than factory (extended) has the trap stock, and all matching numbers in the 613xxx range. 

 

I have spent a few weeks researching this gun, and it appears that it was made before browning bought out miroku to make sitoris (no BC markings) I am estimating condition to be at 98%,

Quality O/U shotgun in 20ga (Beretta, Browning, etc)
Left Handed Semi Shotgun
Hi-Power in 9mm
CZ pistol in 9mm
Comparable quality .45 1911

Is has a few surface rust freckles on the front sight and some bluing wear. It also has a cracked butt pad which is an easy fix.Overall IMHO I would give it between 6.5 and 7 for condition.Most of its wear has been from riding in the back of the pickup for several years. $250 cash. I'm always open to trades (guns) as well just be reasonable.

This rifle has not been shot or used. The weapon includes a Leupold Mark 4 ER/T 6.5-20X tactical scope with locking elevation adjustment and the front-focal TMR (tactical milling reticle), which is secured to the weapon via three Leupold Mark 4 steel rings in a ""Euro"" configuration; this scope's reticle changes size based on magnification, allowing its graduations to be utilized as a metric range-finder; the scope also includes a detachable sunshade with its own flip-open cover. Also fitted with a Karl Nill AR-15 palm-shelf walnut grip with Rhomlas checkering - this is the same style of grip as the HK PSG-1 and made by the same manufacturer of the PSG-1 grip, and is pretty much the best grip that can be fitted to a sniper rifle - its base is also adjustable via screws on its sides; also included is the factory plastic grip and a green Hogue rubber grip. I had also experimented with some sling options and found that the Vicker's M240G sling, modified with 1.25"" HK-style snap hooks, is the best sling option for this rifle, especially when paired with the included ultra-rare matching Eagle Industries padded scope cover, which actually makes this weapon comfortable to carry without jabbing you in the back; I also include the Eagle Industries muzzle cover in case you want to use this system on a smaller rifle (the muzzle cover won't fit over the M95 brake). In addition to the above accessories, the rifle includes a total of five factory 5-round magazines, a factory monopod, and of course the standard Pelican case, cleaning kit, and manuals; I also made a ballistics chart and placed it in a luggage tag that can be tied to the scope or its mounts if desired."
