I however made it too small for me. My wife tried it on, and it fit a little big on her. The body size it would be appropriate for would be around 5'4""-5'8"", and between 140-180. I used a double cobra weave, and an extra coil up the sides to make it more rigid, comfortable, and add more paracord. There is approx. 150' of paracord in the sling. I used a stainless triangle for the center, and a steel HK clip at the end. The 10"" attached to the clip is a single cobra weave wrapped around bungee cord for decreased fatigue during wear. $70Thank you for looking. Call or text33O sixO5 8O82"

I just bought another with tiger striped wood for a $350 more, and this one has to help pay for the new one. I have a skeet club and we shoot a couple rounds one or two days a week. This is not the only gun I shoot however so the shell count is shared with a nice old Remington 1187, and some sub-gauge 1100 Sporting models. The gun has been used for target loads only during the time I owned it. Closes tightly with the lever off center as it should be. I hate to part with it because it has brought be consistent scores and breaks those clay targets into a black cloud. It has a minor scratch under the muzzle, and three spots on the pistol grip cap. Not sure how those happened. I wasn't the owner at the time. However you'll soon forget those little blems when you start shooting it...Call Dave at REDACTED with any questions you have.I accept US Postal money orders only.

The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game."

Also it has the bipod under the grip to aid in bench shooting and I have removed the second spring in the trigger pack to bring the pull down to around 6-7lbsoptic not included in deal but can be worked in it is a primary arms 2.5x
