The number one request was to make a thinner handguard. Both versions are slimmer than our current handguards, the smooth being more than 5/8"" thinner than our current quad rail design! The second most common request was to design a handguard that would accept most aftermarket piston systems. The new profile of the S.L.R.® allows for most piston systems to be used while maintaining a top rail that co-witnesses with the upper receiver.We also redesigned the top rail so that when installed it creates one continuous picatinny rail between the upper receiver and the handguard. Also redesigned is our method for attaching the handguard to the receiver. NO EXTRA TOOLS are needed to install the S.L.R.® handguards! The smooth (customizable) version allows you to mount accessory rails to the sides and bottom if you desire using the same Customizable Forearm Rails that we currently offer.-YHM's newest Freefloat handguard-Slim-Piston and Gas Capable-New Mounting System that requires no purchase of extra tools for installation-Continuous Picatinny rail-Hardcoat Anodized matte black to Military Specifications or better -"

Made in Bulgaria, milled, less than 100rds fired since new. Very solid and smooth. Some say these are the very best AKs you can buy, supposedly even better than the higher priced Valmet and Sako models. Imported in the early 90s. This is a pre-ban (made and imported prior to 9/1994) so it is exempt from the high capacity restriction and takes 30rd or higher capacity mags, except where currently prohibited. Know your local laws. Russian Bakelite magazine shown will be included, as well as 2 original steel Bugarian 30rd mags (unless your state prohibits high capacity mags, then they cannot be included because your FFL will probably keep or return them). Also have additional original Bulgarian steel 30rd mags, Bulgarian polymer 30rd mags, and Bulgarian polymer 40rd mags available for extra. This is a rare top quality rifle that will continue to rise in value. Asking $1100. By far the lowest price SA93 you will find.Fully insured FedEx 2day shipping to your FFL will be $60 in lower 48 states and $80 to Alaska or Hawaii."

Includes a bandolier on the stock and standard 770 optics. It's a budget rifle but it's taken its fair share of deer and elk. The .30-06 has incredible stopping power and shoots great, but I'm headed into a law enforcement career and I would like to start building an AR for my duty rifle. My preference is to trade it for a complete AR rifle lower, or a stripped lower and some cash (amount depending on what lower you're offering). Prefer the lower be Cali compliant (with bullet button) since I live on the border and my favorite practice range is in Truckee (at least for the next few months while it's legal to bring into the state). No pistol lowers.I'm willing to ship to a verified FFL dealer, but buyer covers the cost of the transfer and shipping - if shipping with trade I need to receive the lower first, not willing to take the chance of getting ripped off, sorry. If no trade, I'm asking $300 - this covers the base cost of the rifle plus the upgrades, soft case included.
