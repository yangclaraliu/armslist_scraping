I am the original owner and it has only been used outside once and that was when I was moving. I'm upgrading to a Pelican 1750 so I am selling these. The price for the Pelican 1650 is $130. Which is a pretty big discount from the original price. They both come with foam but it has already been cut out. the 1650 has cut outs for a broken down AR and accesorries. They come with the top foam lid and bottom so you would only need to buy replacement mid pieces. The prices are pretty firm since the discount is plenty big.  No trades please. Meetups will be at my location which is around University City and Center City. THE PELICAN 1720 IS SOLD !
