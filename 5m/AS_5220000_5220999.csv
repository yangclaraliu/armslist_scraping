In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.
Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.
The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.
HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.
VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.
Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Cold Hammer Forged Polygonal Bore During the 1960s, Heckler & Koch perfected the famous polygonal profile barrel technology. Conventional lands-and-grooves rifling allow propellant gasses to escape around the front of the bullet as it is fired from the barrel muzzle. A polygonal bore profile effectively seals propellant gases behind the bullet—increasing bullet velocity. An added benefit of a polygonal barrel is its resistance to wear. A polygonal barrel will normally outlast a conventional “lands-and-grooves” barrel by thousands of rounds. Polygonal barrels were one of the many radical design elements used on the HK P7 series pistol and this same breakthrough technology is present on all current HK handguns. Reinforced Polyamide (Polymer) Frame A radical new material used on the P9S pistol in the late 1960s, advanced polymers were soon used as major components and assemblies on a variety of HK products — including the receivers of MP5s in the 1960s. HK polymer molding technology led to the introduction of another synthetic framed HK handgun, the futuristic-looking VP70. Heckler & Koch pioneered the use of polymers more than fifteen years before competing firms. Today, HK remains a technology leader in the use of innovative and high-strength polyamides.

This was his newest gun, and because he was very sick the last 2 years, I don't believe he did any shooting at all. I am almost positive that he never even took it out of the box.  My brother took him to the Jay's Sporting Goods in Clare and bought him this H&K sometime this past Christmas.  I believe it is New in the Box with 2 - 15rd magazines, Owners manual, safety lock, & changeable backstraps and side panels.  Looks untouched and flawless to me! This was one that we were going to keep, but we have kept so many we had to make some hard decisions to let some more go.  My brother told me what he paid for this and $600 is almost $200 cheaper and the gun is only a couple months old and NIB.Price is $600 Firm, and I do mean Firm.  If I can't get $600 then I am going to keep it.

List Price: $20Extra Magazine: $1.50 original costHolster:Custom High Standard .22 Cal. Holster w/ Bird DesignFink Leather ShopsKansas City, MOThis High Standard Model B was manufactured in 1939. The Model B is a self-loading, recoil operated, semi-automatic pistol that is chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. The pistol originally had a blued finish but it is starting to turn a brownish patina color now. This internal hammer fired pistol incorporates a Patridge type sighting system which includes a blade front sight and a rear sight that is drift adjustable for windage only. This pistol has a 6 3/4 inch round barrel that is not easily removed (as seen on other High Standard pistols such as the Supermatic S-101). It is fed by a single column 10 round detachable box magazine. On the pistol's butt there is a European style heel magazine release. The pistol does not employ a slide hold open feature to inform the operator that the last round has been fired. There is a manual thumb safety lever located on the left side of the receiver and behind the grip panel. The barrel is in very good condition as is the gun overall. It fires perfectly.The High Standard Model B was first introduced in 1932 starting with serial number 5000 and it is basically the same pistol as the Hartford Arms 1925 automatic. The Model B was the company's first pistol design. The Model B along with later models such as the C, A, D, E and S designs have come to be known as the letter series. The company manufactured approximately 65,000 of these Model B pistols. The Model B was offered with either a 4 1/2 inch or a 6 3/4 inch barrel. The Model B and the Colt Woodsman look almost like identical pistols, although they are not. They were both derived however from the same earlier Browning design."

It was imported by Interarms in Alexandria, Virginia.  This is the last handgun that I am listing from my stepfathers collection.  Next I will sell of the rifles that we are not keeping.  I have listings on GB and some I choose to sell locally. I believe they purchased this gun new.  My step-dad bought it for my mom but she only shot it a few times and I remember that I ran a clip through it a couple times when I was young, she wants a lighter polymer gun now. Since it was the 1991 guns & Ammo Gun of the Year in 1991, I am assuming that is the year it was made.  It is in the original case case with one 7 round mag plus it holds 1 in the chamber.  The gun is in very good condition and EXTREMELY WELL MADE. The pistol is in great condition with little wear from rarely being fired. On this Star M-43 the nickel finish gives the gun a beautiful look. Adding to the gun is the rubber grips and the textured front and back giving you a nice firm hold on the firearm when shooting. Making the gun versatile for left and right hand shooters is the ambidextrous thumb safety, 3 dot white sights for a easy aim and a 3.25"" barrel for added accuracy in a smaller gun that would make a great concealed carry piece. Includes one 7 round mag (7+1) & factory case. Any questions please ask thanks.
Manufacturer: Star
Model: M-43 Firestar
Caliber: 9mm Luger (9x19 Para)

Grips: Rubber
My Step-Father just passed away and this was in his collection along with the many other guns I have listed here and on GB auction. I did take the gun down to clean all of them and I must say this gun is extremely well made. The slide locks to the frame via a full length rail which you really don’t see anymore. I really like this gun for myself, so I am going to offer it at $375 but if I can’t get that price then I would love to keep it!
I really don’t want to sell this one, but I can’t keep them all, but I can try!

This is the Standard Model M1A with 20” GI barrel dropped into the Sage EBR Mod 0 stock. This is the rock solid setup that the U.S Military used to repurpose many of the M14 rifles that were in storage and bring them up to a modern platform with increased accuracy.This M1A EBR features an adjustable stock and adjustable cheekpiece, pistol grip, and plenty of picatinny rail space for added gear. Included with the stock is the Sage Detachable Cantilever Sight Base (DCSB) that provides an absolute rock steady solution for mounting a scope to the rifle. (The scope pictured is also included with the sale). The attached scope is a Nikon Monarch 3 4x-16x BDC reticle and has been sighted in at 100 yards.A few internal upgrades to the rifle were also added such as a Sadlak Op Rod Spring Guide and a SEI Muzzle Brake. The combination of the muzzle brake and the EBR stock produces almost no felt recoil and allows for very quick follow up shots. This rifle is very accurate, typically producing 1 MOA goups, and has been my favorite hog hunting rifle. However I am now looking to sell it for my next project.
