Open to most anything as long as it's worth the amount I'm asking. No JUNK!REDACTED06Featuring two levels of tactical illumination, ambidextrous switching, a slender ergonomic design, and legendary SureFire reliability and durability, the DSF-870 is the ultimate WeaponLight for Remington 870 combat shotguns. This compact, lightweight system replaces the weapon’s original factory forend and features a recoil-proof LED that generates 600 lumens of blinding white light at maximum output, or 200 lumens with twice the runtime on its high setting. The LED’s light is focused by a precision reflector to create a smooth, wide beam perfect for closer-range shotgun applications typical in law enforcement and home defense—with enough reach and surround light to properly identify threats and maintain situational awareness. The DSF-870 features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switches on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. Selecting the LED’s output is achieved by activating the light in constant-on mode and then pressing the output-mode selector switch until the desired output level (600 or 200 lumens) is set. The selected output can then be left in constant-on mode or switched to momentary activation, and it stays at that output level until reset. Every DSF-Series WeaponLight also features an integrated system-disable switch to prevent accidental activation during transport, storage, or stealth operations. A lightweight but strong aluminum module protects the optics, LED, and sophisticated electronics, minimizing length with side-by-side placement of the two lithium batteries that power the system. The module has a Mil-Spec hard anodized finish to protect against scratches, abrasion, and corrosion, while O-ring and gasket seals keep out moisture, dust, and debris. The slender forend body is made from extremely tough polymer and is textured for a secure hold and features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switching on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. keywords, ar15, ar 15, ar10, ar 10, ruger, colt, Remington, smith and Wesson, Luger, .357, .44, .45, sig sauer, glock, semi auto, pump shotgun, Benelli, Taurus, mossberg, cz, guns"

PORTED 18 1/2"" BARREL, PISTOL GRIP STOCK with  thick recoil pad, 12 GA for 2 3/4"" shell HOME DEFENSE BACKUP or DOOR BUSTER. Made in Brazil of STEEL and WOOD, this was a simple single shot break open like the H&R / NEF when I bought it for a final line of defense  for my petite non-mechanically inclined wife.  The first time she shot it, it almost knocked her down. Made by CBC and imported by Spesco, it's a top break with a release in front of the trigger guard and NO SAFETY.  I had a gunsmith chop the barrel to 18 1/2"" and PORT it with 10- 1/8"" holes in top of barrel and install a large brass bead sight. The stock was shortened enough to install a ""KICK EEZ"" recoil pad but it looks and feels good for me or her. The weapon was inspired by a door buster used by a local Police Dept. It has an exposed hammer so you can tell when it's cocked. Recently we got a 20 GA double barrel for the safe room that she can handle. I DON'T DO PICTURES OF ANY KIND, will NOT ship or trade. The work on this cost as much as the gun, so if you don't like my price, try the Norwood pawn shop that not only charges TAX on old long guns but has a 3 DAY WAITING POLICY. HA !  Good luck in your search if you have a tiny wife that's home alone like mine used to be. ****I don't text. For a response, LIST A PHONE NUMBER. Concealed carry buyer prefered but not required.***** Overall length is 34"", good truck/trunk gun, 100% clean & legal."

The problem with round suppressors on pistols is that they tend to block the factory sights.  That can be worked around by replacing the sights with either an optic or higher ""suppressor"" sights; but, eccentric suppressors solve the problem altogether! With the Illusion, AAC was able to produce the FIRST 9mm pistol suppressor that is truly compatible with factory sights. On top of that, the Illusion 9 is also FULLY USER SERVICEABLE."

Users have the ability to install or remove the silencer from the Blackout flash hider in seconds in the harshest military environment. The compact size and light weight have minimal affect on maneuverability. The M4-2000 Mod 08s extreme durability is maximized by CNC automated fusion welding of every high-temperature aerospace alloy component used in its construction- making 100% suppressed full-auto fire possible on barrels as short as 10 inches. The back-pressure lowering design of the silencer aids in shooter comfort, reduces weapon fouling, and minimizes cyclic rate increase. As a final step, tapered-bore EDM technology is utilized to ensure precise bore alignment resulting in enhanced accuracy and maximum performance. By eliminating approximately 97% of the muzzle report, the M4-2000 Mod 08 preserves the hearing of the shooter and nearby support personnel, facilitates communication, and masks the location of the weapon. Eliminating muzzle flash in combat saves lives."

Description Ruger 6830 Gunsite Scout Syn Bolt 308 Win/7.62 NATO 16.1"" 10+1 Blk Syn Stk Black
 
The Gunsite Scout Rifle has a forward mounted Picatinny rail that allows
for the mounting of modern optics and a soft rubber recoil pad with buttpad
spacers allowing the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters.
Developed with Gunsite, this rifle is ""Gunsite Approved"" and features logo
engraved on the grip cap and name roll marked on the receiver. It has an
accurate sighting system with ghost ring adjustable rear aperture sight and
a protected non-glare post front sight. Patented integral scope mounts,
machined directly on the solid-steel receiver, provide a stable mounting
surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and
inaccuracy in the field (scope rings included). The Gunsite Scout also
includes a rugged, one-piece, stainless steel bolt; three-position safety;
studs for mounting sling swivels; medium contour cold hammer-forged free
floating barrel; glass reinforced nylon trigger guard and magazine well.
