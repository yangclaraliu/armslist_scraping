I bought it new and have only had it a few months - decided to switch to a G43 for everyday and I already have a G31 for the house. I really like this gun and was going to keep it but I picked up a 9mm barrel for my G31 and now that's my shoot-for-fun-gun. There are maybe 300 rounds through this gun, there is very little wear to any of the components. The barrel looks like new. I did carry it for about a month, so the finish isn't perfect but it's pretty close to being LNIB. The gun has never once had any issues with any ammo and was always cleaned and lightly oiled after every use. The gun also comes with a Lasermax guiderod red laser, which is activated by pushing the take down lever to the left or right with your index finger or thumb. Great for home defense at night. I also have 3 extra batteries for the laser. The laser has been in the gun for maybe 100 rounds. Note that I also still have the original Glock guiderod and will include it too. Having a laser completely changes the gun, even my wife can hit a target without too much trouble! :-)I added a grip plug and Talon rubber grips too, I'm not really a fan of the gen 4 Glock grips. These Talon grips completely change the feel of the weapon and offer a much ""grippier"" surface. They do peel right off if you don't like them, but if you've never tried them now's your chance. Also included - a kydex left-hand Concealment Express IWB holster. Like I said - I used it for about a month. Still looks brand new. Wish it was ambidextrous, but's it's left-hand only unless you carry middle-of-back. It will work fine for IWB MOB right-hand carry if that's your thing. If you don't want it I'll knock $25 off the price. The last bit of extras are the mags - it came with the standard 3 15 round mags, I bought 5 more so you will get 8 15 round mags in total. Pretty sure a couple have never been used other than to load them up and put them in my range bag. This gun has all you need for home defense, CCW, or just plinking. It is ready to go in the original box and all the stuff that originally came with it when new. I did switch around the mag release to work for left-handers....if you want I can leave it that way or switch it back, it takes about a minute to do. Gotta love Glocks. The trigger guard/block (Saf-T-Blok) I have is for left-hand too. If you're a righty it won't work as well. The bottom line: Just add your own ammo and you are good to go. (Please note that any ammo seen in the photos is not included.)Now for the elephant in the room - yes I'm new to Armslist and relatively new to guns in general. I've done a bit of research and it seems like this is one of the best place to sell a handgun. I tried my gun store and they offered a ridiculously low price. Not sure how I can provide assurances that the transaction will be completed other than to say I will provide you with whatever info you request before you send any $$$. I actually prefer to sell FTF at your FFL, anywhere in PA (I travel a lot for my job so driving anywhere is not an issue for me.) I can also ship from my FFL to yours, it's up to you to make sure the transfer is legal wherever you live. If you buy the whole package at the asking price I will throw in the shipping too. The last note - I'm not desperate to sell this weapon so please - no low-ball offers. I will entertain some reasonable negotiation though. I'm not really 100% sure what a package like this is worth when selling, but I do know what's it's worth to me, and if I can't get that then the gun will go back into the safe. Here's what I paid - still have the receipts:Glock 19: 579.95 Lasermax: 293.92 Talon grips: 17.99 Grip plug: 6.25 Saf-T-Blok: 12.95 Holster: 39.95 Mags: 124.95 (24.99 each) Total: $1075.96 I'm asking $875 for the whole package, shipping included.  **** REDUCED *** Now asking $795 + shippingI may sell individual items, after a bit of time, if the package doesn't sell...but for now I'd like to keep it all together.

They made less than 500 and even the factory doesnt have an actual number as to how many were made. They made these as a test trial to see how well they would do in the civilian market. They made Limited 16s and 17s. 16s have 7 serial number digits signifying they made over 100,000 of them but the 17s only had 3 serial digit numbers. These first few were first made in the USA at the same plant that they military issues were made. After the first run they moved all production to Belgium. This is gun 186 out of all ever made thus far and continue to produce. They now come in a cardboard box with one mag. The first productions came in a rolling FNH Hardigg Storm case with 2 mags and the Certificate of Authenticity. This one is new and all tags are still on it. Mostly the dealers, ultra high end collectors, and company higher ups scooped most of them up. I have never seen one for sale or sold but have seen one Limited 16s. If you dont know what you are looking at and expect to get it for the same price as a new one dont bother emailing me. I have already sold one. These are so rare I doubt you would ever see another one and certainly not with this low of a serial number. Any other questions email me.Will trade for:

780,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5653780,For Sale:  Hewes and Phillips NJ Contract Type 2,"Lincoln Park, Chicago, Illinois","$ 1,025","Listed On: Wednesday, July 6, 2016",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"When the Federal government went about making minie ball shooting muskets from .69 cone-in-barrel, they ran into the problem of bursting barrels because of the pressure build-up behind the minie ball and the weak barrel. To fix the problem, they turned to their contractors to remedy the problem. What contractors like H&P did was to cut the breech from the barrel, and insert a plug with a new bolster and breech plug. This particular model was converted in 1861 from an 1831 Springfield musket, and has the state of New Jersey stamp from one of 20,000 they had converted early on. It has all four remaining stock cartouches, and is untouched otherwise. What makes these muskets desirable to NSSA shooters, is the rear site on a smoothbore musket; hence a better sight picture for putting lead down the range. This musket is in very good condition, with minor pitting around the breech and other areas of the gun. Otherwise, it is smooth overall, and would make an excellent shooter or a reenacting piece. The cone comes out easy, and the bolster screw functions as well. There is a surface crack on the buttstock, but is not deep, and does not detract from the musket. Overall, has fine patina, and chocolate patches. Please shoot me a message/email for additional information. I will ship or try and possibly meet up around the Northern Illinois area. I am one of the dealers on the Agents Campbell and Pelican's Military Goods facebook page, so please take a look there for additional pictures or other items. Thanks,Mark"

This Patent Pending Buffer Retainer is offset to allow the buffer to rest further forward, allowing the bolt carrier to push the buffer completely off of the buffer retainer pin when the upper is closed. This prevents the buffer from slamming into the buffer retainer pin during cycling! This buffer retainer is design to be anti-rotating, and held in the proper orientation by the buffer tube itself.   How does this damage happen? Simple. Something is out of spec, but usually it's the bore location for the buffer retainer and spring. A damaged buffer face is mostly cosmetic, but chances of the buffer shearing off the retainer's pin is a possibility. If it shears off, that piece of metal could become lodged anywhere inside the receiver mechanism.   Free Shipping Via USPS Mail.  PayPal Orders Here: http://commonbullets.com/wp/archives/1727"

The lock is stamped Harpers Ferry 1816. The m1816 saw widespread use during the early American wars against Indian Tribes, Mexico, and early in the CW (even late into the war!). While most m1816s were beginning to be converted in the 1850/60s, some flintlocks were still scattered throughout Confederate armies East and West as troops were issued weapons in the rear of whatever was available. Among contractors, Harpers Ferry, and Springfield, roughly 675,000 were produced, and was perhaps the most common weapon seen early on in the war. This musket is in unfired condition, albeit it has been tested for flintlock functionality, and it produces excellent sparking. The stock is in perfect condition, and has an inspector's mark opposite the lockplate. The barrel has most of the browning remaining, a little fading by the breech, and the washer has seen some fading too. The bayonet is a reproduction, and has some blemishing, but is still mirror bright. Overall, this would be a perfect weapon to defarb of modern markings, and restore to a pre-war or wartime use.

This rifle has not been shot or used. The weapon includes a Leupold Mark 4 ER/T 6.5-20X tactical scope with locking elevation adjustment and the front-focal TMR (tactical milling reticle), which is secured to the weapon via three Leupold Mark 4 steel rings in a ""Euro"" configuration; this scope's reticle changes size based on magnification, allowing its graduations to be utilized as a metric range-finder; the scope also includes a detachable sunshade with its own flip-open cover. Also fitted with a Karl Nill AR-15 palm-shelf walnut grip with Rhomlas checkering - this is the same style of grip as the HK PSG-1 and made by the same manufacturer of the PSG-1 grip, and is pretty much the best grip that can be fitted to a sniper rifle - its base is also adjustable via screws on its sides; also included is the factory plastic grip and a green Hogue rubber grip. I had also experimented with some sling options and found that the Vicker's M240G sling, modified with 1.25"" HK-style snap hooks, is the best sling option for this rifle, especially when paired with the included ultra-rare matching Eagle Industries padded scope cover, which actually makes this weapon comfortable to carry without jabbing you in the back; I also include the Eagle Industries muzzle cover in case you want to use this system on a smaller rifle (the muzzle cover won't fit over the M95 brake). In addition to the above accessories, the rifle includes a total of five factory 5-round magazines, a factory monopod, and of course the standard Pelican case, cleaning kit, and manuals; I also made a ballistics chart and placed it in a luggage tag that can be tied to the scope or its mounts if desired."

AR15,"Garner, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina",$ 15,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 6, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Damaged buffer face on your AR?   This Patent Pending Buffer Retainer is offset to allow the buffer to rest further forward, allowing the bolt carrier to push the buffer completely off of the buffer retainer pin when the upper is closed. This prevents the buffer from slamming into the buffer retainer pin during cycling! This buffer retainer is design to be anti-rotating, and held in the proper orientation by the buffer tube itself.   How does this damage happen? Simple. Something is out of spec, but usually it's the bore location for the buffer retainer and spring. A damaged buffer face is mostly cosmetic, but chances of the buffer shearing off the retainer's pin is a possibility. If it shears off, that piece of metal could become lodged anywhere inside the receiver mechanism.   FREE SHIPPING Via USPS Mail.  PayPal Orders Here: http://commonbullets.com/wp/archives/1727"
