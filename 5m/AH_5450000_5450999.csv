We are very proud to offer this fine example of Marlin's model 39. The blue is thinning on high edges, the case color has faded, and there are some light handling marks in the wood. The butt plate is an interesting replacement with what looks like 2 hand carved quail. This version followed the 1897, and this one has the S prefix before the serial number. That is the interim series between no prefix and the improved bolt model with the HS prefix. It also bears the star mark on the upper tang, indicating it passed the inspection with the best of fit and finish possible. Unlike Winchester rimfires of the era, this rifle will load and fire all lengths of .22 ammunition, even mixed. Combine that with side ejection and near instant takedown, and you can see why this is the longest continually produced rifle. Starting with the model 1891, it is still made today as the model 39A. If you have been looking for the right 39 to collect or shoot, with the added clout of the star inspector's stamp, then look no further,will ship to FFL dealer."

The Cheetah pistols feature an open slide design that increases the reliability of the firearm. The frame is made from an aluminum alloy that delivers the strength and durability of steel – but with 65% less weight. The automatic firing pin block (FS models) prevents the gun from firing in case of inadvertent drops or strikes against hard surfaces.
