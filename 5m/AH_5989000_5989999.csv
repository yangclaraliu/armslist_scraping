The rifle has been modified with the following components:- Vortex PST 4-16 SFP illuminated scope (MOA reticle)- Seekins Precision steel 0 MOA scope base- Seekins Precision scope rings- CG Xtreme Mod 22 two-stage adjustable trigger - Badger Ordnance oversized bolt knob- Primary Weapons Systems PRC muzzle brake- Bell and Carlson m40 stock in OD green pattern- Harris bi-podRifle has been well maintained and all fittings have been re-torqued prior to, and following each range session. In no need to sell; my interests are leaning more towards a semi-auto DMR system so I thought I'd post and gauge interest. Asking $2000. If you have any questions, please reach out. As far as trades, I would consider an M1a in a Loaded or National Match only. Thanks again for reading"

All due respect to the Glock community, but this is just not for me. This is a sweet gun but after putting 200 rounds through it and switching back to my Beretta 96, I felt like it just didnt fit me. I just did a complete disassembly and cleaned the whole thing thru and thru. Not a spec of carbon to be found within it. the picture shows 5 mags - 4 in the case plus one in the gun itself - but I actually found an additional one after taking the picture so theres actually 6 mags coming with it. Asking $650 for the whole package. Interested in trades for something different. Be respectful in your messages, and keep the trade valuation the same ballpark. I live in Olathe, a suburb of Kansas City Kansas. Ill do cash deals to Kansas residents if you have a conceal carry license. Ill meet at an ffl to missouri residents if you pay the fees. And Im willing to ship to your ffl on your dime if youre elsewhere."

We are a Daniel Defense dealer and carry their products alongside other major firearms and suppressor manufacturers. We have significant range experience with our products and can assist with selection based on shooting needs.

This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol. The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger. Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands. The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.Features:Caliber: 9MMCapacity: 14+1Magazines: 1Barrel Length: 4""Finish: Dark Earth Frame, Black SlideAction: Double OnlyFast Action Trigger"

It measures a little over 9 ft from the tip of the bow to the transom, and a little over 11 ft from the tip of the bow to the end of the pontoons. I purchased this boat 4 years ago on Lummi Island and have used it 3 times. After the sale of our Lummi property earlier this year, I moved the boat back to Poulsbo and have not used it since. I believe the craft dates from the early 2000's, but I am not certain. Seaworthy boats were manufactured in Europe (Croatia?) and sold by West Marine until about 10 years ago. The Hypalon skin is in generally good condition, with a small patch on the starboard side. This patch is pealing up at the edges and there is a very slow leak here as a result. One of the wheels attached to the transomhas been lost. The boat features a wooden transom, with metal reinforcement for attaching the outboard motor, wooden decking, and seats. There are three main air chambers, and an inflatable keel bladder.Replacement parts, patches, etc., can be easily obtained through West Marine, The inflatable Boat Center in Portland, and eBay.$400I am interested in the following trades:JM stamped marlin 336Marlin 189550 or 54 caliber TC Hawken and accessoriesWinchester 1897shotgun suitable for clays (ie, not moss 590 A1)Quality recurve bow and accessories8-9wt fly rod/reel"

This gun has been fired no more than 100 times to assure reliability for carry. It weighs about 9 ounces loaded, which is about what one 1911 magazine weighs with 7 rounds of .45acp ammo!Condition is excellent and comes with all original paperwork, box, and the zippered pouch (never used or even taken out of box). It also comes with a leather Galco pocket holster that is a perfect fit. The holster is actually virtually brand new although it does look a bit worn - this is because I had soaked it in water in an attempt (as directed by Galco) to mold the fit to the gun (wrapped gun in a plastic ""baggie"" to keep it dry) and then put it in holster long enough for the leather to dry. This resulted in the slightly worn look.This pistol comes with an extra magazine. I have one set up for FMJ range ammo, and the other for hollow point self defense ammo. This is supposed to prevent ""rim lock"", but I'm not sure if it's necessary or not. The ""rim lock"" kit easily converts from the longer cartridges to the slightly shorter HP ammo so either can be used either way. Just requires sliding a thin metal bar out of the magazine by moving the base plate a fraction of an inch and replacing it is just the opposite. Takes just a few seconds. Kel Tec no longer sells these rim-lock kits, so I would guess they may have never been necessary if the magazines are correctly loaded (as per the included instructions). I have used hollow points without the rim-lock kit (which is what it's intended for) along with the flat nose Winchester FMJ ammo sold at Walmart, (same length as most hollow point ammo) and I've never experienced rim-lock when firing. I also am including a box of the Power Point ammo and the super high velocity RBCD ammo. (both boxes were about $40 for 20 rounds each, so not what I'd ever use for range ammo. Both these rounds have the same profile as regular FMJ ammo, so even is rim-lock were a real issue, it would not affect either of these high dollar cartridges.The hard chrome plating is amazing....ever single stell part is hard chromed down to the take-down pin and I believe even the internal springs. I've had this gun for several years and there's never ever been a trace rust or any kind of corrosion. The actual frame is aluminum (covered with a polymer grip) so the slide is hard chromed steel riding on aluminum rails which eliminates any chance of galling. I lived blocks from the ocean and even the very ""salty"" air has not affected the gun in any way (same for the sweat in my pockets) - I've never had a single failure to feed or to fire  or to extract. Gun has been 100% reliable. And while some may think the .32acp is not a powerful enough round for self defense, I disagree since at it's intended range (like for a street mugging, etc.) - it's more than enough to stop any threat (the .32 is still commonly used by police forces in Europe)."

According to the liquidation company I bought these from, they most likely came from Camp Allen or Fort Story in SE Virginia. In their current form they are setup to hold two side by side M2HB Browing Machine Guns as well as spare barrels. Of course, these units are completely modular and can be outfitted for any and every storage need. I will be including pictures of the M2HB storage setup so you can get an idea of how massive and rugged these things really are. I will also include pictures of other setups as well as the design I am currently pursing to show modularity. Originally I wanted to use the entire lot for myself however I ran out of wall space. These are the largest units SpaceSpaver currently produces 84"" x 42"" x 16"". This locker will keep your firearms, ammunition and other paraphernalia safe and secure. Inside the doors is a metal rod that locks into the top and bottom of the unit to keep doors locked and prevent access. When not in use the doors fold onto themselves and collapse into the sides of the cabinet to avoid getting in the way. This UWR comes with 4 support racks and various weapon holders already attached. Comes with USGI lock wth keys. Right now if you called SpaceSaver they would charge you between $1500.00-$1700.00 per cabinet depending on configuration. In their defense, these are extremely well made. On eBay and Armslist these have sold for up to $900. These are lightly used and practically brand new. Asking $500ea. Considering the size and weight, I will also include FREE delivery directly to your door. Cash sale, but open to trades as well.Here is a link to the sales page at VAGUNTRADER.

If intriuged i will verify credentials only if youre interested in a sale. While creating this build i incorporated everything i found useful while in the course and added things i wish i would have had at the time and while in service. Ive had troubles getting my emails to go through in order to respond. If your interested leave your number in email and I will text you rather than email response . thank you Ghillie specsBuilt on a Medium Regular multicam Fire resistant base uniformThe netting on the back of both the pants and blouse is sewn on and additionally reinforced with a rubber like glue to ensure it will not rip when crawling in the prone.The entire backing is coated with the previously mentioned netting and is the attachment point for the strands of jute. In between the strands of jute i have strategically placed strands of fire sealed 550 cord to attach natural foliage clipped from the area in which you are operating.I had cut sections of duffle bag (canvas) and sewn the section on the front portion of the blouse and pants to reinforce the structural integrity of the uniform while crawling in the prone. The sewing on the front is reinforced with rubber glue as well. The canvas on the front was then coated with several coats of paint in different patterns and sizes to create depth in order to give the uniform a greater camouflaging ability when viewed from the front. The back of the blouse has a vent cut into it in order to release built up heat. The seam was then sewn around to give it strength. the vent is also covered with a 2nd layer of netting.The veil (boonie with jute) is also covered in the same netting and jute used on the blouse and pants and is attached to the boonie by zip ties. The ghillie itself is virgin, new, unused, and has not been mud washed. Prior to use, in the area of operation, you would find a mud pit, swamp, ect ect, and roll the uniform in it in order to match the color of the jute to the color of the earth. There are many factors that go into effective camouflaging if you are interested in purchasing the ghillie i would have no problem sharing some information with you on the proper use of the ghillie and additionally give you the information needed to make the ghillie as effective as possible. Any questions feel free to ask.  My intent is to sell the suit in order to fund other projects. If you have a special request or would like a custom suit built feel free to contact me. Additionally, I will not give you the time of day if you message me with the intent of giving me tips and tricks. Im aware of other styles of suits and have built many in different forms, however if you have a professional bit of information to share feel free. thanks all for your time."
