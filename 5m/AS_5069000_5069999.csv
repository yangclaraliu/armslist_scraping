Upon further investigation the revolver is a Colt M1860 with a serial dating it around 1862 (50XXX). It's my understanding that there are three screw and four screw versions of this pistol; this has a three screw frame. For being over 150 years old, the revolver is in pretty good shape. There is a ""Colts Patent"" engraving under the cylinder with a 44cal engraving above the trigger. I have not fired the revolver, but the physical functions work flawlessly: the hammer, trigger, and cylinders all work in tandem, with no issues with the cylinder revolving. The incorporated ""ramrod"" (that pushes the ball into the cylinder and seals the powder) also functions perfectly. I have additional photos upon request.

Included is a compact conversion kit in .40 as well with night sights and 3 magazines. Both kits have low rounds through them. Included as well is the original case with the original Sig holster and paper work. This is one gun. The Sig P320's internals are able to be removed from the frame as a whole. The internals are one complete unit and are the part of the gun that carries the serial number. This allows for its ability to convert from different calibers, frame size-grip size. The picture I show is a fully assembled full size pistol with a compact conversion kit above. I simply rested the slide on top of the frame (without internals) to show size comparison.Though this kit I'm offering only comes in .40 caliber the P320 can be converted to either 9mm, .357 Sig or .40 S&W. It can be converted from either a full size, carry(full-size grip with the rail/dust cover length of a compact), compact or sub compact. And any combination of grip and slide you can come up with. Not that you would want to because it would look weird; but because all frame sizes use the same internals you can put a full size slide on a sub compact frame. I personally like the full size slide on the compact frame. Additional frame sizes and frame colors as well as complete conversion kits can be purchased through Sig."

I shot it three or four times (about 100 rounds each outting) and cleaned the barrel after use. While the gunsmith did an awesome job of bedding it in to the boyds stock, (shoots very tight groups), he did manage to scratch some of the beadblast finish on the barrel around the receiver, which I have not gotten around to having touched up. Barrel, Receiver, Bolt,bolt handle,  buffer, and trigger are all Kidd. Stock is Boyds. The Bipod is included and I have a couple of 10 round magazines and one 15 round. I go back and forth on selling, as it is an awesome rifle, but I really don't want to spend the money on a nicer scope (was shooting it with a $99 cabellas scope and getting 1/2 inch groups at 50 yards) and would be willing to part with it if someone was genuinely interested. Sale must go through an FFL....Armslist doesn't have an option for Kidd so it's listed as a Ruger even though the magazines are the only Ruger parts....Thanks!"

Precision kevlar and fiberglass-reinforced synthetic stock with a full-length, aluminum bedding block. Except for two modifications, this stock is identical to the M24 stock currently used by the Army.  The M24 barrel channel is wider also as that rifle's barrel is almost a straight taper whereas the PSS has the same contour as the current Remington varmint line of rifles. The stock is sturdy without being overly heavy. It has a wide fore grip and is quite stable off a bag, bench, or bipod. The H.S. stock is molded with a non-slip pebbled finish and is black in color. It has a palm swell at the pistol grip that fills out the hand nicely and makes trigger control easy by positioning the hand properly. The 26"" bull barrel has a parkerized finish and the action has a steel baseplate. The custom trigger from remingtons custom shop has about 3.5lb pull. The stock has two sling swivel studs and comes with a harris bipod. I can sell this rifle with a redfield tactical scope or without.  These guns can shoot .5 to .8 MOA with 168gr federal gold match ammo and down to .2 to .5 MOA with good hand loads. Only reasonable offers and trades please."

Took it to get appraised and they said it was considered excellent condition. It has original grips and comes with Taurus Case. Please call or text REDACTED or email me by clicking contact seller.Details on the Taurus are as follows:The Taurus Tracker family includes a full range of calibers and sizes to perfectly suit any hunting adventure. Chambered in everything from .17 HMR to .22 LR to .44 Magnum, these rugged, durable revolvers also make a practical choice for backpacks and tackle boxes, especially where there are bears and other predators around. Extremely comfortable to fire and easy to control - the Tracker Series continues to grow in popularity thanks to its high level of accuracy, rock-solid performance and near-indestructible construction. PortingReferred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality. Ribber Grip Exclusive Taurus orgonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.Taurus Security System (TSS)rsTaurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.Transfer BarThe transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.Model: 44TRACKER4B Finish: Blue Steel Caliber: .44 MAG Grips: Ribber Grip UPC: 7-25327-35123-8 Capacity: 5 Weight: 34 oz.

I say based because I don't see the Tower of London seal stamped on the breech and it has what I think are arabic letters etched into different parts of the rifle, so I think it may be an Afghan or Indian replica. I can't say for sure though, I'm no expert. That being said, It's still a functioning rifle. The breech locks up tight, and the hammer, trigger and firing pin seem to be in great shape. I've never fired it becaue I could never find the ammo but I've read that people make their own using 24 gauge brass shotgun shells. The rifle alone is longer than a Mosin 91/30 and with the bayonett it stands at just over 6 foot 5 inches.

There is a lot to know about this limited edition rifle...You will see a STAMP and a the number ""271"" on the very end of the barrel along with another symbol that I do not know anything about.. This .50 cal BMG sniper rifle was custom made for my Grandfather for competition shooting by well-known gunsmith Klaus Hortsman. Only 300 of these were made and this particular rifle is #271 and you can see that his Stamp is placed at the end of the barrel as Mr. Horstman always did on these custom rifles.I was always told by Grandpa "" don't ya dare take less than $15k for it boy""... However, I have taken it into several very trustworthy gun shops who have told me it could be worth anywhere between $12k and $14k depending on the market and condition. One thing is for sure.. This firearm was VERY WELL cared for!  I took 9 great photos of the rifle, but Armslist will only allow 3 to by uploaded.. This rifle is 15 years old and it looks like it was bought BRAND NEW yesterday. My Grandpa took better care of his weapons than anyone I have ever met. I can state with confidence that this riflle is 100% Excellent condition.This rifle has won DOZENS of competitions. You cannot get another one made. Klaus Horstman had passed away. This rifle is a great buy for a collector or a competition shooter. I will include the $350 carrying case and $500 worth of 750 grain .50 caliber Ammo for FREE with the purchase. The rifle comes with SCOPE and BIPOD.. I will also SHIP FOR FREE anywhere in the USA lower 48 states. First GOOD offer takes it.. This is one hell of a great deal here!"
