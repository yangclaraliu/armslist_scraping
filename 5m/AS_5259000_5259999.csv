The Trophy Hunter features Savage's AccuTrigger® that is easily adjustable by user to get a light, crisp release with no creep; while a lever mounted within the trigger body blocks the sear unless the trigger is intentionally pressed in the center, virtually minimizing the risk of accidental discharge. The basic bolt design assures that the locking lugs fully contact the receiver, holding the headspace to a minimum every time the bolt is locked. The tight headspace and a free floated barrel contribute to the excellent accuracy Savage rifles are known for. The Trophy Hunter XP combo comes with a Nikon® 3–9 x 40mm scope with a BDC (Bullet Drop Compensation) reticle that gives hold-over points for precision long range shooting. The synthetic stock, barrel, and receiver are finished in matte black that won't spook game, and sling swivel studs and a soft rubber butt pad are standard. A 3-position receiver tang safety is easy to reach with the shooter's thumb, and allows the rifle to be loaded and unloaded in the safe position. A detachable magazine provides quick and safe reloading and unloading of the rifle.

Capacity is 12+1, though these will also accept the standard 15-rd mags from other S&W double-stack 9mm models like the 5906,5903,5904,etc. This has an alloy frame and stainless slide, with ambidexterous safety/de-cockers. The grey factory finish they put on the alloy frames is barely worn at all. This commonly wears off in places from normal use, but you have look hard to find any wear at all. It's nearly perfect. Included are a total of 4 factory 12-rd magazines, a spare factory grip, and 2 spare recoil springs (I installed a new S&W factory recoil spring soon after I bought it 1.5 years ago, and I bought a spare spring at that time. So one of the spares is brand new, the other is the original used spring, which is still perfectly fine.) The pistol was obviously not heavily used when I got it, and it's only been fired about 3,maybe 4 times since, less than 200 rounds. It's quite accurate, and has been 100% reliable, as all of these old 3rd gen Smiths are particularly famous for reliably feeding any and everything.   Asking $450,firm. (which is an absolute steal for this pistol, in this condition, with these extras). Any prospective purchasers must be over age 21, fully legal to own firearms, a resident of state of Georgia, and show valid ID.I have my Georgia carry permit, so I'm good to go. I will not respond to one-liner messages asking, ""do you still have the gun"", or,""I would like to purchase the gun"", or ""when may I view the gun"", etc. Please provide enough info that I can tell you're a legitimate local buyer, not another scam-bot. Sorry,no trade interests, I need the cash (else I wouldn't be selling such a sweet unit!!)Thanks for looking......."

I am very meticulous or OCD About maintenance, using the proper cleaner with the specific tools to get in every grove and space. I have never shot it even if it it was only one round shot through my Glock of any of my guns and not field strip the firearm to ""properly"" clean it. I pride myself in handling my guns with great care when most see the condition of my firearms, it's hard for them to believe it's not brand new out of the box. The ONLY reason I am listing it for sale is because my grandfather in Florida was recently diagnosed with throat cancer and after losing my Grandmother, I need to move my family out there as soon as I possibly can. The Glock 22 Gen 4 comes with everything as if you went to your local gun store to order one brand new.

It's all kept under the foam in the Glock Fireaem case. This firearm is ALL ORIGINAL GLOCK PARTS AND THERE HAS BEEN NO MODIFACTIONS PERFORMED! Please do not hesitate to Contact me directly for any questions, more pictures (they only allow me to post 4 Pictures), and details about the deal.

Designed to work with both Colt/RR and Glock style AR builds. Compatible with standard mil-spec uppers. There are also numerous dedicated 9mm upper options that work. Requires the use of a unique magwell conversion (Colt/Rock River style) with UZI mags or a dedicated 9mm lower with Glock mags. 9mm on an AR15 platform operates by blowback and does not need a gas block or gas tube. Threaded 1/2x28 instead of 1/2x36 to give you greater versatility when choosing a suppressor. Integrated feed ramp and barrel extension. Since the “barrel extension” is an integral part of the barrel, the length stated is the true overall length.

688,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5259688,For Sale:  Bulletproof Vest - Better than IIIA - Resistant To Stab Attacks,"Union County, Charlotte, North Carolina",$ 300,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 21, 2016",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I would like to sell my bulletproof vest, which is also known as body armor.  This bulletproof vest is from the ""soft armor"" category of bulletproof vests. This means that it is designed to be concealed underneath clothing and give protection mostly from handgun ammunition.  This bulletproof vest is from Germany and is a police surplus item. The maker of this bulletproof vest (Mehler) is the largest and most advanced body armor manufacturer in Europe. The protection ratings on this vest are rated in Germany as SK-1 and ST1. (The German standard of SK-1 surpasses the NIJ rating of IIIA, which is the highest NIJ rating for soft body armor.)   The German standard of SK-1 is the highest level of ballistic protection for soft body armor vests. The German standard of ST1 is the highest level of stab protection for soft body armor vests. The wearer of this vest will gain protection from both shots fired (from handgun rounds, but not rifle rounds) as well as stab injuries from knives and other sharp objects, such as ice picks, sharpened screwdrivers, etc.   The national police in Germany have had a long-time reputation around the entire world for maintaining the highest standards for bulletproof vests. The German SK rating system goes beyond the NIJ ""Level"" system. The German SK rating system is more demanding for performance than any other law enforcement standard.  This bulletproof vest fits very well on men who wear a size large or size extra large t-shirt. I wear a Size 42 jacket, and this vest fit on me very well when I tried it on just once for size.  This bulletproof vest is fully concealable under many types of shirts and jackets. The carrier on this bulletproof vest is khaki-colored on the exterior and khaki-colored on the interior. The carrier on this vest is in overall excellent condition with no stains or other conspicuous signs of wear and tear.   All of the attachment straps on this bulletproof vest are fully intact. The same applies to all of the hook-and-loop surfaces.  I will meet you face to face in Union County NC for a cash-only transaction. This means that if you cannot manage to meet me for whatever reason in my pre-arranged ""safe area"" in Union County NC, then I cannot do business with you for a face to face transaction. You will have to have me ship this vest to you instead.   I will ship this vest for an extra fee, but I have not yet determined what my shipping fee would be for any of this. (I will update this listing as soon as I do make this determination.) I will accept money orders, Dwolla, Bitcoin, and Paypal for shipping, but you must pay any applicable Paypal transaction fee.  NOTICE: I ALSO CAN ACCEPT DWOLLA PAYMENTS. WHAT IS DWOLLA, YOU ASK? DWOLLA IS A NEW ONLINE PAYMENT SERVICE AND IS A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO PAYPAL BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ANTI-GUN LIKE PAYPAL IS. THE TRANSACTION FEES WITH DWOLLA ARE NO LONGER IN EFFECT - NOW THERE ARE NO TRANSACTION FEES FOR ANY TYPE OF TRANSACTION! YOU CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT DWOLLA HERE:  www.dwolla.com  NOTE: If you want me to send a text message to your cell phone, I can do this if you would please tell me what carrier your cell phone is with. (Verizon/AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/?) I need to know this because then I can send a text to your cell phone with my textem account, which I log into with my computer. I prefer to do it this way because it is much easier for me to send text messages with my computer, than it is with my cell phone. Thanks!"
