The gun has an adjustable comb and bumpbuster added by red dirt stock works, and the work is top notch. The bumpbuster is adjustable for tension, LOP, toe in/out, and drop. The gun is in good, but not perfect condition. There are a few dimples in the stock and a bit of blue wearing from barrel weights. I've shot one NSCA match with it, and got a ton of compliments. The flaws are not readily apparent. I am at work right now, but will upload pictures as soon as possible.This shotgun performs flawlessly and I really wish I could justify keeping it. I just can't deny that I like the ""fuller"" feel of my Winchester. I'm thinking $2200 obo shipped. I may be interested in partial trades for a good field shotgun (auto or pump.) I also have some muller chokes for sale (seperately.) For those in Colorado, if you have a 125 or 250 two stroke mx bike, I may be interested in that as well (also possibly a 250F)."

I DON'T KNOW ARMSLIST SAYS I WON'T?This is a Daisy model 101-33 single shot bb gun. From the research I could find, it was made between 1933-1935 (during the depression). This gun was advertisised as “Daisy for a buck”. The gun is in vintage condition. There are no cracks in the wood or dents in the barrel. I would think this gun could be restored by the right person to be a very nice gun. I have lots of pictures, if you want more just ask. It cocks and shoots. I don't know if the shot tube comes out? The description is hard to read but is mostly legible. A great very old piece of history! Will ship only to the legal lower 48 US States. Shipping will be $17.00. I accept Postal MO or Paypal (plus $3.00 for their fees). Must be 18 years of age or older and legal to own where you live.

I'll also throw in a red dot scope in case you don't like the 3x9. I'm looking for either two handguns, preferably one compact, and one subcompact.  I may be willing to take two compacts or possibly even one very nice subcompact. Preferably glocks, sigs, kel tec or springfield, open to any other offers, preferably .380s and .9s. Just give me a call and I'm eager to hear what you have to offer. The gun shoots ropes and is dead on at 200 and 8 inches low at 500. Milspec everything. Very accurate and reliable gun.It has a nickel boron bolt carrier and a mid sized chrome lined barrell. REDACTEDJay"
