This is a gen 2 which includes the bolt hold open on last round. The rifle is pretty decent for how it comes. Is a play on the ar18 and Australian t2 rifle. The rifle receivers are stamped steel with aluminum handguard. It features a 1 in 9 twist barrel as well as a factory compensator. The rifle is piston driven and includes an adjustable gas block with 4 function modes. The stock is adjustable and also folds to the side retaining it's ability to fire. The bolt and recoil Springs are housed in the receiver to allow for the side folder. This rifle is made in GA and is becoming not so common. Rarely will you come across a piston driven rifle with side folding stock for under 1000 dollars. I'm asking 850 for the rifle with the red dot still installed. For more information please feel free to text or call.

Still in like new condition. Completely coated inside and out for the best protection possible and seamless appearance. Custom sight, slide, and trigger work. Buttery smooth recoil (enhanced by the slide work), dead nuts (sight work), and runs every round every time (custom trigger and internal work).  All the internals including the hammer, trigger, pins, etc. have been changed out with original Beretta parts. The barrel and recoil spring/rod were retained (because they're better than the original Beretta 8000 parts). It's a badass. This version of the 8000 has the hardened steel spring rod and hammer forged barrel (as opposed to earlier models with a polymer spring rod and non-forged barrel). No low balls please. There's more money in custom work done than the gun costs new. I like the 8000 series pistols and the Stoeger's are the only ones (that are easily accessible anyway) with a rail. It was worthy of the upgrades and is an excellent pistol.  I just don't use it as much as it should be used so it's time to move on. You can call or text me at:614-four77-eight4five3and I can answer any questions you may have. I'all also throw in a new Streamlight TLR-3 light for nothing if you don't haggle me to death on the price of the pistol.  Custom Kydex holster is included in the deal.  Also comes with the original box, and two mags."

Let me know if you need any additional photos, I will do my best to take them, but this revolver is hard to photograph due to the reflective nature of its' stainless perfection."

Great way to get into .50 caliber at less cost, and a great piece of history as well!
Inglis manufactured rifle with ""U.S. Property"" marked on it.  Proper harmonica style muzzle break.  
Was rebarreled likely by the army (I have read that US Rangers got a number of these), however I cannot find any markings on the barrel indicating this.
Two things:  (1) does not come with a bipod - there is an interesting pintle attachment instead (see pics).  This can be removed and bipod added.  (2) the harmonica muzzle break is not perfectly horizontal to the ground - might want to make an adjustment.
Comes with 1 box magazine, a spare bolt, and a large wooden boxed boxed wear gage tool that also tells me this was a military conversion.
OK, so based on all that I will blow this out for $3,600.  You will NEVER find another this cheap."

After shooting a few times and thinking it was good for hunting, I have realized it's not for me. This barrel has only had about 50 rounds run through it and is in very new condition... the 300 blackout is a great round too, but I use this gun quite a bit as a range gun..  would take a partial trade toward a bolt action mossberg or savage with scope, preferably in 243..."

If you've carried a shotgun in the field for any amount of hours, you'll appreciate the thinking in aluminum receivers. The Maxus has a trim forearm and a close radius pistol grip. The drop and cast can be adjusted to your personal specs with the included stock shim kit. It makes it your shotgun because it fits you better. Take the low rib. It lies low to the top of the receiver and barrel. The Speedlock Forearm eliminates the bulky, knurled cap at the end of the forearm. With the Speedlock, simply lift the latch and remove the forearm. The Maxus' Power Drive Gas System helps a great deal. The piston design has oversized gas ports, dumping excess gases faster on heavy loads and a 20% longer stroke travel. The Inflex Technology recoil pad is very, very soft. It actually directs the force of recoil downward and away from your face with every shot."
