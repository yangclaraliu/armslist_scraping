As far as trading goes, I am trying to get into the cross bow game but I am definitely more of a firearms enthusiast so let me know what you're willing to trade in either category!If you know anything about these particular models of PSE bows, they are among PSE's most successful sellers for a reason. They are great for both beginners and experienced shooters. I bought it when I was younger to learn how to shoot a bow and became very successful until work, college and military obligations took my time away. Mind you, I was practicing without sights and a release so I was doing all ""instinctive"" shooting. I then bought all the sights and accessories you see below to compensate for my lack of practice but I never even got time to sight it in once I got my final set up or even shoot it at that. I made sure to wax the string after every shoot and took good care of the bow. I really did not shoot it much and never got a chance to take it out hunting. It has only been target shooting in my back yard. Accessories included-• Bow Madness carbon PSE arrows x 6 ($80 retail)• APEX Gear bow sights 3 pin ($22 retail)• T.R.U. Ball Archery release ($32 retail)• Plano Compact Bow Case ($30 retail)"

It has a 14.5"" barrel with a Noveske Flaming Pig pinned and welded in place to meet BATF regulations. Included is an EO Tech 512 which runs off of (2) AA Batteries. Awesome rifle. Piston driven, accurate, insanely comfortable, low recoil and will never quit on you. Shorter barrel dislikes light loads. So, super cheap ammo can cause a FTF. This can be fixed by conditioning the recoil spring by storing it with the bolt locked to the rear, shortening the recoil spring by a link or two, or boring out the gas port in the barrel to allow more gas to drive the piston. I have been deployed overseas shortly after acquiring this rifle and haven't had a chance to fix this issue yet, but PMC, federal, and all name brand .223/5.56 rounds have given me no trouble. *Magnifier not included. I do make people sign a bill of sale saying they can legally own the weapon. So if thats a deal breaker, need not apply. Thanks for looking."

It would not surprise me if it was only test fired. The owner before me said he never fired it. I haven't fired it because I am a collector. This item show a little bit of a blemish where the magazine rubbed the bottom. it may even polish right out. It comes with two magazines. I have seen these guns go for 1200 to 1500 dollars. This is different from other 10mm handguns because it is built like a tank and can handle your hot rounds like buffalo bore and double tap. Some of your other famous 10mm it is not advised. Don't get me wrong I still on them but I'm not going to be putting hot rounds through them either. So if you really want to feel the power of a real 10mm get a gun like this so it will handle it. You can just feel this gun in your hands and know it can take it without any problems. 423 eight six three 6166 is the fastest way to reach me
