It is loaded with a 5 shot N block clip that stays in the weapon. When the clip is empty, the user pushes a fresh clip into the weapon, which pushes the empty clip out of a trapdoor in the bottom of the rifle. It is chambered in 8mm Lebel, which is a rimmed cartridge. It was the first smokeless cartridge to be officially issued in any military service.  The front site has been removed and rewelded at some point, which is not uncommon in old surplus rifles, to increase accuracy.  Also included is 40 rounds of new, soft-point ammunition, a period correct leather sling and one charger clip.

These days, AR15’s aren’t just popular among Law Enforcement, yet many individuals seek to buy or build AR15's for their own individual use. Oftentimes, they’re called America's rifle.Read More About AR's and AK's HereThe AR15’s are available in a broad array of configurations, ranging from short carbine length models that have features like optical sights and adjustable length stocks, to heavy barrel models. The upper receivers integrate barrels of different lengths and weights, and handle various caliber ammunition, abound for this type of rifle. They’re easily installed, because of the rifle's modular design.Features and VariationsAutomatic and semi-automatic variants of the AR-15 are efficiently identical in look. Automatic variants possess a rotating selective fire button, permitting an operator to choose between 3 modes: semi-automatic, safe, and either 3 round burst or automatic, depending upon the model. Usually, civilian AR-15 models don’t have 3-round burst or automatic settings upon the fire selector.AR-15 Features:Direct impingement gas systemAircraft-grade aluminum receiverModular design permits for various accessories and will make repair simplerHigh velocity round, accurate, small caliberSynthetic grips and stock don’t splinter or warpFront sight is adjustable for elevationRear sight adjustable for elevation and windageBroad array of optical devices obtainable in addition to or as substitutions for iron sightsAK47 FeaturesAK47 became popular because of its multiple benefits which range from design, mass production, and size. The AK47s design is light, compact, and simple to maintain and clean because it was initially made for soldiers who wore gloves in cool winter to easily repair and operate. The AK47s average life span will range from 20 - 40 years depending upon usage and the weather conditions it was exposed to. With reliability will come a price of accuracy. AK47 was built for brief range engagement within mass infantry fire. The iron sight upon the AK47 is adjustable and its calibration is set a couple of hundred meters.We have new stock arriving daily, so if you don’t find what you want click on the ‘Add to Wishlist’ option, or give one of our friendly representatives at  (619) 566-6548.

The holster goes for about $60-$70 and there's about $50-$60 worth of ammunition included.MSRP $749My highlights:The trigger system is TDA, so you can carry it cocked and ready as you would a 1911. It also has a thumb safety, with a decocker when the safety is pushed downward. Then you can use it as a Double Action. The trigger is smooth and crisp!It has a stainless steel slide, external extractor with loaded chamber indicator. A stainless steel cold hammer-forged barrel with a polished chamber and feed ramp.The frame is high tech polymer. It has replaceable steel rails, has an interchangeable backstrap system with a lanyard eyelet. There is a MIL-STD 1913 accesory mounting rail and a serrated trigger guard.Ambidextrous decocking/safety lever, slide stop lever and magazine release. The magazines are polished nickel coated steel body, low friction follower and a polymer base pad. It also has a nice fixed 3-dot sight.That's the highlights I personally love about this gun, and is one of the nicest solid higher quality guns I've owned, and I have owned more than a few. It's very accurate, extremely reliable, and is very comfortable to carry. I have not had any issues what so ever with it since purchased.I have a aftermarket pistol case it will come with."

The gun is also super clean, but has the usual signs of 1911 wear. The tritium sights are nice and bright, and dated 2012.Price is $1100.
