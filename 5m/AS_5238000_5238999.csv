This gun shares many parts with the browning A5, such as friction rings and action spring. I bought a new spring and friction rings from Brownells. I believe I paid about $50 with shipping. I shot the gun about 50 times before it had a major failure. Therefore, if you'd like the friction ring and spring, I'll sell you mine. And give you the old spring and ring that came off before I changed them. So, it's a newer spring and friction ring, and an older set. Btw, it a 12 gauge. Maybe the barrel would work on an A5?  Not sure.  Some one did hack the barrel, but it appears to be modified choke. I'll sell springs and barrel for $75.  You want the whole gun? $100. IT IS NOT SHOOTABLE. If you try to shoot it you're an idiot.  I take no responsibility. It had a major failure in the breech. There might be great parts for use on an older A5."

A collaboration with Hodge Defense Systems, the mind set from the start was to create the finest combative modular system that was strong, lightweight, and with a positive tactile feel. No expense was spared in the material selection understanding the rigors this hand guard would potentially be faced with.  For example, most manufacturers exploit the use of 6061 aluminum for ease and cost of manufacturing, though 7075 has strength properties that exceed 6000 series aluminums at or near 40%. The barrel nut is made from Titanium to help with strength/weight, and the thermal properties one would normally see with steel or aluminum during high volume of fire.  A little thicker wall thickness was also chosen for a solid tactile feel, more surface area, added rigidity, as well as a more positive lock-up for modular accessories.  The Wedge Hand Guard slip fit attachment system utilizes a simple, yet robust method via a unique patented Wedge Lock system.  Mega designed the front of this hand guard to allow a gloved shooter to access their suppressor attachment point via a small angle, so not to fight for space while gloved. A steel anti-rotation pin is incorporated in the 12 o'clock upper section which mates with a predrilled hole as found on other Mega Arms billet and forged uppers.  The Hand Guard can also be mounted without the anti-rotation pin if your upper does not have this feature.  Please note, that due to the slim design of the Wedge Lock, sound suppressors will not fit under the Hand Guard like they do with Mega MKM and MML uppers.   Cutting edge new design Ultra strong and lightweight. Simple one screw fastening system Made from 7075-T6 extruded aluminum Titanium barrel nut Black Nitrided wedge system Compatible with any Mil-Spec upper Features a handguard anti rotation pin, compatible with many uppers including the Mega Arms AR-15 standard billet upper Includes handguard and comes with wedge system, titanium barrel nut, assembly tools.

This Sentinel Deluxe was made in 1969. I purchased it new from Sears in 1970. This is a very tight and good looking revolver that will make any collector proud to have it in there collection.
The pictures are of the actual Sentinel Deluxe that you will receive. They are not stock photos. 
Lesser condition models of this revolver can found listed on other sites as well as this one for more than what I’m listing mine for. After careful current market analysis I’ve decided on a price that is quite fair of $300.00 
I do not accept any sort of trades. 
I’m located in Tampa. You can reach me by email. Please leave me a return email address in your response or call me at REDACTED 
A little history about the High Standard Sentinel Deluxe R – 107
The Sentinel is a 9-shot .22 revolver. It has an anodized aluminum frame, high-tensile carbon steel barrel and cylinder, single-stroke multiple ejection, a swing-out counter bored cylinder, a movable square-notched rear sight, a non- slip scored trigger, a diamond-checkered grip and target accurate. 
R-106. In April 1965 the Sentinel Deluxe appeared, with the R-106 series number. The ramp front sight was replaced with a blade, but the gun retained the checkered walnut grips of the Imperial model. The old Imperial continued in production. 
R-107. This is also a Sentinel Deluxe. I have been unable to determine the difference between the R-106 and R-107. Externally they appear to be identical, but the part numbers for the frame, grip, trigger, and hammer were all changed."
