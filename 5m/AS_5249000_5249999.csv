But I rather sell them and wait til I find the 19 mags on sale and buy them.Being they are basically new, but not in a package, it seems they do not send them in a package when you order them from an ammo shop.The price is firm and will not be reduced because as I said i can still use them if I want and will not take no less for them.Price $66.00 and meat on my side of town in a public place. Cash with correct amount. You can inspect and we can make a deal and go. Again Price is firm. Don't even ask or say you only have $60 or $65. Price is $66.00 Firm."

The link to smith and wesson below will give you all of the specs and deatils about the rifle. It does have a bull barrel, hard to see in the pic and I dont think that link says that specifically.  I know the market is flooded with rifles right now but this one is not parted together by some dude that is tacticool. I also know that I will never get what I paid for it. That being said, it is basically a brand new rifle that has seen less than 50 rnds through it. Would maybe trade for another AR.

This allows the unused gas to exit from the front of the gun, rather than the sides of the gas block, resulting in a more quiet operation.  Call REDACTED for the exact price.

KRISS Vector CRB Gen. 2: Carbine / Semi. / 16"" barrel / M4 stock / 13 rds / .45ACP / FDE

Experience one of the most innovative developments in modern firearms technology with the patented KRISS Vector Platform. At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.


The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.


The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16” barrel. The DEFIANCE KRISS Stock provides a wide range of adjustment and length of pull. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine. The CRB is civilian legal with compliant models available for most states."

He seems to be most interested in Glocks. I've gone twice to meet him, both times seemed like a setup but the deal was to good to be true so I went against my better judgement. Luckily I guess I was stood up both times. We were supposed to meet where he said he worked. He said I could just go in and ask for him, problem was nobody knew who he was and we even verified the address that he sent. Hopefully I'm just being paronoid but I'd rather be paranoid and it be nothing than say nothing and somebody get hurt."

This revolver is the best thing I have ever owned in my collection, its so smooth and flawless! Hands down one of the badest revolvers out there on the market, you cant beat 8 rounds of .357 mag. This revolver is perfect size, and handles the recoil with ease! I have maybe only put less than 50 rounds through her and its been well taken care of, its like brand new - whoever buys it wont be disapointed. Youll probably spend anywhere from $1,200 to $1,300 through a dealer, save a few hundred and buy this one, like i said you wont be disapointed. If you have any questions dont hesitate to ask, ill try to respond as quickly as i can! Model: 327 TRR8Caliber: .357 Magnum®.38 S&W Special +PCapacity: 8 RoundsBarrel Length: 5″ / 12.7 cmFront Sight: InterchangeableRear Sight: Adjustable V-NotchGrip: SyntheticFrame: Large – Exposed HammerAction: Single/Double ActionFinish: Matte BlackOverall Length: 10.5″ / 26.7 cmMaterial: Scandium Alloy FrameStainless Steel CylinderWeight Empty: 35.3 oz / 1,000.7 gPurpose: RecreationalHome ProtectionProfessional / Duty"
