Very few parts are actually plastic with those parts being the magazine, a buffer peice and part of the ""action rod"". This rifle is equipt with last shot hold open, a 25-round magazine, a rear sight that is adjustable for elevation and wind.

For someone shopping online, these can go anywhere from $625 and up, but then you have a $50 transfer fee from your FFL, 3-4% credit card fees, $25-40 in shipping fees etc, and you're buying blind online.  This you can inspect of course at time of purchase, will see that it's essentially brand new, and can walk away content with no worries."

It's a color filled Honey Bagder lower from Spikes Tactical ( has a couple small marks inside the lower, but no cosmetic flaws on the outside and will function perfect ). It has the front pin installed already along with the safety lever, but they will still be extra's in the lower parts kit. The upper is a Sig Sauer M400 Upper Receiver which you won't find very often. * The Sig Upper does have cosmetic blemishes from a gunsmith trying to remove a pre existing barrel and rail from it. ( I'm assuming he has pliers or a vise on it looking at the scratches ). I tried to get them in the photos, but armslist doesn't let me add many. It's in about 3-4 places, but you can see most of it from the pics I believe. I'm sure a Cerakote job with a small amount of sanding or something could easily fix the few spots. I like to be honest and forewarn anyone before they show up! The inside is still perfectly mint and actually looks unfired.*Includes a standard A2 pistol grip, 1 30rd Magazine ( A Pmag or Black Metal Mag, I'll let you choose ), and a complete lower parts kit, besides the trigger. ( I planned on ordering a drop in trigger so I got the Triggerless LPK ) FIRST COME; FIRST SERVE!For everything above I am asking $225 cash FIRM. I paid $50 for the LPK aloneThe magazine is another $10 so you will be getting the upper and lower for around $150 which I feel is a great deal based on the manufactures. The Honey Badger lower is color filled so it's worth a bit more than a typical one.The upper is very unusual as most people do not disassemble their Sig M400. The upper dust cover was removed but is included as well as everything in the pictures.*I also have a BCG with a charging handle I can include for $300 total. Price will be FIRM.( They are included in the pics in the background as a reference ) I doubt you will find both of these online for any cheaper than that and they are brand new. The lowest I could find one for was $80+ before Shipping and not ever including the charging handle.* You can email me on here or the best thing to do would be to text me at 904-5zero9-0517.Thanks and look forward to doing business with you.I am located 30 minutes west of Jacksonville in Macclenny, Fl. If you have any questions feel free to ask!"

For sale or trade for firearms.This bike has been meticulous maintained and is in excellent condition. Purchased this bike in January from an older gentleman who bought it for his granddaughter to ride but she never showed much interest. In February I had Factory Connection rework the forks and rear shock. At the same time I installed a Rekluse Clutch so that it would be easier for my wife to ride. The bike also has new tires, handgrips and brush guards. My wife has put 4 hours on the bike since we bought it. Bike has electric and kick start and starts the second you push the button. Bike comes with extra air filter, oil filters, oil, brake fluid, coolant, air filter cleaner, air filter treatment, chain cleaner and lube, bike stand, and some other miscellaneous parts. Do not have the title for bike so it will be sold with a bill of sale as well as the bill of sale from when I purchased it. Bike is located in Verdigris. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Glocks are notorious for their poor out-of-the-box triggers. The DEM Gunfighter Trigger™ provides exceptional drop in performance giving you a custom-feel trigger and “tune” without sending off your trigger and gun.The DEUS EX MACHINA Gunfighter Trigger™ is precision CNC machined from 6061-T6 aircraft grade aluminum, Mil-Spec Type III hard coat anodized and then hand assembled using type 420 stainless steel coil pins (550lb breaking strength with better strength and corrosion resistance than 18-8 stainless steel). As an added option, the trigger includes a new, polished OEM Glock trigger bar to smooth trigger pull (critical areas polished).Our Gunfighter Trigger™ has been developed, tested, and perfected by our team of combat veterans to provide the best, most durable flat faced combat trigger on the market. Made by Gunfighters for Gunfighters.Item number two:ZEV Technologies Competition Spring KitThe ZEV Technologies Competition Spring Kit contains an extra heavy trigger spring (heavier is better, as it helps you pull the trigger), a reduced power firing pin spring, and a reduced power firing pin safety spring. The result is the lightest and smoothest possible trigger pull for your Glock. When used in conjunction with the ZEV Technologies V3 Race Connector (included), the trigger pull weight is reduced down to 2 lbs total.The trigger has never been fired.

Asking $700.00,  Price is OBO, tell me what you thinks its worth, but don't expect me to dump it! The only reason for selling it, is that I just don't use it!  I have thought of rebarreling it to a caliber that would see more use here, but I hate to take apart a gun like this.  I am usually interested in trades, it never hurts to ask.  Willing to ship to your FFL."

I will probably regret selling this scope 5 minutes after I actually do so, as my understanding is that this particular line of Leupolds was recently discontinued, and it's now impossible to get this configuration of magnification (6.5-20 power )   from Leupold in their top tier lines, for anything less than 700 dollars. And you cant get it in silver anymore either, only matte black.  The most comparable scope they apparently offer now in this configuration, is their VX-3i 6.5-20 x 40, with the only difference being a side focus adjustment now instead of the old school AO (adjustable objective) on the bell of this scope.  I would like to hold onto this scope just for value sake or future use, but just dont see how I'm going to use it again in the forseeable future, as my newest build is going to be a 1000 yard bench rig, and I'll be using my Nightforce 12-42 or the new Vortex Golden Eagle 15-60 power for that.  I just don't have anything else with a stainless finish barrel that  I shoot in the 100-200 yard range that aesthetically requires a silver scope, or this range of magnification.  So, I may as well stop hoarding and let it go while I'm in the selling mode.

To fold, press straight down on the top of the diagonal rear support to release the lock while pulling back on the sight tower. Standard, A2-type sight post is the same height as factory post, so it works with any factory height rear sight. Easy to install; dual clamping rings fit standard .750"" diameter barrels, and hex-head bolts (hex wrench included) provide plenty of clamping force to make sure the sight doesn’t shift and change point of aim. Base/gas block of rugged, precision machined steel provides exceptional strength and resistance to erosion by hot gases. Includes bayonet lug, and rear clamping ring drilled to accept sling swivel pin. Aluminum sight post minimizes weight while still providing plenty of strength.
