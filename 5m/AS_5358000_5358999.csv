Cheap,"shrewsbury, Southeastern, PA, Pennsylvania",$ 500,"Listed On: Friday, April 8, 2016",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have approximately 2000 rds of 180gr .40 Caliber FMJ and approx 800 rds of 180gr .40 JHP for sale. A case of .40 FMJ sells for approximately $250-275 for 1000 rds. I am selling approximately 2800 rds for $500. That is $.17 per round. I will only sell as a complete set.
 
Pro: All new factory ammo at a great price. I got rid of my .40 pistols and I am passing the savings onto you.
 
Cons: Since I got rid of my .40s I needed to spare some room in my ammo cans, so I emptied the FMJs out of the boxes and placed them into ziploc bags. So youre getting a 5 gallon bucket of 50 round ziploc bags. The JHPs are still in factory boxes, and the ammo can I keep them in is included (as well as the bucket)Will only sell as a complete set. Must pick up in Shrewsbury."

I thought I would enjoy a semi-automatic for shooting clays but I think I will stick with an O/U. This is a great feeling and looking gun but it is not for me. Also, it can be particular on what you feed it. It does not like cheap Winchester but it will eat up cheap Federal loads. There is a small scratch shown in one of the pictures. I am asking $500 or best offer. The best way to get in contact with with me is throught text message or email. 850-323-007 three. 
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
With CZ quality throughout, the 912’s handsome lines and affordable price make it attractive to the eye as well as the wallet.

The CZ 912 is built with a high gloss finish and sleek look with attractive lines both on the alloy receiver and on the walnut stock.  The modern-style recoil pad provides for not only a significant reduction in perceived recoil, but is snag-free as well. A long recoil spring is located in the butt of the stock, simplifying assembly and allowing it to cycle a wide variety of loads across the power spectrum in both 2 ¾” and 3”.

In addition, the rearward spring design makes required cleanings less frequent and easier when they are needed. Removal of the installed magazine plug is simple, requiring only the magazine cap to be unscrewed. Without the plug it gives the upland hunter a 4+1 capacity. With superb balance and an average weight of 7.4 lbs, the 912 is well-suited to the pursuit of both birds and clays."

The new design is a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert. Designed to give extra strength in the high-pressure sections, the Omni-Hybrid surpasses military pressure and weight-bearing testing.
This unique manufacturing process produces a lighter weight platform, with the total weight of the Omni-Hybrid stripped lower being 8 ounces, a ½ ounce lighter than a traditional aluminum AR lower.
“The Omni-Hybrid lower has gone through all the pressure and weight-baring testing of a traditional aluminum lower with flawless results,” says Joe Calabro, Director of Marketing for American Tactical. “We feel like this new manufacturing technique will help set the standard for AR lower manufacturing.”"
