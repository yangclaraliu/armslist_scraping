But it has the upper of an AK47. The reliable piston vs the gas infringement.  The piston system will always win. Plus its not heavy like the puston ARs. It has a side folding stock which makes it several inches shorter then the AR with collapsible stock.  It is far more reliable then any AR. And it will shoot any ammo you want to put thru it.  Yes even the steel crap. The bolt does not get hot like ARs do. So it wont melt the coating that steel cased ammos manufacturer puts on them. This is a rifle you can trust your life with because you can trust it will work.  Call or text me at 417-849-7824

Although it was never dropped out of a tree or had harsh abuse, this bow would probably keep on shooting if you did not purposely try to damage it. Ruggedness is a valuable part of the design of a bow. Some of the newer ones look kind of flimsy, but they will shoot faster. Having a beefy frame and good tough, quality parts and components is also nice safety feature. A shooter can always keep a bow safe and ready to shoot, but this one keeps it simple. It lends itself to a quick, accurate inspection before firing. It has a new scope with yellow tinted see through scope covers with good mounts. The limbs, cams and string were replaced @ Barnett.
