I am really meticulous with everything I own and this gun is no exception. Black powder is corrosive and requires immediate cleaning after field use. Knowing this, the gun has been completely disassembled and cleaned after each use.After shining down the bore with a light, I can say that there is no rust, only lead streaks which can be wiped out with a few patches and Hornady 1-Shot bore cleaner.The gun is accurate with round balls at half charge (50 grains FFFG) and up to 90 grains FFFG (do not exceed) with conicals/sabots. Expect 1.5-3'' groups depending on the day from a bench. If you ruin this rifle with a scope you likely could get the 1'' groups advertised by Hornady.The gun is rather slim which makes for classic lines and good balance but just in case you over tighten the lock screw or drop it on a rock, I am including a replacement lyman factory stock which requires some minor fitting around the lock.The gun is sighted in for 100 yds with the fixed sight shooting conicals and all 3 projectile types impact at the same point a few inches high at 50 yards. I have included the factory buckhorn sight too.I am selling this excellent rifle, replacement lyman factory stock, gun case, 15 Hornady great plains 425-grain conicals, 15 295 grain power belts, the remaining round balls (~70) and cleaning supplies for $800. I would recommend Buffalo arms or Track of the Wolf for black powder. Otherwise, get to know the traditional shooters at Twin Cities Rod and Gun Club.

Action works as SMOOTH AS BUTTER and I don't say that lightly. One of the best I have ever felt. Has the earlier modeled stronger forged receiver which changed in 1975. The Stock has a beautiful deep walnut finish with minimal scrapes and scuffs although in very good condition and working order as seen from the pictures. Fit and finish is TIGHT! Compared to the newer models after 1975 this one is lighter much easier to carry and maneuver for a brush gun. Please feel free to call and ask any questions before buying. I also have a 4x32 Scope that comes with it. Much of the finish has worn off although the Scope still works. I only have the bottom scope rings mounted as seen in the pictures. I can't find the upper halves. They will have to be replaced to be able to mount the Scope.

The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.
 
And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
 
25 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: 26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 27 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. 28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:"

Has the HK metal lower on it, clipped and pinned SEF options. F is a redundant semi auto. The wood furniture is from German army G3's. It came from Germany wrapped with warnings in German that I couldn't read. The grip is an HK-91 grip ordered from HK Parts. I then had the gun professionally Cerakote'd by Palmer Ordnance in Seabeck, WA in order to make the metal from the G3 wood furniture, the HK lower, and the PTR upper all match. Finally I added a Nightforce SHV scope (3-10x 42mm .250MOA). This gun is a beauty and shoots great. I still have all the original jungle green furniture, which will be included. Also included are 6 magazines, 5 steel and 1 aluminum, all surplus G3 magazines. I have the original box for the scope and the hard case that the gun was shipped in. I put a lot of money into this project building a very nice shooter. This is as close in looks and feel as you will get to an original HK-91 without breaking the bank (I mean, it is more HK than PTR at this point anyway). Unfortunately I am selling to fund other projects. Asking $1100 without the scope, $1700 with the scope. No trades."

Thus you do not need to know the range, you dial the zoom until you have bracketed 18"", at which time the lower crosshair shows the estimated holdover, while the upper crosshair shows the normal 200 yd zero (the distance between the wires showing the holdover). The BDC is calibrated for 7.62 NATO ball or equivalent. You need to be Zeroed at 200 yds. It is an interesting system because you don't actually have to estimate the range, although it is indicated on the zoom ring so you can set it (if know), or read it out once you have bracketed your 18"" target."""

The Springfield TRP offers nearly the same performance and features as the TRP-PRO model at a fraction of the cost. From its fully checkered front strap and mainspring housing, to its durable Armory Kote Teflon finish, this gun can only be described as a knock out value. The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission. Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.
