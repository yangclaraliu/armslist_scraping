I purchased this pistol new roughly two months ago from JJ Gun Supply and have a receipt as proof of purchase. After carrying this firearm for the last two months I have decided to switch carry pistols to something that is more conducive to environments I regularly carry in. I have never shot the pistol and it is in factory fired condition with VERY minor wear on the side of the trigger guard from the holster. Having said that, I'm also including a SAS Customs carbon fiber kydex holster. The holster is set for right hand carry with 22 degrees of forward cant, an adjustable tension device, and is reversible between inside and outside the waist carry. Also included is a Pearce grip plug and a full box of Hornady Critical Duty ammo. The above items new after tax set me back $686 and the cost breaks down as follows: Glock Pistol $540, Grip Plug $5, Ammo $25, Holster $75. As previously stated I am interested in acquiring a new carry pistol and will sell this as a package deal for $475 firm and I will also listen to equal value trades (trade value is higher) for a concealed carry 9mm pistol. Buyer must meet in Mason, cash only, all local and federal laws apply, and buyer must present state issued photo ID at time of sale (fellow CCW holders take priority).

This offering also includes the XD gear along with a Fobus dual mag pouch as well as a Blackhawk level 3 Serpa holster.

I've always loved the caliber (ever since my SKS), since it hits nearly as hard as a 308 at medium range, and is WAY cheaper to shoot.Anyway, it came out better than I ever expected, I just don't have much time to shoot anymore, and as noted above, the money is needed alsewhere...Details of the build: - Anderson Mfg upper and lower - Faxon Firearms 16"" Barrel** This barrel is the focal point of the build, since I was hoping to one day get a suppressor and shoot subs    Here's the details direct from Faxon:    Give your AR-15 some Russian love! 4150 QPQ coated inside and out for amazing corrosion resistance and durability.     We chose to offer the 1/8 twist so reloaders and those shooting heavier grain 147s can use their weapon effectively. Provides great accuracy for all loads!    Faxon Firearms barrels are the pinnacle of value. Manufactured 100% in-house from cradle-to-grave, these barrels are button-rifled and air-guage tested to ensure superior accuracy.    All barrels are manufactured under our ISO:9001 and AS:9100 (pending) quality certifications. We inspect each barrel over 15 times before it ever reaches you.     Barrel Material: 4150 CMV Steel     Barrel Type: Button Rifled     Barrel Caliber: 7.62x39mm Russian    Barrel Twist: 1:8    Barrel Length: 16""    Barrel Profile: Gov't/SOCOM    Barrel Gas System: Mid Length    Inside Finish: QPQ Nitride    Outside Finish: QPQ Nitride    Muzzle Thread: 5/8 x24 TPI (Threads Per Inch)    Gas Block Diameter: .750""    Gas Hole Diameter: .091""    Gas Block Journal Length: 1.9""    Barrel Extension: M4    Weight: 1.67 lbs    Magnetic Particle Inspected!    11-degree Target Crown- Nickel Boron Nitride M16 (fully shrouded) carrier group and bolt, all properly staked and high grade. Very slick (pun intended) and easy to clean- low profile gas block- Ultra slim 15"" free floating Keymod handguard with cover inserts and custom 3D printed ""7.62x39"" TPM vibration-absorbing endcap. Can be removed if you prefer to have an open ended handguard.- 6-position butt stock with 4 QD sling cups and 1 QD sling swivel- Ambidextrous tactical charging handle- Polymer BUIS (back-up sights), tan currently installed, but I have a set of black that I'll swap out if you prefer- Tru-Glo multi-reticle reflex sight. It's a cheap optic, but man is it bright and works great. I actually really like it and will be buying another one to replace it if I ever get another AR. It's Red/Green switchable and is clearly visible in daylight. It has several reticles, but my favorite is the circle-dot for quick close-up work. If you're hunting with this gun, of course you'll want a proper scope.- 2 ASC stainless 10-round dedicated 7.62x39 magazines. Many people have heard horror stories about getting a 7.62x39 AR to run properly. It seems to come down to 2 things: Feed ramps and magazines. These mags are purpose-built for this round, and seem to be about the best available from my research.- Speaking of feed ramps, I opened up and polished the standard M4-type ramps to eliminate the choke points caused by the larger projectile and shorter geometry of the x39 round vs the 5.56, and it feeds like butter. I've only put about 30 rounds through it, since I was working on subsonic load development, but once I corrected the ramps, I had zero issues from then on.- Custom machined blast-redirecting muzzle device. I machined and Duracoated this one myself. If you're familiar with the Noveske KX3 or the ""Flash Can"" style of muzzle device, then you get the idea. It directs all the flash and concussion downrange, away from the shooter. It really makes a big difference vs no brake, but of course you can swap it out for any 5/8-24 muzzle device of your choice. You'll see in teh photos what looks like a short silencer. It's a fake can. It's included as well, just for giggles. It's totally useless, and actually probably makes the gun louder, but it looks pretty sweet screwed on, especially with the long hanguard.- Everything packs up and fits (barely) into this sweet little rectangular case that doesn't scream ""gun!"", which is exactly what I was hoping for. It all breaks down and is well secured for travel as well. There's and outer pouch for mags and small parts that's not visible in the photos. It's a nice padded ballistic nylon case. I'm very pleased with it.Well, that's about it. Feel free to ask any questions. I'm not really looking for trades this time, since I don't want to sell it anyway, but I have to since I just found out I have to spend over a grand on my wife's car. Otherwise, you would NOT be reading this ad right now, and this rifle would stay in my closet where it belongs. The price is also fairly firm, for the above-mentioned reasons."

It has been my safe queen since i've had it. I have nearly 1700.00 in this Colt (with the custom work) & these pictures do not do it justice! It is in virtually new condition with very little signs that it has had a few rounds through it. When I first got it, I shot it 21 times, cleaned it and put it away. It is a great shooter, very accurate and reliable. I decided I wanted to have some custom work done on it a year or so later so I sent it to West Virginia to Novak's Custom shop. Wayne Novak is , in my opinion, the best custom gunsmith in the country. He specializes on the 1911 platform. I had him do a beautiful matte bead blast finish on it, install an Alexander main spring housing, install an ambi safety, install Novak springs throughout, polish the throat of the barrel and add an extended tang to prevent hammer bite. When I got it back, I shot it another 7 times, cleaned it and put it back up. It shot even better than before and the beadblasted finish was superb! Those of you who know, know that the Colt Officers model is almost impossible to find...and highly collectible. Since I never fire it, I just decided to sell to someone who can appreciate it as I have and get some use out of it. Unfortunately, I have misplaced the original box but it will come with a generic plastic case and two Officer's magazines. Also, note the Wilson ambi cut coco-bolo grips. Buyer will sign a bill of sale and must be legal to purchase a handgun, prefer to sell to carry permit holders. I will ask to see ID. Thanks for looking!"

It is aluminum and painted in upper woodland camouflage. The 37"" Goodrich tires are the famous Hummer ""run flat"" tires. The trailer weighs 1437 pounds and has a gross vehicle weight of 3,400 so you can still carry one ton of ""stuff"".

With the wheeled trailer jack, the trailer can easily be relocated by hand by one person. It has a trailer wiring adapter to change the 24 volt lights to 12 volt and has a four pin standard trailer electrical connector. The rear tail lights have been changed to 12v LED.The clevis hitch has been lowered to 20 inches from the original 29 1/2 inches to allow the trailer to travel level.These trailers sold brand new to the Department of Defense for $8,900.00 so the price you pay will be a great savings on a virtually new trailer.

Comes complete with firearm, 3 factory mags, box, and all included contents. I will also include 50 rounds of premium ammo.I am well aware that I have listed this item for full retail. I am also aware that other sites have them listed for less. Unfortunately, all of those sites also have ""out of stock"" included in their listings. This item is hard to get hands on, so it doesn't really matter if Bud's says they will sell it for $50 cents, if they don't have any of them, it's irrelevant. I don't expect anyone who doesn't REALLY want this gun, to contact me. After all, saving a buck is fine by me. But here's the deal, I'm not desperate to sell it, I refuse to ""meet or beat"" any advertised price, especially since they are all ""out of stock"" anyway. Now, if you made it this far, you are likely a reasonable (and patient) person who understands supply and demand. With that, I'll say that I am also quite reasonable and able to be persuaded. If you would like to make a very fair offer, I'm open to hearing it. If you have a snazzy trade for a nice 308, or other Rifle you think I'd appreciate, let me know. If you have a very nice Glock 9mm and some cash, perhaps we can talk about a trade. Keep in mind, the way I define ""fair"" for a brand new, never fired handgun is that you take into account I purchased it, went through the hassle of FFL, and paid the tax. You may say, ""well online you don't have to pay tax."" Actually, you DO have to pay it, just not at the time of purchase. You can choose to cheat the system and NOT pay the Oklahoma Tax commission, but you are legally obligated to report it on your Form 511 under the heading of ""use tax"". And since I have had a few inquiries, (and one REALLY whiney fellow who keeps talking about liberal media) about the price, I'll knock off the tiny bit of markup I had on the gun. Dropping to $1420 obo - The gun cost $1330 out the door. Ammo is $25 for 50 rounds of premium factory ammo. I won't give away, and I won't lose money. There are not a ton of them around. So if you'd like to get one, I've got it. Otherwise, I'm happy to throw it in the safe and let it age. I do not ship. Will meet face to face in Broken Arrow / South Tulsa area for inspection and cash. Thanks!"

It is in pretty nice condition but has been hunted with so it shows normal scratches from moving through the woods. Will shoot 5 Remington 2&3/4"" Accutip slugs into just  over 1"" at 50yds (I have a pic of the target from last fall's sight in session as evidence). I am thinking $500 for all or $400 and I keep the scope and rings (you get the scope base)."

While it's perfectly functional - 300 FMJ rounds and 25 HP rounds through with zero issues - I understand these extremely small blemishes which have no bearing on the gun's operation will turn some people off.

Or we can apply the same logic to value reduction.Your numbersGlock 26 $380 so $124 less than Budswhich would make your 442 worth $261 in equal comparison.but it's not equal since Glocks retain their resale value better than any 442/642.  So either way you would owe me cash on top.  Now keep in mind people I have made no such offer.  I just wanted to point out the hypocrisy.
