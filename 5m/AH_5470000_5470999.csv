This gun has been basically rebuilt and it's new internally. It has a new top latch so the lever is far right.

This is a fantastic pistol,looks and functions as new; with only two trips to the range.

This is a off roster pistol so the chances of you finding another one in California are slim to none.

Will include 92 rounds of loaded ammo with rifle for $900.Have a set of Redding reloading dies, case trimmer gauge, and im sure a little over 7lbs of Lil Gun powder for reloading (a must for this caliber) for an additional $200.Sale will most likely have to occur 24hours after final agreement due to all my firearms being stored off site at a close friends (due to the obvious reasons).Feel free to text me on my cell phone @ REDACTED. My name is David.Ps they only let me pick one picture, so sorry.Upper is a Tromix 458 socom setup with aftermarket freefloat tube. Currently has a thread protector installed but also has a custom cut JP lo-pro brake.Lower is a PSA multi with black MOE furniture.Optic included (if wanted) is a UTG 3-9x32 (iirc) red/green illuminated mil-dot scope with qd rings.Loaded ammunition (92/93rds) consists of 300gr hornady JHP's that have a MV of 1,600fps (+/-). Current loading are intended with case longevity in mind. Loads have been tested well into 1,800fps and nearing 2,000fps. Current loading (1,600fps) resulted in a full vital passthrough on a white-tail at 50yd (+/-), so much more exotic expansion bullets will yield excelent results on common deer.Optional stuff:Redding reloading die set consisting of a FL sizer, bullet seat, and crimp dies as well as shell holder.7+lbs of Hodgdon Lil Gun powder used in current load. I purchased an 8lb container and only loaded about one batch out of it before my current situation.Case trimmer gauge. Not a lot of options here for the 458. I have a pilot bit that works with the lee trimmers."
