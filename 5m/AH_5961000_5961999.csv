Rugged construction makes the 6X Raptor very reliable, and is one of the most accurate imaging devices available to professional shooters. This powerful night vision sight is the envy of the competion, and is often compared to their top-of-the-line products. If you want good enough, look elsewhere. If you want excellence, get the 6X Raptor. No other night vision scope can match its performance, ease of operation, or range detection. This scope means business, but delivers pleasure!Desinged to meet strict military requirements for extreme long range accuracy, the 6X Raptor can be mounted on almost any weapon with an M1913 (Picatinny) Rail, and can withstand the shock of full automatic fire of weapons such as the M4, M240, and M60. It can also withstand the recoil of high caliber sniper rifles, including .50 BMG (12.7 x 99 mm). This weapon sight incorporates a MIL-DOT reticle (some models use the Chevron reticle) with variable brightness control, and can be zeroed with separate windage and elevation adjustments. An Objective Lense Cover or Daylight Cover is a rubber cap that protects the objective lense, as well as the image tube, from accidental exposure to bright light. This daylight cover can be utilized for training and bore sighting during low-light conditions such as dawn, dusk, or overcast days, by means of a small hole in the center. For night use, the cover can be pulled back on top of the sight. This Daylight Cover may be needed on night with a full moon, especially with snow covered terrain. A pressure operated rubber 'Shuttered' Eyegaurd consists of a molded rubber eyecup and an adapter ring which protects the eyepiece optics, provides operator protection from recoil, and prevents light scatter from the image tube from illuminating the operator's face. Optional extended shuttered eyeguards are available. The Objective Focus Knob is used to focus the 6X Raptor for range. With a single wrist movement, the lens can be adjusted to focus on distant objects from 98 feet (30 m) to Infinity. The Elevation and Windage knobs control the reticle position so that the sight can be zeroed on the weapon. The Eyepiece Focus Ring can be rotated to adjust the eyepiece focus from -6 to +2 diopters to suit the individual user.Typical operating range is:2,425 yards\ Moonlight1,695 yards\ Starlight840 yards\ Cloud Cover6X RAPTOR FEATURES:-6X Magnification-5.7 degree Circular FOV (Field Of View)-0.2 MIL Elevation and Windage Adjustment-MILDOT Reticle-Common AA Battery Operation-14"" x 4.5"" x 4.5""-Weighs 5 lbs 8 oz-Shock Protected Optics that are Combat Proven-High Resolution 64lp-72/mm Minimum-Bright Source Protection-Auto Bright ControlSYSTEM TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-Generation 3-64-72 lp/mm Resolution-100 mm diameter Objective Lens-30 mm Eye Relief minimum-1800 typical Photoresponse-19:1 typical Signal to Noise ratio-6X Magnification-5.7 degree circular Field of View-98 feet (30 m) to Infinity Focus Range--6 to +2 Diopter Adjustment-5 lb 8 oz Weight-2 AA Batteries-55 hour Battery Life with Lithium AA Batteries-14"" x 4.5"" x 4.5"" Dimensions$6,000 when purchased newYour Price: $2,995Shipped within the United States only and to US Citizens only.

Stock is not original to the rifle, it is a late 1944 - early 1945 semi kriegsmodell but the handguard is matched to the rifle and has the same serial number as the rifle does. There are no RC or Yugo stamps on the rifle or the stock. There is a very light import stamp on the keel of the barrel towards the front sight. Very difficult to make out the importer. All visible numbers on metal parts match, except for number on the butt plate. Receiver, rear sight parts, trigger guard, handguard, front bands all match, floor plate has no markings or number. The bolt does not have a serial number on it, not sure if it was issued this way or it was removed, however the bolt does have an “eagle ‘1’ “ stamp on both the receiver and a “1” on the underside of the bolt, so the bolt is definitely Gustloff Werke manufacture and is correct for the rifle, if it were issued without a serial number, which did happen on occasion. All waffenamt eagles have been cleanly peened out, following the outline of the eagles. Bore is very good – excellent, good rifling, not a rotted out sewer pipe like most. Stock has a repair on the keel towards the rear. E-mail me for additional pictures. Selling for $750.00, FTF Frisco, Texas, cash only, no trades.

The XL7S is a rifle that you can be proud of.Scope: Leupold’s-exclusive FireDot® illuminated reticle gives you a bright, clear aiming point in any lighting condition. With eight intensity levels to choose from, it provides the precise illumination needed to match the conditions. A proprietary motion sensor automatically deactivates the illumination after five minutes of inactivity to conserve battery life and reactivates it as soon as motion is detected. A common CR-2032 coin-cell battery provides a remarkably long run time. Plus, fiber-optic light pipe eliminates the need for an eyepiece-based control module. Leupold’s legendary Index Matched Lens System™ combines with edge-blackened, lead-free lenses for astonishing clarity and light transmission. Extreme fast-focus eyepiece ensures optimal diopter adjustment in the field. 30mm main tube and finger-click adjustments assure maximum adjustment precision. Second-generation waterproofing resists fogging more effectively than standard nitrogen.Mount: DNZ Products Game Reaper ring mounts attach directly to the receiver, offering a rock solid ring and base combination that eliminates any seams between the firearm and scope. Game Reapers are made from lightweight aluminum so they are 1/3 the weight of other mounting systems.Case: This case has an O ring 6 latch design making it water tight and keeping dust out. There is a low profile pressure relief valve. There are three pieces of foam inside which are uncut. Interior dimensions 51"" x 12.5""."

$560 in cash or a little better in trade.  Looking for a folding brace for a Sig P556 and a nice replacement trigger.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18""
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

This rifle is absolutely gorgeous. It has had a total of 120 rounds of federal 7.62x51 147 gr xm80 shot through it. I bought it new last year and absolutely loved the gun however I am getting married in a month and so money is tight. Naturally I want a new rifle but that means one has to go! This rifle is in excellent condition. It features a medium weight national match barrel and national match front and rear sights. It comes with one 20 round, 1 10 round and 1 5 round magazine. It also has the sadlak gas piston cleaning tool kit, and a GI cleaning rod and combo tool. I am also including a syringe of xf-7 grease for lubricating the action after cleaning. All garand action rifles should be lubricated with grease and not oil for proper function. And finally to cap things off the rifle will come with a tan pelican 1750 hard case to store everything in. The foam is not glued down so you can make changes to the cut outs if desired as well as start fresh with entirely new foam if that's the way you want to go. Foam can be purchased relatively cheap online. All told this setup would cost you around $2300 new and it can be yours for $1600. So for the price of just the rifle new you can have a like new m1a, cleaning and servicing tools, extra magazines, and a pelican case! The rifle will also include the original cardboard box it came in as well as all original manuals and papers. You won't find a better deal than this.Any interested parties may contact me at 608-two one five-0776 or via the contact seller feature of this website. If you require any extra photos or specific close ups just let me know and I'll try to meet your requests. Thank you for your time."
