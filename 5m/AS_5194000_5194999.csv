It's a new, U.S. factory made G-3  HK91 made by PTR on former Portuguese HK factory tooling in South Carolina. Less than 200 rounds through it, only had time to go shooting twice. Comes with black A3 furniture w/ bipod, surplus Olive Drab slimline furniture, surplus german army cleaning kit, 15+ mags, 200 rounds high quality ammo, rifle case, extra trigger group, extra steel grip and more I've probably forgotten. Price reduced $1,100 for everything. Please don't waste my time and I wont waste yours. I can show it downtown during the days or evenings.  I love this gun but I need to money to pay for a motorcycle project which I love more."

It also comes with 20 Speer gold dot hollow point defense rounds in 45 gap.  I bought this as a police trade in basically because it was in such good condition I could not pass it up. They had a brand new one and I compared it with this one and I could hardly tell the difference (field stripped this one and the new one and could hardly tell the difference). What the dealer said is it was likely bought by the department and they over ordered so it was not used but is still considered used because it had left the dealer.  This thing has never been holstered, and I put 50 rounds through it (more than likely the first time it was ever shot) gave it a good cleaning and put it away in its factory case where it has remained for a few months. I am selling it because I shoot 9mm all the time and just don't like the bigger calibers as much. It is chambered in 45 gap.  Many professional reviews of this gun say it is one of the best balanced glocks available (I agree with that assessment). I usually don't like how glocks feel but this thing is very comfortable and is a great shooter.  The gun, finish (really beautiful finish on the gen 3s), chamber, barrel, mags, box, manual (still sealed), are all like new in box and pretty much indistinguishable from a brand new package. With the night sights and caliber this is ideal for home defense. I misplaced the ""factory lock"" it came with so I threw in one from an h&k vp9 I had laying around so it says h&k unsteady of glock on the side of the lock.This gun will need to be transferred at a gun shop with transfer fee on the buyer. I will do the transfer at any shop within 45 minutes of Pittsburgh, preferably at guns priced right in Dravosburg. The transfer will need to be done either on a week night after five or on the weekend (I work full time).  NO TRADES, cash only. Thanks."

Just google the reviews (the Sootch00 YouTube channel has an excellent review titled ""C-308 Battle Rifle Review), and you'll see this is a sought after rifle with limited availability.Chambered in the hard hitting .308/7.62 NATO, this rifle is both accurate and powerful. One of the best features of the C308 is a welded picatinny rail. If you've ever tried to mount a scope on an HK91 variant with a clamp style mount, you'll appreciate this feature.The only modification I've made is the addition of a short pic rail under the barrel to allow attachment of a bipod.Includes two twenty round steel mags. Extra mags are plentiful and cheap on the market. Original box included.MSRP on these is $699. Less than 200 rounds have been shot through this rifle.Cash only - no trades.

I am in the process of taking photos. The M 48 has three changes from the German K 98. Its action and bolt were made shorter to reduce cycle time in cocking and extracting rounds. Secondly the butt plate was redesigned to cup the entier end of the stock replacing the plate. Lastly the follower was made to allow the bolt to ride forward eliminating the need to depress it. Their is also a smll change on the top of the stock with one more handguard than the K 98. Other than that, it is a Mauser built on german technology  after WWIIIf your looking for a pristine Mauser that was a WWII weapon that was never issued never fired, and is new, this is it.This rifle has all its original parts in new condition. This rifle is not for every one but someone who wants and can afford a one of a kind new, unfired mauser manufactured circa 1956Photos are in processFeel free to contact me with any questions."

With its low felt recoil and self-loading action, the Model 82A1 offers rapid, accurate firepower that never slows down.For more than three decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so infinitely precise it is hard to believe it's man-made.As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot."

It is very nice and tight, the bluing is is excellent condition, the wood looks great with a small chip but looks like he didn't use it much during its lifespan.I am home all day usually except for the occasional trip somewhere.  I am located at Southfield and Allen rd area in Allen Park.  Just of Southfield freeway.Thanks Dan REDACTEDOh I have plenty of pictures.Price is $1000 FIRM"

For those who don't know this was one of the most accurate surplus rifles ever made and it fires the powerful 7.62x54r round. This rifle is in great condition for the age, and actually comes with the original hang tag. Made by VKT or valmet this was a solid built rifle and still has a great bore, shiny and strong rifiling throughout.  The wood is actually in good condition no heavy scratches or cracks, metal is in good shape, some numbers match but not all. Barrel is a 1942 and marked with SA and a ""D"" which means it was rechambered at some point in its life. This rifle is a shooter 2"" groups at 100 with iron sights used it on a hog hunt last month.  I can get pics on request or whatever details you need. Asking 400 OBO make me an offer but these are only going up in value and not a whole lot left. Would like to sell this week.  Thanks"

I am driving from Fresno and will be willing to meet in town or any of the surrounding counties, or outside of it. The areas I am willing to meet at are Merced, Modesto, Los Angeles, and San Luis Obispo. If you would like to meet half way or at least a little out of your way, that would be appreciated but not expected. Because this gun is off roster, it cannot be shipped to an FFL and a face to face meeting at an FFL has to be done between you the seller and me the buyer. This means the seller (you) has to go there once and the buyer (me) will have to go twice.

All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; Includes 2-15 Round Magazines. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.Features:Caliber: 9mmCapacity: 15Number of Mags: 2Barrel Length: 4.09""Finish: BlackFrame: PolymerAction: Double OnlyType: Semi-AutomaticOverall Length: 7.34""Rate of Twist: 1:9.8""Sights: 3 Dot, Radioactive LuminousAdditional Features: 2 Additional Backstraps, Ambi Slide & Mag Release, and 2 Add.
