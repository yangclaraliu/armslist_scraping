The BL-22 also has the shortest throw of any 22 lever action (only 33 degrees) and the trigger is captive with the trigger guard so you won't pinch your fingers. It has a 20"" barrel with an elevation-adjustable folding  rear sight. This rifle is in excellent condition, very clean, and the action is smooth and tight. I bought this rifle used about 3 years ago, and the only blemish is a few small nicks on the stock. It has a sling swivel drilled in the stock and another on the magazine tube, and a Browning brand sling is attached. Also included are the manual and a soft padded case.

Black Armory coat finish. This gun is very lightly used with only 400 rounds through it and has proven to be reliable and very accurate thus far. Very low recoil thanks to the big bull barrel and the heavier railed frame. It comes with the (pictured) set of VZ 320 grips in Dirty Olive (green and black). The gun comes with everything from the factory including the original aggressive textured grips, two mags, and the holster and mag carrier.$1500 OBRO, face to face in Ellenton. Buyer needs to have a Florida Driver's License and a FL CCW permit. I'm not deperate to sell it off. If I can't get a resonable offer on it, then I will hold onto the gun until election time, and who knows what the market will look like at that point. If you think you can find it cheaper, then go ahead and buy it there; don't waste my time. NO TRADES."

Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany.
