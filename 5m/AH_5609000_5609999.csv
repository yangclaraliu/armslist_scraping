The rifle is very lightweight and user friendly (only 4.5lbs)  Breakdown occurs easily via a simple push pin similar to breaking down an AR upper/lower and is easily packed into a bug out bag or backpack when folded.  It's amazing how compact you can get this rifle, to the point of no one expecting your backpack to have a full size rifle in it.
AR sights, AR mags, AR caliber, more compact, lighter, and less expensive; this is the perfect option for an AR alternative.
 
Comes wth brand new infactory box/paperwork and 2 - 10rd Kel Tec magazines.  This rifle has not been fired at all and is in brand new condition."

The gun also has the extended beaver tail frame, mag well grips and picatinny rail. By far my favorite part of the gun vs a standard 226 is the short reset trigger. If you compare this trigger with a standard trigger, it's a night and day difference. The gun has a fairly low round count and has been taken care of, never carried. I'm open to trade offers. I am thinning my handgun collection and if others sell, this is one I will keep without hesitation. It's a very nice gun.

I like the looks of the new Springfield EMP 4"" 9mm and figure if I sell this one I'll buy one of them.  Not interested in other trades except maybe a Sig or Springfield 1911 with night sights.  I can't get pics to upload here but I can text them from my phone if you send me a text at 785 458 two nine seven six.  Thanks for looking."
