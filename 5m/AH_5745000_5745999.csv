$450 firm in cash.
Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific up front as it makes it a lot easier.  I don't mind questions at all(cash buyers no problem), but please don't string things along with 10-20 messages only to offer a crap trade in the end.  State the details up front if it's a trade, so I can tell you if I am interested or not.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  A few things I might use or use more of:  
Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts(no std. triggers wanted), nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  FosTech Echo trigger.
Quality stamped AK-47 with side rail for optic mount, preferably with a nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock would be a plus.  I really like the RAS47 with the nicer trigger groups and Zhukov furniture, but I've read about too many problems with their cast trunnions an bad/faulty rivets.
Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" model only.
Maybe a quality 9mm or 45ACP pistol with ""arm brace"", Ideally a good deal on a Sig MPX Gen 2 with folding arm brace or similar, so I can change out the trigger easily, I like nice triggers, otherwise, I would consider the CZ Scorpion or others.  Maybe a KRISS in either caliber.  I want something with a good trigger, so thinking a piston AR 9mm pistol will be easiest and best value, again, I want something compact.  
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56, Federal preferred.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech or Vortex magnifier, maybe two Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle and 1-2 with 7.62x39 reticle.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship for $30 more.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

I have had these stored away in a plastic tote container for quite sometime now and it's time to let them go. I will list all 5 with the following descriptions:-Colt Woodgrain style box with the correct sleeve and styrofoam insert. One end flap has had some very slight inside tape repair to it to keep it intact but both flaps are still there and true to the box. The styrofoam insert is in great shape and it does include the Python manual that is copyright dated 1978. The box will fit up to an 8"" double action revolver including all double action Snake revolvers but the correct time period would be for the Python or Diamondback. It also includes other various paperwork items, original gun bag, and the original yellow hang tag. There is no end label on the box so it is not permanent to any certain gun currently. Price- $150Colt Maroon Heritage of Craftsmanship style box with styrofoam insert. This box would be great suited for any 2 1/2"" or 4"" double action Colt revolver and Colt 1911 style automatic up to a 5"" barrel length. This box does have both end flaps intact and does not include a paper label, however, it does have the permanent end flap label that has never been filled out. It does include all Colt paperwork, hang tag, gun bag, and the styrofoam Red Tape. It does not include a specific gun manual. This box could have possibly came with several different model Colts from the factory, most likely during the 80's Era. Price-$100-Colt Woodgrain style box with a tan/light brown styrofoam insert. This box is not in the best shape and does not include either end flap. It is indeed for a double action Colt revolver but I will not be specific on which exact one. It looks that at some point in it's life that someone modified the styrofoam insert to hold a box of ammo. Therefore, it would only be suited for shorter barreled Colt revolvers. This box would be good to just keep your gun stored in away from harm or certain elements. Price-$50-Blue Colt Plastic injection molded box for a Colt Mark IV/Series 80 .380 automatic pistol. It does have both black plastic locking tabs intact and the overall box is in great shape. It does include the factory Colt manual that is Copyright dated 1993. The box will suit the follow guns: Government Model, Government Pocketlite, Mustang, Mustang Plus II, and Mustang Pocketlite. Price-$75-Blue Colt Plastic injection molded box for a smaller D-Frame Colt Revolver. It does have both black plastic locking tabs intact and the overall condition is in great shape. It does include the Colt Manual that includes the following list of models: Detective Special, Diamondback, Police Positive, Commando Special, Agent, Cobra, and Viper.

Built for 3-gun, this is easily the softest shooting rile i've ever shot, thanks to the low mass bcg, rifle length gas system, adj gas and brake. Shooting it side by side with a standard carbine is comical. Little to no muzzle rise, and with an unloaded weight of just under 6 pounds, this is an easy turn-key solution to rifle competition. Rifle comes pre-tuned to run on off the shelf 55gr American Eagle ammo, and the gas block's 15 position detent system makes adjustments incredibly easy.

The first set is a set of rubber Colt grips from the Colt Custom Shop. I say that because they originally only came on the Colt Grizzly and Colt Kodiak from the factory, however they will fit all V-Frame double action revolvers including the Colt Anaconda, King Cobra, Grizzly, Kodiak, Boa, and Trooper Mark V. These specific grips are finger grooved and have silver medallions with Colt inscribed in black. These are not commonly seen unless you are looking at the two Bear model Colts. The rubber on the grips is in real nice shape with very minor wear shown. The second set of grips are a custom made laminated wood grips with a gloss green/black combination finish. They too are finger grooved and are in great shape and will fit all listed above Colt V-Frame revolvers. I would consider $50 each for these sets. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

This IS my current EDC so I am not looking to really sell this one but I thought I would leave it listed just in case there are any FNH fans out there I can help out.  It comes with three magazines: 12 round flush, 12 round finger extension, 17 round with sleeve. (all will be blocked internally to 10 rounds...ugh... sorry...CA law)The mags are blocked to hold 10 rounds each but not destroyed. Factory installed tritium night sightsPrivate party transfer only (no trades)Enjoy and have a great day!"

Pocket sized with upward folding trigger.I bought this gun (the .32) at an antique gun show and thought that it was a really neat gun.  The seller did not reveal at time of purchase that the gun needs some work to be fully functional.I knew that the safety was missing, and could tell that the firing pin was not the original and someone had made it themself.  The biggest issue is that the piece which should hold the bullet revolver in place after rotating is missing.  After I tried firing it for the first time, the firing pin moved backwards.My grandfather tried to help me fix the firing pin in place with a torch and some solder, however this did not completely fix the problem.I have fired a couple of rounds with it, but not by pulling the trigger.  I was able to fire the primer manually by using my thumb to pull the hammer back further than the trigger and release it.  This struck the primer with enough force to fire a round.One of the plastic grips has a small chip missing.  Both sides have a pretty neat relief of a head (similar to a coin).It's still a really neat looking antique and with some restoration would be an awesome piece.  Even without restoration it is a unique antique with a cool look.I am giving full disclosure (unlike the original seller).I'm looking to get $100 or best offer (or trade for a shotgun or other small handgun).  Will include a mostly full box of Browning 7.65 Auto (aka .32 ACP).I'm especially interested in a 12 gauge of some sort just for home defense(prefer pump, but would consider semi-auto, single, or double barrel), mainly bc I already have some sub lethal shells and bird loads in 12ga, but shoot me an offer with anything.  Even if it's a really crappy 12ga I don't care as long as it's functional.  I'm even interested in other shotguns or rifles, too, but must be functional and preferably include at least a little ammo, but ammo not a deal breaker.This pistol is interesting as a conversation piece if nothing else.  I would love to trade this ASAP.  I'm also very interested in a trade for a small handgun of some sort.  Please make me an offer.  Motivated seller!"

I'm wanting to move the pistol this week and I'll take a look at all cash offers.

You also won't pay tax or shipping.  These are the 22TCM, not the 22TCM-R. They will not fit the pistols (Glock, EAA) that were retrofitted for it.If there seems to be the beginning of something we could work into a deal here, please help an injured (I dislike the label ""Disabled"") vet, get in touch.  We'll see if we can find some middle ground.   It's a special gun that you can't always find.  Before (the very day before) I bought the 17+1 version, I had bought the 10+1 version.  On impulse, I sold the 10+1 on the way to meet the guy who sold me the 17+1.  A long time ago, A number of years ago, my right hand was slamed in the turret of a hmmwv. The army tried to fix it a couple of times, but to no avail.  As a result, my injured right hand cannot grip the wide grip on the hi-cap version.  I wish I had the standard capacity back.  That is the objective here.You'll be helping out a veteran who is recovering from cancer and has 3 kids, 2 of which are in college.  I am fortunate enough to have kids who like to come out and shoot as a family related passtime.  As we all know, the family that plays together and prays together, stays together.  I whink we're doing pretty well on those fronts.  If you cansee to your own family's fun with this gun and help us out, it will be appreciated."

No other part of the firearm in the pictures is for sale. This is the stock that I started my long range precision shooting with for several years. I had my Howa 1500 sitting in this stock, but you can also use it for the Weatherby Vanguards as well. This is a very lightweight and quality stock, it is for sure the most clearance I have ever seen in terms of a free floating barrel. I was able to produce sub MOA groups with my rifle and this stock out to 800 and even 1000 yards, it has built in recoil reducing features that helped mediate the kick from my 20 inch bull barrel. You will be able to throw your action and barrel right into this stock with absolutely no gunsmithing needed. The stock already has aluminum pillars so it is ready to rock and roll right away. You WILL get better accuracy out of your factory rifle with this stock. Not to mention it has the chassis look that everyone is raving about now. This is in perfect condition, on the buttstock I had to do a little modification due to the bolt rubbing the area behind the tang, this is something that everyone I talked to said they had to do on theirs as well. Besides that there are no blemishes on this stock.I dont need to sell this per say, but i am in the market for a new scope so I would like the money to put into a quality optic. That being said if you have a scope to trade I would be open to options. This is priced well below what they are currently going for, brand new from Midway they are $200 after tax, and they retail for $250. I am asking for $125 cash or Trade for a new scope"

I had this sitting on my Howa 1500 in .308 and was able to shoot MOA groups consistently. This has an illuminated mil-dot reticle, and 1/8 click MOA turrets. It has the 30mm tube that everyone is wanting now a days and the side parallax adjustment.This scope has served me very well, I am looking to step up my game a little bit and put some more money into the optics. Functionally there is nothing wrong with this scope, I would be happy running it on any of my rifles, its just time for an upgrade. I am asking $225 for the scope, the retail is $379 but they can be found for around $300 online, so I feel that $225 is a very fair price.I am also open to trades, like I said I am trying to upgrade scopes so if you have an offer shoot it over.Thanks for your time!"

Surplus from the Hungarian army. Condition is excellent; I would rate it between 85% – 90%.  Capacity is 7+ 1, safety is a slide mounted, lever style decocker/safety. The gun has had a trigger and recoil action upgrade from Wolf spring company. Cycles smoothly with a clean and crisp trigger pull. Accuracy and reliability are second to none. This makes a great concealed carry gun due to its small size and relatively light weight for an all steel handgun. It is balanced well to minimize muzzle rise and to refuse recoil impulse. It's a smooth shooter. Own a piece of world firearms history with this Soviet era sidearm. Included are 150 rounds of 9X18 Makarov ammunition from federal, factory recoil and hammer spring set, original army issue leather flap belt holster with mag pouch (80% condition), two 7rd factory mags with pinky rests, and a hard plastic caseAsking $300"

This is an awesome shooter, and very fun. With the 7"" full lugged barrel, shooting the hottest 357's don't even sting the slightest. As for accuracy... Well, I can't seem to miss with the thing. There is only one reason I'm willing to part with this is because I added another S&W 357 that has won favor over this one, and I'm saving up for a second vehicle to drive during the winter so I don't tear up my Mustang.The grips are Rosewood AG/Target grips that replaced the original round butt grips (that looked utterly silly with the long barrel) and they were made by Altamont who makes all the wood grips for S&W, and have the correct S&W medallions. They fit snug and personally I love them. This gun has about 1000 rounds through it.This has the original case, manual, and test fired case. It also comes with 3 HKS brand speedloaders. I cannot supply ammo as all of it is reloads, so please don't ask me to throw ammo in!I'm in no way desperate to get rid of this pistol. So don't insult me with idiotic low ball offers. Anything less than what its worth, I'd rather keep it!Buyer must meet me within 5 miles of Kettering, Ohio. In a public, gun friendly area (i.e. close to a gun shop) I will not meet you out in the middle of nowhere! No shipping, Don't ask!"
