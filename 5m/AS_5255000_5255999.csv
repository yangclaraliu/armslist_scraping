That way the holdover adjustment on your target would be the same regardless of the magnification level your scope was on.   The next problem that many run into while shooting high power scopes is it doesn’t matter how much your scope magnifies if the image is blurry you cannot take the shot.  The B.E.A.S.T. shreds all doubt of image clarity at 25 magnification by being one of very few to ever reach 90% light transmission approaching the maximum level possible by a riflescope.  New features on the B.E.A.S.T.’s turrets take it above and beyond any competitors.  With XtremeSpeed adjustments on the 34mm tube enable a 60 MOA, 20 Mil-Radians, of elevation adjustment in a single rotation with a total of 120 MOA of adjustments exceeding the maximum effective range of any known cartridge.  While the main turret adjusting in increments of .5MOA /.2 Mil-Radians there is a lever at the base of the turret the increases the adjustment by .25MOA/.1Mil-Rad.  With ZeroStop in the mix you can always easily return to your set zero without looking.  On the top of the elevation turret there is now a 360-degree brake control which enables you to lock you elevation adjustment in by pushing down and rotating the knob 90 degrees counter clockwise.  This ensures you don’t knock your precise adjustment off during any maneuvering to get in the perfect shooting position.  Surprisingly that isn’t even all the B.E.A.S.T. has to offer.  The new DigIllum illuminated reticle technology enables the shooter to choose the appropriate color and strength of the illumination for their specific situation.  The DigIllum technology now has 400 hours of illumination with one battery life with an automatic shutoff feature after an hour of illumination so you never have to worry about leaving the illumination on and killing the battery by accident.  The B.E.A.S.T. is by far the most advanced multifunctional scope in one that exists today.  Nothing comes close.   Magnification Range:   5X to 25XObjective Diameter:   56mmTube Size/Mount:   34mmLength/Weight:    14.3"" / 38 oz.Field Of View:    18.7 ft @ 5X; 4.92 ft @ 25XEye Relief:    3.35”-3.54” (85-90mm)Turret Adjustment/Click Value:  .25 and .5 MOA/ .1 and .2 Mil-RadElevation/Windage Adjustment Range: 120MOA or 34.9Mil elev./ 80MOA or 23.27Mil wind.Zero Stop:    YesReticle:      MOARReticle Illumination:    DigIllumReticle Focal Plane:    FirstScope Finish:     Matte BlackWarranty:    Nightforce Limited Lifetime"

One micro scratch behind Colt horse insignia approximately 2mm in length. One small wear spot on front corner of crane assembly. And finally, one small mark above rear trigger guard. Very slight wear in bluing at barrel tip endge left side (barely noticeable).This looks as if it has never been fired. Inner barrel is bright and shows no wear. All bluing on cylinder is perfect with only slight wear on the advance mechanism (ratchet). No evidence of it ever being loaded. Striker pin has absolutely no wear- all buing intact and hammer has no rust. Mechanism is perfect- tight with no looseness whatsoever. Front sight shows no wear. Cylinder shows no wear. Mainspring flawless with no rust. No wear on trigger.I have not seen a finer example of a First Model Colt Cobra. From the minimal wear only on one side, it looks as if it sat in a drawer nearly its entire life and got the few small wear marks it has by things being placed on top of it. Even the ejector rod has its full original bluing without wear. Grips are clean walnut with only the slightest wear. Overall, I believe you will not find one in better condition. I sincerely wish I were in this good shape at 46 years of age!These guns are rare to begin with, but finding one in this condition is nearly impossible (until now).$750.00 o.b.o.Thank you for looking."

This is factory built, and at the top end of CORE Rifle Systems offerings! CORE TAC lll M4 loaded to the gills with top-end upgrades and finished in a beautiful burnt bronze cerakote. I am the original owner but CORE offers a lifetime no BS warranty which covers anything and everything no matter what happens, and no matter if the rifle changes hands 50 times. Arguably the best warranty in the industry! Founded and operated by veterans that know how to put out a quality rifle built to extremely high standards. The rifle is like new with only one range trip, totaling 90 rounds. Mid-length gas system on a Mil-Spec 1:7 twist rate CMROV 4150 black nitride barrel. It took roughly $3560 to put this perfect racehorse together so please be respectful with offers. I don't expect to get near what I've got in it. I will sell it as it sits for $2550 (over a grand less than I have in it) or I can keep parts you may not want in order to work out a lower price. I'm also open to trade + cash.

From http://www.diamondbackfirearms.com/product?id=22:
 
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. Feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. Lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. Cross bolt style safety.

The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG."
