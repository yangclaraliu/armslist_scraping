This is a very nice, small pistol that is a great gun for pocket carry. It is a traditional double/single action pistol with a tip-up barrel and a manual safety. The double action pull is long enough for safe carry without the safety engaged. This would make a great defensive pistol for someone who might have difficulty manipulating the slide of most semi-automatic pistols as the tip-up barrel design eliminates the need to rack the slide to chamber a round. Additionally, you get a few more rounds than a traditional five shot revolver (7+1). I've shot many small 32 Autos and this one is by far the most reliable. I've never had a jam with this gun cycling all sorts of ammunition--it has been flawless. Even wide hollowpoints feed perfectly. While the 32 is considered ineffective by many nowadays, with quality modern ammunition a user can place many rounds on target very fast with a gun like this. And with some factory loadings reaching around 1000 fps, this cartridge isn't something to scoff at. This is a really nice quality gun that could be used for defense or just as a collector's piece. The gun comes with one magazine and its original plastic case.All laws will be followed."

This is a 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Model 06390, Mustang 380 semi-automatic pistol, manufactured in 1986.  In Like-NEW Condition, with the rare 150th anniversary silver medallions on the handgrips, 100% of original Colt blue finish, machined from solid block hardened-steel (no cheap polymer, zinc alloys or aluminum as found in recent Colts).  What is a 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mustang, how could Colt make a semi-auto pistol for 150 years?  The anniversary refers to Colt, which was created in 1836 and celebrated its 150-year anniversary in 1986. In 1836 there were only percussion revolvers, there were no semi-automatics.  So for only 1986, a special box was made with a 150 year emblem, and the Colt Mustang was given a special silver medallion with the number “150” above the horse’s legs.  These Mustangs were made only in 1986 and they were made to tight tolerances.  The 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mustang is therefore a rare and high quality firearm.  
 
Only one round was test fired from this 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mustang; I purchased it from a dealer in 1986, along with Federal hydra-shock ammo (ammo still has $8.99 price sticker) and I kept both in the night stand by my bed for personal protection for 40 years.  There are no scuff marks, no wear-marks, no scratches.  Included are the factory box, Colt manual, and all original paperwork (including a letter from Gary French, the President of Colt). 
 
Great defense weapon – small, accurate and solid as a tank.  It has a 2 3/4” barrel, 6 round capacity, 5” overall length.  Do not compare this solid steel, 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Mustang 380 semi-automatic pistol to the flimsy, cheap plastic, and aluminum versions, this is a precision milled weapon that is solid like a tank!
 
My asking price is $850 cash, no trades.  The fair market value of a 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV/Series 80, Mustang .380 is $895 to $1,000. Even the non-anniversary editions of the Mark IV, Series 80 Colt Mustang are all priced in the $700’s, do a search here at Armslist for “Colt Mark IV/Series 80 Mustang” and see for yourself that even the non-anniversary edition is in the $700 range!
 
As you can see, my $850 asking price is a bargain.  Remember, cash only, no trades!"

I used this for exactly 23 rounds before I replaced it with an Alexander Arms bolt. This one works, just locked up a little too tight in the barrel I was using (my guess is due to the chrome coating adding a few thousandths thickness to it), so I replaced it. $100 for the bolt; Type II bolt, mics out at 0.136 depth.- Two sets of 1911 grips, will fit a Government model or Commander size. First is a set of VZ and the second is a set of Magpul grips. Both are in excellent condition (color on both is black). $35 for both pairs.- Last is a Glock 19 model for forming holsters. Has a continuous rail on the top of the slide to allow a channel to be formed in a Kydex holster to clear the front sight when drawing. This is unused; bought it for a project that I ended up not completing and I have not use for it as it is; free with purchase of any of the packages listed above or $20 by itself. Thanks for looking and please feel free to ask any questions. I have photos of everything listed and would be happy to provide them to anyone interested since Armslist limits photos to 3 for the listing. More than happy to ship where legal to own. Only trade interests would be face-to-face for new or excellent condition Mark III 22/45 magazines or 30 round .223/5.56 magazines from Magpul, C-Products, Lancer or Barnes TSX or TTSX bullets in 100 or 120 grain weights in .264 caliber, plus cash.

This sweet little gun is in immaculate condition, considering it was manufactured in 1959.

Referring to the shape of the bottom of the pistol grip and the longer tang that extends down the length of the grip. It sports 28"" barrels with a vented rib. The top barrel is modified choke, bottom is improved. Bluing is in great shape, I'd give it 92-95% condition with minor wear in the normal handling places (on the tang and around the safety/selector). The wood is in great shape.
