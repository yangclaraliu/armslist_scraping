It's a hair but too big on me, I'm 5'11"" and 150 lbs, skinny guy. The camo pattern is strong and not faded like surplus ones you get. I bought it brand new and wore it twice just for size. It comes with built in removable shoulder, elbow, and forearm pads in the sleeve. it had Velcro on both sleeves for ID patches, also pockets on the sleeves. It's made for having under armor or a plate carrier. The middle material is very similar to under armor and is real nice and breathable. The sleeves are flame resistant And reinforced in the elbows. Other than that, I just wish the shirt fit me better. Nice shirt here for sale, these are usually quite pricey to get a nice one."

Built on the same technology that the military and law enforcement officers use, the M26C is an extremely powerful self defense weapon that puts the power in your hands.
It shoots a 15 foot electrical shock cord to freeze your attacker in the spot. This cord can pierce skin, clothing, and thick materials. Once activated the bad guy won’t be able to move and most likely will fall down in place – giving you plenty of time to get to safety and call the police.
The M26C is a serious self defense tool that can save your life and your families. If you are ready to take control of your protection – the M26 is a great start!SALE INCLUDES...

The small A behind the serial number on the trigger guard may be there if you have a bit of an imagination. The screw on the bottom of the grip will not come out so we do not know if the grips are serial numbered to the gun or not and cannot see if the number on the loading gate matches inside of the frame. The bore has some frosting but is very strong. The screw holding the cylinder pin looks to be a replacement and there is no dimple on the end of the cylinder pin. All in all this is a nice and very early Colt Single Action Army from the first batch of Ainsworth guns.This is an Antique."

done on Ruger Blackhawk convertible.  Replicated from the movie 3:10 to Yuma
(45LC & .45 ACP)
One of a Kind, beautiful work of art by Joe Perkins of ""Classic Single Action""
you can see my Hand of God displayed on his website 6th one down
classic single action dot com / refinishing
Spent almost 12 months on a waiting list for the basic gun then sent it away for another 8 months.
work done:
Bone & Charcoal color case harden / Premium Action Work / Hone & Chamfer Cylinders / he Hand created part to make Free Spin Sprawl 
Hand of God grip is real African Ebony EXACTLY fitted to the frame.
Crucifix is Gold alloy made with lost wax process.
2 holsters, Western style Cross Draw & Mernickle Stingray CCW 
Finsh on .45 ACP is antiqued to easily identify different calibers.
This Ruger is like no ruger blackhawk you have held, buttery smooth and the free spin sprawl is amazing.  
Dry fire practice all you want with a blackhawk.  I will include 1 LaserLyte cartridge in 45 acp ( for shooting from the hip practice, no need for ammo or a range.
I'm looking to start my next build project.  This is a stunning work of old world gunsmithing.
Any questions, feel free to ask.  Prefer to stay local but will ship to FFL if needed at buyers expense.

KRISS Vector GEN II CRB Flat Dark Earth, 9mm Caliber. Includes Factory Case, One Glock 17 Round Magazine, Manuals, Lock.FACTORY COMMENTS:Experience one of the most innovative developments in modern firearms technology with the patented KRISS Vector Platform. At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.  The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip. The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16” barrel. The DEFIANCE KRISS Stock provides a wide range of adjustment and length of pull. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine. The CRB is civilian legal with compliant models available for most states.REDACTED  ELITE PAWN & GUN7804 Garners Ferry RdColumbia SC 29209***CHECK OUT OUR WEBSITE FOR EVEN MORE GREAT DEALSwww.elitepawnsc.comwww.facebook.com/elitepawnandgunHOURS:Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri - 8:30am - 6:00pmWed - 8:30am - 5:00pmSat - 8:30am - 3:00pm"

Introducing the Henry Big Boy Carbine a modern carry-over of the “Trapper” classics of the past. It combines all the features of our legendary Big Boy rifle with the quick handling of a shorter, lighter carbine barrel length — losing almost a pound in barrel weight.
It’s the ideal brush gun for tight spaces, but don’t let its compact size fool you. The shorter barrel gives up nothing in accuracy to the regular Big Boy. This is still one hard to come. And like our classic Henry Big Boy the attention to detail in the design with great western styling including the large loop lever makes holding this rifle as thrilling as it is to shoot.
The 16.5” octagonal barrel is outfitted with a classic fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear sight with a reversible white diamond insert and a brass beaded front-sight. The tubular magazine tops off at 7 rounds.
Both the straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted of select American walnut accented with a brass barrel band and Henry’s recognizable brass receiver. All have that crisp, smooth action that sets an authentic American-made Henry apart from other lever action rifles on the range and in the woods today. The .44 Magnum can also shoot .44 special rounds, and the .357 Magnum can also shoot .38 special rounds.
Whether you’re looking for the perfect gun to saddle up with or to hog hunt across the Florida backwoods the Henry Big Boy Carbine is the big shot in a small package you’ve been waiting for.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this rifle online at www.copsgunshop.net"

Smith & Wesson had recently (c. 1915–16) produced the Hand Ejector, which uses their heavy .44 caliber frame, for the British Army in .455 Webley caliber due to shortages in British production facilities of standard-issue Webley Mk VI top-break revolvers.[1] The S&W M1917 is distinguishable from the Colt M1917 in that the S&W cylinder had a shoulder machined into it to permit rimless .45 ACP cartridges to headspace on the case mouth (as with automatic pistols). The S&W M1917 could thus be used without the half-moon clips, though the empty cases would have to be poked-out manually through the cylinder face, since the extractor star cannot engage the rimless cases.THIS PISTOL IS IN GOOD SHAPE AND IS IN 100% WORKING ORDER VERY COOL GUN THAT SHOOTS A MEAN ROUND!!!"
