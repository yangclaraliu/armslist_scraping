Due to the Swiss Federal Council's early 1866 decision to equip the army with a breechloading repeating rifle, the Vetterli rifles ere, at the time of their introduction, the most advanced military rifles in Europe.  The Vetterli rifle is was the replacement for Amsler-Milbank rifles, which were a metallic cartridge conversion from a previous Swiss Muzzle-reloading rifles.This antique comes with some original bullets and cases but I do not believe there is powder in the cases.  The original rod is with the rifle.   Nice antique rifle for  the collector."

You can be in the woods hunting or out on a 3D range later TODAY!!! I didn't hunt much with it. I shot two deer. I shot 3D events here and there when I had time.

IF THIS AD IS VISIBLE, THE GOODS ARE STILL FOR SALE!!!

Used very little. I can include stick-on target dots. • SKS Hard Travel/Storage Case. Never traveled with this case via the airlines. Like new condition. Has never been locked but keys are included. Originally bought at Cabela's. • Peak-to-Peak brand arm guard. If your forearm gets raked by the string, you'll NEVER fire a bow without one of these! • Scott finger release - Smooth and VERY comfortable to use. • Cobra 5-pin Sight-This sight was known as ""The Barber Pole"" sight because of its maximum light-gathering capability. I used pins set at 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60-yards for 3D archery gatherings.  • Trap Door rest - This rest drops out of the way as soon as the bow recoils. There are several arrow rest options available for the Trap Door. Mine has mole-skin padding to reduce noise. • Black/White rope wrist sling • Rubber hunting-length stabilizer • Limb-saver vibration dampeners • Cat Whiskers string silencers • Camo stretch fabric limb hardware covers for hunting. • Bohning plastic accessory box-I use it to keep broadheads, field points, string wax all of which are included. There will be extra broad head blades, rubber bludgeon tips, and other goodies • Six camo, Super Carbon -- Magnum 60-75 arrows that were bought with the bow originally • Ten Easton Lightspeed 400 carbon arrows equipped with Muzzy 90gr. Broadheads or field points • Camo quiet quiver The Hoyt Ultratec compound bow is a bow designed for the serious bow hunters who like to feel a sizeable bow in their hands. The bow was designed with a couple of different limbs used: the XT2000 limbs and the XT3000 limbs. There is a difference in performance and bow set up between the two limb choices and the specs below will reflect both configurations. The Tec riser was used through a large range of Hoyt bows and was very successful in minimizing the twisting, flexing and recoil of the bow under tension. In other words the torque of the bow was reduced which helped the archer keep the bow aligned through each shot. The length of the bow helps to make the bow very accurate and a pleasure to shoot. The cam systems that are available on the Ultratec are the Versa Cam & ½ system and the Excel cam & ½ system. The versatility of the Versa cam means that the bow will be adjustable over a wide range of lengths and this was the standard way in which Hoyt released their Ultratec bows due to the number of requests for the cam system. The Ultratec remains one of the bows that many serious archers will turn to when they want a high quality compound bow that they can rely on."
