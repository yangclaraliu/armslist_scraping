The first scene shows infantrymen landing on the beach during the D-Day invasion. Dodging a hail of bullets and artillery shells, soldiers dragged the Thompson through seawater and sand. Once they reached enemy positions, the last thing they needed was a misfire. The trusty Thompson rarely let them down. Also featured is an outline of the U.S.A. with the words, “Freedom Forever,” and a banner reading “Country Before Self,” both honoring the selfless contributions of America’s Soldiers. At the center, a soldier stands firing his Thompson.The right side of a Tribute to America’s Soldiers Thompson features an illustration of a soldier taking aim with his Thompson and banners that read, “Saluting America’s Soldiers” and “Defending Freedom”. The rest of the action on the right side of the receiver depicts scenes during WWII and the Korean and Vietnam Wars. In the North African campaign in WWII, soldiers wielded the Thompson alongside battle tanks during desert warfare. On the front lines of Korea, the soldiers distinguished themselves with the Thompson. Though the struggles and harsh conditions in Korea would push every soldier to the limit, the fighting spirit of America’s Soldiers carried on. In Vietnam, with helicopters in the background, soldiers relied on their Thompsons, often in the rice paddies and jungles."

The Clubfoot EMOD stock is 1"" longer than the original design to increase the available comb space and length of pull in all positions on the buffer tube to benefit those using magnified optics in a DMR role. The stock's Rubber Buttplate has been widened and lengthened at the toe, and has a noticeable Negative Pitch that enables faster, more natural transitions from the ready to firing positions. A sturdy Metal Strike Plate resides under the buttplate for use as an impact or compliance tool, and extra Water Resistant On-Board Storage options have been added in the form of 2 Removable Side Tubes capable of holding 4 CR123 or 3 AA batteries each, as well as a smaller Hinged Door Compartment located at the toe that's large enough to accommodate 2 more AA batteries or other small spare parts/tools. The EMOD's Butterfly Adjustment Lever is positioned and contoured to the stock in such a way as to strike a nice balance between ease of activation and security to ensure that it is not inadvertently depressed until the user wants to use it. Additional features include a durable polymer construction that is impervious to the elements, an integral top-mounted sling loop, and 2 QD Sling Swivel Sockets. Carbine Receiver Extension Tube, Carbine Buffer and Buffer Spring are NOT included with this EMOD Basic Buttstock assembly. Compatible with both AR-15 and AR-10 / LR-308 platform rifles when paired with the appropriate buffer spring and buffer.

Its regulator (time-measuring device) is a quartz crystal. An electrical current causes the crystal to vibrate very consistently and at a very high frequency (32,768 times per second). This gives the movement almost perfect precision (a variation of only a few seconds per month.)PERFORMANCETAG HEUER QUARTZ MOVEMENTS Quartz movements used by TAG Heuer are some of the most reliable and accurate made in Switzerland. They are also distinguished by excellent resistance to shocks and magnetic fields.DISPLAYTAG HEUER BATTERIES The batteries for TAG Heuer quartz movements have a service life of at least two years.DECORATIONEND-OF-LIFE INDICATOR For increased security, all TAG Heuer quartz watches(except chronographs) are ?tted with an end of battery life indicator (EOL). When the battery shows signs of weakening, the seconds hand starts making four-second jumps every four seconds. However, the movement continues to display the exact time until the battery is exhausted."

I can't afford range time anyway so it's just taking up space right now.I'm not a firearm aficionado so I can't tell you much about the specifics of it. All I can tell you is that it was second hand when I bought it and I don't know the round count, but personally I have put about 100 rounds through it with no hiccups. It's fun to shoot and very steady. It came with the scope in the picture and I added the tactical site, a red laser, and a flashlight. All of this will be included along with 5 30 round magazines, 2 of which are coupled together. I also have 1 box of ammo left over that I'll throw in. Also included is the tactical rifle bag you see in the picture.Here's what I really need. I'm in a bit of a jam, financial wise, and $1000 is what would get me settled.

I've only taken in out once and fired about 200 rounds through it. No FTE/FTFs. The rifle worked wonderfully. I just don't have the time to go out shooting as frequently anymore. Fully adjustable stock. CLEAN. Comes with a BUSHNELL red dot sight. The sight has several different brightness levels. It works GREAT if you have an astigmatism (I love EOTech and AIMpoint but both of those sights had me seeing two dots - after some google-fu, I found many other people with a similar issue and it's likely due to having an astigmatism). I have the original box for the bushnell and an extra button cell battery I'll throw in. The parts were roughly $1200; though, now, the same parts can be purchased for about $1000. I'm asking for $800 obo. I dont have have the parts list as I'm in the middle of moving but I'd be more than happy to try and find it. Local sale only and must be face to face. Cash only. Will come with about 50 rds of .223. Will come with one 30rd magazine. I WILL be asking you to sign a bill of sale (for my records only)."

Swedish Mauser rifle in 6.5x55 caliber. The Swedish Mauser rifles are regarded as one of the best-made and most accurate Mauser-type rifles ever produced. The caliber and the rifle are known for their ability to hold a tight group. This rifle is in great condition. Most numbers match. This rifle has the range conversion sticker intact on the stock from when the Swedish army converted their ammunition from a round nosed projectile to the new spitzer round. Many rifles are missing this range conversion information. The muzzle is threaded (the factory did this) and accepts a blank firing device, or the flash hider as present on my rifle. The cleaning rod is present. Overall a very nice example of Swedish military surplus and an example of Mauser's heyday."

It was found outside a pawn shop, used as a bit of a gate post to the entrance. It was purchased from the owner when the shop closed.As you can tell in the pictures, it measures 40 5/8” tall, 10 5/8” wide across the base, and about 9 3/4” tall across the mouth. This certainly was an eye catcher at a gun show - it’s pretty heavy and I ended up pushing it around on a little plant stand with wheels.It does have a little corrosion on the brass, but it is by no means destroyed. It’s in pretty good shape for a shell that’s been around for 113 years and traveled halfway around the world.By the little I’ve been able to find about it, it was made during the reign of Alfred von Tirpitz, while he was expanding the German Fleet to 45 battleships. This is used specifically in Wittelsbach class battleships that were constructed from 1899 to 1904. The Wittlesbach class were a group of five pre-dreadnought battleships. After dreadnought battleships became mainstay, the armament for these ships was disassembled and used on locomotives. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_German_Navyhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittelsbach-class_battleship#Armament"
