These have never been fired other than what Colt does before they send them out. They each are still in the plastic and come with individual pelican cases. They come with trijicon open sights from the colt factory. These are very valuable and will continue to appreciate bc they don't make them anymore and had to stop production due to govt involvement. Look them up to confirm the story and know the values before you make any offers. I'm asking $9,500 OBO. Cash only no trades. text REDACTED for questions offers or addition pics."

Comes ready to be mounted right onto your rail system. It’s an awesome sight, but I don’t really have a use for it. I’ve had it mounted only on my AK-47 and have only taken it to the range a handful of times so it has almost no wear on it. I bought it a little over a year ago so the battery should be almost new and are rated for about 50,000 hours of use depending on the power setting used. I also have the lens cap for it which you will get with the purchase as well."

Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low glare surface. The handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability. The front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A-2 Style F-Height allows co-witness with many optics. The Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability and is a solid, reliable aiming system when coupled with the elevation adjustable front sight.

A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. The ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow for gloved shooting. The chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.
