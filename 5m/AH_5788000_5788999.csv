When I initially bought it, it had a quadrail.  It was shooting 3+'' groups at 100 yards.  After the changes, I have it dialed in to 1.5'' or better groups at 100 yards…  Pretty good for a semi-automatic.  Obviously as you shoot, the groups are going to open up because of the heat, but the first five are usually within a quarter-sized diameter.  If you're taking more than 5 shots at an animal, you're either too far away or you suck.  I've shot about 300 rounds, give or take 100.  It has never had any steel cased ammo run through it, only the Aguila and Fusion rounds included in this sale.  The difference between the Agula FMJ and the Fusion rounds' point of impact is negligible at 100 yards. 
I'd recommend getting a solid zero with the Aguila, then confirm and/or adjust for the Fusion after that.  Seriously, I've found the sweet spot here for practice and hunting interchangeability.  Just give the rifle and barrel plenty of time to cool off.  Bonus, you can just unscrew the handguard to help it cool!  The vinyl tape on the handguard is so that it doesn’t resonate when it taps something else metal.  It can come off pretty easy.
Seriously, this is a very good set up as is…  If you want to fuck it up and make it look tacticool again, you get all the parts and tools necessary to ruin it again.

It has a 16"" chrome lined barrel that looks great--as do the bolt and all other parts-- and has the side rail for mounting optics; I don't believe that it saw a lot of use by the previous owner. All of the holes left by converting the rifle from stock configuration have been welded up, and the receiver and barrel assembly have received a fresh coat of paint. It comes as seen here, with the stock 10 round magazine, wooden buttstock, handguards and pistol grip. 
I'd like $900 for it, and may be interested in partial trades plus cash, including the following: Zastava m85pv, m85np, m90np or m92; a converted OR unconverted Saiga in .223, x39 or 5.45; VEPR converted OR unconverted in .223, x39 or 5.45; left-side folding trunnion and triangle/poly stock; yugo m85 parts kit.

It features superior glass quality and light gathering capabilities with zero distortion. The bullet drop compensating and ranging reticles allow for the shooter to quickly and accurately estimate range and apply the correct hold. The first focal plane reticle allows the subtensions and drops to remain true at any magnification. With a forged 7075-T6 aircraft-aluminum-alloy housing, the VCOG is an exceptionally durable and nearly indestructible sighting system. Robust enough for any application, the VCOG utilizes a single AA battery, commonly found across the globe and offers 6 adjustable brightness settings for the LED reticle. When powered by a lithium AA battery (like the one provided), it boasts a considerable battery life of 700 hours at setting 4 (constant on). An integrated dial fin allows easy rotation through the magnification range and a constant eye relief means no head or stock position adjustments are needed. Waterproof to 20 meters (66 ft.), the VCOG comes standard with a quick-release mount for any 1913 Picatinny rail.  The VC16-C-1600000 also includes: 1 Thumb Screw Mount (TA51) 1 Lithium AA Battery 1 LENSPEN® (TA56) 1 Trijicon Logo Sticker (PR15) 1 Manual 1 Warranty Card      Magnification 1-6x   Objective Size 24   Bullet Drop Compensator Yes   Weight (oz) 23.2 (w/o mount or battery)   Illumination Source LED   Reticle Pattern Segmented Circle / Crosshair   Day Reticle Color Red   Night Reticle Color Red   Calibration .223 / 55 grain   Bindon Aiming Concept Yes   Eye Relief 4 in.

Or get the peace of mind knowing you have your fellow officers back in a hostage standoff.   The MIL-Square reticle was designed by a former Marine Sniper to give a shooter refined aiming points compared to the widely accepted MIL-Dot.  This reticle provides the capability of determining distance to a target, determine the size of a target, and to provide visual reference points to be used to compensate for bullet drop and provide reference for follow up shot compensation. Because of the square design the user can more accurately align the edge of the MIL-Square with the edge of the object being measured.

Plus,Hunting Season Is Here!!!!!Hogs don't stand a chance with the Daniel Defense V7 rifle, Deer drop like flys, and what ever else you put in the cross hairs. I have a like new 300 BO DD rifle. Rifle has extras, polished bolt, upgraded muzzle break with threaded for suppression. The rifle has only fire 200 rounds, 100 suppressed and 100 non sup. But be aware, no childish emails offering 500 bucks for a 2000 rifle.If you are wanting to do a trade at this point I am looking at the over all value of both guns involved. So if you have a 1000 stock rifle trying to trade it for my rifle valued at over 2000 that's not going to work unless you have a combination of things going with your rifle and or firearm.""I have put on magpul stock and Borus grip because I liked the way it felt better then the stock DD set up, however if you would rather have the stock DD pistol grip I have it still available. But you must choose between one or the other. The DD rifle is already set up to accept a ""surefire can"" if shooting suppressed. "" The DD rifle has a polished bolt and bolt carrier group done in a nickel finish. The bolt and bolt carrier group came with the weapon from Daniel Defense even though it is rare that you will find many more rifles with the same bolt and bolt carrier group. Now you will either get a chrome (polished) bolt carrier group OR black bolt carrier group. I had Marty Daniel send me the nickel and I haven't went back. You want a funeral shooting gun, the gun is dead nut set for continuous fire at groups of 1.5 moa at 300yards. I have the weapon set up to accept a tri-pod and you can also attach lights and lasers, OR you can simply take everything off the rail, install the foregrip that comes with it back on, tighten two screws and go hunting. Very versatile rifle. (My experience when firing the rifle was fired with BlackHills ammunition with a surefire can and a nightforce scope at 300 yards my moa was no more than 1.5"" however I am diversed and experienced in this field and am happy to answer any question regarding the best ammo to use and scope while firing this weapon if you so choose to buy or trade for it. I will consider selling for cash as well, but the offer must be reasonable and respectful. You can google the price for a V-7 Ambush Rifle. I would consider taking a solid cash offer at 900.00. Or I will trade at 1400.00.Contact me with reasonable offers to get a response back. Emailing me would be best but the number provided is ok as well. Leave a message and I'll contact you back. REDACTED"

It is a very simple system with few moving parts and no O-rings, gaskets, or seals to maintain. The system uses the length of the shotgun shell hull to regulate the amount of gas, allowing the gun to operate with every type of shotgun shell from light 2-3/4"" loads up to 3-1/2"" magnums without any shooter adjustments. The versatility of the rugged, value-priced VERSA MAX Sportsman makes it equally well suited for turkey and waterfowl hunting with magnum loads, as well as upland birds, and even pass shooting doves with light field loads. The VERSA MAX Sportsman semi-automatic shotgun has a weather resistant, black synthetic stock with textured panels on the fore-end and pistol grip that provide a solid hold in any environment. The barrel and receiver are finished in a non-reflective matte black that enhances concealment in most hunting environments. A molded in sling swivel stud on the butt-stock and a stud on the magazine cap allow the quick attachment of a sling. The self-cleaning, gas operation system of the Remington VERSA MAX Semi-Auto shotgun reduces recoil considerably, allowing the shooter to follow-up on missed birds or shoot multiple targets quickly."
