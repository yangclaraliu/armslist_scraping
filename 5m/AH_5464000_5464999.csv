If you've fired the LCP you know what I'm talking about, and since my wife is not built like a tank her wrist couldn't handle the recoil and maintain quick accuracy.  The gun has dual recoil spring and does not kick like a mule like the other micro's, shoot all day and keep on shooting.  Gun has fired several hundred rounds flawlessly of multiple ammo's to verify my wifes not going to pull it and here a click in her moment of need, and comes with an extra nickle plated mag not shown for a total of 2 mags.  Has gator grip on handle to help me since it is small for larger handed guys.  If interested let me know, may trade for somthing with an engine or that goes bang.  Cash price is pretty firm, only reason to sell is now its a safe queen unless im going on a job or somthing.  Nice gun and one of the smallest you can find and still fire a bullet thats considered to have decent stopping power.  Have more pics but will only let me load 1 for some reason.

Comes with upgrades/ extras like the aftermarket E2 grips and tool to remove them if you wish ( they are a huge improvement) and the original grip panels. Also a custom heavy duty holster molded to exact fit the P226 with the 1913 rail. The gun runs flawlessly and smooth as silk with that extra bit of “cool factor”, selling because I’m looking to move to a smaller pistol for carry.

194,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5464194,For Sale:  CZ 75 P-01,"Osseo, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 425,"Listed On: Monday, May 9, 2016",Handguns,CZ USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Used CZ 75 P-01 in excellent condition with 2 magazines.The CZ P-01 is a compact, aluminum-framed 9mm designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame make it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action.
The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well.
These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired.
With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use.
After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.
Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN."

I am the orginal owner and it is in excellent condition. Brand new, I bought it for $1495. This handgun is the last year model of the Para Ordnance handguns made in North Carolina (higher quality) before Remington aquired Para Ordnance and moved them to Huntsville, Alabama. In 2015 Remington decided to kill off the Para USA brand and now only sells them under the Remington brand. Becuase of that, Para handguns are increasingly more difficult to find and becoming more expensive. Para was known for hand building high quality 1911 style handuns with many features, and thier life time warranty. Remington still honors the warranty. This one is no different. It features a 5 inch ramped match grade barrel, Trijicon tritium night sights, stainless steel frame and slide, an EGW HD extractor, checkered front strap, integral accessory rail for lights or lasers, beaver tail grip and ambidextrious thumb saftey, skeletonized match grade trigger, Ion bond PVD finish, VZ Operator machined carbon fiber g10 grips (which are awesome, as the $150 price tag would reflect), and two 14 round double stack magazines. I also have an over-molded rubber Hogue grip that I am throwing in with it. I have taken excellent care of this handgun as it has been my pride and joy. Everytime I have shot it (a total of somewhere around 150 rounds) I have field stripped and meticulously cleaned it before storing it. I am reluctant to part with it, but circumstances forces me. It has never failed to deliver. This is the top of the line tactical para handgun that will last for life, and has every feauture you could wish for in a situation where your life depends upon it. It is very accurate and a joy to shoot. I am firm on my price of $1000, No trades. According to gunbroker and other sites, I am asking a good price. If you are interested or have any questions, please call or text me at 86Five-Eight01-Five755. I will accept cash or Paypal, and you have to meet me somewhere in my local vicinity around the Clinton, TN area."

This rifle is a tack driver. The only reason I am selling it is to pay off some of my college tuition. I take extremely good care of all of my firearms and this one is no different. It has been field stripped and meticulously cleaned each time after being shot before being stored. It has the SPS Varmint stock with the beavertail fore-end and a 26 inch bull barrel (heavy contour barrel).I bought it in January 2016 and have only put two boxes of 20 rounds through it. The scope was $125 and is a Bushnell Banner 4-16x40 illuminated green/red CF scope. The scope mounts are leupold and the picatinny base is a Warner base that together costed me over $100. I had previously used weaver bases and mounts and experienced a zero wandering problem that the current, much higher quality base and mounts fixed. The bipod that is on it is a Harris HBRMS 6-9 inch spring assisted swivel bipod that was $125. Altogether  for the rifle and everything on it I am asking $750. If you are interested please call or text Eight65-Eight01-Five755. I will accept cash or paypal and will meet in the Anderson county, TN area."

Typically a small amount is used (less than 5 micrometers which is 0.00020 inches) but the improvements are substantial. It makes the barrel hard, scratch and wear resistant as well as corrosion and chemical resistant and lowers the coefficient of friction so the barrel runs smoother as well as giving the barrel a polished gold appearance.*Fluted barrels come with 4 column flutes that are cut at ""safe depths"" so there's absolutely no interference with the function of the gun. The main purpose of fluting is to reduce weight and increase surface area to make the barrels less susceptible to overheating.
