Will come with its factory case and 4 eight round magazines.Interested in possibly trading it.  I have other full sized 45's that I prefer.  Would really like to trade it for another P series Sig, particularly a similarly equipped (night sights and SRT) P226, with a high preference for 9mm.  Prefer a full size P226, but I won't say no to a 9mm P229 (similarly equipped) or an M11a1.That's my top choice, but I'd also consider an M&P45c (short grip and slide, not just the short slide) plus cash, or maybe a pair of M&P's or Glocks.The only long guns I'd be interested in would be an Ar10 or maybe other similar 308 battle rifles, or possibly an AR15 in 300 Blackout, maybe 556.  For the right trade I may have other guns I could add or cash.Not really looking to sell, but if you'd rather buy it I'd sell it for $900.If interested feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3, texts are best as I may not be able to respond until this afternoon. Thanks!"

What is NOT included from the pic is the scope (removed) and the bipod.  The rings MAY be, depending on the deal.  They are Nightforce Ti rings.  Very nice, but were pricey.
I do have a LNIB Vortex PST 2.5-10x 44 MRAD scope I can add to the deal for an extra $500 with the rings.  It's not for sale separate. 
I am wide open on trades, but not really desparate.  I've moved to a different LR/Precision platform so I don't ever get this out.  Cash is always awesome though, and I will sell the package for $975 OBO without the scope/rings, or add $500 for all of it.  That's cash money.  Trade value depends on how crazy you value your stuff and how  bad I want it.  I'm also a lefty so if it's RH specific, like a bull pup, it won't work.

Rifle started as a complete Bushmaster XM15-E2S 6.8mm SPC lower, changed out the handgrip for a CAA rubberized grip, the upper is a generic A3 upper with no dust cover or forward assist to keep the rifle looking smooth and clean, the handle on the top is also a removeable add on with built in hard sight and removeable scope mount. The butt stock is an Ace LTD fixed skeleton style with nice padding and a tacticalsprings.com heavy buffer spring and extra heavy buffer inside. The barrel is a Stag arms 16"" medium barrel and also included the muzzle break and combination front sight/gas block. The forward stock is a UTG aluminum quad rail currently holding a magpul grip. Internally there is a LWRC 6.8mm SPC combat bolt and firing pin as well as a generic 3-9x 40mm scope to round it all off. I built it about a year ago and since then have never had a chance to shoot it. The rifle will also include 2 metal 25 round magazines, the original stag arms forward stock and hardware, original bushmaster handgrip, original spring and buffer, an extra gas tube and the 2 6.8 dummy rounds i got for it. Action works very well, spring is super strong and it takes some effort to cock the gun but the combination of the heavy buffer and spring plus the LWRC combat bolt makes it feel nice and smooth. Rifle has no issues loading the dummy rounds into the barrel or ejecting them and firing pin lines up and strikes good. And not that i know why but if anyone was so inclined the lower and bulk of the parts are standard and the gun could easily be converted to a standard .223/556 with just a couple parts.
