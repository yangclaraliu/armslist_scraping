The accuracy of this firearm is outstanding and the trigger is great. I have a Ruger precision rifle in 6.5 Creedmoor, and it is just as accurate well within 250 yards. This is also a genuine Colt AR. Not a ""frankengun"" with a Colt lower. It has about 100 rounds put downrange and LOVES anything from 40 grain up to 55 grain.

If you are interested, please let me know and I will be more than happy to send more pictures. If you would like to see it in person, we can set a time due to the fact that I am traveling out of town fairly often."

This is an interesting piece. So in 2004 and 2005, HK made a limited run of colored-frame USPs - Urban Grey (blueish), Forest Green, and Tan (they called it taupe). By the end of 2005, they weren't selling all that well at the time and a lot of dealers sent the colored frame USPs back to HK. HK and CDNN got together and rebranded the remaining USPs as Custom Combats - featuring a jet funnel on the 40's, Novak rear sights, Fiber Optic front sight (green on the 40's, red on the 45's), and added the Decal Grip Panels. 
There were only 500ish made of the standard 40's and 45's, of which only a few were made into Custom Combats. Ironically, there are less Tan USP40, 40CC, 45 and 45CC's than there are Tan USP Tacticals or Tan Mark 23's because of this."

If the FFL of your choosing requires it be sent by an FFL then there is an addition $25 fee.

It's bone stock and in very good condition for a used revolver with me being the second owner. Included in transaction will be the working firearm pictured and a concealed hip holster. Sorry, no box, no ammo. Willing to sell or trade in person at an agreed local public location. No out of state buyers. Absolutely no minors. No felons/ non legal gun owners. I reserve the right to refuse sale or request an FFL mediator to assist in sale if interested party is deemed unfit. Thanks for looking. Email me for phone # exchange. God Bless America"

The barrel year code is UU, indicating that it left the factory in 1949. This places it early in the production run, and the rifle displays with the scarce non-grooved upper receiver milling. There are no post production holes present on either the metal or the wood.The wood is in excellent original condition with a conservative estimate of 95% original finish remaining. There are a few handling marks and minor dings, but no cracks or major post production issues. The spent shell ejector shield had been removed, but the original part was presented along with the rifle for re-installation. A local gunsmith supplied a replacement (non-original ) screw with the correct thread count and length, and the shield was reinstalled.  The metal shows some carry and handling wear, along with minor spotty rust freckling and slight blue thinning  overall. The muzzle shows notable blue loss, as do carry areas on the underside and the frame. The rifle has not been tested for operation. Based on the lack of use, it will probably respond well to a thorough disassembly and cleaning (the floating chamber is noted for carbon buildup and associated issues), but will most probably not require any replacement of parts.If you are looking to add an honest and early 550-1, in well above average condition to your collection, this should be a serious consideration.Conservatively priced at $225~ or best offer.

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, CZ's Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests they get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to their polymer Omega line. The P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07's safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09's updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 they've had to date.

Wonderful, fun little blaster that gets lots of attention when you break it out at the range. Comes with two magazines. The stock is welded shut, making this technically a pistol, but it'd be easy to remove the welds to make this an SBR if you wanted to Tax Stamp it. These came from the importer painted black over the original bluing. The paint is pretty worn on this one, which I think just adds to its look, but I'd be willing to strip it and repaint it if you're not into the ""battle worn"" look."
