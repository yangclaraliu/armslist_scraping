New AR-15 Build Kit in Kryptek Highlander Reduced Camo.
This AR-15 build kit can be used to build all calibers for the AR-15 platform except the large bore calibers, which require a modified upper, such as the Bushmaster 450, 458 Socom, and 50 Beowulf etc.  Kit consists of an upper receiver, lower receiver, key mod handrail, fixed rifle stock kit, grip, and trigger guard.  The upper is an Anderson Rifle Mfg. 7075-T6 aluminum forging with M4 feed ramps.  Upper comes assembled with dust cover, forward assist, and charging handle.  The lower is a matching Anderson Rifle Mfg. 7075-T6 aluminum forging marked Multi Caliber.  The free float aluminum hand guard is a slim 12” key mod rail system with steel locknut and alignment shims. The top of the rail is full length picatinny with 3 additional 3” long key mod rails that can be attached anywhere along the sides or bottom of the hand guard.  The rifle stock, trigger guard, and grip are Magpul MOE.  The Magpul stock has a sealed rear compartment, sling and quick release QD attachment capability.  The Magpul MOE grip also has a storage compartment.  The Magpul MOE rifle stock comes ready to assemble with a buffer tube, buffer, and buffer spring.  All components are new.  The upper, lower, stock, and handrail have been base coated, hydro dipped in Kryptek Highlander Reduced Camo, and then matte clear coated.  To build your custom AR all you need to do is add your barrel, gas system, bolt carrier assembly, and LPK. 
Payment: If local cash only.  Must have valid CWP and driver’s license to purchase.  A signed bill of sale will be required. 
If shipment is required then I will only ship to a licensed FFL holder.  Payment can be in the form of USPS money order or cashier’s check.  Shipment will be $40 which includes insurance.

This neat semi-auto plinker will make a great gun for a new shooter, someone looking to burn some ammo, or that person who is nostalgic for a gun from their youth. It is especially cool since the charging handle is located on the left side of the reciever, something that is fairly unusual in American guns. 
 
The rifle is in overall good shape. The blue on the steel parts is near 95%, while there is a bit of minor discoloration on the factory paint on the receiver as well as a few scrapes (the worst shown in picture 3). The wood has some dings and dents from regular use, but nothing that will affect performance or ruin the aesthetics. The only part it is missing is the shell deflector and the associated screws, but that should not impact function in any way. Overall a gun with an honest amount of wear but no serious abuse. 
 
This is definitely a neat little rifle and the new owner will surely have tons of fun with it!"

By eliminating the barrel bushing and installing a full-length guide rod and a coned match barrel, accuracy is improved and recoil is reduced.Nothing short of an engineering masterpiece, the fit between the integral barrel wafer and the slide is impeccably executed to appear as one, yet the two never contact. The result is a level of reliability and accuracy only money spent in the right place can buy.With its discreet but wide mouthed magwell and caliber options, the Predator is the perfect candidate for protection, uniform, competition, hunting and recreational employment. Mr. Browning would be envious.Pay special attention to the limited edition Predator grips, they are extremely hard to find.  In addition, I have added the famed patented smith and alexandar one piece combination arched main spring housing and extended magwell.  I am the original owner, test fired once.  Have all packaging and accessories.  No trades please, I need the cash for other priorities, or I would not part with it."

Includes Ammo!Invented in the late 1850s by Benjamin Tyler Henry, this revolutionary lever action repeating rifle was the most important firearm of its time and went on to become the most legendary American firearm of all time. Patented in 1860 and first used during the Civil War, the rifle’s rapid fire capability and high-capacity tubular magazine stood in amazing contrast to its single-shot musket counterpart. It became known as the rifle you could “load on Sunday and shoot all week long.” After the war, the Henry rifle headed west and went on to play a significant role in the homesteading of that great frontier.Now, the Original Henry Rifle is back in all its American-made glory.The Original Henry Rifle is virtually identical to its history-making forerunner in all aspects. The only exception: it is a .44-40 caliber. The 1860 version was made in caliber .44 Rimfire, also invented by Benjamin Tyler Henry, but long an obsolete cartridge. Every other facet remains true to its inventor, and each gun’s serial number begins with the initials BTH in his honor.Made with the same American pride and attention to detail as all Henry Repeating Arms rifles, the Original Henry Rifle features a hardened brass receiver with the same tensile and yield strength as steel; a one piece, 24 1/2 inch octagonal barrel/tubular feed; a genuine American fancy walnut buttstock and a classic folding ladder rear sight paired with a traditional blade front sight.I am the oriinal owner and have all of the packaging and accessories.  Test fired once, AMAZING!"
