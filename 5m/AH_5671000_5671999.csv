This ammo is live and should be treated as such, however, because of its age (~1930s) it is best suited as components for reloading purposes. I no longer reload rifle rounds because I just don't have the time or motivation. I would pull the bullets, salvage the powder, de-prime the cases, and sell the brass to a scrap yard. This is a much cheaper way to reload for 8mm surplus rifles.Due to mass low baller spam I am setting the price to ~0.13 per round for a fixed price of $200 for all 1,529 rounds and cash only. The cheapest 8mm projectiles on the market currently are PPU at ~0.25 per bullet. At 0.13 per round you are getting a projectile, powder load, and brass to trade to a scrap yard for some money back or convert to boxer primers. You won't find 8mm components this cheap anywhere else, ever.If your email has anything other than ""I'll take it"" it's going straight to the trash folder, spammers will be blocked so don't waste your time. Just need to see an Arizona ID and you're good to go."

All receivers, charging handles and buffer tubes are 7075 T6.The Anderson Rifle is The World’s Only NO LUBE RifleThe Anderson Rifle is the only rifle in the world that never requires lubrication. It is only possible because it is permanently treated with RF85, the nano technology that injects calcium into the molecular fabric of the metal. RF85 is permanent. It is IN the metal. RF85 reduces friction 85% and wears with the metal. Under heat and pressure the calcium nano particles elongate and form a protective barrier that eliminates the need for lubrication.An ancillary benefit arises because without an oily film to catch carbon particles, the rifle runs cleaner much longer. A typical lubricated weapon traps the carbon byproducts from explosives. Under the heated conditions found in weapons, the gooey mess turns into tar which bakes into a solid mass and fouls the chamber. The result is life-threatening weapon failure.The Anderson Rifle uses RF85 nano-technology to fire with85% Less Friction23% Faster ActionNever Needs OilingCleans Up with Soap & WaterRF85 is proven effective in the medical industry, in automotive and racing, and manufacturing.

I used a Blackhawk bipod for a couple seasons, but honestly it was very heavy and to many things to break or go missing. So I replaced it with a extremely lightweight collapsible bipod that is very well made and durable. It cut the weight down instantly noticeable. I set it forward on the barrel, doing so it's much more easier shooting. The rifle has a 22""  hammer-forged free-floating barrel with a 1:10 twist, marksman adjustable trigger from 3-5 lbs., flush for rotary magazine and a Power Bedding Integral Bedding Block System. Upgraded one piece scope mount, larger 6 bolt tactical scope mounts, shoulder sling and ammunition sleeve on stock. Comes with hard case and rifle cleaning kit. Also throwing is roughly 20-30 rounds of large game ammunition.Rifle costs about $419 plus tax, the Nikon ProStaff Scope currently it's selling for about $230 plus tax, bipod $60, sling $30-$40, rifle case about $60, one piece scope mount was custom made for about $60 and scope mounts $40.Selling everything for $475"
