MSRP $347.27
(From the Kel-Tec factory web site)The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO pistol chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Optional twelve round magazine. The Kel-Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonomecs, perceived recoil, and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns.
The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Supplied with a 12-round double column all steel magazine."

Henry’s 1860 rifle, we do understand that today’s hunter may prefer something a shade lighter on the mountain, and the 2015 introduction of the Big Boy Steel carries on the same brush gun appeal of the brass-framed Big Boys in its overall configuration, but with upgraded features for the modern hunter, while weighing in 1.68 lbs. less than its shiny cousin. The 7 lbs. steel Big Boy hangs its 20” round barrel and checkered walnut furniture on a matte-finished blued steel frame that’s drilled & tapped for optional scope mounts, and uses the same adjustable Western-style sights as the standard Big Boy, with the same sliding transfer bar “safety” system in its hammer. Most of the weight savings is due to the steel frame being lighter than a brass counterpart to begin with, and less steel in the thinner barrel walls than an octagon version. To make sure the steel Big Boy stays easy on the shoulder in any of its three calibers, the .357 Magnum/.38 Special, .44 Magnum/.44 Special, and .45 Colt"

The only wear on the firearm is the charging handle but still functions flawlessly and is simple to replace. The BCG is a mil spec full auto fail zero NiBx coated BCG ( I also have the original BCG that came with the rifle). Handguard is a Troy alpha VTac rail and comes with all rail sections that came with the rail. H2 buffer and Red sprinco buffer spring. this rifle runs extremely smooth and flawlessly even with a carbine system, similar muzzle rise to a mid length system. The barrel itself only has about 160-200 rounds through it while the upper and lower have close to a thousand. I can send additional pictures if necessary. the rifle will not come with the vortex optic or the weapon light unless for an additional charge.

I contacted this posting a few days ago about a Glock 34 MOS with a Trijicon RMR for a super low price of just $400. I received a reply. Turns out the claim is this person is in Maryland working and has it with them. Knowing what I know about Maryland I don't think it's legal to have this type of handgun in Maryland (it's a very anti 2nd Amendment state). This individual is not local here in Gainesville. Anyway let's make a long story short. It's a total SCAM!!! I wish there was a better way for Armslist & FL Guntrader to recognize these type of listings before they are published. These websites are beginning to become a waste of time.
