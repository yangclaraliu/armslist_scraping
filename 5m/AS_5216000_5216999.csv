4,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5216004,For Sale:  Kershaw Launch Cali-legal Auto,"mountainous, Fresno, California",$ 65,"Listed On: Friday, February 26, 2016",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Howdy, will ship this knife anywhere in United States, is brand new and fires strong and fast.  Must be 18yrs and older to purchase.
For 2016, we made something special for our neighbors to the south. And since we’re in Oregon, of course we mean California. So for you, California—and for anyone who prefers a shorter-bladed auto—we made the Launch 4. The Launch 4 sports a blade of just 1.9 inches, nice and legal. And pretty handy, too.
 
The blade is high-performance CPM154 steel. This powdered metallurgy steel has more uniform distribution of carbides—so it takes and holds an excellent edge, provides good corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and toughness. The blade is DLC coated for an additional measure of blade protection and non-reflective good looks. Then to lighten the Launch 4’s weight, we made the handle and integrated backspacer of durable aluminum, anodized in black.
The Launch 4 opens with a push button, recessed so that it is level with the flat of the handle. This is a safety feature and makes it harder for the knives to accidentally deploy. For left-handed use, press the blade-release/lock button with your index finger instead of your thumb. The Launch 4 has a single-position pocketclip and carries tip-up.

Forward-ejecting allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. The stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup developed because the breech is separated from the shooter's face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The barrel has a chrome-lined bore and chamber, threaded muzzle (5/8x24 TPI), and comes equipped with Keltec's A2-style Flash Hider. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20-round magazine is included, and the RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference"

I split my main colony of 200k into 4 about 60 days ago to allow them room to multiply for a big sell off at the end of summer. But I need the room and I'm  looking to sell or trade them off. I don't have an exact count but it's over 200,000. Comes with a 27cf converted freezer with vent, power exhaust, thermostat to plug a heater into, 3 smaller containers that house the expanded colonies,  extra foam and whatever else I can find. These 4 colonies consume 4.5-5 lbs of boneless raw chicken I about 10 hrs. The main colony will consume 2.5 lbs of it in that time alone. That means they can clean a hog skull in about a day. Its been a good business and I've had no complaints about the quality of my beetles. These were originally a wild caught colony from deep east Texas. They've thrived on mixed beef and the occasional chicken. I've even given them cleaned gar and they had it to bone in a day. I did did not do euro mounts for people, I have been a beetle supplier for taxidermists, schools, and hobbiest. During hunting season, beetles sell for around $100 per 1000. If they are properly fed and cared for (not really that hard) thru the summer months, the total colony should be around 450-500,000. That gives you a potential income on the sell of 4,500-5,000. But I'm not making any promises. Do your research. Google is a good tool, figure your potential profits then contact me. As it stands e bugs alone worth $2,000 not counting the extras. My asking price is not negotiable, but I may be interested in partial barter. Im between Joshua and Godley, delivery may be negotiated, but you'll have to come here first to see the colony then delivery will be arranged."

I will consider cash offers, but really do prefer to trade. I will ill also consider all other guns in .45 ACP. No HiPoints or Glock please. Just not a fan. M&P would have to have accessories in my favor. Can add some cash for Sigs, Kimber, and guns of that sorts. I am very open. Ask, worst I can say is no.

This particular shotgun was made for sale at Coast To Coast Stores and is branded Coast To Coast Master Mag on the receiver. This particular gun functions very well. It has a 3"" chamber, 30 inch barrel, and fixed full choke. The stock has pressed checkering. The stock has lots of hunting wear from the previous owner. Much of the finish has been worn off the stock, with a small chip in the toe of the buttstock, and a small piece missing from the recoil pad. There is somewhere around 60% blueing. There are some scratches on the receiver. This is by no means a safe queen, it is a shotgun that can be used without worrying about scratching up when hunting.I have not shot the gun much, but I have taken the shotgun all the way apart and cleaned every single part, polishing off any burrs and the bolt. The action is very smooth."
