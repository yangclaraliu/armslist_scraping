This Berthier rifle has a 32"" barrel and is chambered in 8mm Lebel. This French Lebel rifle is fed by a 5-round enbloc clip (one included) and is in good condition for a rifle of its age. The bluing is aged and has minor surface pitting. The wood stock is heavily worn (the French beat these things up over the decades) yet the action is smooth and the base plate swings open easily. The bore is in good condition with clear rifling grooves. All serial numbers match on bolt, bolt head, trigger guard, and butt stock. ""N"" stamped on both barrel and receiver. These are hard to find in the US and there are no import markings. A great gun for anyone interested in World War One weapons or military history. US African American troops under French command would've had opportunity to use this arm along with its three-shot predecessor. More pictures available upon request.

Located in Reno, NV. I'll ship the ammo but shipping will be extra.This will absolutely be the cheapest price on the internet hands down. You find it lower on any retail website let me know. I'll beat it! This will be cross listed on gunbroker, snipershide (I have a lot of good feedback there), and accurateshooter. 1) 150 gr Ball military ammo. From what I remember this is Israeli or Bulgarian manufactured, i can't exactly remember but the headstamp is below. I bought these from samco global for 78 cents a piece BEFORE shipping. Looking for a quick sale so 60 cents a piece BEFORE shipping is the price. There are 142 rounds so $85 + actual shipping and insurance (if you want it).2) WOLF 145 gr ammo. 22 boxes of this and a partial box of 5 rounds (which is free to the buyer). 20 rounds per box. Total of 440 rounds + 5 rounds extra. Will sell for 50 cents a round which is below market value. So $220 plus actual shipping and insurance (if desired). I'll split these up in quantities of 10 boxes and 12 boxes if desired. 3) HUNTING AMMO- Prices do NOT include shipping- 3 boxes of Federal Power Shok 180 gr SOFT POINT will sell for $18 per box- 3 boxes of Remington Core Lokt 180 gr will sell for $19 per box- 1 box of Hornady 150 gr InterLock will sell for $18 Discounts for multiple items bought for example if you buy all the hunting ammo take $1 off per box. Otherwise the ammo is already below market value. Local pick up in Reno, NV is ok with me. It will save on shipping. If you want a shipping quote please PM me. I have good guy feedback on snipershide under this same screen name. Local shooters probably know me as well from Palomino gun club. This is cross listed on multiple sites so I wouldn't sit on this too long. The first ""I'll take it"" on any site gets the ammo."

The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing.

The gun is like new.
It has one extra 14-round magazine  (three total) and three 16-round extended magazines--all OEM.   
It also has the new CZ Custom front and rear Trijicon tritium sights professionally installed with a new pin used on the front sight.  I still have the original sights.  In my opinion, these sights are a necessity, and improve the pistol 100%.  
It has the CZ Custom black aluminum grips, which greatly reduce the width for conceal carry if one is inclined.  I have the original grips as well, which were put back on for sale.   
Finally, I have a new CZ Pistol bag and PCR/P-01 Armorer's Manual

NO TRADES. Prices are firm for now. I can meet in West Central Wisconsin with coordination and on occasion near Madison when I travel there. WI CCW preferred, but I will sell to a WI resident with a WI DL and affirmation that you are authorized to buy a firearm under WI and Federal law."

The Tantal is a unique derivative in the AKM family and is not commonly encounted any longer.   The folding stock is robust and when folded makes for a very compact platform.  It does not favor larger shooters and being 6'7"" i ran this with a fixed AKM stock when I took it to the range.   The Tantal utilizes the standard single top tang rear trunnion and any standard AKM stock including adtermarket stocks will fit just fine. This is NOT a Century built rifle.  This rifle has the correct 5.45x39mm barrel and does NOT keyhole the target.Shipping to your FFL is included in my asking price.  (Valued at $45.00 for Fully insured with positive signature required).Additional photos available on our Facebook Page:  Polish Tantal"

A lever mounted within the trigger body blocks the sear unless the trigger is intentionally pressed in the center, virtually minimizing the risk of accidental discharge. The 93 F has a weather resistant synthetic stock, and a blued barrel and receiver. The receiver comes drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Factory installed sling swivel studs accommodate attaching a rifle sling, or a bi-pod to the forend. The bolt features dual extractors for positive extraction of spent cases. A 5-round, detachable magazine facilitates loading and unloading the rifle. The 2-stage safety is located on the right side of the receiver. The Savage 93 F Bolt-Action Rimfire Rifle in 22 WMR reaches out well over 100 yards to take varmints, small game, and medium sized predators such as coyote, fox, and bobcat with minimum muzzle blast and pelt damage.

It has the excellent MFI 553 type handguards installed and the MFI 3 prong 553 type flash suppressor. The front sight is the factory Sig Hooded front sight and the receiver mounted rail has a flip-up rear sight. A Sig Sauer rotary diopter sight has been added which offers a combat V notch and 3 diopter positions for 100-200-300 meters. It is a HK type rotary drum and they are extremely easy to use once you get them dialed in.   These 556 rifles are no longer in production and are highly sought by collectors and shooters. They are an interesting design and many have referred to them as product improved AK designs.   The Magazine is a hard to find 20-rd 551 type that was offered by Sig-USA years ago. The 551A1 lower accepts all 550/551 type magazines.  This carbine weighs a trim 7.5lbs as shown with the magazine. It handles extremely well and shoulders comfortably and the folding Swiss Type 556 stock offers a surprisingly comfortable cheek weld. It is a very tight feeling rifle due to to the shorter stock, almost AK-like in length which makes it very fast to track onto target.  This is not a Sig factory combination and is a custom rifle that apporximates the Sig 553 carbine very nicely with the exception of the longer barrel.   This 556/551A1 Carbine is available for sale.

This is a CZ 75 clone made because the patents on the 75 expired, I guess. -It has ambidextrous controls for the slide release and safety. -I lost the original grips but put the CZ factory wood grips on and they look phenomenal, although I'll keep looking for the plastic ones. -I also installed a lighter hammer spring in there- no FTFs yet and it's not even broken in so I'm not worried about reliability but thought you should know. It does feel a lot nicer with the new spring in. Just bought this about a month or two ago, but I got news that I'm moving to a different state where people can buy CZs so I want to keep this in state because I know how much of a pain in the ass it is to find one. It was new in box, only test fired when I got it, and I've put maybe 250-300 rounds through it so far. It's in nearly pristine condition and you'll know I'm not trying to pull a fast one as soon as you hold it, there is nearly no wear at all yet (see pictures. Comes with the box, all documentation, cleaning kit (crappy so unused but if it's your first gun they'll do), an extra hammer and a sight adjustment tool. Also two nicely polished CZ ten-round magazines. Looking to get the price I paid for it and don't NEED to sell it, so no lowball offers please. I can meet at an FFL and transfer (on your dime) or a nice public place for E-FA, I've used Cabela's previously which worked nicely. I work in Waltham 9-5 and live in Boston. I have one transfer left this year."
