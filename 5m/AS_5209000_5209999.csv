The Cascade Extreme Rifle is based on the Montana Rifle Company’s Model 1999 stainless steel action, the same as in the X2 rifle, which was named a “Best of the Best” by Field & Stream magazine. Chambered in the versatile .300 Winchester Magnum, the Cascade Extreme is bedded in the company’s cutting-edge Montana X2 Carbon Fiber Reinforced Stock. The entire rifle is cerakoted in a Tungsten Grey undercoat, with a matte Cascade Green epoxy finish over the top. A newly designed Montana Flats Brake vents gas away from the shooter while delivering maximum recoil reduction. A 24-inch No. 2 contour barrel is completely hand-lapped and features a 1- 10 twist. Built around a completely trued action, the Cascade Extreme features an old style M70 trigger tuned to a crisp three pounds. The three-position wing safety also serves as a firing pin block safety, offering an additional safeguard when working through rough country. The Cascade Extreme Rifle offers controlled round feed with a large Mauser claw extractor and Mauser C-ring breech system. A dove-tailed lug and raceway system ensure smooth, reliable operation in hot, cold, dirty or wet conditions. The Cascade Extreme Rifle is bedded in the new Montana X2 Carbon Fiber Kevlar reinforced stock. Featuring the finest advancements in Pre-Preg carbon fiber technology for complete reliability, the X2 stock has been enhanced with Kevlar resins for extreme strength. Aluminum pillar blocks offer a true and durable bed for the action, delivering outstanding accuracy. Enlarged aluminum blocks add strength to the sling swivel studs. The X2 stock is filled with a fiberglass strand reinforced foam, to increase strength while mitigating recoil and saving weight. A Pachmyar recoil pad is attached to a 12-inch wood core, for rock-solid durability. Finished with a matte Cascade Green and Black Fleck epoxy finish, the Cascade Extreme Rifle is ready for any weather condition. Limited to just 50 rifles, the Cascade Extreme package will feature a Leupold® Custom Shop VX-6 3-18x44mm objective in Covert Green 30 mm tube, with the FireDot® WindPlexTM reticle and CDS-ZL locking adjustment. VX® The VX-6 will also be limited to 50 units and will be individually numbered to match the rifle (i.e. 1 of 50), and each scope is serialized to match the rifle."

Gun has ambidextrous flip safety on slide, gun has slide lock, de cocker, take down flip switch all on left side with mag release. I purchased this gun 4 months ago and took it to the range one time and ran 50 cci mini mag's through it and it functioned flawlessly The gun is in immaculant condition with no scratches or scuffs. Never had this gun in a holster, have original box and all paperwork that goes with it. Also comes with original trigger guard lock, 2 magazines, tube of oil that came with gun and tool to remove the thread protector that is screwed onto barrel to keep threads safe when not using them. The gun is very accurate, even with the target out as far as I could go, which was 30 yards. This gun is a 90% full size replica of the popular sig p226. Like any 22lr pistol recoil is non existent along with noise, perfect gun for the first time shooter, or younger shooter. I also attached a suppressor to this gun when I had it at the range and even without earplugs, a cap gun is way more loud then this thing was, very fun gun to shoot. I am asking $350, which I think is fair considering the condition of this gun. I may be willing to negotiate if you would want to do a partial ammo trade/partial cash. Just let me know and we can go from there. You can text or call me anytime at REDACTED for fastest response. Thanks for looking"

$1,950 firm for everything or higher in trade value.  I can also take some more off if you don't want the MI sights or all the mags, just let me know.I might consider trades, but only if it's a good deal as I don't need anything right now.  If it's not a good deal as far as the value goes, then there is no reason to offer it, sorry, just trying to save everyone some time.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal.  Are you wanting the rifle, all the mags and the sights or?? and are you wanting a straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns and bolt-guns.A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Ammo in common rifle and pistol calibers to help with a deal, but I have PLENTY of ammo.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics to help, but I have nice scopes, Aimpoints and Eotechs just sitting right now for future projects.Ftf in the Dallas area or will ship insured for $40 more.Thanks for looking!"

For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer. The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil. Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern. If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed. This is a new old stock ECO because we got it from another dealer so we can’t say it is factory new but it is new and never has been fired. Save hundreds of dollars when you buy this new Dan Wesson ECO. Shipping is $25 and free for all military, veterans and law enforcement. Please visit and like our FB page at: DCF FB Page"

Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

I'm looking to sell it only because I never take it out and it's taking up room in my safe. It's an awesome rifle, but it's not one I use enough to justify having around. This is a perfect home defense rifle or even just to have a unique rifle to set yourself apart at the range from all of the AR fanboys. It has a short-stroke piston-operated system making it extremely reliable, clean, and cool even in sustained fire. The cold hammer forged barrel gives it superb accuracy. The bullpup design is awesome, and in my opinion, once you know what you're doing, is superior to conventional rifle designs. It comes with 2, blocked 10/30 magazines and a Red Dot on a Cantilever mount (R/B/G). It also will come with the original box and cleaning kit. I am willing to trade for one thing and one thing only, a CA Legal HK-MR556. I know they exist in CA but are hard to come by. I know the MR556 is 2400, so I am Willing to add another $200 to the trade to make it even. Transfer at Gunther Guns off Loker Avenue in Carlsbad.

$1,060 firm in cash or may look at trades.I might consider trades, but only if it's a good deal as I don't need anything right now.  If it's not a good deal as far as the value goes, then there is no reason to offer it, sorry, just trying to save everyone some time.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal. Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns and bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Ammo in common rifle and pistol calibers to help with a deal, but I have PLENTY of ammo.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics to help, but I have nice scopes, Aimpoints and Eotechs just sitting right now for future projects.Ftf in the Dallas area and must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

$1,260 firm in cash or better in trade.  
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal. 
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Also, Pmags for both AR-15 and AR-10.
Ammo to help complete a deal in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  Any all ammo deal would need to be a really good one as I have PLENTY of everthing.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area or I can ship for $30 more.  Thanks for looking!"

One of the conclusions from the war, particularly relevant to the small arms industry, was that the battle had moved from open field conflicts to close-quarters engagements – and there was a need for a seamless transition from daylight to nighttime capability on a single mission. Out of this understanding, and after more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.Rifle package comes with 1-30 round magazine, lock and cleaning kit. • Bullpup configuration; short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy• Mil-Spec , chrome lined, cold-hammer forged CrMoV barrel, 6 groove 1:7 RH twist• Optional 9mm Parabellum conversion kit with CHF barrel, 1:10 twist, CrMoV steel• Optional 5.45x39mm conversion kit with CHF CrMoV barrel, 1:7½ twist, chrome lined• 100% ambidextrous configuration and operation with optional left hand bolts for 5.56 NATO and 5.45x39mm• Integral folding adjustable backup iron sights with Tritium front post (flat top models only)• Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles• Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies• Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR®SAR parts• Mil-Std bayonet lug on 18"" barreled models• Uses standard AR-15/M16 magazines• Last round hold open on empty magazine• All metal parts are treated for corrosion resistance• Integral rubber recoil pad• Assembled in the US from Israeli and US manufactured parts• Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use• Clean, long stroke piston operation• Body constructed of high-strength impact modified polymer"
