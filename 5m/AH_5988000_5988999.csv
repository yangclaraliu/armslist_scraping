Mdl: 051815490      UPC REDACTED96    3.625” Barrel     MSRP: $639.99
Browning’s 1911-22 has made .22 popular again. This high strength, light weight, A1 style compact is constructed with a polymer frame design and was originally introduced in 2011. Gun reviews have been favorable attesting to the design and contruction holding up well. Weighs under a pound when loaded and fits both large and small hands while still retaining the safety and “manual of arms” of the original John Browning 1911 full size with blowback slide action and single-action trigger.
Standard features include stainless steel barrel block, target crown, machined aluminum slide, fixed sights, detachable steel 10 round magazine, manual thumb and grip safeties. But this gun comes in a compact 6.5” length overall which is approximately 85% the size of a full size 1911.
The “Black Label” models have enhanced features such as laminated and stippled grips with checkered frontstrap, matte black finish, extended ambidextrous thumb safety, Beavertail grip safety, Commander style hammer and extended slide release.
This gun is New In Box and never shot or registered for the warranty. Comes in the original ABS factory case with all factory options and documents. Local delivery in Wichita or the surrounding communities available if purchaser has a CCW. Otherwise gun will be shipped from my FFL for a flat rate of $24.99 paid by buyer in addition to purchase price shipped to your FFL. Buyer is responsible for his/her own FFL fees.
At the most recent Wichita area gun show there was only one 1911-22 and that wasn’t a close match to this gun as it was a used, earlier specimen with the first generation “flat” black finish selling for $525 without the case and paperwork.
Yes. The base Browning 1911-22 with pink grips or the tan frame is available at various stores for $499.99. But add to that tax. And then consider that it is the base model without the “Black Label” enhanced options. You’ll especially appreciate the Beavertail grip safety on the one for sale."

Read Their Fine Print!! This Listing is for One Factory Brand New in the Box Kel-Tec Gen 2 KSG 12 Gauge Pump-Action Shotgun in Black with a 18.5"" barrel and 14 shot capacity.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

This optic features a 7mm raised base for better iron sight access, and an adjustable quick-detach lever for easy and repeatable attachment and removal. The more compact design only requires 2.75“ of rail space! The compact design used by the XPS and EXPS models was created by separating the battery compartment from the base and mounting it transversely. This not only dramatically decreases the over-all size of the optic, but allows the battery compartment to easily clear the delta ring on M4/M16 platform carbines and rifles. The A65/1 reticle features a 65MOA circle for fast target acquisition in CQB scenarios with a 1MOA aiming dot for precise shooting to mid ranges.

Bolt body does not match, but parts of the bolt do match and it looks like everything else does including the stock. The bad: bore is rough and dark and crown is pitted. It was missing the extractor which is common for these so I fitted it with a functional vergueiro extractor. Gun functions and will fire, but no guarantee on practical shootability due to bore and crown condition.No felons, must be a WI resident.I will ship for $30 extra to a FFL or C&R, must pay with USPS money order if you'd like me to ship it.

Had them looked at a few years ago and was given a rough safe estimate in the upper twos because they were not given a official grade but are good quality. They more than likely have gone up in value. Going to have them looked at again and graded when I have a chance but wanted to put them up to see if there is any interest. Meet at a jeweler first for testing so you can see that they are real before a transfer or heading to a FFL unless you have a background in that area and can judge for yourself. Listed a few trades but would be interested in others and would add up to $100 cash depending on the trade but might go higher on something interesting. Not really looking to sell but I might so just ask if your interested. Good way to make someone special happy. All laws will be followed. Thanks.

Very little use the past few decades - has been in safe, clean storage since the 1980's. Here's a little history: Simson & Co was a gunmaker in Suhl, Germany that began producing guns in 1910. The Nazis took over the factory before WW2 - the family was Jewish. After WW2 the East Germans began producing guns again using the Simson name. This is a pre-WW2 piece (1932). The exact value is hard to place. I had it inspected and valued at a gun show in Nashville in 2010 - the dealer valued it at $1,400. Don't know what it may be worth in today's market, but wanted to try selling locally before going nationally. You have to see this one to really appreciate it.

While I am a private party, I do require that we have a bill of sale signed and that I visual inspect your Drivers License to insure that the information on the bill of sale is correct.  There are no exceptions to this policy of mine.  The bill of sale that I will use is the ATF Form 4473 which is the same thing you would fill out if you purchased the firearm from a dealer.  If there is anything that you feel uncomfortable about filling out on that form than I recommend that you buy from someone else.  I know that sounds harsh, but it is the only harsh thing you will hear out of my mouth.  I am actually a very nice and polite person that is only trying to protect myself :)"

Has 1 ruger mag, 2 mecgar mags (all cycle flawless) Gun is getting hard to find, especially with the ghost ring sights. Comes with a nice soft case, and a bushnell trophy red dot scope (like new) The Ruger i bought brand new, unfired. Ive shot exactly 30 rounds thru it (3-10 round mags) All mags functioned 100%. Gun is in great shape....Ive had alot of interest in all 3, so i thought i would try this approach and offer all 3 as a package Ill throw this out there, and ask 3000 for all 3 rifles (cash only)Only trade would be for a nice running Kubota compact tractor (b7100, b1550, b1750, etc) Must be 4x4, in good shape, with no major issues. email for more info and picsThis will be a 1 time post, if you feel that im asking too much, simply hit your back button and keep browsing. If you interested in all 3, send me a email and we can discuss details. I can answer any questions you may have about the rifles"

These are amazing shooters that need absolutely no modifications on sights or trigger work. The trigger has a factory adjustable set screw stop for travel, on the back of the frame there is an adjustable screw to adjust the trigger break which is very light and perfectly crisp. If you want a true target pistol and one that will continue to go up in value this is your gun. I have had it for about 2years, probably about 250 rounds through it. Previous owner was a gentleman who was about 83yrs old who hadn't shot it for over 15years he told me. It has had excellent care, has no pitting or corrosion marks at all. This one is a gem. No box, just the gun and one factory magazine.These guns shoot 22LR only and they shoot Target Velocity ammo not high velocity ammo. The short travel action of the slide gives little to no felt recoil, this is an excellent affordable true target pistol. Selling as I don't shoot it enough and I am not a collector and hope there is someone who will put it to good use or is a collector. If you have a question please ask, will be happy to answer in a timely way and accurately. Thanks for your interest."
