It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed steel front sight, picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.

If this were brand new in the box with all the accessories and such it would well range over 200 dollars. I'm only seeking $50. I dont have the time or money to sink into airsofting anymore and am just looking to be rid of it.The original box for the gun claimed 460 fps with .12g BB's and 370 with .20g to .23g BB's. I had it chronographed for 430+ using .12g BB's and 350+ with .20g to .23g BB's. Can easily be used in indoor and outdoor fields with swapping of BB weight or to the 8.4v battery. My price is firm.Would happily trade for ammo, specifically .410 Buckshot and Slug loads or .32 S&W Long/Short rounds. 2 boxes of 50 for .32 Long/Short or at least 50 rounds of .410 Buckshot/Slug rounds would be enough.

$800 in cash, if it does not sell, I'll just keep this one. 
Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades considered would be, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns in this order.  A few things I can think of now on trades:  
Stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers, will consider all brands, depending on your value, lower parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  FosTech Echo trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles as well, depending on the value placed on it as I like to build lowers/rifles with quality parts and can do it much cheaper than buying them complete.
Quality stamped AK-47 with side rail for optic mount, preferably with a nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock would be a plus.  I really like the RAS47 models with the nicer trigger groups and Zhukov furniture, but I've read about too many problems with their cast trunnions an bad/faulty rivets.
A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Maybe a quality 9mm or 45ACP pistol with ""arm brace/stabilizer"", ideally a good deal on a Sig MPX Gen 2 with folding arm brace, so I can change out the trigger easily, I like nice triggers, otherwise, I might consider other similar firearms. 
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56, Federal preferred.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifier, maybe two Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle and 1-2 with 7.62x39 reticle or similar 1-6x.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship for $45 more, since it will have to be overnighted to your FFL.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

This one was a working gun in my cabinet and has anchored several elk and lost count on the bears. None needed a second shot. Kept it zero'd at 200yds and it's well inside 2"" at that range. Some shallow dings and scrapes on the walnut. it's not a safe princess, but in fine working order and I've priced it accordingly. Consider the glass a freebie. 3x9 chicom with an MOA reticle. but it does handle the recoil and stays zero'd. The mounts are factory Ruger. Throwing in a hardshell case and 10 rounds of Remington 225gr SPOk guys, I thought I priced it right as the cheapest one of these I found on the net was $499.00. A week with no bites so I'm dropping the price $100.00 to move it along. New price $399.00Nevada residents only please.

I literally pulled it out of my pocket with all its built up pocket lint  and dust and fingerprints, and just snapped a quick pic, thinking this was probably just a $200 used gun.  But amazingly,  these things routinely sell for over $ 1,000 I've since learned.  Funny thing is I've always had a love hate relationship with this thing.  What I loved was that it was SUPERLIGHT thanks to the titanium cylinder, and carried 6 shots instead of 5, and was a nice smooth low recoil shooter.  What annoyed me was that sometimes spent cases tend to stick, and you have to poke them out with a pen or something.  SO anyway, Ive had this for all this time, it probably looks a bit rougher than it is bc I didn't bother to pretty it up at all before photographing it.  But it's actually seen very little actual use and has been shot not that much, it's just been carried a lot. Doubt if I have more than 250-300 rounds thru this thing, if that.  As for asking price, I'm going to wait until I hear from Smith and Wesson first on my purchase date, but I will entertain offers until then.  In the meantime, I'll wipe it down and take a cleaner pic. UPDATE:  SMITH AND WESSON CONFIRMED THIS MORNING THROUGH MY SERIAL # THAT THIS REVOLVER IS INDEED THE RARE MODEL 332, AND THAT IT HAD A PRODUCTION DATE OF 12/11/2000"

The Riverside Arms Co. name first appears in the J. Stevens Arms & Tool Co., Chicopee Falls, Mass., catalogue No. 54 issued circa 1914 on a hammerless double the No. 315 and a hammer double No. 215. These guns were based on G.S. Lewis Patents No. 1,086,378 granted Feb. 10, 1914, for the hammer gun and Patent No. 1,136,247 granted Apr. 20, 1915, for the hammerless gun. During WW-I the Stevens factories were taken over by, I believe New England Westinghouse, for wartime production. After the Great War the Chicopee Falls factories were bought by Savage Arms Corp. and the gun business there emerged as J. Stevens Arms Co. a wholly owned subsidiary of Savage Arms Corp. They continued to manufacture both Stevens and Riverside guns up to about 1930, when they changed the name of their lower priced line from Riverside Arms Co. to Springfield Arms Co.

Comes with IWI cleaning kit and (1) 20 round magazine and (1) 25 round magazine. From the factory:The UZI PRO pistol is a modernized Micro UZI semi-auto pistol based on the world famous UZI sub-machinegun, variations of which have sold in excess of 2,000,000 units worldwide. The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location. Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel. Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms: Manual thumb safety, Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firing Firing pin block. Each UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round in states that permit these magazine capacities."

It was fed with a 6-round clip. The clip was a Mannlicher design and the breech block assembly was designed by an Italian gunsmith named Carcano. While it is looked down upon by some devotees of the ""finer"" rifles, it was a rugged weapon that didn't foul up easily and withstood hard treatment. Its smaller cartridges [Cal. 6.5x52 mm vs. 7.92 mm Mauser] meant a soldier could carry more rounds and its clip held 6 rounds vs. 5 per clip for almost all rifles of the other belligerents. It's length [140 cm, 160 cm with the bayonet] was designed for an obsolete method of warfare, allowing an infantryman to fend off the lance or saber of a mounted cavalryman. Since it proved to be clumsy in the tight confines of the trenches, a carbine version called the 'moschetto' adapted from the carbine version used by the cavalry was also given to special troops, carabinieri [MP's], officers, NCOs and Arditi [shock troops]. Both carbines fired the same cartridge the rifle did, indeed they were just shortened versions of the rifle. Both had a turned down bolt handle rather than a straight one. The cavalry version had a built in folding bayonet while the infantry adaptation had a detachable one and a longer wood stock."

It is a member of the belted magnum family that is directly derived from the venerable .375 H&H Magnum. The original purpose of the belted magnum concept taken from the .300 H&H and .375 H&H, was to provide precise headspace control, since the sloping shoulders, while easing cartridge extraction, were unsuitable for this purpose. Improved cartridge extraction reliability is desirable while hunting dangerous game, which would be of concern when needing a fast follow up shot. The 7mm Rem is based on the commercial Winchester .264 Win Mag, .338 Win Mag, and .458 Win Mag, which were based on the same belted .300 H&H and .375 H&H cases, trimmed to nearly the same length as the .270 Weatherby Magnum.The 7mm Remington Magnum offers ballistics better than the .30-06 Springfield with bullet weights of 175 grains and less, one of the more popular loads being a 160 grain spitzer loaded to 3,000 ft/s (910 m/s). This is due both to the higher muzzle velocity of the magnum compared to the Springfield and that .284 diameter bullets tend to have better ballistic coefficients than .308 diameter bullets of comparable mass. It is arguable that the 7 mm Remington Magnum offers marginally better ballistics with 175 grain bullets, the heaviest bullet commonly used in the caliber. The .30-06 Springfield can, however, be loaded with heavier bullets up to 220 grains."
