Weapon with apex duty trigger, talon grips, ammo, and scabbard.__________________________ From the manufacturer:Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately. Trigger mfg:Apex kits for the M&P Shield directly replace the factory hinged trigger with a solid aluminum trigger body featuring a center mounted pivoting safety that maintains factory safety values. The kits reduce pre-travel and over-travel by approximately 20%, and provide the M&P Shield pistol owner a smooth, consistent trigger pull that is approximately 2 lbs lighter (based on variations in factory tolerances) with the advantage of a more detectable trigger reset.The above picture is not the exact pistol, but a picture of an identical one."

I can provide extensive information if desired. The rifle is an early 1936 S/42 model, with amazing early bluing still present. It retains at least 90% of its original finish.  Loads and loads of Waffenampts, EAGLE/63s and WaA214 stampings throughout all parts of the rifle. The numbers on the receiver, barrel, sights and bolt group match. The bolt matches unto itself.   The stocks has various nicks and handling marks of a combat rifle. It needs to be cleaned up, as it seems to have some sort of waxing over it.  It is also WaA on the sides and wrist extensively. Still retains its original cross-hatched leather sling.  Mr. Asel was a double Purple-heart recipient, having enlisted in 1941 and discharged in 1946. He was with the 3rd BN, 18th RGT, 1st INF DIV in North Africa, Italy, Belgium, France and Germany. I still have lots of his WWII souvenirs as well as some of his personal items such as uniforms, CIB awards, boots, belt, a nazi Browning M1922, a nazi G43 rifle, etc. and various other german pieces of field gear.   SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY, PLEASE.   $1600.     I accept Paypal and can ship UPS ground.
