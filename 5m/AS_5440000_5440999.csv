I have owned it, used (1yo), for 3 years. I cleaned it thoroughly upon purchase and have put only a few hundred rounds through it. I clean it more than I shoot it. It will eat the cheap steel casings as well as the expensive brass rounds. I mainly only shoot decent brass bullets so cheap ammo doesn't gum-up the gun. Very well taken care of. This gun features a carry handle with iron sights, fixed butt-stalk, forward assist, dust cover and comes with the factory 20 round magazine and an additional 30rnd mag. Asking $700.  Feel free to email or call/text REDACTED"

As the title says for full asking price I will include a lightly used Streamlight TLR1s light and a fitted kydex OWB holster so you can carry it with the light on.  This would be an excellent full size carry pistol or home defense gun, I picked up another 45 recently is the only reason I'm looking to part with it.I will sell it with light and holster for $500, without the light and holster for $400.  Prices are FIRM, I am not desperate to get rid of it. The only trades I would consider would be an entry level AR15 such as an M&P15 Sport, Ruger AR556, or PSA rifle (No dpms or poly lowers).  Or I would consider just a complete upper, but I would prefer one with an 18-20 inch barrel and a mid or rifle length gas system.If interested feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3, texts will get the fastest response from me. Thanks!"

We are super proud to offer this fine example of the very hard to find Model 1886 in extra light takedown form. The 1886 was another of John Browning's proof of genius, and the receiver of each gun starts out as a 40 ounce chunk of solid steel. It would handle the most powerful rounds of the era. After years of offering more and more powerful chamberings, gun makers then found ways to make them lighter. Fitted with a tapered 22 inch barrel, this rifle is a pleasure to tote and point. The special order takedown feature makes it even more practical. It takes down in about 10 seconds, and locks up tight just as fast. Made in the year of our Lord 1910, she is in good condition for 106 years old. The wood is about flush or over where it meets the steel, with only light carry marks. The stampings are very sharp and clear, indicating good care was given to this rifle. The bore is good, with some light roughness in the grooves, but plenty of shine and good rifling. The front sight is typical for a special order 1886, and is one of my favorites. It is the Lyman ""hunting sight"", which has matting and a real ivory bead. Let's look at value. I see 2 more of these listed over at guns international, a very nice one at 9000 and another with a climbin' Lyman for 7500. I will start this one for far less. If you have been looking for the right Winchester 1886 to collect, shoot, or for investment, with the added clout of an extra lightweight takedown, then look no further,shipping available and gun is in excellent condition"

The craftsmanship of this shotgun rivals the quality and craftsmanship of the English and Italian shotguns. The shotgun is in great condition with very few use marks. It is chambered for 3 1/2 inch magnum and is rated for steel shot. I never used steel shot because over time it will scar the inside of the barrels. You can tell when you look through the barrels that it has probably never had steel shot through it. The inside of the barrels look like mirrors. The barrels are 32 inches long and holds a pattern of about 9 inches at 40 yards. Perfect shotgun for duck, goose or deer. But, don't limit yourself to that because there is not many things this gun WILL NOT bring down! I know the gun is worth more than I am asking, but I am motivated to sell quickly to make another purchase. For more pictures or more info please text or call John at REDACTED.

The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game."

I originally bought this for the purpose of using the Speed Bead and mounting a FastFire III for turkey hunting, but wound up getting in to TSS this year and prefer my 20g now. I bought a new Steady Grip stock and a used camo forearm. I intended to have the gun cerakoted and the steadygrip stock and forearm dipped in one pattern for turkey, and the original stock/forearm another pattern for duck.

It will come with some accessories to make a near complete package. It will come as pictured below, minus the scope. Details:•Scope mount:The side rail mount is an NPZ from Russia via AKFiles member Kosea. The mounts are Weaver brand. I'll include them to take the guess work out of finding a set to work with the setup. They were ~$50 new. •Fire Control GroupI also installed a Red Star Arms adjustable FCG. This trigger does not fit the rifle in its stock form, so I performed the necessary modifications to ensure complete function. (A quick Google search can show the required steps needed, so I won't detail that here.) I will include the instructions for the FCG with the rifle. I have it set to two stage, with a light take up but firm, quick breaking second stage. Essentially 0 over-travel and quick reset. The selector lever isn't a PAP piece, it's an original M70 under folder selector. I notched it to clear the FCG to allow proper function, so it goes with the rifle. •MagazinesI will ship three (3) 20 round magazines with the rifle. These are M14 mags modified to work in the M77. I have original springs with them as well as Wolff extra power springs. I will include the original springs as well. Two (2) of the magazines are CMI (Check Mate Industries) and one (1) is from KeepShooting.com. These mags have worked well for me, although I can't say have had 0 issues with them. The CMI seems to perform better with the original spring than the Wolff. The opposite is true with the KeepShooting mags. I'm asking $950 for the package, plus shipping and insurance. I'm willing to entertain reasonable offers, so feel free. I will also drive within a reasonable distance to meet for a FTF transfer in Tennessee. Valid state DL is required for a FTF. Payment will be accepted in the form of USPS money orders, discrete PayPal, or cash for a FTF. Please message me with any question or offers."
