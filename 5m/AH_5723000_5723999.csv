The hammer spurs are close for easier both hammers one-handed cocking. The top latch lever even works under the cocked hammer to allow it to open the action. Because for CAS you don't shoot much at arial targets most of the other CAS SXS’s don`t have enough drop in the stock. They tend to shoot high for most people.

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration. The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional."

The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope. All VEPR rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual."

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration. The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional."

The Jeep corners like it is on rails. Smooth ride. This is a custom Jeep, one of a kind, all exhaust system is shielded to go off road in the brush without setting the grass on fire. Custom high impact factory custom bumpers, only 10k miles on the odometer. As stated, new mint condition, never abused, always garaged, owned by an 82 year old man who no longer can drive it, hard for him to get in and out of. All the records, oil changed to full synthetic oil in everything, transmission, differentials, engine. This car was broken in correctly oil changed several times before the jeep hit 1000 miles. Too many extras to list. Color Silver, with factory hard top. Interior excellent, still has the new car smell inside. Top never removed. The owner is an aerospace engineer who specializes in mechanical engineering, all aftermarket items installed professionally. This vehicle is a one of a kind, all custom fitting floor mats, double sound insulation around doors, special heat shielding to block any damaging heat from engine, heat shielding keeps the cab cooler in the summer months, exhaust manifold heat shielding to keep engine bay cool on those long hot trails. Life time radiator silicone hoses. Life time Evans waterless Coolant installed. High performance K & N Cold Air package. Please note, the photos of the skid plates are from the vendor websites, the actual items are painted including the entire underside of the Jeep to prevent any rust or corrosion. Axles, drive shaft and other components painted to prevent corrosion. This Jeep is custom and has hundreds of hours in it of customizations that are too many to list. I just installed the kit that gives the back seat a better angle recline. Just installed Best Top drivers side under chair lock box and the SuperChips Trail Dash. The Trail Dash allows one to program the engine for max performance and optimal mileage, a $500 addition. A great one of a kind Jeep for someone who realizes that all these aftermarket items are worth thousands of dollars already installed and tested thoroughly. This Jeep is ready for your favorite off road destination."

The Jeep corners like it is on rails. Smooth ride. This is a custom Jeep, one of a kind, all exhaust system is shielded to go off road in the brush without setting the grass on fire. Custom high impact factory custom bumpers, only 10k miles on the odometer. As stated, new mint condition, never abused, always garaged, owned by an 82 year old man who no longer can drive it, hard for him to get in and out of. All the records, oil changed to full synthetic oil in everything, transmission, differentials, engine. This car was broken in correctly oil changed several times before the jeep hit 1000 miles.
