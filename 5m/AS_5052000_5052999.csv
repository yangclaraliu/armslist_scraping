He probably picked it up from someone in the French military. After WW I, France asked manufacturers in Spain to create a carry gun for its military. Dozens of Spanish factories built guns of this design.  For the complete story on these guns, see: http://www.reenactor.net/units/151ri/weps/ruby_pistol.htm  This gun was made by La Industria Orbea, Eibar, Spain. That's what the fading etching on the side of the slide indicates (above the ""CAL 7.65"" marking). Beneath the right end of the slide is a stamped ""IO"" inside an oval. That indicates the gun was made by Industrie Orbea. The same logo appears on the bottom of the clip, which shows it is original.  At the base of the handle are stamped two stars, ""**."" This indicates the gun was used by the French military.  At the back of the slide is an engraved ""TC"" that looks like the logo on the caps of the Minnesota Twins. I have diminished its appearance with a dose from a Gun Blue Pen from Birchwood Casey.  The gun comes with an authentic military type holster with the flap over the gun and a pocket for the clip. I am also including the hard plastic case in which it is set for the photo. For a local sale, I will include about 1 1/2 boxes of .32 Auto ammo.  I also have for sale a brown leather holster my father usually kept the gun in. It's vintage, from Brauer Bros. in St. Louis. Those go for about $40 on eBay.  I just took the one photo because I wanted to get this uploaded as soon as possible. I will take more if someone requests them.  Asking price is for local pick up. If I have to ship it to your FFL holder, the cost should be an additional around $45. That's what it cost when I shipped a pistol last month."

I will trade for $50 worth of ammo too.I traded for a bunch of swords from a blade refinishing guy who basically refinished samurai swords. He finished two of them with 550 paracord and installed survival firestarter/compasses into the scabbards, but never got around to the other swords. Well, I never got to them either so my loss is your gain!Note that these are NOT $500 each Paul Chen, Cold Steel or other higher end swords; although they are imports, they are ALL still 440 stainless steel blades that will take a razor sharp edge. Some of the blades are sharper than others as is, but all will need final sharpening to hone them to razor. These are NOT cheap pot metal swords for Halloween costumes or cosplay. Again, they are real steel blades.This lot contains 14 short, medium and long swords with one extra short blade thrown in. If you are handy with a sander, a gloss spray can, can wrap paracord and sharpen a blade, you could easily refinish these swords to a much nicer state than they came new and easily make $50 or more per sword!With 14 complete blades/scabbards, I would value this lot even in it's unfinished condition at approximately $400 TO $500 or so. Remember that there are two finished swords in this group with sharpened blades that are easily worth what you are going to offer I'm sure. Let the offers fly, but don't insult me. I'm not going to let this whole lot go for eighty bucks. With that said, we both have the opportunity to get what we want here with a comparable trade. I am always looking for ammo and firearms related trades. Let me know what you have for trade.Trading value would be dependent upon your offer. NO, I'm not trading this whole lot for a beat up BB gun or a box of ammo. Please keep your cash and trade offers reasonable.Will meet in S. Hill Puyallup/Tacoma area only. No LOOKI-LOOS!

Make this historical piece apart of your collection!Excellent mechanical condition.
Remington MLE 190715 RAG 1907-15 8mm Lebel French Berthier Sporter Remington Factory Berthier Bolt Action Sporting Rifle. Curio/relic. Cal. 8mm Lebel. Manuf. Remington Arms 1918. This is one of the rarely seen Remington Factory Berthier sporting conversions. Because the demand for rifles could not be met by their own industry, France contracted with Remington Arms to manufacture the Model 07/15. For unknown reasons the Berthier’s magazine capacity was three rounds while German rifles held five rounds, and British 10 rounds. When World War I began the French quickly realized the problems with the Berthier. The Model 1907 was modified by adding a metal extension to the bottom of the rifle so a five round clip could be loaded. Thus the rifle Model 07/15. It became the primary rifle of the French army during World War I. Many of these rifles were re-imported after the end of World War I and sold on the surplus market. Remington was stuck with these guns after WWI when the French refused to pay for them. They then decided to cut their losses by converting a number of them to sporting rifles. The walnut stock has been cut down for sport use and is in good condition with handling marks and dings. The blueing is about 25% on the metal surfaces with minor pitting from old rust and light corrosion from sweat especially on the trigger guard. The bore is good with definitive rifling with no visible pitting. Remington never serialized these and there are no numbers on it anywhere. Comes with the hard to find three round enbloc. The 8mm Lebel is a very powerful round and is readily available at an affordable price from PRIVI and is adequate for all North American big game. This rifle has a unique sight combination of a rear and front peep sight that is very easy to use. Overall the rifle is in good condition for a nearly 100 year old sporterized war relic. We have shot this rifle and it certainly gets the attention at the range."

Let me know what you've got and what you need for them and hopefully we can work something out. Thanks!                                                                    Keywords: AK 47 AK47 AK 74 AK74 surplus milsurp mag mags magazine magazines AR15 AR 15 okay industries center industries colt 30rd 20rd 40rd"

Curio/relic. Cal. 8mm Lebel. Manuf. Remington Arms 1918. This is one of the rarely seen Remington Factory Berthier sporting conversions. Because the demand for rifles could not be met by their own industry, France contracted with Remington Arms to manufacture the Model 07/15. For unknown reasons the Berthier’s magazine capacity was three rounds while German rifles held five rounds, and British 10 rounds. When World War I began the French quickly realized the problems with the Berthier. The Model 1907 was modified by adding a metal extension to the bottom of the rifle so a five round clip could be loaded. Thus the rifle Model 07/15. It became the primary rifle of the French army during World War I. Many of these rifles were re-imported after the end of World War I and sold on the surplus market. Remington was stuck with these guns after WWI when the French refused to pay for them. They then decided to cut their losses by converting a number of them to sporting rifles. The walnut stock has been cut down for sport use and is in good condition with handling marks and dings. The blueing is about 25% on the metal surfaces with minor pitting from old rust and light corrosion from sweat especially on the trigger guard. The bore is good with definitive rifling with no visible pitting. Remington never serialized these and there are no numbers on it anywhere. The 8mm Lebel is a very powerful round and is readily available at an affordable price from PRIVI and is adequate for all North American big game. This rifle has a unique sight combination of a rear and front peep sight that is very easy to use. Overall the rifle is in good condition for a nearly 100 year old sporterized war relic. We have shot this rifle and it certainly gets the attention at the range."

I bought these to try my hand at finishing out 80% lowers and I decided that I do not have the skill to do it.I HAVE NOT TOUCHED THESE 80% lowers, they are as they came from the manufacturer. YOU WILL NEED TO FINISH THEM YOURSELF.I will ask to see a PTP or PTC, I just need to be sure you are not a criminal even though these are paperweights.If you do not know what 80% lowers are, I suggest you educate yourself before buying.CASH OR TRADE ONLY - no low balls offers"

SilencerCo’s Multiple Accessory Attachment Device (MAAD) allows you to interchange the Saker’s mount so that you can attach the Saker to your preexisting quick detach mount and save hundreds of dollars. This patent pending baffle technology protects the Saker’s baffles from erosion thus increasing its durability. Much as armor on an armored vehicle deflects the debris from an IED, the Hoplon Baffle deflects debris and cuts down on baffle erosion up to 90%. The TrifectaRS flash hider is the most advanced quick detach mount on earth. The RS stands for Resonance Suppression which is a patent pending technology that keeps the flash hider from ringing like a tuning fork. The TrifectaRS also allows the Saker to be attached and detached from the rifle quickly with one hand.All NFA rules apply. If you out of state then this will transfer on a Form 3. If your in Tn then we can do the form 4."
