The West may have been tamed and fenced long ago, but its unbridled spirit lives on in this line of traditional big-bore Henry rifles. Choose from .44 Magnum, .45 Colt and .357 Magnum. All are SASS approved so Cowboy Action shooters who enjoy stepping back to that bygone era can use them in competition. Don’t let the retro look fool you, these rifles are much more than shootin’ irons for today’s new breed of cowboy. They’re also the unbeatable choice of big-game hunters who prefer the traditional look, feel, reliability and accuracy that comes from an authentic Henry rifle. The traditional 20? octagonal barrel is outfitted with a classic fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear sight with a reversible white diamond insert and a brass beaded front sight. The tubular magazine tops off at 10 rounds. Both the straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted of select American walnut accented with a brass barrel band and Henry’s recognizable brass receiver. All have that crisp, smooth action that sets an authentic American-made Henry apart from other lever action rifles on the range and in the woods today.

Awesome gun, light recoil for .357 sig, even with hot Underwood ammo. Just not the right gun for me. $1400 is about right for the TRADE value for the gun in barely used condition (exactly 60 rounds through it since I bought it new) and all the extras in my opinion. This stuff is just over $1500 new, and I will take the new value of your items when considering a trade. I will accept $1200 cash for everything (somewhat negotiable). If we're trading multiple guns or gun plus cash, we'll figure something out that works for both of us. You can text me at REDACTED.

The Renegade is how POF does basic. The features in the Renegade go far beyond the low entry barrier that many manufacturers obtain but don’t care to surpass. This barrier of entry is known as MILSPEC. As you’ll see, it is anything but basic. In fact, the only parts that can be considered basic are the forged lower receiver and flat-top upper receiver. The heat sink barrel nut dissipates heat quicker than any system on the market. Our patented E2 technology brings a new definition to extraction reliability. The Dictator 9-position adjustable gas block, with straight gas tube, let’s you tune this rifle to be as smooth and flat shooting as possible, no matter the ammo load out. At this price, and even well beyond it, you simply will not find features like this on any other rifle. The 15” Renegade rail with M-LOK compatibility and 4 integrated QD slots provides maximum comfort, hand placement, and accessory mounting options. Topped off with a 16.5” nitride heat treated barrel, you have a 1 MOA guaranteed rifle suited for any patriot.

It combines the injury reducing benefits of traditional stun technology with a quantum leap in stopping power via new Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology. In police studies, the new TASER® M26C has a higher instant incapacitation rate than a 9mm hand gun. The TASER® M26C shoots out 2 darts attached to 15 feet of wire. 50,000 volts travels over the wires and over-rides the central nervous system providing incredible takedown power. Package includes includes:  One (1) TASER® M26C with Integrated Laser Sight  Four (4) Air Cartridges One (1) Carrying case  (Note: Requires 8 AA batteries which are NOT included.)NEW Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) TechnologyThere are two catagories of energy weapons: Stun weapons and EMD weapons.STUN WEAPONS: Traditional stun technology weapons operate in a 7-14 Watt range and interfere with the communication signals within the nervous system of the target. These stun systems primarily effect the sensory nervous system. Like static on the communication lines between the brain and the body, stun systems interfere with the human command and control systems. However, a small percentage of people with a very high tolerance for electrical stimulation can fight through the effect of these 7-14 Watt systems. The TASER® 44001 series is a stun weapon using the same settings used by law enforcement for over 20 years.EMD WEAPONS: EMD weapons use a more powerful 16 - 26 Watt electrical signal to completely override the central nervous system and directly control the skeletal muscles. This EMD effect causes an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle tissue, allowing the M-Series to physically debilitate a target regardless of pain tolerance or mental focus.The TASER® M-Series are EMD weapons -- specifically designed to stop even the most elite, aggressive, focused combatants. Rather than simply interfering with communication between the brain and muscles, the TASER® EMD systems directly tell the muscles what to do: contract until the target is in the fetal position on the ground. The TASER® provides for maximum safety for both the user and the subject by bringing dangerous situations quickly under control before force escalates to lethal levels."
