The iron sight line was redesigned and featured a rear receiver aperture battle sight calibrated for 300 yd (274 m) with an additional ladder aperture sight that could be flipped up and was calibrated for 200–1,300 yd (183–1,189 m) in 100 yd (91 m) increments.

It is LNIB with all Glock 21 Gen 4 acc's and with professionally installed aftermarket “Tritium” Night Sights, which were about an extra $100 installed.Everyone knows or should know about Glocks. You point, pull the trigger and they go “bang.” The G 21 holds 13 + 1 when fully loaded, and it still weighs less than a full sized 1911 empty. Pull out a 1911 in an emergency and forget to take off the safety (if carried in a cocked and locked position) or forget to cock it in a panic situation, and you just might be a “long gone pecan.”Pull out the G 21 and pull the trigger, doesn't get any more complicated than that, plus you have party favors for (14). Only $545. You can't even come close to buying a quality 1911 for that. When you put your life on the line, only buy quality and proven track record firearms no matter what caliber you choose.Everything I own is either in LNIB condition or NIB and Un-fired condition. I am a gun enthusiast and a private gun owner, and don't need to sell anything, but just re-adjusting what I have.Will need a signed “Bill Of Sale” for the both of us.                                                               ""PLEASE NO TEXT"""

The Colt Model 1908 Pocket Hammerless is a variant introduced five years later in .380 ACP caliber. Despite the title 'Hammerless', the Model 1903 does have a hammer. It is covered and hidden from view under the rear of the slide. This allowed the pistol to be carried in and withdrawn from a pocket quickly and smoothly without snagApproximately 570,000 Colt Pocket Hammerless pistols were produced from 1903 to 1945, in five different types (see Variants paragraph below). Some were issued to US Army and US Air Force general officers from World War II through the 1970s. They were replaced in 1972 with the RIA Colt M15 General Officer's Model, a compact version of the M1911A1. The Shanghai Municipal Police issued the M1908 to its Chinese officers in the 1920s and 1930s and it was a popular model with police in the United States such as the New York City Police Department, Woonsocket RI, Chicopee Mas, Gloversville NY. Detroit MI and many others. In addition to lawful owners, many gangsters of the pre-World War II era favored the Model 1903 and Model 1908 because they were relatively small and easily concealed. It is said that Al Capone kept one in his coat pocket and Bonnie Parker used one to break Clyde Barrow out of jail after smuggling it into the jail by taping it to her thigh.

When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

Innovative mechanical design, innovative manufacturing processes and innovative materials used in firearms production, define UTAS and set the company apart from other's in the firearms industry. Along with numerous patented design innovations, the new UTS-15 military and police combat shotgun recently developed by UTAS will be the first shotgun every produced with a receiver produced 100% from polymer. In fact over 80% of the gun is fabricated from fiber reinforced injection molded polymer. Of course using new lightweight materials in firearms has to be backed up with solid engineering and that's exactly what UTAS does."

This shotgun is like new and doesn't have a scratch on it.The Benelli SuperNova® is an innovatively designed Pump-Action Shotgun made from the most advanced materials. The SuperNova is an ultra-reliable, nearly indestructible pump shotgun that's ideal for all-round rugged use. This SuperNova is finished with the Realtree MAX-4® camo pattern, designed specifically for waterfowl hunting. Filled with cattails, swamp grasses, and cane, MAX-4 blends in with marshlands as well as corn stubble and other agricultural cropland. The SuperNova comes with Benelli's ComforTech® recoil reduction system that tames recoil from magnum loads considerably and reduces muzzle rise for fast follow up shots. A shim kit enables adjustment of drop and cast; integrated sling attachments allow the shotgun to be carried with a sling. Benelli constructs the SuperNova with corrosion-proof polymer over-molded on a skeleton framework to form single-piece receiver and buttstock for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Exterior metal parts have a non-glare, anti-corrosive finish. The polymer forearm pushes a rotary-head bolt back with dual-action bars. Aggressive ribbing on a contour-tapered forearm provides a secure hold while cycling the action under any circumstance. A magazine disconnect button on the bottom of the forearm allows user to quickly unload the chamber without releasing another round from the magazine, to quickly load another round via the ejection port in the event that a different shooting situation suddenly presents itself. The premium steel barrel features a ventilated stepped rib with a mid bead and red-bar front sight. The Nova utilizes a magazine cap that doubles as a tool for pushing out the single pin that holds the trigger assembly in place; the shotgun can be fieldstripped down to basic components in less than a minute. The Benelli 12 gauge SuperNova Pump-Action Shotgun handles all 2-3/4"", 3"" and 3-1/2"" ammunition. Realtree MAX-4 finish blends into waterfowl habitatComforTech recoil reduction system stock1-piece receiver and buttstockMagazine disconnect buttonStepped vent rib barrelRotating bolt headDual-action barsFieldstrips easily3-1/2"" chamber"

Can't remember for sure but somewhere around 300 rounds down the pipe, mostly 38 special. In the beginning I carried it in a soft leather holster so there's a little bluing wear on both sides of the muzzle. Other than that the revolver is perfect. I would rate this piece at around 97%. I don't think you will be able to see the muzzle wear too well in the one picture that Armslist allows, but I have many more pictures to email if you're interested. They just don't do bluing like this anymore.
Also included is a set of Wolff gunsprings that I never got around to installing: two hammer springs and a lightened trigger spring. I lost the box many years ago in the move from Kansas to Colorado, so what you see is what you get. I'm old now and just do not ever shoot this revolver. I think it's from the mid 1960s.
I'll meet you anywhere in the metro area to do the transfer on your dime, but if you want to meet at JAX Outdoor Sports in Lafayette I'll pay for your BGC fees. I also will ship most anywhere from my FFL to yours for exactly what my FFL charges: $40.
Not really interested in trades but I suppose I could be tempted by a high quality 1911. Thanks for looking."

The average dry sound signature of the Ti-RANT .45 is 133 dB when fired on a Heckler and Koch USP Tactical .45 with Remington 230 grain ammunition. This puts the dry performance of the Ti-RANT .45 squarely in the ballpark of most competitor's 9mm pistol silencers. With a wet charge of 5cc’s of water, the sound signature drops to 125 dB. To put it another way, our .45 silencer is quieter than some company’s .22 silencers. The Ti-RANT .45 does not stand out among a sea of posers just because of its jaw-dropping performance. Intelligent material selection gives the Ti-RANT .45 unequalled durability in a deceptively light-weight package."

After World War II, the Yugoslavs took this design and incorporated modifications based upon Germany’s Mauser Karabiner 98k. Although similar in general appearance to that of the German rifle, The main difference between the M48 and the K98k is that the M48 uses an intermediate-length receiver.
