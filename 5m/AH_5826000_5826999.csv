Working with our newly formed 3 Gun shooting team, Team Stag Arms, we have determined the features and configuration that will have the broadest appeal and use in competition. With this rifle, competitors are able to produce fast and accurate shots from close to long range as is needed in 3 Gun competitions. Boasting an 18 stainless steel fluted heavy barrel with a rifle length gas system and the new Stag Arms 3G compensator; recoil impulse is greatly reduced allowing for fast follow up shots. Aiding in accuracy is the Samson Evolution handguard, which is free floating and modular, allowing the attachment of rail sections or sling mounts along the handguard. This also grants the shooter the ability to mount accessories as needed but not be burdened with a full quad rail. The trigger is a Geissele Super 3 Gun trigger, which was specifically developed for 3 Gun competitions, as the name implies. It possesses a great reputation for durability and has what Geissele calls a hybrid pull. This hybrid pull is a unique combination of a single and two stage that allows for both quick close range shots and more deliberate long range shots. The buttstock and pistol gri p are from Magpul featuring their collapsible ACS buttstock that provides a comfortable cheek weld along with storage and their MOE pistol grip that provides a solid and secure grip."

The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability."

The PLR-22 pistol is chambered for the popular and economical .22 Long Rifle cartridge (.22LR). It is based on the 5.56mm NATO chambered PLR-16 pistol and shares many parts including the grip and front and rear sights. The PLR-22 is not a simple conversion kit, it is a standalone firearm chambered for the .22LR and is designed for target shooting, plinking, or small game hunting. The PLR-22 operates by blowback action and has a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16 and SU-16.
 
The PLR-22 and SU-22 will accept many of the same accessories as the PLR-16 and SU-16 including the slings, stocks, and compact forend. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and the front sight is adjustable for elevation. An integrated picatinny rail on top will accept a multitude of sighting options. The muzzle end of the barrel is threaded ½""-28 to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake. A 26 round semi-transparent magazine is included and it will accept magazines designed for the Atchison M-16 conversion.Call Tina or Mike REDACTED"

I've been told it will shoot anything from a 1 oz load to a 3 1/2 load.  This gun comes with 5 choke tubes, wrench, case, all papers, detachable sling swivels and it has the Kick-off stock. THE LOWDOWN The metal parts of Beretta's 3½-inch auto have a rust-resistant Aqua coating inside and out. As I determined in my test (see box), this coating protects the gun extremely well. (In contrast, I also sprayed salt-water on an old muzzleloader destined for the dump; its bluing peeled right off within three hours.) Rubberized inserts in the stock help you hang on in wet weather. Just a few easy- to-clean parts make up the gas system, yet it dampens recoil noticeably. The gun shoots even softer if you spring for the optional, effective Kick-Off stock.I've never fired this gun.  But, here's an on-line *review of this gun. *This is the best automatic shotgun I've ever owned. This gun will cycle everything from 1 oz. target loads up to 1 7/8 oz. 3 1/2"" magnum steel shot. I do not have the Kick-Off system, but in my opinion it is not needed. The versatility of the detachable sling is great for packing the gun to and from the blind."

Many dislike the fact that you are supposed to run at least 200 rounds before you should consider them dependable. This one has just hit that mark and runs VERY well. Only a few ftf's during break in anyway. They come with a factory stainless guide rod and triggers are smooth as butter! Sooooo slim it hides very well. I am firm on my price of $450.

$800 in cash.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace, I can add??
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"
