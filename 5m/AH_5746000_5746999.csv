I will also be including a cheap BLACKHAWK! OWB Nylon holster and a size 1450 Pelican case with foam already cut to accomodate this handgun and a Ruger GP100, along with two mag holes and space for 3 speedloaders.  Price is 470$; OF COURSE I understand you can get a new one for around $400 out the door, but I arrived at the price based on this reasoning...Tristar T100/Canik Shark-C: 350-360$ + tax and background     Used: 280$LPA Adjustable Rear Sight: 100-110$ shipped    Used (nearly new) and Cosmetic Damage: 70$LOK Grips: 60$    Used but nearly new: 50$Pelican Case, Size 1450: 110$    Used but nearly new, foam modified: 70$BLACKHAWK holster: 10$    INCLUDED Free.I am open to some haggle, I understand the concept of coming to a deal.  I DO hope any potential buyers see I've tried to be reasonable in how I've priced everything out.  Out the door, the gun, the sights, and the grips would come to 510$ + tax and background. For any serious inquiries from the Knoxville area or beyond, I am willing to meet as far from the Tri-Cities as Oak Ridge, but for that distance would be pretty intent on my asking price. I will be requiring a Bill of Sale and a look at any buyer's TN State Issued ID.  A carry permit is even better, but is not a requirement."

Innovative Design The SRS-A1 Covert sniper rifle was purpose designed for police and military snipers needing ultimate concealability and maneuverability. The SRS-A1 Covert is designed around the core components of accuracy with super ergonomics. The use of aircraft grade materials and ultra high strength steel creates an extremely durable and lightweight system. Accurate Designed with the same accuracy components as the SRS-A1, the Covert holds the same guarantee of the 1/2 MOA or better accuracy at 100 yards for 3 shots using DT ammunition. The SRS-A1 Covert uses conversion kits with fast-twist barrels to optimize accuracy for btoh subsonic and full-power ammunition. Compact The SRS-A1 Covert is the shortest sniper rifle in the world with an overall length of just 27 inches. At over a foot shorter than traditional sniper rifles, the Covert adds a new level of concealability in a full-power sniper rifle that gives up no capability. Convertible The SRS-A1 Covert uses their patented quick caliber conversion feature. With the ability to change calibers in sixty seconds, operators have the option to fire suppressed subsonic ammunition or full power standard ammunition with MOA accuracy. The Covert also accepts full-length SRS-A1 conversion kits in all calibers providing snipers full size rifle flexibility. Features  Recoil Pad: The recoil pad is raised to position the shooter's shoulder above the bore line in order to minimize muzzle rise and the pad is soft enough to allow long strings of fire with large magnum cartridges like the 338 Lapua Magnum. Adjustable Length of Pull: Users can quickly adjust length of pull by adding or removing multiple 1/2 inch spacers with their proprietary lever locking system. Monopod: Desert Tech's patent-pending monopod is the fastest actuating device of its kind. Just pull down on the knurled thumb wheel to engage the spike for rapid elevation modification and then spin the wheel right or left for fine adjustment. Cheek Piece: Desert Tech's non-slip cheek piece adjusts up or down and securely locks into place via two screws and locking ribs ensure it doesn't come out of adjustment. Telescopic Bolt: Desert Tech's bolt utilizes a 60 degree bolt throw for fast manipulation. It's collapsible design allows the rifle length to be extremely short. Safety: The ambidextrous safety switch easily easily actuated from firing position. Match Trigger: The match trigger is adjustable for travel, creep, location, and weight. Barrel Mounting System: Desert Tech's patented barrel mounting system ensures consistent mounting & return-to-zero repeatability. Its five inch locking engagement reduces harmonic barrel whip of a 26"" barrel to that of a 20"" barrel which improves accuracy as a result. Handguard and Accessory Mounting: The free-floated handguard has six flush cup sling mounting points to chose from and also allows users to strategically place picatinny rails to optimize mounting of support accessories. Barrel: Stainless steel fluted match barrel. The barrel mounting system utilizes five inches of locking engagement which reduces harmonic barrel whip of a 26"" barrel to that of a 20"" barrel which improves noticeably improves accuracy as a result. Muzzle Devices: Desert Tech's patented muzzle devices both muzzle breaks and silencers are designed to increase accuracy, shooter recovery, and reduce recoil by 30-40%. Accuracy is improved because their designs immediately strip excess gases away from projectiles.

765,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5746765,For Sale:  WEBLEY MARK V REVOLVER,"Blacksburg, Roanoke, Virginia",$ 750,"Listed On: Tuesday, August 2, 2016",Handguns,no type,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"Here is the nicest Webley Mark V revolver you will ever see.  The mark V is one of the least common of the big Webley top-breaks, as it had a very short production run.  It was introduced in 1913 and superseded by the big Mark VI in 1915: most Mark V’s date from 1914-15.  Thus nearly all of them would have seen service in World War One, and many were issued during World War Two as well.
I bought this revolver as a college student in 1966.  It was imported as military surplus in the halcyon years before the never-sufficiently-to-be-cursed Gun Control Act of 1968, so of course it has absolutely no importer markings.  It has British military AND commercial proof marks.  These were required by British law whenever a gun was released from Crown ownership into the commercial market.  There is a British “sold-out-of-service mark” (opposed Broad Arrows). It is stamped with the country of origin, “ENGLAND,” a requirement of US law for imported goods since 1890.
The serial numbers on the frame and barrel do not match, but because there are both military and commercial proof markings, it left England that way.  It was almost certainly assembled using parts of two different existing revolvers, probably at the beginning of World War Two.  In 1939 the British were caught short on armaments and arsenal rebuilding of older weapons was a standard practice while production lines ramped up.  It has been very professionally refinished, and the job is so well done that all of the markings are intact and undamaged.
The 4” barrel has a bright, shiny bore; the cylinder chambers are unmarked by rust or corrosion.  It is TIGHT, much tighter than most Webleys.  Lockup is solid and it is fully shootable.  Functioning is perfect in both single and double action.  The cylinder—as is true of nearly all Webleys in the USA—has been modified to accept .45 Auto with half-moon clips, and four of these are included in the sale.  It will also shoot .45 Auto Rim, if you can find any.
I have reached an age when I’m “thinning the herd” and selling off much of my collection: for re-enactors, gun collectors, and tin-can-bouncers, this gun is ideal.  It’s a chance to get a fairly uncommon gun at a reasonable price; one you can actually shoot for fun or self-defense.  Nobody ever made better revolvers than Webley, and this is a very, very good one.You will pay ACTUAL SHIPPING, to a US street address, via FEDEX.  I cannot send a handgun through the US Mails, and FEDEX cannot deliver to PO Boxes.   BE CERTAIN YOUR FFL HOLDER WILL ACCEPT THIS GUN FROM A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL.  I will include a courtesy copy of my driver's license for his records.  Bona fide Virginia residents age 21 and over can purchase it in a face to face transfer with proof of residence.PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY!NO SALES TO CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, OR MASSACHUSETTS! I recently had a supposed ""buyer"" for this gun who wanted to engage in a shady transaction.  I won't go into details, but this fellow ended up being reported to the BATF and the FBI for attempted illegal purchase, forgery, and mail fraud.  Believe me, folks: I know the laws on this sort of sale inside out and backwards and I WILL spot you if you try to scam me or get me to do something illegal.  I WILL report you to Armslist, and the Federal authorities if you try."

The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to their polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suilt, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07's safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09's updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we've had to date.

Go ahead, make Dirty Harry’s day, buy this hand-cannon.
My selling price of $1,400 is firm.  In fact, my selling price for a FACTORY NEW, NEVER FIRED AMT AUTOMAG III is less than a used Automag!  But don’t take my word for it, see a typical selling price of a used Automag for yourself, go to: https://www.gunsamerica.com/910511780/AMT-IAI-Auto-Mag-III-30-carbine-6-1-2-barrel-original-box-copy-of-manual-1-mag-Millett-adj-site-rar.htm
