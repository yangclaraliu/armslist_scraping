Here's why.I don't sell dogs! I have only bought the best condition guns throughout the years because if and when I sell them I don't have to makes excuses or apologize for them.Sometimes (more often than not) gun show dealers will take milsurps that are already clean but nasty dogs, then lather them up in cosmoline and tell you ""How great they'll clean up!""Since many buyers at gun show already have stars in their eyes and don't want to get their hands dirty they buy the dealer's fluff and take the dog home only to discover that they've been bit.I don't play that game or waste my time with lowballers. Don't screw up good milsurps by trying to make them something they were never meant to be.  Adding ""tactical"" stocks and all that other crap is money better spent on other guns, ammo, and fun. You can always sell an orignal milsurp. You can't hardly give away that after-market bs.$385.00Cash only, no shipping, no trades. FTF in Cleveland, TN"

S# 69XXX (1913) with early Rampant Colt superimposed over the stylized ""C"", grooved hammer top, original barrel cut to 2 1/8” according to information pass on to me from Colt collector this was shipped to California in 1913.
This Fitz conversion was done at some point much later than the gun production date and after Fitz conversions already became known and popular. This was probably done between 1920 and 1925 because of the patina. The workmanship on this old Colt looks like it was done by a Master gunsmith that paid attention to detail.
 
Bore and rifling are in good condition along with the cylinder, its chamber for 38 special you can also use the shorter 38 S&W cartridge.  Pistol has period grips and the nickel finish is about 80% remaining, it shows use which is to be expected for a 103 year old gun included is the period holster.  Because of the rarity of this conversion this Colt would make a nice addition to your Colt collection.
 
Before his death on June 12, 1945 H J Fitzgerald travelled 30,000 miles a year throughout the U.S. visiting different Police Departments offering Pistol shooting instruction. During these trips he also met with many other clients interested in his shooting skills and his unique conversions including troops during WWII. There’s a possibly this might be one of his conversions since not all his conversions were done at the factory while he worked for Colt; you be the Judge either way these conversions are extremely rare.
