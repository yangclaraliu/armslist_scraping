Night sights recently purchased and still nice and bright. Low round count as this weapon is NOT used for competition. Ideally the pistol is for sale but will consider trade for Glock 19 of similar condition and generation. All normal ""accesories"" included with a new purchase are in the box. Comes with 3 magazines and I can also work out a deal on whatever .40 ammo I have left over. Internals have been polished for smoothness, but none of the parts are aftermarket. With the exception of the night sights it is a stock weapon.
My motivation for selling is that my wife shoots the 9mm round much better than the .40.
If you don't have a valid Georgia CWP a sale must go through a FFL holder. NO EXCEPTIONS."

Comes with Williams peep sight, butt pad, muzzle brake, cheek riser, accutrigger and accustock. The cheek riser is pretty useless if using the iron sights. Unless you have a head the size of a softball. However it works well when mounting a scope. The combination of butt pad and muzzle brake significantly reduces recoil, giving quick target aquisition. Bolt is short stroke and very smooth.There have been 60 rounds +/- down the tube. So, if this is such a sweet rifle why are you selling it you ask. I'm a Lever gun guy, and can't seem to really like a bolt gun. I tried.Not interested in trades. Will only sell to NH residents. Willing to travel to meet a reasonable distance.

This also has several infrared settings for nightvision.The Aimpoint® Micro T-2 redefines everything you thought you knew about compact red dot sights. Cutting edge lens coatings radically improve the shape and clarity of the 2 MOA red dot and physical protection has been added for even more ruggedness. We listened to feedback coming from hard-core customers desiring an even more hard core Micro sight. With a redesigned and reinforced house body, as well as flip-up covers protecting the lenses, the Aimpoint® Micro T-2 can withstand all types of environmental conditions.At the same time, we decided to improve upon the optical performance of the sight which results in a new lens and an important breakthrough in reflective lens coatings. This makes the Micro T-2 and the 3XMag magnifier a fantastic optical combination.UNIQUE FEATURESAdvanced optical lenses for even better light transmissionFront Flip-up lens cover is includedTransparent rear Flip-up lens cover is includedReinforced protection of the turrets for even greater ruggednessIdeal for rifles, carbines, shotguns, submachine guns, and handgunsWeight 3.7 oz.
