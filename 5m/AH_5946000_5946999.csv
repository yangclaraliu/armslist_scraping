I can also throw in a Blackhawk! Serpa holster. It has a little wear from use and is deady accurate. As far as handguns go, this thing is nearly surgical. At 25 yards my groups are ragged holes the size of a golf ball. These things hardly ever come up for sale, so don't miss out. This is my favorite handgun out of all I have owned, and it has been my favorite to shoot. I have even shot this one side-by-side with a Wilson Combat CQB elite and I honestly preferred the sig. I a selling to fund another project and I will genuinely be sad to see it go. These may become quite valuable in the future, and I may kick myself later, but it is what it is. Quick note to the interested parties: the top of the Sig slides are more square than the traditional Colt gov't pattern 1911's, so picking a holster is easiest when you have the gun with you to test fit.. for example, the Serpa paddle holster included was originally made for a Beretta 92FS and it fits this 1911 perfectly... go figure."

Originally purchased in May of 2016. Round count through the pistol is exactly at 500 per the manufacturer's recommended break-in procedure. All recommended procedures were followed to the letter with cleaning and generous lube performed every 50 rounds. The pistol performed flawlessly during break in and was fed nothing but Winchester FMJ's. Break-in is basically verified and paid for with this pistol. Trigger breaks like a glass rod at around 2.5-3 pounds. Great shooter and accurate as you can make it. The inner frame is showing a minor wear from being fired but that is to be expected with an coated aluminum frame. Pistol is still an otherwise 100% reliable and attractive shooter. Package comes with everything you see in the pictures to include all the originally provided DW gear (case, manual, sticker, 2 mags, bushing wrench) and also the VZ Grips Carbon Fiber Super Scoop grips, VZ Grips Turbo Blackwash screws, 2 extra DW-branded mags, 1 ten round Wilson Combat extended mag, Wilson Combat Shok-Buff Recoil System with original springs. Payment methods are Cash, Money Order, Or Cashier's Check.  No personal checks.Valid CCW and payment in hand takes it today. Nevada DL requires we meet up at Metro for transfer.From the manufacturer: Our Guardian has proven so popular due to its concealable profile and Commander-length slide that we took it a step further with the CCO – the Concealed Carry Officer – a Commander slide on an Officer frame. With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration. The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional.

We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration. The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional.

The three midlength 16"" melonite barrels are perfect, as far as I can tell. No visable blemishes on them. Probably just got tossed in the ""blemish"" bin. Three perfect melonite barrels for $150? Deal of the decade right there. Alright, here's the deal. Please read this entire post before messaging me. Thank you in advance.I have factory second and blemished AR-15 barrels. They should all be within spec. The blemishes are fairly easy to identify. Most of these are ""calibrate"" pieces, meaning they've been pulled off the line to test something. Something such as the laser engraver, for example, which is why some of them have ""223"" or ""556"" etched onto them six or seven times. If one of them is completely unusuable, please let me know and I will make it right. Headspaces should be within spec. Please gauge them yourself, with correct gauges. Here's what I have. This is everything that I have, and I will do my best to update it periodically as it sells. Please do not contact me to ask if I have something not listed here. I do not. I am open to trades for guns and ammo, as well as other gun-related things. Please be realistic with your trade values. I will not lowball you, but don't assume your used firearm is worth full retail MSRP. Assume all barrels have a 1:7 twist rate unless specified otherwise.Here's all I have left:(3) 16"" Melonite barrels. Midlength gas. $60(1) 18"" parkerized barrel. Midlength gas. 1:8 twist. $60(1) 18"" parkerized barrel. Midlength gas. 1:9 twist. $60(1) 7.5"" Melonite barrel. Pistol gas. Missing index pin.

This firearm is from the first manufacturing year for this model, and they were only produced for a few years, before the entire 8000 series was sold to Stoeger who ceased production of the .45 Caliber models. The 8045 has several interesting features attributed to it such as: a rotating barrel locking system which significantly reduces felt recoil, increasing accuracy for follow up shots. A light weight aluminum alloy frame keeps weight distribution balanced in the pistol. Along with an ambidextrous safety mechanism which came standard on these models. The 8045, though a well designed and wonderful pistol, were only produced for 6 years, and have become increasingly hard to come across.This firearm is in excellent conditions, and comes with a new match grade barrel which has hardly been broken in with less than 200 rounds through it. This firearm maintains over 95% of its original finish, and would make an excellent choice for either home defense, or as an EDC gun. This pistol comes with a Safariland 6004 thigh holster which retails for over $150, 1 Magazine, soft case (not pictured), and pistol lock (also not pictured). Can include a box of 45 ACP SD rounds, for an additional $25.00.These firearms typically retail for $800, significantly higher than its 9MM/40 CAL varients which stay consistently in the low 500's. I am asking 700 OBO for this firearm, with the thigh holster included as a bonus for local buyers. I currently live in Owenton, KY but am able to meet in surrounding areas with notice.
