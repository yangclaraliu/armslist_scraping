EOTech is one of the most trusted manufacturer of military and civilian weapon sights and accessories, and the HHS I is the perfect example of why. The HHS I combines the popular EXPS3 with the innovative G33 3X magnifier and Switch-To-Side mount. Both of these units work seamlessly together and offer quick-detach, locking mounts. The EXPS3 is among the most compact units available requiring minimal rail mounting space. When combined with the G33 magnifier the entire HHS I units measure a mere 8.1"" and requires only 2.75"" of rail space for mounting. When faced with variable situations the HHS I is the ideal choice with the ability to quickly switch from 1x to 3x with the flip of a finger. The G33 is held in place with a strong detent that maintains its perfect alignment with the EXPS3, and hold the unit out of the operator's way in CQB situations. Perfect for any situation, the HHS I offers 20 illumination intensities, anti-glare coatings with high light gathering capability, true holographic transmission for a parallax free optic that features a true heads-up display for shooting with both eyes open. Additional features of the HH I are Night vision compatibility as well as a ballistic BDC reticle matched to .223 ammunition. Technical Information

$940 obo. in cash or higher in trade value, lowballers will not get a response.  No hurry to sell, just wanting to free up some cash to finish a couple projects and get some new tires in the next month or so.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal as far as the value goes, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

$500 firm in cash for the pistol and mags only or $540 firm with the DeSantis rig, this will also work with other pistols.  Higher in trade value as I am really wanting the cash right now.
Might look at trades as long as it's a good deal on the value, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Garland area.  Thanks for looking!"

$1,100 firm in cash for just the rifle or will also sell as is with scope and mount for $1,300 firm.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal and the value is there, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.  Also, state if you are wanting to trade just for the rifle or with the scope and mount.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.  Ideally, I would like to try the DPMS Recon G2 .308 and would trade rifle for rifle, since new cost is about the same new or will include scope and mount if yours comes with extras.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Also, Pmags for both AR-15 and AR-10.
Ammo to help complete a deal in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area or I can ship for $30 more.  Thanks for looking!"

When i bought it i didnt realize that i couldnt afford to make it up north to do any rifle hunting for a bit. So my loss is someone elses gain. The gunsmith who had done all the work to this rifle did a very good job. The shooting i did to sight in the scope held very close. I had 3 shot grouping that held within a quarter size. He used the original 3 step mauser barrel, just rechambered it from its original 8mm to 30-06, and shortened it and re crowned the muzzle.

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal as far as the value goes, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-ups.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in Garland/Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

I will update the ad as more items are added and of course when items are gone. I have other firearms listed as well for a bigger deal.  Prices firm at this time, may change them later if not moving. 
1.) Hornady Critical Duty 9mm FlexLock 135gr +P JHP 50rd. boxes. The more common 25rd. boxes go for $20-$25 online and the 50rd. boxes for usually $35-$40 plus any tax and/or shipping when you can find them in stock.  If you can find it cheaper, great, but I have looked and I could not.  $300 per case(500rds) no shipping.
2.) D&L Sports 1911 Single Stack Quad Magazine Pouch/Holster, like new. $60 shipped.  http://www.dlsports.com/kydex_1911_single_st ack_quad_magazine_pouch.html 
3.) Grips are in excellent/like new condition, prices are the same whether shipped or FTF, from left to right starting at top, smooth wood grips $40, checkered Walnut $30, S&W ""K"" frame $50, faux Stag $25, and the Pachmayr Rosewood/rubber $25.  Found another pair of AJAX Pearlite 1911 grips $30.
4.) 6 boxes of 20ga. shells, see pic for load info.  $25 no shipping.
5.) Zombie flash suppressor, perfect to top or tip off your Zombie rifle.  $20 shipped.
6.) Nikon M-223 1-4x20mm Point Blank Reticle with flip caps and box/ppwk, mount is NOT included.  $220 for scope shipped.  Sells new for around $300 with no mount included.
7.) Nikon M-223 1-4x20mm Point Blank Reticle, no box and the M223XR mount is NOT included unless you want to add $80(sells for $100).  $200 for scope shipped.
8.) Beretta 92/96 Crimson Trace Laser Grips, older model grips, traded for these a few years ago and never used them.  They are used, but still work great, the pic with laser dot on cabinet is taken 20+ feet away.  I do not have the retainer plate for the batteries, so you would have to find one or make something similar, should be fairly simple and I will try to get around to it myself soon.  Also, missing is the small Allen Key to adjust, if needed.  $80 for grips shipped.  New models new for around $300, CTC also told me they will take old grips in an exchange and give 50% off new models, so that's pretty cool too.
Might look at trades as long as it's a good deal on the value, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
FTF in the Garland area only or will ship, if stated.  I can accept PayPal.  Thanks for looking!"

Also including 400rds of factory ammo. That's 200rds 170gr and 200rds are 150gr. For those who are not familair with this rifle, the difference between a Sears Ted Williams Model 100 and Winchester 94, one is rollmarked Winchester. The other is rollmarked Sears. Both are made by Winchester. Both are a 94. I am looking to trade this rifle from something of similar value at $500.So I've been asked by a few people on here how I came up with that price because apparently to them I am expecting wayyyyyyyyyy to much. As result I've gotten some pretty generious low ball offers like $180 for it all. Hey, free market right? But for anyone curious how I came up with that number, lets say, even if I priced the ammo at $12 per box 'which I'm not', that is still $240 in just ammo. And lets be honest, 30-30 doesn't cost $12 per box anymore and has not for a long time. So that combined with the rifle, which btw other examples last year of well used ones have been selling on the auctions between $240 & 350, is how I'm coming up with $500 total. I've been buying and selling for nearly 20yrs and I judge what items are worth on what people are willing to spend for them on auctions. I do not have to let this go, which is why I prefer to trade for something of a equal $500 value. And I'll be up front with you, I'm picky. If your trying to sell a $500 gun I can get for $320 shipped at online places like Buds, I'll pass. Unless you can genuinly make up the difference. I'm not going to waste your time trying to b.s. you unlike some others. Just a honest value on a hunting rifle with a more than fair value in the ammo. Again, I am looking to TRADE ONLY. May have a cash to add depending on the offer. Items I'm interested in are listed below."

S&W's SKU on this gun is 170077. Originally this was a stocking dealer exclusive. The only thing I would trade for would be a S&W 460ES. That's the one that says Emergency Survival Tool Kit on the box. It must be in the original yellow pelican type gun case with all the accessories that came with it. And Id like to have the white box it all came in. I'm not really interested in any other gun. Or multiple gun trades. Thanks!"
