Patton referred to as: "" the greatest battlefield implement ever devised."" She was originally purchased through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.The rifle is chambered in the venerable 30-06 cartridge. The SA barrel dates to 4-55. The SA rifle serial number dates to 1955 as well. That, along with like condition and Patina, suggests the barrel is original to the gun. The serial number will be given upon phone conversation only. There are no visible import marks. The stainless gas seal is the only area exhibiting any significant wear. Rust is non-existent, nor are there any signs of major battle scars. Normal wear is minimal for the time frame. The stock is a post WWII Overton Stock with evidence of a faint DOD cartouche stamp. The barrel is shiny and remains accurate. The rifle functions wonderfully and is accompanied by 5 en bloc clips. The rifle wears an OD nylon sling, befitting of the time period in both use and appearance. The weapon has the normal matching of the major US manufacturers parts of that time:Receiver- SABarrel- 4-1955Trigger Group- International Harvester Op Rod- SA Bolt- Harrington and RichardsonSights (SA). The sights are in excellent mechanical condition and show minimal wear. They remain audible, tactile and precise on the firing line.Stock- OvertonME- 2Do not have a chamber guage, but throat wear is minimal. Casing test shows a solid 1/8"" of the top of the casing, so it's definitely not ""swallowing"" it. The pkg. will come with 5 En Bloc Clips & a Hard Carry Case.*Numerous additional photos and videos upon request."

New front turn signals, new choke cable, new windscreen, and a general look over by a professional. The bike has just over 28 thousand miles on it. It runs great! Shifts through all the gears without any problems. The rear tire is in need of replacement, but is still useable. The front tire has a good amount of life left in it. The paint looks ok, but on the right side it looks like gas was spilled and the paint flaked off. The mufflers are stock and the bike is pretty quiet! Its NOT loud. Motor sounds great and is very responsive. This is a used bike, and its not perfect. But is a great beginners bike that can be ridden home! Asking 1500 cash. I will not take payments. I will not hold the bike. If you tell me you are on the way to look at it, I will hold it until you get here. As long as you show up on time. I would rather sell for cash, but will consider trades. I will not consider electronics. No TVs, no game systems. Possibly for cars, trucks or other bikes that need work? Would trade for guns. If its not a decent brand name, Im not interested.

This is a Just Right Carbine (JRC) chambered in 45 acp. This has been completely gone through and upgraded by the factory with new bolt, feed ramps, extractor and spring, etc. This has all of the newer upgrades to make it shoot more reliably and is something the vast majority of the other of these out there do not have. It is ready to tear up the range. This takes Glock magazines. This has an adjustable Buttstock, MCT Buttstock cheek weld enhancement, quad rail, threaded barrel, thread protector, magazine, magpul flip sights, quad rail cover on Palm area, and box. This is a great little gun and is a blast to shoot.  I would also consider trades. Really only interested in CZ Scorpion, CMR30, towards a 1927-a1 type (Tommy gun), AR10, maybe even a CETME or similar build in 308. May consider other offers. Some trades will need boot on my end, some will on yours. Mainly looking for cash though, so trade will have to be really worth it. Pickup in Norman only. Thanks for looking and happy hunting."

However, my loss is your gain as this is a really great firearm. It was a law enforcment trade in so it does show wear on the outside. I never got around to replacing the grips, but new grips can be found online. New grips are probably the easiest replacement parts you can find and are very inexpensive; it's also easy to install yourself, eliminating the need to pay a gunsmith. Despite the outside, the internals of this firearm are in really great condition. The barrell is clean, frame is clean, there is no rust or pitting. I am selling the S&W 5906 in 9mm with one S&W 15 round magazine. This is the DA/SA model with a slide mounted decocker/saftey lever. It also features a magazine disconnect feature (trigger is deactivated when magazine is removed). I can provide more images upon request. I am willing to meet anywhere around the Philadelphia area. I live in Bala Cynwyd and work in University City, so any time after 5pm works for me. I usually prefer going to my range/shop in South Philly but I am willing to drive up to 30 minutes outside of the area if that works better for you. If you pay the full asking price of $345 I will pay for the transfer! I will also include an inexpensive IWB holster. If we negotiate a lower price then the transfer fee will be on the buyer. PLEASE DO NOT waste my time. WE MUST MEET AT AN FFL. I do not care how much more you're willing to pay; no FFL, no background check, NO SALE. Do not contact me if you do not wish to follow the law."

It comes with the plastic carrying case, and I also have two speed loaders with a belt carrier (these are loaded with .357 hollow points (six in each for twelve total) free of charge. It came with a crappy solid black front sight, and so I put in a high-visibility bright neon green front sight for better targeting. It also has very nice Hogue grips that fit the hand very well. It would make a fantastic home defense gun, and that's what I used it for. Single or double action. For those that do not know, this gun would be able to shoot the .357 magnum round, but also the smaller .38 special and .38 special + P. I have 110 rnds of Remington UMC .38 special 130 grain, and another 50 odd misc Winchester White Box .38 rounds. 25 rounds of Hornady .38 spc + P also good for defense, but slightly lower power and recoil. Also got some 20 rounds of low recoil .38. I would be willing to take $550 for the gun, original case, speed loaders loaded with .357 hollow points. I would include the ammo with everything previous for $600.NOT looking to trade or to sell the ammo separately from the firearms. I am looking to meet within the Eau Claire area only. I will not ship. Cash only. I am able to provide more pics if you would like.

However, my loss is your gain as this is a really great firearm. It was a law enforcment trade in so it does show wear on the outside. I never got around to replacing the grips, but new grips can be found online. New grips are probably the easiest replacement parts you can find and are very inexpensive; it's also easy to install yourself, eliminating the need to pay a gunsmith. Despite the outside, the internals of this firearm are in really great condition. The barrell is clean, frame is clean, there is no rust or pitting. I am selling the S&W 5906 in 9mm with one S&W 15 round magazine. This is the DA/SA model with a slide mounted decocker/saftey lever. It also features a magazine disconnect feature (trigger is deactivated when magazine is removed). I can provide more images upon request. I am from the Philadelphia area but will be visiting the York area this coming weekend (June 25th and 26th). If you live in York and are interested in my firearm I have no problem bringing it with me and meeting you at your FFL of choice. If you pay the full asking price of $345 I will pay for the transfer! I will also include an inexpensive IWB holster. If we negotiate a lower price then the transfer fee will be on the buyer. PLEASE DO NOT waste my time. WE MUST MEET AT AN FFL. I do not care how much more you're willing to pay; no FFL, no background check, NO SALE. Do not contact me if you do not wish to follow the law."

Great choice for a carry gun, or home defense weapon.Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind.

Then when you remove possible sets for every person that only has one or two of these..... Because of these facts, how many full high quality sets really exist?  I have only ever seen mine, and no full sets ever for sale.    Both sets of grips ""Anodized aluminum and plastic"" are included with each gun, and three official Beretta 15 round magazines.These Hogue anodized grips with the etched Beretta trident, are not replaceable.

A visible laser 5mW equiped in a single lightweight, integrated, & rugged sight, there is no longer a need to purchase a seperate laser.  In addition there is now more space on your rails & less weight.  Three integrated reticle illumination systems (a fiber optic collector system during the day, a miniature self-powered tritium light source at night, and a 3 position LED enhancer for different ambient light conditions.  This ensures you NEVER lose your reticle.  Unlice other battery0powered sights that loose their reticle when the batteries are low or not working, the Mepro MOR continues to operate!  A unique single single boresight mechanism allows you to zero both aiming devices simultaneously ( the sight reticle & laser pointer) thereby saves time on zeroing.  A totally inegrated day/night sigh which provides instant all light aiming."
