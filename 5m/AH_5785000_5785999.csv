Generations of families have used a 3-9x for harvesting numerous types of game all over the globe.     The MIL-Square reticle was designed by a former Marine Sniper to give a shooter refined aiming points compared to the widely accepted MIL-Dot.  This reticle provides the capability of determining distance and size of target, and to provide visual reference points used to compensate for bullet drop, plus provide reference for follow up shot compensation. Because of the square design the user can more accurately align the edge of the MIL-Square with the edge of the object being measured. Intermediate tick marks aid in increased accuracy for ranging or shot placement.   The LED reticle illumination comes in either red or green allowing you to use Trijicon’s Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC), or to give you that added contrast to your target.  Use our 1” rings or quick release mount to match your firearms platform.   The light weight and low profile Trijicon 3-9x40 AccuPower design works well with bolt guns and AR semi-auto firearm platforms.    Package Includes:  1 Trijicon Logo Sticker  1 Lens Cloth 1 Set of Lenscaps 1 AccuPower Manual 1 Warranty Card       Magnification 3-9x   Objective Size (mm) 40mm   Bullet Drop Compensator No   Weight (oz) 17.0oz (483g.)

If going to be used a lot will need new tires but I wanted to get running before I sunk any money into it for other things. Will need other tlc I'm sure. Running I see these go for around 3500. I value this around 1500 in current state. Worst case can be used for parts or replace the engine which I have looked into and can be done for less than 1000 depending on how handy you are. Really looking more to trade shotguns,rifles,handguns,or any combination of will adjust some on my value on straight trades but not looking to add any thing on my end. Will also trade for utv or maybe even 4 wheeler,or do partial trades. Please understand that I can leave this on my project list and don't have to do anything at all so please serious offers only."

Description / Manufacturer Information: The Daniel Defense Ambush .308 in Kryptek Highlander is the new benchmark for anyone demanding an accurate, fast-handling, hard-hitting platform capable of taking down any North American big-game animal. Built from the ground up, this rifle has been engineered to help you harvest that trophy with the precision and dependability you expect from Daniel Defense. At its core is a free-floating, 18” Cold Hammer Forged barrel, which comes standard with the DD Superior Suppression Device Extended, for reduced muzzle-flash. This top-quality barrel connects directly to the upper receiver through a robust 4-Bolt Connection System with a patent pending barrel extension resulting in increased stability, better accuracy, and reduced weight. Ambidextrous controls make operating the .308 Ambush comfortable and convenient for both right- and left-handed shooters. You can easily drop the magazine, release the bolt, or operate the safety selector from either side of the receiver. The charging handle is ambidextrous as well and also user-configurable—you can set up either side of the charging handle with a larger or smaller handle to accommodate magnified optics or iron sights for a snag-free setup. The water-transfer printing process (also known as hydro-graphics) of this finish makes for a durable, uniform coating that holds up to and resists even the harshest environments. The Ambush is fed with an optimized bolt carrier group featuring a redesigned geometry and a new extremely slick, low-friction coating to ensure smooth, reliable feeding. As a sportsman, you have an obligation to take clean shots on your game, and a crisp 2-Stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) Trigger gives you the advantage you need to deliver a precise, on-target shot that’ll bring down that elusive trophy you worked so hard to get in your sights.

The Federal and Winchester I bought at Walmart and has a price tag of $13.97 a box which means I paid about $15.50 a box 5 years ago all the oddball stuff I got in trade on a rifle. I need $15 for the 20 round boxes of Federal and Winchester. The oddball stuff I will negotiate on. The only thing I need in trade is 22 mag.

It has been developed from thier highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.
The PF-9 retains the best features from the P-11 and P-3AT pistols. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode —and have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame —in addition to the two safety levers. A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions."

The key is the multi-pole rotor with a small stator. This design is smaller and lighter than a conventional twopole alternator with a large stator--and it helps make the EF2800i extremely portable. With the EF2800i, Yamaha has created one of the quietest generators in its class (64-68 dBA). The EF2800i--with its inverter system--features Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) so wavelength distortion is less than 2.5 percent, making it ideal for equipment that requires stable frequency and voltage, such as computers or other sophisticated electronics.Yamaha's Smart Throttle feature automatically adjusts engine speed to match the load. The result is quiet running, maximum fuel efficiency, and a run time of 14.7 hours at Â¼ rated load. Yamaha's Oil Watch warning system prevents engine damage, avoiding costly repairs and minimizing down time."
