Ad will be taken down once it's gone. Thanks!WHAT IS IT? WHAT's INCLUDED? It is a KelTec PLR 16 that looks very different from what it left the factory looking like! Vltor rail (over $200) and forend system. This system is not a direct bolt on. The gun and system had to be fabricated to fit together. Magpul buis iron sights ($95) and angled foregrip ($40), Noveske ""flaming pig"" flash hider ($125) This piece sends the sound forward so you aren't blasted by the sound wave these guns produce (from the factory, these guns are louder than ANYTHING I've ever heard shot). The sound and accompanying flame that shoots out the front is enough to send a thug home crying. Also included is one Pmag (30 round, cost $15) and the padded carrying case (cost $85). Add everything up, including the base gun (cost $500) and that's $1,060 before tax, fees and before what I paid for the rail fitting, the sling adapter the sling and the small front rail attachement(about another $150 all together, so over $1,200 total).I would like to either sell it for $825 cash (Firm) or can accept a partial trade with cash. Only trades I'm interested in are 9mm pistols (WITH CASH) or if you have a S&W SV or SD .40 at a decent price ($200-$300 trade value depending on age, model and extras as that's what I've bought them for pre-loved in the past). I also need some (not a lot though) 9mm ammo. NOTE: I have received a lot of offers with folks offering a ton of ammo. I only want maybe 2 boxes. Also, I need some cash on top of whatever you have to trade. Will only consider trading for two handguns as a straight trade if their combined trade value is $1,200+. Not interested in releasing any cash for a trade up. Thanks for reading all of this and considering it in your offers!!!Florida resident with ID only. No felons or out of state buyers. Will not ship.

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****  We do produce, hands down, some of the best-looking lever action rifles on the market in our brass and silver models, but as a part of our aggressive expansion into the more utilitarian side of life with newer steel centerfires meant for everyday life in the truck, on the farm, and through the woods, in 2016 we introduce the hard-working All-Weather H009AW in .30-30 and the H010AW in .45-70. In profile and general dimensions, these two Henry offerings are essentially the same as their blued steel counterparts, with 20” round barrel and 5-shot magazine capacity in the .30-30 and 18.43” round barrel with 4-shot magazine in the .45-70, and both with the same adjustable buckhorn/bead sights. Like the blued rifles, the All-Weathers also wear the same wrist profiles- straight in the .30-30, and pistol grip in the .45-70. The major differences lie in the first time we’ve used hard chrome plating on all metal surfaces (except springs and sights), and a durable industrial-grade coating on hardwood furniture. In a tough world where a working rifle might be “rode hard and put away wet”, this is the finish you want on it. A very strong plating permanently bonded to the steel underneath, hard chrome doesn’t flake, chip, or peel, and its corrosion resistance is actually stronger than some stainless steels. The treatment we use increases surface hardness, reduces friction on moving parts, doesn’t normally scuff or scratch, and leaves a low-gloss look that won’t spook game. The furniture is another departure for us; we’ve based a good part of our reputation on our select American walnut over the years, but here we’ve opted for a stained hardwood with a carefully-selected coating that’s formulated to stand up to wear, tear, scratches, moisture, temperature variations, and the angst of the various“character marks” an everyday outdoor tool inevitably picks up during its lifetime. If you want beauty, we’ve got it. If you want a more subdued partner you can depend on to ride any trail with, any time, any season, and in any weather, we do that too.  We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $759.

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****   CZ-USA 357 Magnum Dan Wesson 01932 715 357 Magnum 6 in 6 SS Returning to regular production late summer 2014, the 715 is as it was before designed and built to be the most accurate, rugged and versatile revolver on the market. Shipped with a 6′ barrel, the new shroud is designated the HV6, a heavy vent shroud profile that tames the .357 s recoil very well.The double action trigger is short and relatively light, while the single action is light and crisp. The target-like SA trigger pull made the Dan Wesson revolver a favorite among competitors and hunters, and the tradition continues in the 715. Barrel assemblies and grips are easily swapped by the shooter, and the 715 accepts grips and barrel/shroud assemblies from 15-2 model and newer revolvers. The original Dan Wesson revolver improved on the accuracy and service life of the traditional double action revolver design in a few ways. The tensioned barrel of the DW interchangeable barrel system enhances accuracy, pulling the barrel tight like a guitar string, enabling it to vibrate at the same frequency every time. The forward crane latch, located in front of the cylinder and paired with a rear ball detent helps to ensure proper cylinder/barrel alignment during firing. Superior to the rear locking designs of other revolvers, it adds to the accuracy of the 715. While the tensioned barrel definitely improves accuracy above other revolvers, it s the consistent cylinder/barrel alignment that contributes most to the accuracy of the design. Additionally, the clockwise-rotating cylinder reduces stress on the crane, since it turns in the same direction the crane locks, prolonging service life and keeping everything tight. The 715 s frame is robust, built to handle the heaviest of factory loads. Each revolver is shipped in a custom Dan Wesson hard case. Patterned after the ever-popular Pistol Pack, each case has compartments for three additional barrel assemblies and factory-supplied barrel wrench kit.   We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $1099."

Blued steel barrel and Case Colored components. Rifle style forearm. Grade II/III walnut. Like no other. Do you like the look of a pistol grip stock on a classic rifle like the ’73? Read on if you do. Because there is no doubt that there is something entirely cool about a pistol grip stock that has been combined with an octagon barrel. It has the look more of a dedicated rifleman than a working cowboy. You may love this rifle for other reasons, but the fact remains that a ’73 like this is purely a classic. But we have taken it a step beyond with a walnut stock with fine Grade II/III walnut that simply gives it the look of the special limited rifles produced by Winchester in the mid-1800’s that became the legend of stories and movies. Timeless styling. The classic rifle-style forearm offers a timeless look and feel. It features a case colored steel receiver, lever, crescent buttplate and forearm cap. And then the crescent buttplate is the final touch — slipping right into your shoulder for a more solid hold from any shooting position. Set your sights. The rear tang is drilled and tapped for scope mount. Features a semi-buckhorn rear sight and a Marble’s gold bead front sight.

It is topped with a falcon menace 4x14x44mm mil/mil scope. It sits in burris 6 screw scope rings on top of a weaver 20moa one peice scope base that is bedded. It will also come with a blackhawk cheek rest with zip pocket and 5 round holder. It will also come with the no name bipod i bought for it that was only $35. My best load and accuracy has come with a 69gr smk. it shoots a little under 1 moa at .76"" being my best 5 shot group, though it may perform better with a more talented shooter. Furthest ive ever shot the rifle was out to 650 yards and once dialed in it was ringing a 12"" plate consistantly.I bought everything that is on the rifle brand new and it was 1100 total with everything on it. The only thing that is wrong with it is the saftey lever broke off flush with the tail at about 100 rounds down the tube. The saftey still functions properly when i took it out of the stock and nothing is wrong with the trigger itself, i never figured out what broke it off as i just noticed it while pulling it out of the gun case. Ive since put 300 round down the tube with it broken off with no hiccups. Because of this im taking $50 off of what i wouldve asked so you may go to a gunsmith and get the lever replaced if you so choose. I can send more pictures if interested, i wouldve uploaded on here if it werent for the 4mb limit."

The shield comes with two magazines - one 7 round magazine with a pearce grip extension ($10 upgrade) and an 8 round magazine with a Plan B Shield base pad ($50 upgrade).  Sometimes the plastic insert on the stock 8 round magazine moves and interferes with the magazine being seated correctly.  The Plan B shield base pad ensures that the 8 round magazine will seat properly if you are reloading quickly in a self-defense scenarios.  See the plan b safety solutions academy website for more details. 
In addition, I will include a N82 Tactital tuckable compact holster ($60 value).  This is the most comfortable holster I have ever worn, and it is in great condition.  A shield Recluse TS pocket holster is also included ($60 value).  In my opinion, the shield is a little too big to be a pocket carry gun, but the pocket holster works perfectly to carry the shield in a bag.  The recluse holster managed to get a little dirty, but it is in good condition.
As you can see, this is a highly upgraded shield for an awesome price.  I have $520 of extras invested in this gun.  This shield shoots like a big gun, and it is highly concealable.  It is also extremely comfortable to carry.  I bought this gun about a year ago to be my summer carry, but it has turned into a safe queen.  I compete in USPSA and IDPA events with a CZ 75, and I decided to carry a CZ PCR so that my competition gun and carry gun would be on the same platform.   So, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the shield.  It is in great condition.

Picked her up a few days ago, went to the range today but wasn't really a fan of the sights. Since the sights and the finish are what make the VTAC special, I'd rather sell/trade the gun than try and swap the sights and sell the old ones. Most people like the sights, I guess I'm one of the small percentage that doesn't.Though most M&P pistols have a corrosion-resistant finish applied to the barrel, slide and steel sights, the VTAC’s slide is finished in an enhanced Flat Dark Earth PVD and has specialized sights designed by Kyle Lamb. These sights are the main reason why the VTAC is one of the more expensive guns in the M&P line. The VTAC’s unique sights are made by Trijicon and only offered on the M&P9 VTAC. These sights are intended to be rapidly and highly visible in different lighting conditions. They accomplish that by using three green fiber-optic and three green tritium inserts. Thhe fiber optics are on the top and the tritium inserts directly below. In daylight the fiber-optic dots glow; in low-light conditions, the tritium inserts take precedence.This gun comes with both factory mags, all 4 backstraps (Two black, two FDE), and a BlackDog Concealment, OWB Kydex holster. Both the holster, and the gun are barely used, with not a single scratch. I am MAINLY looking for trades. Specifically a Beretta Pico or Ruger LCP-C + Cash, or other 9mm handguns (Glock, FNS9-C, Steyr, etc) of EQUAL VALUE or PLUS CASH. I can Google what your gun is worth in under 30 seconds, please don't try and rip me off.I don't really want to sell it outright, but if I do, I'm asking $600 for the weapon and the holster. Gun retails for $660 online, + an average of $20 shipping and $25 transfer. So all in, you're looking at $705 minimum plus a weeks wait. The gun and the holster ($65ish) for $600? That's a steal. I'd really hate to let her go, honestly one of the nicest looking handguns I've owned but I don't shoot it that well. You can get ahold of me anytime, day or night by texting me at REDACTEDLocated in Northville, Michigan. Willing to drive a bit. 18+ with PP or CPL, FTF deals only.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

Winchester M-22 Subsonic 22LR ammo. 45 grain Black Copper-Plated Round Nose. 1090 fps. The M-22 is designed specifically to function in semi-automatic firearms, while remaining subsonic from both pistol and rifle length barrels. The new M-22 Subsonic features a 45-grain black-plated lead round nose bullet that has the equivalent energy of full velocity 36-grain rimfire products. In addition, the M-22 Subsonic utilizes non-corrosive priming and clean burning powder for reduced muzzle flash. The M-22 Subsonic was also created with suppressed firearms in mind, but performs just as well in unsuppressed rifles and handguns. During Winchester testing, M-22 Subsonic rounds measured 129 dB from an unsuppressed rifle. That is significantly quieter than a full velocity .22 LR fired from a suppressed rifle, which typically measures around 138 db. With the addition of a suppressor, M-22 Subsonic achieves a remarkably quiet 116 db. Comes in 400rd boxes. $50 per box of 400rds. Multiple boxes available. Will ship. Text REDACTED."
