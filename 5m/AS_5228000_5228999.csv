Buy it now!! The Colt 1991 Series is a direct descendant of the original Colt M1911. A long trigger, flat mainspring housing and original style recoil spring system remain from the original M1911 design. Upgrades from the original include white dot sights and a lowered ejection port for extra reliability. It still remains “the standard” that everyone tries to imitate, but no one duplicates."

The biggest differences are a single-side safety, aluminum frame and steel slide. (The black 9mm versions (like the 915) had plastic sights and guide rod, but the .40s have steel sights and a steel guide rod.) This is a very solid pistol in excellent condition and it shoots extremely well. I have a Hogue slip-on grip over the slick plastic factory panels, 4 extra magazines (the gun only came with 1 mag from the factory), a black nylon holster with single mag pouch, and the original box it came in from S&W. The gun itself was $455 new and each magazine was $50. I'm asking $380 for everything and am open to offers. As much as I hate to sell her, I've been on a limited income for the past several months due to an injury and things are getting kind of tight.

If you're a ""prepper"" without Night Vision, you'll be dead soon after the SHTF without it. The great thing about PVS-7's is that you get to use BOTH eyes, whereas the PVS-14 is a single-eye monocular.FYI, the images posted are STOCK images, but are virtually identical to the PVS-7B I am offering for trade.Here's your chance to gain entry into the elite world of high-end Gen 3 night vision.

The final product is an affordable, feature-loaded rifle that faithfully replicates the AR-platform dimensions between the sighting plane, buttstock height, and grip. The SR-22 utilizes AR-style ergonomics with the industry-leading Hogue Monogrip and a six-position telescsoping buttstock on a Mil-spec diameter tube. Every rifle is built with a precision-rifled, cold-hammer-forged barrel that's 16-1/8"" long and forged of alloy steel before being capped with the same flash suppressor found on the SR-556 and Mini-14 rifles. The SR-22's round, mid-length handguard is mounted on the standard-thread AR-style barrel nut with a barrel support block that ensures accuracy. The legendary Ruger rotary magazine makes the SR-22 one of the most reliable, trusted autoloaders available and the Picatinny rail allows for a variety of sight or scope options. 1:16"" right-hand twist. 10 + 1 capacity.Rifle / Ammo / Scope / 3 10 Round Mags / 2 25 Round Mags / Carry Case / Lock -----------------------   Buyer pays ALL transfer cost"

I picked this up a while ago and it has simply been too much of a safe queen to hold onto any longer. Needs to go to a new home. As pictured it comes with the stick mag and adapter for it as well as a harder to find drum mag. Also included is the loading tool for the drum mag and a spare ejector. It is in excellent condition with very strong rifling. The bluing is in excellent condition overall with only a couple small scratches and some ejection marks from brass on the ejection port. These haven't been made in a while and now seems like only the 45acp ones are around so nice way to get some more affordable tommy gun action. The drum mag has some wear as pictured but should still be in working order. I took this rifle out a few times and it seems to be a bit finicky as to what ammo it likes. I've found it likes some old Klean-Bore or CCI more than anything. Cheap new-age ammo will temd to cause 'stove piping'.This one also comes with an original 16 page Auto Ordnance Catalog along with letter from 1975 BATF certing the firearm is semi auto only and a notarized letter from Heileman Brewing Co noting the rifle as a prize in 1983 for a Seattle plant worker so a neat piece of history attached.This sale is for the rifle, 2 mags and adapter, spare ejector, drum loading tool and a hard sided gun case.
