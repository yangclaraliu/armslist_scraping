This is a very lightly used Beretta Nano with the Olive Drab color grip frame. I fired one magazine through it when I got it and never used it again. Highly rated CCW gun, these are compact and soft shooting.
9mm
Comes with two magazines. One flush and one extended.
FTF Sale in St George, UTAH DL / CCW required to prove residency. Bill of sale on request.
Asking $350 OBO
Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1″ wide and just over 5″ overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not “print” thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat–even on hot summer days.
The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.
The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA."

The ONLY pistol I will trade for is a full size M&P chambered in 40 S&W or 9mm.
This G23 has the iron skillet finish which is far superior to anything Glock produces now. I bought it in 2014 from GT Distributors. It was an unissued Police Trade which means it sat in a safe and was not fired. When I bought it the copper grease was still in the slide. It has been properly maintained and cleaned and still shoots great. I have 700 problem free rounds through it and never had a single issue. The frame is stippled but was not ground down with a Dremel so it is 100% structurally intact. The stippling provides an excellent surface and makes for a great home defense, range or carry gun. Comes with original Glock plastic case, three 13-round G23 magazines, one 15-round G22 magazine plus an X-Grip (to use with the 22 mag).It has Trijicon HD night sights which are only 1 year old so you have 10-11 more years of life in them. The sights alone run around $120 on eBay, more elsewhere. Where else can you find a Glock with Trijicon HDs, 4 mags and an X-Grip for $365?I am thinning out my collection and this one is the last to go. If you are in the market for a reliable, accurate shooter you won't find a better deal. I take cash sale or will trade for a Full Size M&P 40 or 9. I will not sell to anyone under the age of 21 and you must show your Indiana Driver's License in person before the transaction will take place. No need to do a bill of sale, I just want to verify the buyer's age.I have more pics if interested, email me direct at REDACTED."

Whether you see something you want on online or you want to buy something off of someone on Armslist or otherwise, I'm your guy. I have an at-home FFL in a nice neighborhood conveniently located on a main road - you can't miss it. I charge the standard $20 fee, not the $35 to $50 I've been asked to pay at the local shops around here. I offer a 25% discount to all military and law enforcement, active or retired, with proof of ID. If you are selling a firearm and need me to mail it, it's $20 plus the cost of shipping. I do have a day job, so I operate by appointment only, but am usually available weekdays between 7 and 10 pm, and most weekends anytime before 10pm, provided I have adequate notice. Call or text REDACTED. Don't worry, I'm a nice guy and am happy to help the gun community in any way that I can. If you have placed an order and need me to send my license to the seller, just shoot me a text with your name, order/invoice/auction number, make and model of the firearm purchased, and your email address (so I can copy you) and I'll get that out to your seller pronto. Once you have received confirmation of shipment, please send along the tracking information (so that I can make sure I don't miss delivery). Any questions, please ask! Thank you!!!"

Bill of sale on request.The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-packaged size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the double action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.SpecificationsCaliber: 9mmHeight (inches) 90° to barrel: 3.9Weight (ounces) with empty magazine: 17Length (inches): 5.5Magazine capacity: 6 roundsFrameMaterial: AluminumFinish: Matte Black KimPro IIWidth (inches): 1.14SlideMaterial: Stainless steelFinish: Matte Black DLCBarrelLength (inches): 2.7Material: Stainless steelTwist rate (left hand): 10SightsMeprolight Tritium 3-dot night sight, fixedRadius (inches): 4.4GripsMicartaCheckeredTriggerDouble action striker- firedFactory setting (approximate pounds): 7"

This was my home defense shotgun but decided to go with a semi auto design.
Prior to dedicating this for home defense I have used this for shooting clays, birds and small varmits  also. I have not used it for bigger game hunting yet. This is a Remington 870 clone. The reviews prior to buying this noted that it was of better quality than the newer Remington 870, and I have to agree. Better quality and action all around. It will accept most all accessories and upgrades for the 870.
The side saddle shown needed to be modified to work with the ATI fore grip so it will only hold 5 shells in lieu of 6. No biggie. It comes with everything shown in the pictures.
The rifle, ATI furniture.
The gun is clean and ready to go. I am looking for $275.00 or best reasonable offer.Buyer must have a valid drivers licence and CCW permit or we can do an FFL transfer at a local dealer. Pictures coming.

It's designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications. The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Light Weight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

This revolutionary design, paired with our advanced polymers gives the AK30 the strength it needs to survive impacts that would destroy other magazines. After the magazine is molded, the body and end-cap are bonded together, so no disassembly is possible or required. The AK30 has a unique low-friction semi-floating follower that is slotted to allow for easy cleaning and hassle-free maintenance. Just dunk the magazine in hot soapy water, rinse and invert to drain. Dry contamination easily flows free through the vented follower design. The AK30 also features a Mil-Spec spring that is heat-treated and stress relieved.Internal designInside, there is a lot going on! The locking surfaces are reinforced by a stainless steel cage that has been molded into the entire top of the magazine to further ensure reliability for years of trouble free service. We purposely omitted reinforcing the feed-lips with metal, being as our polymer rebounds back to its original shape much more reliably than metal or metal reinforced designs. When examined, the benefit of steel reinforced feed lips was found to be less desirable, as the two dissimilar materials, polymer and steel rebound and flex at differing rates. This can cause delamination between the two materials, which can create an environment for malfunctions. It was also observed that even though the AKM platform is field proven and very robust, attempts at field repairing bent feed lips by end users were unsuccessful.External DesignOutside, our design team created a magazine that can be utilized by an operator in any environmental condition. The aggressive ridges on the front and rear allow a positive purchase when seating the AK30 into the rifle. The deep waffle pattern on the magazine sides assist in rapid extraction from magazine pouches, and 100% positive manipulation within conditions beyond extreme. Every surface of the AK30 was given careful consideration to benefit the operator working in the harshest conditions on earth.Platform SpecificsInitially designed to fit AKM-47 rifles that use detachable double-stack magazines, the AK30 has been successfully deployed in other makes and models similar to the AKM as well. We still advise users of mass-produced/domestically produced rifles to test their individual rifles for compatibility, as there exists a very wide set of “standards” to which rifles are manufactured, and in the rare occasion, the AK30 may be too dimensionally specific to accommodate for a wide tolerance stacking issue.Weapon locking interfaces (notch/latch) are a reinforced with a welded stainless steel cage, molded into the bodyLow friction self cleaning polymer followerProprietary polymer body and end capSealed one piece designColors: BlackCaliber: 7.62 x 39Capactity: 30 roundsWeight: 7.0 ounces"

It is an H series later run when they added back the forend cap making it late 70's or into 80's .The third is that it has 26 inch barrels . Savage did not mark the chokes but factory guns with 26 inch barrels were typically modified and improved cylinder . This gun is at least that open .There are some marks on the barrels and stocks and the smallest unrepaired beginning of a check on the right side buttstock behind the receiver . This is common .The lever is left of center and may have left the factory that way . The gun has extractors and the heavy factory springs have not been changed . Great candidate for cowboy action shooting .Buyer will receive 20 rounds of 3 inch BB 1-5/8 lead shotshells @ 1280 FPS not for hunting use ."

It is a NO1 MK3 chambered in 303, all numbers matching rifle. The bore is in great shape for the age and action seems to work smoothly. The safety has been broken off, the stock has seen a lot of ""action"" and still has some cosmoleen in it. I found a safety online, complete for $20 but I have no interest in this type of gun. It is sold as is. I will do my best to provide any information I know for ya. Thanks."
