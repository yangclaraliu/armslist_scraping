It has a 15 round magazine, sling, oil can and buttstock mag holder (like the real m1's).Good luck ever finding another one of these for sale.Here is information regarding it's history. Between May 1945 and June 1949 West German police in the American Occupation Zone were provided with American handguns and and 18,966 U.S. M1 carbines. [OMGUS Civil Administration Division, Bad Nauheim, 08 Sep 1949, Semi-Annual German Police Personal & Equipment Report as of 30 Jun 1949]. More M1 and M2 carbines were provided to the newly formed West German Border police (Bundesgrenzpolizei) in 1952 and to the new West German Bundeswehr in 1956. Records of the U.S. Department of Defense Military Assistance Program maintained by the National Archives indicate 1950-1963 West Germany was provided with 34,192 U.S. M1 carbines. With the M1 carbines came a very large need for training the Germans how to use the American weapon.
The development and use of .22 caliber rifles constructed to operate and feel like a particular military weapon was fairly common in Europe during the 1900's. One example is a .22 caliber training rifle used by the Germans to train their troops for use of the Mauser K98 main battle rifle. Compared to the full size weapons, the training rifles and their ammunition were less expensive to produce, and helped newcomers to familiarize themselves with the weapons.
When Erma Werke was acquired by Fiberglide in 1961 plans were already underway for production of the EM1 Carbine look-a-like in .22 long rifle caliber for use as a training rifle. The EM1 was adopted for use in training by the Austrian Gendarmerie [U.S. Karabiner .30 M1 by Wolfdieter Hufnagl], who had obtained over 10,000 U.S. M1 carbines 1955-1957. How many EM1's were manufactured and used by the Austrian Gendarmerie is not known.
ERMA-Werke purchased surplus U.S. Army Ordnance tooling and machinery used during WWII to produce various parts for the U.S. M1 Carbines."

Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel. Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms: Manual thumb safety, Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firing Firing pin block. Each UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round in states that permit these magazine capacities. Fully adjustable front and rear sights are standard.

Action rides in a beautiful heavy weight laminated wood stock completely free of dents and gouges.  Rail mounted Harris bipod attached. Optics are 6-24x Bausch & Lomb with 1000 yard and infinity adjustable objective lens. Optics were upgraded at some point in the 90's based on the model of this scope. Scope is mounted in S&K rings and one piece base. This rifle and caliber was designed to dominate at the 1000 yard line by throwing long (positive coefficient) heavy 30 caliber bullets harder and further than the 300 Win Mag and far beyond the 308. That said, it would make an exceptional elk rifle especially out west. This piece is just a beautiful rig that's in need of a new owner who will appreciate her for the craftsmanship it displays. I used to have the room at Quantico to shoot this rig but now it sits so it's time to move her along. THIS IS THE FINAL PRICE DROP. IF IT DOESN'T SELL IT WILL GO BACK IN THE SAFE.I also have a limited amount of loaded rounds and brass plus load data to get you started.  if you've read this far and checked out the pics (which don't do it full justice) you can see that you couldn't build this rig for anywhere near what I'm asking."
