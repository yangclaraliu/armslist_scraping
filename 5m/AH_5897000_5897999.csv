The rifle is pretty but is old and has been used. It has some surface rust on the barrel and other metal parts but shoots flawless and is dead accurate with the iron sites. This is a good opportunity to get a very nice shooting .22 long rifle cheap if you don't mind a little rust and the rifle looking well used. Price is $80 cash firm. I am in Asheville NC near Sweeten Creek Rd or Hendersonville Area. Call or text REDACTED."

I did take it out and ""test fire"" a couple of mags through it and cleaned it after. It's an awesome shooter. I just need to move some stuff right now. The awesome price reflects me shooting it a couple of times. Sphinx Compct Alpha Wolf 9mm DA/SA 15rd Description The SPHINX SDP Compact Alpha is a duty-sized pistol that can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Alpha is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The polymer pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Alpha. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.Specifications:- Action: DA/SA with Ambidextrous De-Cocking Lever- Caliber: 9mm- Barrel Length: 3.70""- Capacity: 15 Rounds- Magazine Catch: Left/Right (Reversible)- Sight Radius: 5.70""- Sights: FrontL Iron Blade with White Dot and Rear: Serrated Fixed- Trigger Pull Weight: SA: 4.0+ lb and DA: 10.0+ lb- Slide material: Steel- Slide Finish: Cerakote- Frame Material: Upper: Milled Aluminum and Lower: Polymer- Frame Finish: Cerakote- Grip: Polymer Including Finger Molds- Interchangeable Inserts: Polymer Base with Rubber Size (Small, Medium, Large)"

I inherited all of this stuff from my grandfather who was a gunsmith. I have set aside all that I want to keep so the rest is up for sale. I am a VERY busy father so I would much rather just sell all of this as one big lot rather than piecing it out but if I have to I will. I am by no means planning to just give it away by accepting ridicules offers, so don't offer a couple hundred bucks and expect me to accept it. I have already researched every item in this listing to get a value and a Conservative total is $1500. If someone buys the whole lot I will sell it for $400 which would net you a 600 dollar profit by selling everything at the discounted prices I have listed here. I have priced everything below the prices I found online so that I know I am offering you the lowest price. I am accepting any REASONABLE cash offer as well as trade offers but I will be expecting a higher than cash value offer in your trades. Please do not send messages asking what I want in trade because I don't have specific items in mind other than a mig/flux core welder or a .22 for my son. Just let me know what you have to trade and we'll go from there. I will be including a few extras to the person who buys it all like a pistol rack and some gunsmithing tools/accessories. LET'S MAKE A DEAL! Best way to get ahold of me is email or text because with what I do I am not able to always answer my phone. 937xx260xx5002 So here is what I have for sale:I suggest that you Google any of these items if you want to see what it looks like or text/email me and I will send you pictures.1.

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. Starting at just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck. CALL JOHN @ REDACTED"
