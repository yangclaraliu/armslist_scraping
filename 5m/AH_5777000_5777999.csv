(If the word is unfamiliar, an anomaly is ""something that deviates from what is standard, normal or expected."") The barrel is marked .22 Magnum, but has the flat muzzle that was typical of the .22 LR guns. Over many years of collecting the Frontier Scouts, I have owned two or three , I do not know why these revolvers exist. I do know that all the guns that I have seen in this configuration, fall into the 80000F-85000F serial number range (1959). According to Don Wilkerson's excellent book, ""Colt Scouts, Peacemakers and New Frontiers in .22 Caliber"" (Walsworth Publishing, 1993), the .22 Magnum chambering was introduced in the Frontier Scout line around serial number 48800F. If ""transition"" models existed, I would expect them to be in that number range, not 40,000 numbers later. However, Colt produced more than 50,000 Frontier Scouts in 1959 so some strange things could have happened in that period. Colt collectors have learned to ""never say never"". a very rare colt revolverNice older colt single action frontier scout revolver.22 magnum. Very nice smooth colt action, shiny bore, good lockup and timing. Not much wear , abit of light flecking that should clean up nice. Awesome plinker with a super light smooth action. Essentially a scaled down peacemaker in .22 'The New Frontier 22s made from 1970 until 1977 had barrels bored for the .22 Magnum even if shipped with only .22LR cylinders.

It has a fairly broad set of iron sights consisting of a ghost ring with both windage and elevation adjustments and a front sight with a tritium insert for low light shooting. Just past the action of this rifle is a rail for mounting optics if you don’t want to use irons. It has a black synthetic stock that is smooth and feels very solid; it also contains a protected storage compartment. The trigger is a smooth two-stage that breaks at roughly 6 pounds and it is very easy to use and maintain accuracy. Springfield included a proprietary muzzle break built into the gas system to help tame the recoil of the .308 and it definitely does its job well.  I put a couple boxes of ammo through this gun the other day and definitely enjoyed myself. The muzzle break does a great job of keeping the muzzle rise down and sends most of the recoil straight to the rear, but not so much that you couldn’t shoot it all day.  With the sights being so broad and open it is very easy to find your target quickly and fire relatively fast and accurate.    Manufacturer: Springfield Manufacturer Part #: AA9611PK Model: M1A SOCOM Action: Semi-automatic Caliber: 308 Win Caliber: 762NATO Barrel Length: 16.25"" Finish/Color: Black Grips/Stock: CQB Composite Type of Barrel: 1:11 Capacity: 10Rd Sights: Vortex Venom"

I have had this gun for some time but I have maybe only shot 200 rounds through it. That is the reason I am selling it, I do not live on shooting land, or have access to shoot this bad boy often enough to justify keeping it. Therefore, I would like to pass it on to another owner. I would advise only purchasing if you are skilled with firearms. These guns have adjustable head spacing and parts must be swapped out for caliber changes. But it is easy to pick up the operation. That said, I have collected over the years about all the accessories and spare parts you could ever want for one of these. This auction will include everything pictured. I have installed on it a crank fire system which will simulate FA firing speeds. I have caliber conversions for 8mm, 30-06, .308, and my favorite, 7.62x54r. You can shoot just about any surplus rifle round your heart desires through this 1919. Included also are all the spare parts pictured (and some more in the plastic bags), two semi auto bolts, one in 7.62x54, and one new one that has only been test shot in .308/30-06/8mm. Also included are two non-modified bolts in 30-06 and one in .308. An Israeli ground A6 style kit will also come with the 1919 which includes the carry handle, bipod, and stock set. Further, a BFA is included and I will add in 250 or so rounds of belted plastic .308 blanks. Lastly included is a multicaliber ammunition link loader. Works great and links up 20 metal links at a time. I will include about 100 metal links, plus the 250 linked on blanks and 3 cloth belts. Any other small 1919a4 parts I have will be included. I do not take selling this gun lightly, so I am going to try to sell as a set. I have listed it for what I have in it and what I believe it is all worth together. I would prefer buyer to pick up from Galveston Texas, If picked up I will include a very nice Sokolov Mount in for free, Otherwise buyer pays actual shipping. Gun is very heavy I may look to finding a crate to ship it in. Thanks again for looking. If shipping know your state laws. I am not responsible for knowing laws of other states. 1919 if shipped must ship to FFL but I can ship everything else to you."

Many Missions.The revolutionary, fully-modular Remington Adaptive Combat Rifle (ACR). The ACR was initially conceived to provide today’s warfighter an American-made, reliable, accurate, and mission –configurable rifle. Three American companies – MagPul Industries Corp., Bushmaster and Remington – shared this common vision and after multiple iterations of torturous testing only the strongest materials, components and concepts survived. The ACR can change calibers from 5.56mm to 6.8mm in minutes at the user level by changing the bolt head, barrel, and magazine. The ACR can also change barrels, stocks, and accessories to go from a close-quarters battle carbine to a designated marksman rifle. Add a superbly reliable gas piston operating system, controllable full-auto fire capability, a non-reciprocating bolt handle, a monolithic free-floating handguard rail system, and intuitive, ambidextrous controls and you have a platform that is a natural fit for any operator and gives him all the options he needs.

Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. (Model 8502 features a fixed stock.)   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.     Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug (model 8500 only), for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. (Model 8500 only.)   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.     Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.   Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul® PMAG® (model 8500 only) or one, 10-round metal magazine (model 8502).
