It likes to go out for walks too.  It also really wants a suppressor for Christmas.I can be contacted via email or text (Seven6three 33one two9two5) with questions, etc.  Willing to discuss possible trades if it's something I'm interested in.  Price is firm.  These are not easy to find in the used market.You will need PTC or PTP and ID to purchase.  I am willing to bring it to my local FFL so it can be shipped to your local FFL for transfer, at your expense.  I can take CC but add 2.9% fee. I use PayPal. Thanks for looking!"

I prefer face-to-face sale, but I will ship in-state directly to you.  No middleman, no FLL dealer required!  However, the money must be in my hands before I will ship. 
 
In Like-NEW Condition, 150th Anniversary Colt silver medallions on handgrips, 100% of original Colt blue finish, machined from solid block hardened-steel (no cheap polymer, zinc alloys or aluminum as found in recent Colts). 
 
This is a Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Model 06390, Mustang 380 semi-automatic pistol, manufactured in 1986.
 
In NRA New condition, only one round was test fired from this Colt Mustang 380. I purchased this Colt from a dealer in 1986, along with Federal hydra-shock ammo (ammo still has $8.99 price sticker) and I kept both in the night stand by the bed for personal protection for 40 years.  There are no scuff marks, no wear-marks, no scratches.  Included are the factory box, Colt manual, and all original paperwork (including a letter from Gary French, the President of Colt). 
 
Great defense weapon – small, accurate and solid as a tank.  It has a 2 2/4 barrel, 6 round capacity, 5 inch overall length.  For those of you unfamiliar with .380 ammo, it is really 9 mm shorts, and it backs a heck of a wallop.
 
Do not compare this solid steel, 150 Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Mustang 380 semi-automatic pistol to the flimsy, cheap plastic, and aluminum versions, this is a precision milled weapon that is solid like a tank!
 
My asking price is $850 cash, no trades for this like-New, 150 Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Mustang .380 pistol.  The fair market value of a 150 Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV/Series 80, Mustang .380 is $895 – $1,000.  Look for yourself:  http://www.gunbroker.com/item/573988609  
 
As you can see, my $850 asking price is a bargain.  Remember, cash only, no trades!"

Maybe 200 rounds through it, never dry-fired. Fantastic hunting rifle for the upcoming season. The accu-trigger on this gun is the best-breaking trigger I have ever used for hunting. It is mounted with a Leupold VX-1 Rimfire 2-7x28mm rifle scope that is perfect for small game, with fine duplex crosshairs and a factory parallax setting of 60 yards. It is currently sighted in for tack-driving accuracy at exactly 50 yards, spent a while at rabbit creek today making sure of it. This rifle has never disappointed in the short time I've had it, but I have another 22 rifle and I don't need this one.Included is three five round magazines, a Leupold scope cover, a great RedHead sling that matches the rifle's camo, and a Herter's soft rifle case. Also, it's got a custom machined 1/2-28 threaded muzzle attachment for fitting muzzle accessories. Machined to the exact diameter of the barrel to the nearest thousandths of an inch and fits perfectly. Had a local gunsmith do this.

I prefer face-to-face sale, but I will ship in-state directly to you.  No middleman, no FLL dealer required!  However, the money must be in my hands before I will ship. 
 
This is a 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Model 06390, Mustang 380 semi-automatic pistol, manufactured in 1986.  In Like-NEW Condition, with the rare 150th anniversary silver medallions on the handgrips, 100% of original Colt blue finish, machined from solid block hardened-steel (no cheap polymer, zinc alloys or aluminum as found in recent Colts). 
 
Only one round was test fired from this 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mustang; I purchased it from a dealer in 1986, along with Federal hydra-shock ammo (ammo still has $8.99 price sticker) and I kept both in the night stand by my bed for personal protection for 40 years.  There are no scuff marks, no wear-marks, no scratches.  Included are the factory box, Colt manual, and all original paperwork (including a letter from Gary French, the President of Colt). 
 
Great defense weapon – small, accurate and solid as a tank.  It has a 2 3/4” barrel, 6 round capacity, 5” overall length. 
 
Do not compare this solid steel, 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Mustang 380 semi-automatic pistol to the flimsy, cheap plastic, and aluminum versions, this is a precision milled weapon that is solid like a tank!
 
My asking price is $850 cash, no trades.  The fair market value of a 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV/Series 80, Mustang .380 is $895 to $1,000.  Look for yourself at  http://www.gunbroker.com/item/573988609    The non-anniversary editions of the Mark IV, Series 80 Colt Mustang are all priced in the $700’s, do a search here at Armslist for “Colt Mark IV/Series 80 Mustang” and see for yourself that even the non-anniversary edition is in the $700 range!
 
As you can see, my $850 asking price is a bargain.  Remember, cash only, no trades!"

I like it but don't carry it enough. Comes with everything from the factory including the cardboard box. Plus one extra 7 round mag as a bonus. Everyone knows what a LCP looks like but if you need pics I can send to you by request. It's as new as one you'd buy at your local gun store. Can meet anywhere between Novi and Utica as I commute daily between those two areas. Must have CPL. All laws apply. No no trades at this time.

The rife is rare because the action including all the metal parts are dated in 1953 which is a later post-war production. Yet the stock is a beatiful walnut stock dated back in 1944. as you K31 collectors out there, you know that later production K31 usually have Beech wood stock. However, all the wood parts' serial number on the rifle match with the ones on the action. I have digged into the history of this and found this.According to http://www.cruffler.com/study, when they were manufacturing the rifle on 1953, they found several batches of unused war-time walnut stocks inside a cave. So they decided to use those stocks on these new productions. therefore, u have a 1953 produced K31 with a 1944 walnut stock in front of you. Also i found a troop tag right under the butt plate. This is a highly collectable K31 that is full of history.All the numbers are matching even includes the the upper handguard and the stock. Yes, I did take it fully disassembled in order to clean it so I have looked at the wood parts' serial number. And yes, I did take everything apart and cleaned it throughly including the trigger group.I also re-oil it. The bore looks absolutely beatutiful.
