I have invoices or at least packing slips for everything.
 
I bought the parts and assembled this AR myself save the upper receiver which I bought fully assembled from BCM.
There's about 1250 just in parts in the gun, but in my offer there's 480 rounds of federal and 7 magazines included. Only taken to the range once in 2 years, so it's time to sell it. Armorer's tool and bore snakes are your's if you want them.
There's nothing wrong with the gun besides some paint transfer on the buffer tube from the armorer's tool and very minor markings from the punch. Shells eject at the right angle and she shoots like a champ.
 Price is negotiable, but this is already a good deal."

Thin coat of Rustoleum applied and then handled consitently in order to achieve the battle-worn desert tan look. Can be completely removed in minutes with paint thinner, brake cleaner, or any other kind of paint removal substance, but I liked the look. Has had about 250 rounds through it so it's still relatively new. Visibile cosmetic wear and tear is simulated -- rifle has been very well taken care of. Rifle is in great condition and is a fantastic shooter; however, I am in a bad situtation financially and so I need the cash. As a result I can't take trades right now. Face to face transaction with buyer only. Please be legally allowed to own this firearm. Ar-15's are one of the fastest selling firearms this year, and the prices are sky-rocketing. Get one now before they are banned!!!Thanks for looking and feel free to ask for pics!"

Hinged solid-steel floorplate for easy unloading without having to chamber each cartridge. Features an engraved FTW logo and patented latch that is flush with the trigger guard to avoid accidental dumping of cartridges.   Three-position safety is easily accessible and allows the shooter to lock the bolt or to load and unload the rifle with the safety engaged.   Cold hammer-forged barrel results in ultra-precise rifling that provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning.   Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver, provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field (scope rings included).   Ergonomically pleasing stock features a soft rubber buttpad with buttpad spacers that allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters or varying levels of outerwear (three 1/2"" spacers included).   Also includes: rugged one-piece, stainless steel bolt; studs for mounting sling swivels.   The Ruger® Muzzle Brake System includes a removable, radial-port muzzle brake that significantly reduces felt recoil. For times when the brake is not preferred, it may be replaced by the included dynamically-matched muzzle weight. Switching between the brake and the weight will not change the bullet's point of impact for a particular load. The included thread protector may be used if neither the brake nor the weight is desired."

I would like it to have removable chokes and a 24 inch or shorter vent rib barrel. These requirements could be waived if the price is right though. I am not too concerned with condition as long as it is priced accordingly. I may be interested in a decent quality over under as well, so let me know what you have."

Only thing I did do was color fill the ""357 MAGNUM' in red along the barrel, but I can easily remove that. Comes with original box and accessories. $600 FIRM. Prefer weekends. Buyer pays transfer fee at either Pantel Tactical in Renton, West Coast Armory in Bellevue is second choice.
