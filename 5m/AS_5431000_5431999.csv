A beautiful rifle in great condition. Many of these were pretty beat up from the training the Swiss did during the world war eras but this one has survived well and is mechanically fantastic. The bore is shiny and crisp and the action is smooth. Rifle includes the weather cap designed to protect the crown and keep the elements out of the barrel. Please email or text 865-foursixsix-0740.  Asking 325 firm. Classic Firearms description of the firearm:An improvement over the original, 1889, version of the Schmidt-Rubin rifle, the Swiss M1911 placed the locking lugs in the middle of the bolt, rather than at the rear, strengthening the action and allowing a more powerful cartridge, the Gewehrpatrone 11 or GP 11 to be used. It is distinguished from the 96/11 rifle by a curved buttplate and by a stock with an integral semi-pistol grip. It uses a graduated tangent sight which begins at 300 meters. The 1911 and 96/11 rifles are characterized by exceptional accuracy and were made with excellent craftsmanship. The fact that Switzerland remained neutral through both world wars ensured that they are in far better condition, on average, than the rifles of other European nations from that vintage. 7.5x55 caliber, Straight Pull."

It will come with VZ Grips, original grips, two Wilson combat 8 round magazines, and a hard plastic case that is not the original. I put trade value at $800. A cash sale would be more a little more flexible. This is probably one of the best 1911s I have ever shot. And I have owned a bunch. Just let me know what you're thinking, must have CCP or permit etc. Located in Charlotte. Thanks for looking!"

It's a licensed copy of the Czech ZVI ZP-98 ""Kevin"" pistol. It's blued, with a black alloy frame, and uses a unique gas-retarded blowback action that operates via a ported barrel. In my experience this makes for exceptional reliability without the weight or stiff recoil of a straight-blowback pistol. It is one of the smallest .380 pistols on the market, being shorter than the LCP / TCP / P3AT in both length and height, albeit a little thicker and heavier.This pistol is in excellent condition, with only minor carry wear. It comes with the factory box, paperwork, and one 6rnd magazine. Also includes seven 90gr Federal Hydra-Shoks.This little thing makes the perfect pocket gun, and with double ports on the top of the barrel by design, it is quite fun to shoot. Asking $400. Cash is king, but also looking to trade for a Beretta Pico or possibly a Ruger LCP-C.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED or PM me on here any time.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

I paid $459.00 for it then, they still run about the same price now. If you would like to see details on it search the cabelas website, they have the same package for sale still, sku # 03014934 is the one.Two boxes/ 40 rounds of low quality remington core lokt ammo have been shot through rifle with 1"" or better, sub moa groups @ 100 yds. I cant magine what it would do with quality ammo. I also shot it at steel targets at 200 and 300 yds which showed about the same 1 moa accuracy or even better. My best group was ajust over 3/4"". Its a very accurate and awesome rifle for the price. I would have changed the stock and scope out and used it for long range shooting but am not a fan of the 30-06 for this. A new one currently costs $459.00 +$34.00 tax= $493.00 total, $143.00 more and you risk getting one of thier rifles that do not shoot 1 moa or better. You could buy a decent scope to put on it with the savings!!There is no wear, scratches or cosmetic issues on the gun, it is like new. I am selling it because i don't have much of a use for it other than using the 700 action to build a different custom rifle. It has just sat i my gun case. I am purchasing a sendero/ long range rifle today in 300 WM for this purpose, something capable of really long range shooting in a magnum caliber because i was so impressed with the accuracy of this gun.I am willing to meet and drive a little ways if it helps. Please call my cell at REDACTED if you have any questions. I do not check my email very frequently so please call my cell. I am sure it will sell quick and first to pick it up gets it."

So I ordered a spikes Spartan from joebob's for my Adams Arms piston 11.5"" upper only to find a small gap between the lower extension and the upper(it's not horrible but I am kinda picky).
