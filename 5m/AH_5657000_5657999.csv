This is a high-end Ruger AR. It operates with a piston system rather than DI which allows the gun to stay cooler and cleaner during operation, meaning less fouling of the bolt. You can also dial an adjustment to the piston to account for different types of ammunition. The gun is very reliable. I've fired about 100 rounds since I bought it and have seen 0 failures using a variety of inexpensive 5.56 and .223 rounds. This is a fine AR rifle, one worthy of any collection. I have found myself needing to adjust my collection however, so I've selected this one to move on because it just sits in the safe.Rifle features a 16 1/2"" cold hammer forged mil-spec 41v45 barrel. Barrel is threaded 1/2-28 and capped with a Ruger flash suppressor. Lightweight ergonomic handguard, flattop receiver with full length picatinny rail in the 12 o'clock position. Flip up iron sights. 6-position telescopic stock on a mil-spec buffer tube. Chrome lined gas block and chrome plated piston. Includes (2) 30-round PMAG's and a Ruger soft-side carrying case. I removed the OEM stock and replaced it with a Magpul CTR.You can check out details here: www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?i=GM447594Price is $995.00 cash. Buyer pays transfer/BGC. Transfer to be done at FFL in the Portland Metro or Vancouver area for WA buyers. I will ship to your FFL, buyer pays shipping/transfer costs. If your FFL can accept a transfer directly from a private party, it will save on shipping costs rather than ship though my FFL. I can take PayPal for payment.Trades: I need to get about $600-$700 out of this rifle, so I may be open to part trade for other firearms. I don't need any shotguns, bolt guns or anything in an oddball caliber. I also don't need optics, ammo or reloading supplies. Some handguns may be of interest such as an inexpenisve Glock 22 (like a police trade), maybe some other smaller handguns in 9mm or possibly .380. Canik TP9SF is on the list of interests. SCCY CPX-2 is also on the interest list. If you have something to offer, let me know what you have and I'll let you know if I'm interested."

While the Flat-Top Upper and Top Handguard section of the VIS begin as 2 separate, partially machined components, they are fused together during manufacture by a proprietary welding process, emerging as a single piece that has been stress relieved, final machined, and heat treated. This unique design enabled the Vltor VIS to become the 1st of the 1-Piece AR-15 Upper Receiver/Handguard Assemblies capable of accepting Any Standard AR-15 Barrel on the market! The Bottom section of the Quad Rail Handguard incorporates a protective Heat Shield and is a removable piece that's easily detached and re-installed to the main receiver body via 2 recessed levers, maintaining full compatibility with under-barrel mounted flare or grenade launching devices. This VIS Upper incorporates a combination Forward Assist and Shell Deflector into its flattop MUR Modular Upper Receiver, and features a Quad Rail Handguard, creating a continuous Top Rail platform for optics and/or accessories. While not compatible with any gas piston operating systems, the VIS will allow most low profile gas blocks to be mounted inside and under the handguard.Technical Information Upper Receivers: Polylithic 1-Piece Flat-Top w/Forward Assist & Shell DeflectorMaterial: Forged 7075-T6 AluminumFinish: Mil-Spec Type III Hard Coat AnodizingM4 Feed Ramps: YesCarbine Length:Weight: 21.5 ozLength: 7""Overall Length: 14.5"""

Supposedly there's a breaking in period and a magazine mod to fix this but I'm unwilling to do that.  Fmj rounds load perfectly btw. So i painted the slide white to customize it.

Local gun smith installed the Ghost 3.5# connector and Zev Tech Competition springs allowing this the best trigger pull of any Glock I've shot. I can provide you the original parts if you want to revert back to original but once you shoot it you will not dream of it.YES, this does have a Cominolli Safety (1911 style) installed. Fully supported through Glock warranty as they approved it. TEN RING PRECISION out of Texas professionally installed the safety for me ($138). It allows you to load and unload the gun with the safety on. You can run it just like a 1911 as well. Before someone starts with why a safety on a Glock or it's between your ears stuff.....This was my family camping and hiking gun. I preferred to leave one in the Chamber in the tent without the worry of the kids bumping into it in the dark. Remember it does have a very light trigger -￼. When I'm solo I just turn off the safety and leave it off. So have it on or off - pretty simple.Also, has a Trijicon front night sight. Box and 2 mags. Ultra reliable and VERY accurate.Only selling because I'm sticking with 10mm that I'm going to install a Cominolli Safety on. Owned it for about 4-5 years. Extended slide release not included. I will take $550 cash or might trade at $600.  This was an expensive for me but worth it.  I will not separate the parts.  CCW & Bill of Sale required. FTF within 30 minutes.  Thanks"
