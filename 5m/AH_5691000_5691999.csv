1,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5691001,"For Sale:  Ruger Toklat 454 PACKAGE: ammo, accessories, etc.","Dallas/Fort Worth Area, Dallas, Texas","$ 1,100","Listed On: Sunday, July 17, 2016",Handguns,Ruger                                                                                ,454 Casull                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"The short sell: Up for sale is a like new Ruger Toklat 454 Casull/45 Long Colt. Plenty of factory ammo, sweet hardside case, original accessories, Jack Weigand optics mount, some other minor accessories. Precisely 43 rounds through the beautiful slab side barrel. Manual, because reading is fundamental. Quick responses, because I have no life, when you text 956-three six nine-2997. The long sell: Do you love America? Does the featherlight recoil of a 44 Magnum put you to sleep? Are you kept awake by the constant thought of being robbed by a kevlar vest wearing, ISIS trained grizzly bear? Are you curious about the sound God makes when he sneezes? If so, the Ruger Super Redhawk Alaskan Toklat (Talo Exclusive) is for you! Despite a name longer than the current democratic nominee, this is an All American hand cannon I call the Hellephant and my brother calls ""that damn earsplitting wheelgun abomination"". Information on the Toklat is very scarce on the web, but I am led to believe only 500 were manufactured by Talo under contract from Ruger and it is rumored that Ronald Reagan hand washed each one in Holy Water. You almost can't find these things except online at an exorbitant rate: when and if you can find one, they run around 870-990 bucks plus whatever extortion your local FFL charges, plus Obama taxes.The gun: This is your standard Ruger type wheelio: button cylinder release, heavy DA/SA trigger system, Hogue grips thicker than Ms. Universe's fanny and just as fun to grab...with a twist! I have had Jack Weigand's Picatinny rail installed to the top to allow for a red-dot style optic (if you prefer traditional optics, this can be undone easily). It is very possible that less than 50 or so Toklats are styled like this. This is a true revolver to deal with rapid acquisition of Grizzly Bears or Priuses that threaten your home and family. It makes a poor CCW, however, unless you are the Undertaker. If you wanna learn more, Republican Santa, AKA hickok45, made a video about it on youtube and used it to great effect. Even he didn't have an optic ready one, however. This is what you get, baby: 1. PLANO hardside case with plenty of foam: because the Ruger original box sucks and has no padding. They go for about 25$ and protect the beautiful finish wonderfully. 2. Jack Weigand Aluminum Weig-a-tinny Picatinny rail, silver, already installed (no drilling and tapping req't) to make this beast optic ready. Loctited. Goes for 70$ with shipping. 3. Two HKS speedloaders that fit either 454 or 45 LC perfectly and allow for quick reloading to deal with roving gangs of Russian tanks. Bout 10 each. 4. ONE HUNDRED GOSH DARN rounds of 300 grain, 454 Casull, WSM factory Flatnoses. These will kill a bear hiding behind a refrigerator hiding behind your neighbor's house. SIXTY THREE HOLY MOTHERIN rounds of 300 grain, 454 Casull, WSM factory JHPs. 43 once-fired brass cases, and you really should reload, because these go for about a buck a round. Also, two beautiful Cabelas plastic cases with individual round holders to protect bullets from moisture and dirt. 163 for the ammo, bout 10 for each box. 5. Boring original plebean accessories: Brass Bead front sight, original rear sight (had to be uninstalled so the Rail would fit). Original ruger scope rings. Paperwork proving I bought it legally from a gun store, and I'm the original owner, and an all around handsome guy. Price is 1100 FIRM, cash is king. Here's how that breaks down: 850 gun, 150 Ammo, 20 speedloaders, 25 case, 70 Rail, 20 Ammo boxes. I discounted both the gun and the ammo a bit because I fired 43 rounds through it. FTF only, I absolutely will need to see a Texas DL or CHL. We can meet wherever you want in the DFW area, provided I can legally carry the firearm there. Again, my contact is 956-three six nine- 2997. Treat yourself before the November elections! Buy now, explain to your hateful wife later!"

Overall the gun is in good shape. It has some wear on the exterior, but it is in very good condition. This was my carry gun, but I am selling it to get some money. I have attached photos so that you can see the condition for yourself. The holster is a SHTF holster that I have used extensively; however, it is still in good condition and completely usable. I have also attached photos of the holster. The gun originally came with 2 mags and I acquired 3 others. (The extra mags normally cost $50 each). I think that $750 for the 5 mags, the holster, and the gun is a fair price. If you are interested, please feel free to call/text me at REDACTED.
 Images: (Obviously there ARE serial numbers on the gun. I used photoshop to blur them out so that they are not readable. I did NOT remove the serial numbers from the gun. That would be highly illegal).

I bought this gun NEW from Low Price Guns in Bellevue YESTERDAY, July 16th -- as you can see from the receipt I included in the photos. Photos: http://imgur.com/a/zdDO0Brand new Colt LE 6920 in Carbon Fiber Magpul MOE Furniture w/ Vertical Foregrip hydrodipped. Carbon fiber ""texturing"" and pattern is actually pretty stunning and I'm surprised how nice it looks on this 6920.  . Bought this gun on impulse yesterday because it was a good deal, but realized I'm leaving for London pretty soon for a good 3 weeks and have a nice AR build I should finish first before buying a brand new 6920. So hopefully, my mistake can become your fortune! Please feel free to ask me any questions at all. Great 6920, the gold standard for any quality build or just solid gun all on its own.Everything in the photos is for sale too (all ultra high-speed-low-drag-high-inverse-ability mounting aside). Yup, the Vortex Viper PST FFP 2.5-10x32mm, ADM quick detach mount for 30mm scope tubes, ADM high mount for Aimpoint Micro H1, Nikon P300 (awesome scope), plus more!  *Not the Aimpoint though, maybe...*1st Photo attached shows how the rifle came and will be sold to you.
