$1,100 obo. in cash or a little better in trade value.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

This is one of the more rare Webley models, as it was only produced for a year (1914-1915) in order to begin arming the British Empire for World War I. Revolver is in GREAT condition, and everything indexes perfectly. Very fun to shoot (I have a cool POV video of me shooting this one too, if you'd like to see it). Comes with 50 Powder River Cartridge Company lead-tipped, unfired rounds that are safe to fire in the Webley. Although many people have and do shoot full strength factory .45 ACP, I have not and do not recommend it just in case, although the Webley is known to be a very strong revolver system. Also comes with 1 full moon clip and four half moon clips. An original WWII khaki canvas holster is also included. I'm only looking to trade right now, as I do really like this pistol. No sales at this time. Trade for a H&K USP 9, H&K USP 45, or H&K Mark 23. Can drive depending on distance and deal. Email with offers, thanks!"

Sorry, but hold trade offers. Thinning the collection. (I have a few others posted up too!)This is a High Point 9mm that runs like a champ. Hundreds of rounds through it. A joy to shoot at the range as it's boringly reliable. I have only shot range grade ammo through it, but not lead nose, only copper jacketed. I did shoot some Hornady, but not much. Just wanted to make sure it would cycle properly with them as this sits on the nightstand as my back-up to my back-up gun. These only come with one magazine. Look up the additional cost of the extra 2 included, as well as a nice leather owb holster. Holster fits like a glove and has a nice thumb break. I also have the factory hard case, which is unusual as they usually come in a cardboard box. Excelent home defense or truck gun. At this price you can't go wrong, or if you lose it you won't shed any tears. $150 Firm! Please hold lower offers. Face to face sale to take place in Winter Park. You must be of legal age, a Florida resident and can not have any felonies.

$580 in cash.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.  I can add??
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $30 more.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

This is the Trooper version with a 6in vent ribbed barrel. This gun was developed as a less expensive version of the famous Python series of revolvers. At first glance this gun looks identical to a python. The gun still has Colt's famous Royal bluing and nice wood grips. The MKV's have a half lug barrel, and cast trigger/hammer. The gun has a smooth trigger, but its not as clean as the Classic Python action. The MKV is the best variation of the Trooper series of revolvers, and the most desirable. This gun is in great condition. The grips are a nice light walnut with deep checkering and the classic gold Colt Medellin. The grips are in good condition. There are some light impressions, but no chips or cracks. The checkering is still deep and sharp. The bluing looks great. The gun was done in Colt's famous Royal Blue. This bluing has a high polished, mirror like finish. There is some very light wear at the muzzle, but overall looks good. There is some blue wear on the front face of the cylinder. Overall the gun still looks good. The gun is fitted with wide target hammer and trigger. The gun also features a fully adjustable rear sight. This is the perfect addition to any collection, or an excellent shooter. Don't miss out on this great revolver. Low Start, No Reserve. Buyer pays shipping, 2% CC fee.
