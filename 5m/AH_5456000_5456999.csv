260,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5456260,"For Sale:  Steam Engines For Sale (Yes, Real Ones)","NE, Portland, Oregon","$ 5,000","Listed On: Saturday, May 21, 2016",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Until the 1930's, almost every American farm had its own steam engine. Independent of far-away generators, these engines were sadly sold off during the Depression, to pay for foodstuffs. Now, we are witnessing a comeback of steam power, with the backing of modern technology. Efficiency in the old days of 4-7% is laughed aside; modern engines, working too hard and too fast, produce at LEAST 7% efficiency. Typical loads are 15-20%. Combine steam with solar power, and you have what amounts to a free energy source.Not only that; with a single attendant, a steam engine can run 24/7, all year long. These are wonderful investments; I personally own the Single-Cylinder 50HP listed below. It's run for 5 years with no complaints, and with the plentiful water and wood on my land, my cost to run it are a mere $8/month for lubricating oil.If you live in the country, it provides you with a cheap power source (Horsepower starts at 6 and scales up to 100 depending on needs. A single of our large boilers can power up to 5 engines). If you live in the city, take advantage of grid buyback and earn money by supplying electricity to your local grid. For less than the cost of a car, gain energy independence for a lifetime.I have several variants of steam engine for sale. ALL are:-Brand-new. These are not antiques, or toys; these are low-tech, low-cost solutions to the common man's power needs.-Factory produced, factory-tested, and ready-to-run out of the box with minimal assembly.-Coated in multiple layers of weatherproof machining paint.-Made of highly durable steel, not mandrel iron like the originals.-Created with dual-action heads, which provide a steam cushion for either side of the piston head. Doubles the life of your steam engine.-Highly durable, low-tech designs drawn directly from historical schematics. With proper care and maintenance, a steam engine can quite literally run forever. All it needs is oil, fuel, and water. No more than 25HP is needed to run a modern home with two people; 50HP and above are typically reserved for shops or large power requirements, such as a multi-story home, many large appliances, or a family.Styles:Single Cylinder:-6HP: $1,900-10HP: $2,400-20HP: $2,800-25HP: $3,600-50HP: $4,800-70HP: $6,600Double Cylinder:-5HP: $1,800-8HP: $2,400-12HP: $2,600-20HP: $3,700-36HP: $4,400-40HP: $4,600-100HP: $8,600Boilers, Alternators, Control Panels, Common Base-Slats, Etc, are available upon request. The boilers are based on designs for warships, they are more than capable of handling stationary engines, no matter your requirements.Engines are made to order and shipped to your door, anywhere in the world.

The scope contains the most advanced image correction technology available, and optimizes images automatically. The R-Series provides three inches of eye relief, up to 16× digital zoom, and multiple reticle options with a repeatable and dependable zero. Select between “white hot,” “black hot,” and “InstaAlert” palettes, and capture memorable moments with video out.
The ThermoSight R-Series was built for moments when you have to act fast. With large, glove-friendly buttons and an intuitive menu, you can quickly set reticle settings, zoom, and polarity palettes in three clicks or less. An internal shock reduction system (SRS-M™) is qualified for a MSR semi-automatic platform, up to .30 Cal. Plus, the durable, water-resistant casing can be submerged in up to three feet of water.
The R-Series runs off an internal, rechargeable battery that provides about 4.5 hours of constant operation from a single charge. This helps to reduce the overall weight, size, and cost of the scope. The LaRue quick detach mount is rock solid and features a return-to-zero when removed and reattached to the weapon. The RS32 variants provide some of the best performance for the buck. Running at a real time 60 Hz, the FLIR ThermoSight R-Series delivers the range of features you want—with the thermal performance you expect."

Its major shortcoming is a minor barrel bulge.  It's slight, and towards the muzzle end half of the barrel.  It usually goes unnoticed on casual first inspections,  and even the top solid barrel rib wasn't affected.  I have no idea of the back-story on it,  but the rest of this firearm is as near new as it gets.  There are no ill effects anywhere else,  it's been professionally checked.  Sales of THIS model (with box / no bulge) in the same overall condition have sold on GB for 5K and up.
I can’t say how much a new 4-inch, 6 1/2-inch, or 8 3/8-inch barrel would cost from a S&W gunsmith,   but just do the math.   It's little more than a bolt-on fix for the right armorer. Then it's a mint, 1950's S&W .44 Magnum once again.
The photo shows many glare spots on the bluing.   There are no actual high spots or rubs. No box.
Serious inquiries only please. There's a 72 hour wait period once agreement is made and valid FOID information provided.
If my ad is up,  it’s still available.

The flat cylinder grants maximumcomfort. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment."

The flat cylinder grants maximumcomfort. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment."

The DAO™ can be worn strong side or crossdraw at the user’s discretion. The holster employs a retention strap for simplicity and security in the brush. The retention strap has a large polymer tab to aid in snapping and unsnapping with a gloved hand. Tension screw adjustments allow for a custom fit to your revolver. Constructed of premium saddle leather, the DAO fits belts up to 1 3/4"". Made for Rhino 5-6-inch double-action revolvers, the Dual Action Outdoorsman is tan and for right handed use. REVOLVER INFO:  Defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximumcomfort. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect."

The trigger spring is a reduced-power Wolff spring, the recoil spring is an extra-power spring from Wilson Combat. I also replaced the firing pin and retainer plate. New grips, but the pistol would likely look better with wood factory grips. It could use a new rear sight since the original is damaged (still an okay sight picture). The front sight has had the white-dot processionally re-done. Shows signs if use but the barrel/slide lockup is good. Comes with original surplus magazine (in good condition). $550 cash, no trades.

The rifle was purchased brand new when the GII first came out in 2014; the serial number starts off with ""AA00"". It has only 150 rounds through it following the DPMS recommended barrel break-in procedure. It is sub-mil accurate, and with a practiced shooter, can do even better. My best 5-shot group was a 0.82"" at 100 yards. The rifle comes with the following features and accessories:-Stock free-floating stainless steel 24"" long 1"" diameter bull barrel, 1:9 twist rate-Stock black canvas adjustable sling-Stock A2 buttstock with custom hand-stitched coyote tan wrap/cheekrest (wrap has inserts inside on top of the buttstock to get the proper cheek height for me)-Stock free-float aluminum front handguard with custom hnad-stitched coyote tan wrap (wrap insulates the aluminum handguard from the cold)-Ergo Tactical Deluxe pistol grip with palm shelf-Harris 9-13"" swivel bipod with notched legs (model HBLMS)-AADMOUNT 30mm diameter 20MOA scope mount-SWFA SS 3-15X42 FFP mildot reticle with 1/10th mil turrets-SWFA flip-up Scope Caps-1x stock steel 20 round magazine-5x Magpul Gen M3 10-round magazines with covers-Hand-stiched coyote tan heavy duty rear shooting bag-Heavy duty olive green drag bag-50 rounds of Hornady 178-grain A-Max mild reload with a muzzle velocity of about 2700fps-Various other accessories including lens pen, bore snake, star hex key for scope mount, spare canvas and paracordSome other things to note: all functions, ergonomics, and takedown are the same as any AR-style rifle. This made it very easy for me to learn, and is a comfortable shooter from prone or bench. Recoil is very mild for a .308, thanks to the AR-style gas design and relatively hefty weight. This rifle is not exactly light at about 14 pounds unloaded.I broke the barrel in using 100 rounds of cheap white-box winchester .308 147-grain with zero failures of anykind. Of course, the twist rate in the barrel favors a heavier bullet, so it is highly recommended to use a 165 to 180 grain bullet for normal shooting. I personally prefer the ballistics of the 178 AMAX, which is what the rifle is zeroed in for.I paid well over $2500 for everything, and am asking $2200. I just don't have time to shoot anymore since I moved to Georgia and started my new job."
