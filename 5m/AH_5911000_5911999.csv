Ultimak AK-47 Gas Tube Optic mount (co-witnesses irons perfectly with Bushnell TRS-25) $100
Magpul Zhukov folding adjustable stock  (shoots like a pistol when closed) $100

I’m also including 3 Magpul 30 round Pmags, a 30 round Gen M3 Pmag with steel locking lugs, and a mag coupler. All this is a $168 value, free of charge since I won’t have any use for it. The gun shoots very nicely, is surprisingly accurate (especially with magnified optics), cleans easily, and is overall just an iconic weapon. I am selling the gun to purchase some other accessories, clean out the safe, and focus more on some of my other tools. If you are interested feel free to shoot me a message. I am pricing this to sell. Asking $925. If you have a 1:8 twist Mid Length 16"" .223 Wylde upper to trade I would lower the price accordingly."

Pachmayer flip up scope mount and Kollmorgen Optical 4X scope. 1 box of ammo.The model 1899 (later shortened to 99) was the first commercially produced hammerless rifle. Its predecessors, models 1892 and 1895) were developed in an attempt to replace the Springfield 1873 Trapdoor as the US Army standard issue. Improvements to the early prototypes predicated the establishment of the Savage Arms Company.These rifles are difficult to date, but according to what I've found on line it appears the barrel was produced some time between 1950 and 1960 (fire destroyed factory records after 1950, and popular opinion on line seems to indicate serial numbers over 1,000,000 started in 1960). I'd put it pretty early in that range because records stop at 566,000 and this one is 652,xxx. Savage Arms also stamped a date code on the receiver when they were assembled and shipped, they were notoriously sloppy and difficult to read. This one is typical. Could be a I which translates to 1957.Brite bore, some wear apparent in bluing, some minor pitting just under the scope front lens. Optics are clear on the scope. Overall I'd say it's in good to very good condition,  but I'm no expert."

The CDP stands for Custom Defense Pistol. Awesome carry gun. I've owned this for 10 years, but usually only carry when I go camping or exploring out in the woods. This gun has no holster wear and has had maybe  450 rounds through it. Never had a malfunction except one time when a new shooter was limp wristing it. This feeds everything, even some of the old Speer ""Flying Ashtrays"". Alloy frame of 7075T aluminum keeps weight down to 27 ounces, about what some polymer frame pistols weigh. So light, compared to a steel frame 1911, that you don't even notice it on your hip. Stainless matte finish slide and barrel, Black cerakote finish on the frame. 4 inch ""Commander"" size slide with full length grip holds 8 round magazines. A stiff recoil spring and bushingless coned bull barrel keep recoil close to what you'd get out of a steel frame 1911. I am almost as accurate with this as a Kimber Match 5 inch .45 I had, and some of my friend's custom full size 1911's. This has the carry meld ""bar of soap"" treatment so all edges are rounded and snag free. Bright Meprolight Tritium sights, sweet 3 1/2 pund trigger pull. Ambi safeties, and checkered Rosewood grips. These sell new at Sportsman's Warehouse, Cabela's, etc. for $1099.Included are 8 Chip McCormick ""Shooting Star"" 8 round magazines, 5 are stainless, 3 are blued, all with bumper baseplates. Chip Mccormick (and Wilson Combat) are the best, and the only 1911 magazines I'd consider having.I just don't shoot .45 much anymore, getting older and wimpy I guess. Shooting more .22 LR and 9mm out of pistols.  I also have several hundred rounds of ammo to sell separately if someone wants it."

I was told this had only a few boxes through it when I bought it, and I believe it. I have only shot about a box and a half, flawlessly, through it. It is a pleasure to shoot a well make, nice fit and finish gun like this, that cycles perfectly every time. But I inherited another shotgun, not nearly as nice, but has more sentimental value, and I don't need 2 of them. So this one is up for trade. While I would take cash I guess, I would rather trade. I can add cash for the right deal, or take it, to keep things fair. I can also add in a nice flannel lined case. If you can find a close place and convenient time, you can try it first, it really is a pleasure to shoot this one, but I would want cash or trade in hand."
