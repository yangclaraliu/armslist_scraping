I will also be including a cheap BLACKHAWK! OWB Nylon holster and a size 1450 Pelican case with foam already cut to accomodate this handgun and a Ruger GP100.  Price is 470$; OF COURSE I understand you can get a new one for around $400 out the door, but I arrived at the price based on this reasoning...

I am open to some haggle, I understand the concept of coming to a deal.  I DO hope any potential buyers see I've tried to be reasonable in how I've priced everything out.  Out the door, the gun, the sights, and the grips would come to 510$ + tax and background. I will be requiring a Bill of Sale and a look at any buyer's TN State Issued ID.  A carry permit is even better, but is not a requirement."

Put an XD Mod.2 in your hand, and you'll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol.  Within the GripZone, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone doesn't stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and its only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack coneal carry models. The High-Hand grip relief and High-hand beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol's felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealiblity and increased magazine capacity, you'll want to pick up the new XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact.

It boasts a more forgiving sharpness and eye clarity for positioning fore and aft, and left and right. Using modern alloys and machining techniques the weight has been reduced by 20%-25% without affecting durability or optical performance. 
Most scopes have three or four potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area. The Fullfield II has but two. These leak paths are sealed with special quad seals rather than low-tech O-rings. To change magnification, turn the entire eyepiece, which is now integral to the power ring. A European-style adjustable eyepiece is easy to use and requires no locking mechanism.
Burris has moved the adjustment system rearward to better accommodates mounting situations. Also, the eyepiece is shorter, allowing even more mounting flexibility.
The Fullfield II has also improved long-range marksmanship. The lower part of the crosshair has ballistic lines that compensate for bullet drop from 100 yards to 500 yards for many common hunting cartridges-it's called the Ballistic Plex.
Specs:
This is an ultra-bright varmint/target scope or for long-range big game hunting.

Every design feature on the SDP Compact Alpha is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The polymer pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Alpha. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box."

Known for their excellent triggers, especially in the precision rifle community, JARD has been quietly toiling away on some fun rifle designs, including some buffer-tube free MSR upper receivers and side-charging uppers. The latest creation is the J67, a fully ambidextrous 9mm bullpup design. In fact, it cannot be any more “ambidextrous”. All functions of the weapons system are mirrored on both sides of the gun. The charging handle is forward and non-reciprocating (note, no forward assist which is not needed, especially on a strong recoil spring pistol carbine), magazine release is trigger style in front of the magazine chute, and the safety is Garand-style blade built-in to the trigger guard area. Ejection is out the bottom through a true blow-back system. Similar to the Kel-Tec RDB, the weapons bolt over-travels the magazine and the round is ejected out the bottom behind the magazine, though the JARD uses a fixed ejector system, which is actually the recoil spring guide rod. Its a novel use of needed components. The upper receiver is a monolithic machined extrusion from the handguard cap all the way to the rear. It has the bolt guide-rails shaped directly in, requiring almost no machining, save the picatinny rail up top and the M-LOK compatible (though not officially to-spec) vent holes across the front. The lower is stamped and bent metal housing the trigger (also stamped and bent) which uses a pull method to actuate the hammer behind the ejection chute. Mikail Kalashnikov would be proud of the manufacturability of the weapon. Its simple, inexpensive, and the design is novel. The only option for customization is the addition of a threaded muzzle. JARD is an interesting company with interesting rifles. The J67 is no exception. Its a novel solution for a bullpup rifle and certainly has many positive attributes going for it. First, the trigger is excellent (even for any stock rifle). Its the minimum legal everything in the US (length, barrel, etc) and is 100% fully and totally ambidextrous. From there, its M-LOK compatible, easily broken down and serviced, and with downward ejection, the J67 is not just ambi but southpaw friendly. **Pictured MRO and Suppressor NOT included**"

I've decided to sell it to try and put more money into building a true precision rifle (possibly a Remington 700) in 308.  I don't have any information regarding its previous level of use, however the rifle IS in functioning condition. The only issue with the rifle is what appears to be- and i could be wrong, but i dont want any disappointments- a bit of surface rust forming on the barrel. Its a slight discolored/rough patchy spot, and i am assuming it is rust. Otherwise it appears to function nicely and all. I put about 30 rounds through it with zero issues; not much, but the thing is fairly expensive to shoot so i tried not to waste ammo. May need to be zero'd in as i removed and put back on the sight. The Busnell scope is a 3-9 and is included, but appears to be your typical cheapo scope that comes with rifle packages. I can't say it gave me any problems, though. Rifle has an Accutrigger according to the sticker on the stock.450$ takes it.Also available, either as a package with the rifle or AFTER the rifle is sold, is 180 rounds of Wolf Military classic 145gr FMJ steel case as well as 10 rounds of Federal Power-Shok 180gr soft point ammo. 65 cents a round for them all (Paid over 1$/rd for the Federal, and about .75+ for the wolf with shipping).
Please note that the Bipod IS NOT included. Located in Woodbridge, but can meet in East Brunswick, as well. May be interested in trades for gun-related stuff; other firearms (can add money), lights, optics, etc.."

I've had this grip since probably around 2009-2010 and never had to replace the batteries as of yet. Although Crimson Trace does offer lifetime battery replacement on these products so no worries there. I paid $229 for this at Mikes Outdoors when it was purchased, just make me a reasonable offer as I no longer use it, nor do I have a need for it. Thanks for looking. GOD BLESS AMERICA !"

$2000 or best REASONABLE offer.
 
This Colt Python is as accurate as you can get! 
 
The timing is 100% on and has NO mechanical issues whatsoever. 
 
The pistol does have wear along both sides of the barrel and cylinder from being stored in a leather holster. There are also some very minor corrosion spots that can be easily cleaned up. Also. the grips are chipped but, can be easily replaced. This pistol is mechanically sound and, like a fat girl at closing time, will get the job done! 
 
I bought this pistol thinking that I would be allowed to use it at an upcoming Range Master School only to find out later that I could only use up to a 4"" pistol.
 
I am open to trades such as a POF 308, gun plus cash or, a multi-gun trade.
 
PLEASE do NOT offer me Hi-Point garbage, IO AK's or anything in that realm of ""guns that should've never been made"". 
 
No Hunting shotguns unless you have a truckload of them...seriously, a truckload. 
 
I am located in the New Orleans, La. area for FTF transactions or, I will ship on your dime to your local FFL.
 
Discreet PP, cash or USPS Money Order are the only accepted forms of payment.
 
Bill-of-Sale required along with ID showing at least age 21.

This is a great rifle but I already have a weapon for everything that I need to do and it is time for me to let this one go, it deserves an owner that will actually use it.

It has the 18 Inch Threaded Barrel (5/8-24 TPI), Moss Green Composite Stock, and TWO (2) 5-Round magazines.  I bought this rifle new a couple of months ago, mounted a scope, zeroed it at 100 yards, and then fired a few more for fun. This rifle has shot a grand total of 20 rounds. It is essentially brand new. Comes with the owner's manual but not in the original box. This rifle is so light weight that it kicks too hard for my wife and she doesn't want to shoot it, so here it is for a fat discount. The scope and rings shown in the photos are NOT included in the price, but may be negotiated for extra coin if the buyer wants me to leave it on. I'd kind of like to keep the scope because I like it, and won't think about parting with it for less than $150. Do your own research and let me know: it is a Weaver Grand Slam 3-10x40."
