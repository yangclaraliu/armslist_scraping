The mount and optic are not included with the rifle.  I am looking for a nice AK-47. I would like something like a Converted Saiga with extras or a ARSENAL or similar. In other words, my rifle is very nice and was over $1000 so please don't offer me a bare $500 AK...   If you have any questions just let me know. Thanks!"

The V11 Pro carries the new SLiM Rail 15.0 which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnified optics.  A newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb.  A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset.  Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle length gas system, equals shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue.    MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION  LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, probably a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so firm on price.  Lots of trade offers so far, but none I would rather have yet over the Henry, so sorry if I'm picky, I don't really need anything right now.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.  Could use several stripped AR lowers and would trade for 2,500rds. of Federal 5.56.

There are no visible import marks but there may be one under the grips, which I have never removed. Some shooters prefer the Brazilian model because the rear sight has a squared off cross section, rather than an arched one like the US 1917, and has a better sight picture. It is chambered for the venerable 45 ACP cartridge utilizing moon clips. One can also fire it without clips as the cylinder has a shoulder for head space. Thank you for your interest.

The BEAST fires as true today as she did when I bought her back in 1986. A little history of this amazing weapon:The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated mechanism normally found in rifles, as opposed to the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. The pistol is fired by a single action hammer, and has a manual safety switch on the slide. The ambidextrous safety switch rotates a drum mechanism which sits over the firing pin, causing the firing pin to lock in, which prevents it from moving forward and reduces the possibility of the gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, pulling the trigger releases the hammer to fall downward, hitting the firing pin and causing the chambered round to discharge."
