Product Description
The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gun making expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Remington's Exclusive ArmorLokt process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3-1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built- in. Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18-1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail."

$1,700 firm in cash.I might consider trades if it's a good deal as I don't need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.
A few things I would not mind having more of right now would be, a Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Last one I picked-up was the PX4 model new for $600 and came with five mags.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it, let me know if it has extra mags, the capacity, if it has an upgraded trigger etc.  Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts kits without trigger parts, nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers to help with a deal, but I have a plenty, so not in need.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe nice scopes and 1x Aimpoint and Eotechs for future projects along with nice magnifiers.Ftf in the Dallas area or will ship insured for $40 more and must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

MSRP: $1479.00Target Shooting version, featuring a new standard in competition. Different grips size and finish available for maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric caracteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2""to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to repare to fire.

Another is a boutique guitar made by a small company in Florida called Fool; this model is the Fool Ignatz, with a distinctive hot rod stripe down its mahogany body. The third is a 3/4-size Takamine acoustic. One amp is a Line 6 combo amp. The other consists of an Orange Micro Terror head and two small cabinets; the full stack won't even reach your waist, but it'll blow your ears out. Two of the ukuleles are expensive, solid wood Lanikai models; the other is a less expensive Oscar Schmidt OU-4. The bass pedals are pricey ones by Crush.

Oh, I also have an old, powered pedal board and about nine pedals, including a like new Dunlop Crybaby From Hell wah and an Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail.

Maybe even an AR-15.My stuff is also for sale if you'd prefer a cash deal. Drop me a line, and we can discuss prices. One guitar is a 2014 orange Ibanez hollow-body. Another is a boutique guitar made by a small company in Florida called Fool; this model is the Fool Ignatz, with a distinctive hot rod stripe down its mahogany body. The third is a 3/4-size Takamine acoustic. One amp is a Line 6 combo amp. The other consists of an Orange Micro Terror head and two small cabinets; the full stack won't even reach your waist, but it'll blow your ears out. Two of the ukuleles are expensive, solid wood Lanikai models; the other is a less expensive Oscar Schmidt OU-4. The bass pedals are pricey ones by Crush. All of the above are like new, as I can't actually play any instruments. Oh, I also have an old, powered pedal board and about nine pedals, including a like new Dunlop Crybaby From Hell wah and an Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail. Come to think of it, I also have African drums: a djembe, a set of congas and a 4 1/2-foot-tall ngoma. I'm sure we can package things together to make a fair trade. Please do not flag my post, as someone did earlier. You can't mention guns on Craigslist, so this is about the only place for me to try to arrange a swap. I'm not a dealer; I'm just an obsessive collector with a short attention span, so I'm emptying my house of musical stuff. I'm a real guy paying a real mortgage in Edmond. I don't put my phone number in public ads, but if you email me I'll be happy to provide it."

Hate to get rid of it but I have my eye on the 229 combat so this is on the chopping block since it just sits in the safe. $800 is my bottom dollar and is a great deal on this firearm. You won't find it cheaper. So please don't ask what my bottom dollar is or if I'd take $xxx. You're just wasting both of our time. All laws apply, CHP or PPP required and Bill of Sale."
