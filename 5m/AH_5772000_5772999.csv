S&W cartridge. Different versions of the Sub-2000 rifle will accept most double column handgun magazines. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the Sub-2000 rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25x7 inches for ease of storage. The polymer of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel. Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the Sub-2000 forend for mounting compatible accessories. The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-Lok accessories. The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter's comfort. Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position. The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25"" wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories. The Sub-2000 features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into the cutout on the receiver. The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The thread protector on the Sub-2000 is removable, if the shooter desires to replace the thread protector with a compatible accessory for the 1/2""-28 threads. The Sub-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools. The 9mm Sub-2000 can be configured in the following magazine types: G17, G19, S&W59, BerettA92, Sig226.

This two-piece, free-floating rail system allows the mounting of devices like a M203 grenade launcher without influencing the barrels harmonics, eliminating problems like wandering point of impact that plagued other mounting designs. The two-piece design also allows for partial disassembly of the rail to aid in cleaning around barrel without completely removing the entire rail system. The weight of anything attached to the RISII rail system is fully supported by a sturdy bolt-up system, using 6 grade 8 bolts, leaving the barrel completely free floating for best possible accuracy and dependability. The M4A1 features a 14.5” Cold Hammer Forged M4 Profile barrel with a permanently attached Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor to meet the NFA required 16” length.

Send it along...I'll consider...but this is a rifle that if you buy and keep it in it's present condition, it'll continue to appreciate. Put out in the 1970s, the rifle was way ahead of its time. Single shot rifles had not yet come into vogue and the cost was 3 times plus back then of a Ruger #1... Sooo, it never established a market and now it's a shootable collectible.   Rob US Army (Ret)"

Different versions of the Sub-2000 rifle will accept most double column handgun magazines. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the Sub-2000 rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25x7 inches for ease of storage. The polymer of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel. Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the Sub-2000 forend for mounting compatible accessories. The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-Lok accessories. The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter's comfort. Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position. The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25"" wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories. The Sub-2000 features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into cutout on the receiver. The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The thread protector on the Sub-2000 is removable, if the shooter desires to replace the thread protector with a compatible accessory for the 9/16""-24 thread. The Sub-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools. The .40 Sub-2000 can be configured in the following magazine types: G22, G23, Beretta96, S&W4006, Sig226.

This is a rifle that if you buy and maintain in its present condition, it'll continue to appreciate. Put out in the 1970s, the rifle was way ahead of its time.

The Tactical Grade ""Flat Faced"" Trigger closely replicates the feel of a 1911 trigger. Our Tactical Grade Glock Trigger has been thoroughly tested to insure reliability, consistency, and uniformity of weight. You will immediately notice the difference in your shooting performance after installation. The trigger face is totally and geometrically flat:  Look at all the match rifles used to set combat rifle marksmanship records.  They all use flat triggers.  Flat triggers are totally flat and straight, not just ""square faced"" curved triggers.  ""Flat and straight"" triggers improve your mechanical leverage and allow you to consistently place your shooting finger in the most advantageous location for you.  Additionally, these triggers maintain a more consistent feeling trigger regardless of where on that trigger your finger is placed. The trigger safety is much wider than an OEM unit, allowing you to quickly place your finger in the optimal firing position via a tactile index and thus build improved consistency and accuracy via smooth operation through the entire length of pull.  Reduced pre-travel and crisp reset improves the shooter’s ability to place follow up shots with speed and accuracy.

First, this is a work truck and as such it looks like a work truck. It has typical rocker panel rust, dents, dings things like that. Second, it is going to need some work down the road. The head gasket is starting to leak. Right now it runs just fine. I just drove it to ct and back with no problems. You just have to watch your heat and coolant levels. It's an older truck so you have to watch your fluid levels. Now that is out of the way, this is a great truck but I have outgrown it and need something bigger. Both the bronco and the trailer have clean Indiana titles. This year I have replaced the following parts:starteralternatorbatteryrear brake linesdistributer capwires plugstires (upgraded the spare to full size as well)oil always changed with mobile 1 synthetic high mileage. The good:114k mileslots of new partsnew(ish) tiresfull size sparethe bad:head gasket needs to be addressed soonone of the hub locks needs to be replaced. Otherwise the 4x4 is fine. It has a few quirky little electrical things like the cruise control doesn't work, power locks are odd. Things to be expected with an old work truck. I I will only do a trade with someone from Indiana as I am and a fire arm trade would be illegal otherwise. I am interested in ammo and guns in common calibers. Cash is king but will entertain trades or cash/trades. Cash price $1600. Trade value $1800."

The SP5K is designed and manufactured to meet the definition of a civilian pistol and marks the return of the roller delayed blowback system to an HK commercial product. This operating system is legendary in its accuracy and relability. Originally developed on the Heckler & Koch G3 rifle, it has been used on several HK firearms. The SP5K retains many of the critical features of the MP5, including its precision mahcined components and attention-to-detail quality. The SP5K is manufactured completely in Heckler & Koch's Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The SP5K is a safe, robust, ergonomic large frame handgun. For more comfortable shooting, the SP5K is equipped with an elastic ""bungee"" sling. The sling is easily installed by snapping it onto the sling swivel hardware located on the rear of the receiver. Using the sling makes firing the SP5K more stable and reduces fatigue. The overall length of the SP5K is approximately 14"" - slightly longer than an MP5K - due to its unique handguard. The SP5K handguard is designed with special ergonomic and safety features to protect the shooter's hand and provide a comfortable and stable grip. Desite its size, the SP5K is well suited for sporting use. Using the proven roller delayed blowback system; the SP5K's inherent accuracy makes it an excellent choice for target shooting and an ideal home security arm. And a wide variety of accessories can be added to increase its functionality. A Picatinny rail scope mount is attached to the upper receiver and allows for optional sights to be easily mounted. Covered by Heckler & Koch's limited lifetime warranty, the HK SP5K is a faithful rendering of the iconic MP5K as a semi-automatic pistol.
