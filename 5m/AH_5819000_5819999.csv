Undrilled, Untapped receiver.  Looks like an old re-blue.  Strong lands in barrel with some minor issues in some of the groove areas, but might clean up with a few rounds through it.  Very shiny otherwise. Firing pin in good shape and bolt pulls back and locks as it should, closes and locks when the bolt release is tripped. The safety/trigger/hammer seem to work just fine.  Shotgun type butt with original Remington marked pad.  Wood stock has been refinished.  Rear sight is missing, but it still has the sight screws.  Tang, receiver and forearm metal all have  matching numbers and it is 1915 production!  I have not yet fired this rifle.  I would recommend disassembly and inspection by someone who is knowledgeable about the model 8's, and who knows how to take one of these down (and knows how to put it together properly too) prior to firing, as it is over 100 years old, and fresh from a farm auction. It's complicated enough so I'm not going to try it! If you have a nice original .30 or .32, you could use the innards from this one to make yours a caliber that you can actually get ammo for!See it in person in Janesville.  $425Additional pictures available upon request."
