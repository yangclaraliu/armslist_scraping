The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Lightweight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The V9 Lightweight is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip and is finished with Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™.

The Optima-Bore, Optima-Choke barrels are light-weight and place the shotgun’s point of balance right at the hinge-pin, meaning lively feel in the hands and natural point ability. And with its select-walnut stock and tasteful scroll engraving, the Silver Pigeon I Sporting won’t fail to turn heads at the range, also thanks to its unmistakable Beretta looks. At the heart of the Silver Pigeon I Sporting is the legendary 686 action, a long-standing favorite among competition shooters and hunters.The 686 receiver vault-like locking strength while keeping the profile considerably lower. The advantage is that the eye of the shooter is a lot closer to the plane of his supporting hand: considerably better swing and hand-eye coordination, more targets."

I bought one this at Centerfire Systems and it was one of the last ones left and it cost me $659.99 before taxes.  Due to military contract requests from Romania these Wasrs are going to be very scarce for the next few years and the price is going up on them once again.  I added Romanian donkey dong wood grips that cost me $45.  I also added a Romanian metal side folder that cost me $100.  I also added a Romanian Bakelite grip but it was only $6, so I'm not worried about that much.  With the furniture I added I have right at $850 in this gun.  I am only asking $650 cash.  I am also looking for trades and my trade value will be closer to what I have in the rifle. Cash is most desirable right now though.  The rifle will come in the box with the manual and one 30 round steel mag.  Email me if interested."

It is built around the best-in-class 686 action, which is compact and low-profile while being extremely strong. The Optima-Bore, Optima-Choke barrels are light-weight and place the shotgun’s point of balance right at the hinge-pin, meaning lively feel in the hands and natural point ability. And with its select-walnut stock and tasteful scroll engraving, the Silver Pigeon I Sporting won’t fail to turn heads at the range, also thanks to its unmistakable Beretta looks. At the heart of the Silver Pigeon I Sporting is the legendary 686 action, a long-standing favorite among competition shooters and hunters.The 686 receiver vault-like locking strength while keeping the profile considerably lower. The advantage is that the eye of the shooter is a lot closer to the plane of his supporting hand: considerably better swing and hand-eye coordination, more targets. Another advantage of the Silver Pigeon action is the fact that the locking lugs are conical. As the number of shots fired goes into the five digits, the receiver will still lock up positively: the conical lugs merely “self-adjust” by setting themselves slightly deeper into the barrel unit, without any compromise on strength. This means that the Silver Pigeon Sporting is a shotgun that will stand up to years of enjoyment and can be passed down from generation to generation. The oil-finished stock sports a beautiful and crisp checkering pattern, and the schnabel fore-end adds to the classic flavor of this over-under. The scroll-engraved receiver is a functional work of art in itself, with its interesting geometry blending perfectly with the stock and contributing to the gun’s graceful lines. This is a shotgun that has all the elements of a treasured heirloom, without the price-tag to match. This is a excellent shooter with almost perfect feel when throwing it up to shoot and will be a excellent addition to your collection or for the more serious shooter. If you have any questions feel free to call or E-mail us."

NOTE: You must be at least 21 years old and have a valid AZ ID to purchase this item. Description from Taurus In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise. Tax not included in price. Dealer sale. Price is Firm, no trades. Credit cards accepted (No fee).

All 4 plates have had all edges and corners rounded so they don't cut away at your plate carrier, and all 4 plates have been Line-X Coated for Spall/Frag mitigation. These are Stand-Alone plates cut from Certified Level III Mil-Spec MIL-A46100 Armor Plate which has been tested to Military Specs. This is the best of the best armor plate that you can buy.
