Memory storage has been expanded 500% from 220 velocities to over 1,000 stored velocities. Stored string size can range from a single velocity up to 500 velocities and up to 500 different strings. Expanded digital chip design now gives the CED M2 the ability of reading velocities at much lower light levels. On clear days, this means the ability to chronograph from early morning till almost sunset.A new keypad has been designed in calculator-style layout. In fact, we have added a built-in calculator as well. Further, the CED M2 now includes a “Hi-Average” function which provides “one touch” calculation of the average of the three highest velocities in a string. This new function is ideal for calculating Power Factor at IPSC & IDPA matches. With the new built-in calculator, the results are easy and fast! In addition, the CED M2 Chronograph adds even more new features like Single function string removal, 2 ft. FOLDING mounting bracket for ALL uses, the ability to recall specific strings from memory or to remove specific strings from memory, and a new USB interface. Now it is easier than ever to connect your chronograph to your PC and download your saved data into the newly designed and updated CED Data Collector software program.The CED M2 Chronograph goes far beyond the competition with advanced custom features including: • Sleek, lightweight, and compact design • Advanced software & digital circuitry = extremely fast performance! • Over 1000 shot capacity with up to 500 string permanent memory • Records velocities from 50 fps to 7,000 fps • High, Low, Average, & Hi-Average velocity readings • Extreme Spread & Standard Deviation • Edit & Omit functions • Built-in Calculator • IPSC / IDPA Power Factor computation Function • New Data Collector Software program included • Meter or feet recording • 10X Mode – records slower velocities in decimeters • Voice Chip technology – Results can be heard as well as seen • On / Off control, with no-memory loss ""Auto-Shut Down"" mode • PC Downloads - USB interface for fast, software downloads of stored data • New Data Collector Software program included • Low battery warning indicator • Back-up battery storage • 9-Volt battery operation (not included) • Operating Temperature range (0c to +50c)Set includes: Main CPU Unit with keypad, two Sensors, Daylight Sun diffuser screens, 2 ft. mounting bracket, USB cable, Data Collector software, and instruction manual.  The tripod and table mount plate are NOT included in the set,Connectivity for PC'sWith the included USB cable and free CED USB Data Collector Utility you can download velocities directly to your personal computer. Simply plug the M2 Chronograph directly into a USB port, click a software button and in a few seconds the velocities stored in the M2's memory are downloaded so you can save, print or edit the information.The largest custom LCD display in the industry providing all relative information at a single glance. 1 Full function custom display 2 Current Velocity 3 No. of shots recorded in string 4 Screen setting distance in feet or meter measurement 5 Low Battery Warning 6 Current function in use 7 Error warning indicatorCustom Key pad - No toggling required with ""easy to read"" format and moisture resistant display. • One piece rubber key pad display • Easy to read function format   Dual Lens Sky screen Sensors, Diffuser Screens, and 2 ft. foldable (tripod threaded) Mounting Bracket included! • Heavy duty 5 inch wide Screens • Large shooting area • Custom dual lens design with built-in pressure plate adjustment • 20 ft.

It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO features external adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without the caps. Mounting bosses are integrated into the housing by the eyepiece to allow the easy addition of a Trijicon RMR® (not included.) 1700 retail price"

Will come in its case with two 15 round magazines, and it has Dawson precision night sights (blacked out steel rear,tritium front post).  At some point this pistol's original slide and barrel were swapped out for a replacement (replacement slide and barrel have matching serials).  I do not know why, but this was presumably done by the factory, and it has been 100% reliable for me.  Otherwise gun is in great shape, the PPQ has hands down the best factory striker fired trigger on the market.I don't shoot 9mm much so I'm primarily looking for trades.  Would be most interested in the same gun in 40, or a M&P40 or G23.  Would also be interested in a mid size 45 like an M&P45c, or revolvers in 357 or 38 special (No snubs and S&W or Ruger only for revolvers).If you'd rather buy I'll sell it for $400.  For an extra $30 I can include an Alien Gear iwb holster.If interested feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3, texts are best as I may not be able to respond until this afternoon. Thanks!"
