It's a full size 1911 with 5"" cold hammer forged barrel. The pistol is in excellent condition as I've put only about 50 rounds through it. Awesome entry-level 1911, the quality, fit and finish is great for the price. You can see in the photos that the finish is in excellent, almost new condition, very little wear on the gun at all. This model has a black parkerized finish and features Turkish walnut grips. These are made in Turkey by Tisas under ISO9001 standards. The A2 Enhanced model includes a tactical rail for lights or lasers and also includes a skeletonized hammer and trigger. I bought this as my first, entry level 1911 and planned to keep it a while, but I had a chance to move up to a model I wanted even more, so I'm selling this to fund that purchase. If I didn't need the cash for the next purchase, I'd hold on to this. It shoots very smoothly and the 3-dot sights are right on the money. It's more accurate in my hands than jsut about any other gun I own, and has been 100% reliable. For the price, it's really hard to beat. These guns are rate 4.8 out of 5 stars on Bud's - with 90% of reviewers giving them a full 5 star rating. To sweeten the deal, I'm adding a second 8-round magazine and 50 rounds of .45acp to get you started. Included are the gun, the original hard case/cleaning brush, (2) magazines (I'm including one spare) and (50) rounds of .45acp (factory loads, but loose, leftover from a class I took). Price is $425, Firm, and that includes the transfer/BGC fee if we used my preferred FFL: Tigard Pawn 4 More. These guns are selling new for $450 without the transfer fee, extra mag or ammo. if you're interested, use the ""contact seller"" button to reach me."
