The scope is a 3-9X40 and has a range finder that illuminates either green or red. The scope also has 2 side rails. A holographic sight is included for close range. I have a flashlight mounted to the side with a pressure switch. The stock is a pistol grip 6 position ATI. AND there is a 2 pound trigger job. The rifle itself is worth $1500. Comes with 2 clips, sling, the original stock and iron sights, and a box of ammo.Next is a 1983 Polaris Indy and VERY clean. Brand new suspension. The engine in it right now is a 488 (rebuilt), but I also have a rebuilt 440 to go with it. I added an extra vent to keep the 488 cold, and it has a dual carb synchronizing guage that I pulled out of an old airplane. There is a little wear and tear on the seat but that is all that is wrong with it. Comes with a cover.E-mail for more pictures"

It originally had a black plastic hand guard, that I was able to replace with a wood hand guard that was listed as being used in the ""Balkan wars"". Dunno how true it is, don't particularly care, but the wood already had a grove knocked where the underfolder stock met the wood(which I thought was cool and lucky, because that meant it came off an underfolder, and the previous owner had scorched the knock to harden the spot and prevent any damage to the stock. It comes with 16 misc 30 round mags(14 are currently loaded) a drum magazine(empty) and 2 ammo cans pretty full of ammo(I do not have a full count but there's got to be close to 600-800 rounds of steel case in one can pause a smaller can that has 400-500 Russian milsurp ammo and the 420 rounds loaded in mags).i am located in Vancouver WA, can travel a reasonable distance to meet, and this will require an ffl transfer. if you got what I want, I will pay the transfer feeWill trade for:looking for ACOG TA31 or cash.

804,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5412804,For Sale/Trade:  Decoding armslist,"anywhere, Kentucky, United States",$ 0,"Listed On: Saturday, April 23, 2016",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I've been selling, buying, and trading guns on armslist for a long time. In the last few years things have gotten really crazy so for the newer shooters I feel compelled to decode many of the common phrases and redoric used on armslist to help you guys not get bent over a hard dry one get broke off where youd rather not have it happen.  Nearly every gun listed on here has only had 10-60 rounds fired to ""test function"". Because the professionals that built it just simply cant be trusted and the back woods half wit is much more reliable than people who. Got a job with a major gun manufacturer to judge how a gun preforms. In other words, I fired 500 rounds and couldnt hit the broad side of a barn standing inside it. Ask yourself this question, who buys a brand new gun, shoots 20 rounds and puts it up for sale? The guy who cant shoot or bought a defective gun from a shady dealer who wont return it, thats who.  Next up. I have a brand new in the box gun for $50 less than retail. Yeah i bet you do. Right now the market is flooded from fear buyers. So how do big companies sell their guns? They list their guns with an MSRP of a few hundred dollars more on their web page than they actually sell for in the gun store so stupid sheeple think ""wow what a great deal. I cant pass this up"". Now bubba buys it and trys to flip it for meth money to some newbie who dosent know any better, and bubba is wrighting me hate mail as you read this. Well fuck you bubba thats called a straw purchase and its highly illeagle. And my personal favorite. I know what i have and what its worth. Maybe you should get aff you fat lazy ass and see what that gun sells for new today because the scare prices are over. AR's for the most part dont cost $1200 dollars anymore. 300 new fly by night manufactures popped up in the las 6 months alone. Just because you havent heard the name before dosent make it a rare collectors item. Chances are its worthless junk thats backed by a company already out if business, thats why you cant find out shit about it on google. Lastly having a trade value higher than a sale value is nothing but sheer bullshit. If you dont want to trade then dont trade. This is how these fucktards keep on until they actually acuire something of value and then put gunbroker prices on it or try to auction it on a classified site like this. You know why they do that? Because they want top price without paying auction fees or they already tried and now they want their listing fee back on top of what the gun is actually worth. Want to cover your ass? You should because most of these snakes on here want a bite. Buy a gun traders guide. Yes the gun traders guide. Why that and not a blue book. Simple blue book is what you can insure a gun for, not its actual value, just like the blue book for cars. Here comes more hate mail. Do your research guys, dont let the guy selling you something give you the ""facts"". Hit the gun stores, dont be in a rush, guns will be here tomorrow. Dont let fear drive you to a hasty buy. Obama has yet to make even one inch of progress in stopping gun sales, all he has done is promote it and the nasty face of greed that has taken over armslist."

The greatest demand is for the smallest, lightest gun available, but this has drawbacks. Generally these guns are difficult to shoot well, lack stopping power and recoil can be a problem. If you can’t hit or stop what you are shooting at, what good is the handgun? We can understand all of these concerns as we face them every day as well. We wanted to give our customers the smallest, lightest gun that we could without sacrificing accuracy, dependability and stopping power.Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern.If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed.
