The G36 is a carry gun shooting the .45 ACP pistol cartridge, a standard military round with proven knock down power. The GLOCK G36 Slimline has a frame made out of the same high-strength polymer as other full-sized GLOCK semi-automatic pistols, though it uses a single stack magazine, greatly reducing the width of the grip. The slide's internal and external dimensions were also modified to reduce the pistol's weight, and the muzzle end of the slide is tapered to aid in quick one-hand re-holstering. The frame has checkering on the front and back straps, providing a non-slip surface, and finger grooves on the front strap and a finger rest on the front of the trigger guard aid in fire control. The Safe-Action trigger system makes shooting in high-stressed situations infallible. The milled steel slide and the barrel are treated with matte black Tenifer finish for extreme resistance to wear and corrosion. The Tenifer treated steel and polymer frame make the pistol impervious to corrosion caused by perspiration and humidity when carried close to the body. A white-dot front sight and a white-bracket rear sight provide rapid acquisition in dim lighting situations. All GLOCK pistols fieldstrip easily without the use of tools. The GLOCK G36 Semi-Auto Pistol is a reliable, easy to maintain firearm that's comfortable to carry all day. The G36 SF comes with 2 single-stack, 6-round magazines."

This is their original crescent sword model. Pretty rare as it is a pre-fire model, as confirmed by Starfire. It's no longer made in this profile. No nicks on the blade at all. This was made for full contact stage performance and sparring. If you bash real swords together, you're gonna end up chipping or breaking them, not so with this. The steel was perfectly heat treated and tempered so the blade can bend quite a bit and still return to original shape like a real sword should. The heavy blade is thick to allow for blade on blade action without risk of breaking. The current production model goes for $300. Letting this go for $150 with original scabbard and frog. You're getting a quality blade for the money."

This was bought in the last batch from Poland that came with the bakelite-style communist red furniture. The gun features a 9.5"" barrel with an overall length of 21"". Radom, the state arsenal of Poland, now has a large government export contract and their output for the civilian export market has dropped substantially. The few that you do see available for sale these days are almost always with civilian black furniture. These are very high quality AKs and are perfect to be used as a pistol or with a SIG brace. It may also be turned into a short barreled rifle (SBR) [with ATF paperwork of course] and the 7.62x39mm round is perfect for an SBR as less velocity is lost at short barrel length than a 5.56x45mm of same barrel length.Gun comes as pictured. If you would like, a 30 round steel surplus magazine can be included for an extra $20.Not interested in trades at this time."

It has a 22"" barrel, a four-round magazine and is available in wood and durable synthetic models. All of the centerfire pumps feature quick-release magazines and Remington s rotary bolt lock-up design for exceptional strength, safety and reliability. You can't find a big-game rifle with a better combination of practical shooting features: twin action bars provide slick, smooth operation for rapid repeat shots; a quick-release, drop-out four-round magazine that loads and unloads instantly; and a free-floated barrel that matches the accuracy of the best bolt guns. An ideal cross-over rifle for pump-gun wingshooters. A Monte Carlo walnut stock with a satin finish is standard. An optional high-gloss finished stock available in 270 Win. and 30-06 calibers. We've taken the world's most popular pump-action deer gun and given it the extra toughness and weather resistance of a fiberglass-reinforced synthetic stock and fore-end. Metal work and stock have a black matte non-reflective finish, and the butt stock is furnished with a black rubber recoil pad.

Bought for wife, but she won’t even shoot it, preferring to keep her Shield with Crimson Trace laser as her EDC.The textured grip is excellent (I’d like to see it on other pistols!); three dot sights, but front sight is a big orange dot, very easy to pick up and put on target. Barrel is 3.2” long, and dimensions are: 6.2”L x 4.6”H x 0.96”W (height is 5.2” with the 80-rd mag and extension). It weighs 22 ounces (3 oz. more than the Shield), which helps with felt recoil, which is mild for a subcompact. Fired 175 rounds of ball ammo and 25 rounds of Hornady JHP 124-grain, with zero issues. I’m just not a striker-fired guy, so this excellent little carry gun is available. No shipping, no trades; will meet in/near Chattanooga area."
