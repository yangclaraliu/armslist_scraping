REDACTED
Sting 'em with the 17 Hornet Loaded with Hornady's popular V-Max polymer tipped bullet, Superformance Varmint ammunition is filled with proprietary propellants that increase the velocity ratings 100 to 200 feet per second compared to other popular brands. Because there is no increase in pressure, regardless of the caliber, there is no increase in felt recoil but there IS an increase in efficiency and high speed performance. Plus, Superformance Varmint loads are versatile and will perform flawlessly in all rifles, including semi-autos. Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and helps to stabilize the bullet in flight. It also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The copper jacket provides the necessary bearing surface for maximum stability out of the barrel, and the jacket is built to withstand the fast twist rates of the most advanced varmint rifles."

It also has many upgrades installed with it as well. It has a 6-position collapsible stock with a solid inch of rubberized ATI Scorpion butt-stock padding to absorb all that nasty 12gauge recoil impact from bruising your shoulder, as well as an adjustable cheek-rest on top of the stock with a layer of ATI padding on top also for comfort. Also has a sling swivel built in for attachments of any shoulder slings or straps! However if your choice is more towards a compact solution, then this tactical shotgun is your 2in1 solution! If you're not using the full-lengthed size shotgun with the shoulder stock, then it is easily collapsed to the side with one single push of a button, and you now have your compact-sized 12gauge! The pistol grip is also completely rubberized around the back with solid finger grooves that also ensure minimal recoil and shock-proof, as well ATI friction layers around the grip to avoid any slipping or loose grips due to rainy weather, sweat, or any other adverse conditions that could effect the traction of your grip! The fore-end handguard is also ATI traction controlled for quality gripping, as well as dual 4-slotted ribbed venting on both the front and back. Also included with the fore-end is a double-sided quadrail on both the right and the left sides that allows for attachments of any accessories such as lights, lasers, etc.. Other than being completely factory Mossberg 500 Tactical, it has been upgraded with ALL matching ATI accessories (Advanced Tactical Imports) as I have detailed up above.. It has a 6-shot capacity tube and has been fired very rarely since being new (exactly 72 shells ever fired thru it in total) and then has just sat in my safe ever since.. I am a private seller so no forms or background checks are required like with FFL dealers, as well as no tax either, however a bill of sale for MS residents at least 18years of age or older can be filled out if necessary. I am located in the Oxford area and prefer a FTF meeting around the Oxford area, yet I may be willing to travel if the distance is not too far.. Gander Mountain had this for sale at $527dollars BEFORE tax and BEFORE any of the matching ATI-tactical collapsible stock/ATI-tactical pistol grip/and ATI-tactical forend handguard PLUS other upgrades included like Scorpion butt-pad on stock, padded cheek-rest, forend double-rail attachments on each side of handguard, etc.. Also, I have kept ALL of the extra and spare parts and pieces, as well as extra accessories, and ALL of the paperwork and instructions are also included as well! So all in all, easily over $700dollars of value in this Tactical 12gauge Mossberg shotgun, however I am struggling with bills and car payments so am willing to sell to the FIRST $400cash in or around the Oxford area!"

Caliber:   9 mm
Condition: like new
Affordable protection made in the USA ..... that’s a Hi Point. One the best values for the money!
How can a manufacturer make a gun in the United States for such a low price? Simple design, easy manufacture, and inexpensive materials.   A Hi Point is elegant in its design simplicity. They’re blowback-operated, so there is no “lock up” to get compromised by a glob of mud.  Mechanically, there’s just not that much that can break. Read some of the reports on the testing of this gun.  
This gun relies on the weight of the slide to keep the gun closed during firing. When the slide is closed, it simply sits against the back of the cartridge when it goes off.  The slide moves backward from the blowback pressure of the cartridge, and is returned forward by a return spring.  The barrel is pinned to the frame so it doesn’t even move.  So as long as the slide can move backward and fully forward, a Hi Point cycles.   It won’t win a beauty contest, but it works!"

This is the first setup I've had that everything has survived and thrived. The coral is growing way too fast and I haven't spent the time removing the excess. There are at least 7 varieties of coral. There's a Blue Regal tang, a yellow Hawaiian tang, a purple tang, a dwarf Angel, a pepermint shrimp, a serpent star, an abalone, breeding snails everywhere, lots of hermit crabs, several bright blue damsels and blue/yellow damsels.It has a HUGE carpet anemone and 2 yellow stripe maroon clown fish that are a breading pair and produce about 200 eggs every 10 days in case anyone is interested in breading clownfish, I would sell or trade just the anemone mounted on a huge piece of live rock and breeding pair of clowns for $400. You'd get way more than $400 off the first set of babies you raise, but you'll need a separate setup as the babies wont make it around the other fish.Also has other circulation pumps, timers, test kits, nutrients, supplies, cleaning vacuum, about 9 gallons of salt that will last 1 year of water changes, etc etc etc. If you've ever had a reef tank and are thinking about doing it again, this is the way to go."

It's the shorter barrelled version, 20"" I believe. Nice bore, very nice overall condition, very handy and fun to shoot, and disassembles very easily for storage/transport. One issue with the gun - I replaced the firing pins with titanium firing pins and have had some light primer strikes since then. Regular pins will fix the problem (I don't have the old ones - one was sticking, hence the replacement). I'm not really interested in doing the legwork on that, so the gun is priced around $200 cheaper than you see most of these going for.  Price is $250 firm.     I'm in Oak Harbor, but I can meet in between Mt.

The gun is in very good condition. The compact comes with a 10 round magazine and a 15 round magazine. The sub compact comes with one 15 round magazine. All these magazines fit a Sig P320. The gun will come with the original box that came with the lock and the case for the sub compact xchange kit. Contact me at REDACTED. Text is okay. Must go through a background check for private transfer!

Most people use a drill press with a cross vise to mill out the product, many folks have drill presses sitting in their garages, or can find someone who has one available to borrow. The frame accepts Glock17 9mm slides, as well as the Glock 40 caliber slide. The Smith and Wesson 40cal slide is also compatible with the Sig357 barrel configuration, which essentially gives you 3 different calibers to choose from.Unlike the Glock, this frame includes a uniquely extended beaver-tail, and most notably a super tactical 1911 pistol grip rather than the standard Glock styled pistol grip. Even better, this pistol grip includes a built in flared magwell for speed loading. This feature will surely be a favorite among competition shooters who require speed and accuracy.Finally, the areas that need to be milled out to complete this project include:The barrel bridgeThe top rails of the receiverThe slide guide railsOnce completed, you insert the custom locking block which comes with the kit, it provides additional metallic rails up front.Polymer80.com provides the support on this project, please do not contact LWD for support. They can be reached at Support@Polymer80.comFAQ:What generation Glock products is the frame compatible with? What are the rails made out of?This product is compatible with Gen3 3-pin components for Glock17, 22, 24, 31, 34 & 35. The system comes with a combination front rail and locking block made from steel. Are the rails polymer or metal? Front Rails are metal, rear rails will need to be milled from existing polymer. (Similar design to the 100% Ruger Pistols)?Is this product ATF approved? Yes, see the attached documentation (top left of page)What is the warranty on the PF940 80% Polymer Pistol Frame?Lifetime Warranty against any manufacturer's defect.How difficult will this product be to complete and do I need a drill press?The difficulty level is low to medium, it does require mechanical aptitude, a drill press and cross vice.Since the grip is angled like a 1911, is the pistol frame compatible with Glock mags?The magwell is engineered to accept Glock mags only. 1911 mags are not compatible.Where can I find completion parts for the pistol frame?We sell a complete kit depending on what caliber you are using. Click hereAre the pistol frames compatible with my Glock17 holster?The current Glock holsters are not compatible with our 80% Polymer Pistol Frame.
