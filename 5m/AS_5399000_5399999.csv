Not 100% perfect, but in great shape overall. This gun was manufactured in the 80's by Group Industries, a company that no longer exists. However Vector Arms (a quality, current production Uzi manufacturer) now builds their Uzi's using Group Industires' recievers. It's somewhat of an uncommon firearm in this part of the world but a very simple, reliable design. Israel has used Uzi's since the 1950'sThese semi auto Group Industries are pretty rare, and I am told that few were made in this green color. I am not sure of the exact round count but it's relatively low. This gun has the full size barrel and is chambered in 9mm. They also make barrels and bolts that allow you to shoot .45 acp or .22lr out of this gun.Comes with a sling and four magazine repair kits-(2) 25rd and (2) 32rd. I could throw in a little ammo for the right trade.I value this gun in the neighborhood of $1,200 but I could use the cash so I'll sell it for $1000. Research what these go for and you'll see that my price is more than reasonable. I'll consider trades too. If your trade is not worth what this gun is worth, let me know much cash you can add on top. I would trade for older Colt or S&W revolvers, 1911's, quality AK's (or cheaper AK/SKS's with cash), an M1 Garand, an M1a, FAL, or G3 configuration, a semi auto 7.62x54. Possibly open to other stuff too. US made tools, ammo, Ford big block parts.

373,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5399373,For Sale:  Antique Colt 45 Nedbuntline special,"Mt Juliet, Nashville, Tennessee","$ 1,595","Listed On: Sunday, June 19, 2016",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"One of the things Hollywood does well is create legends. And one of the most enduring to come out of the television Westerns of the 1950s and ’60s was the Buntline Special, a Colt Single Action Army with a 12"" barrel.  This elongated hogleg made its theatrical appearance in “The Life And Legend Of Wyatt Earp,” which aired on ABC from 1955 to 1961 and starred Hugh O’Brian, who carried it in a Bohlin-made double rig with a holster featuring an extended drop (necessary for the foot-long barrel to clear leather in a timely manner).  But the Colt Buntline wasn’t conjured up by a screenwriter. It was based in fact-sort of. Back in Earp’s day, Colt customers could order extra-long barrels at a dollar an inch for anything over 7½"". Approximately 31 such guns-with barrels ranging from 10"" to 16""-were produced from 1876 through 1884. However, in Stuart N. Lake’s book, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshall, upon which the TV series was based, he relates that five of these stretch-tubed SAAs were presented by dime novelist Edward Zane Carroll Judson, who used the pen name Ned Buntline, to Earp and four other Dodge City lawmen-Bat Masterson, Bill Tilghman, Charlie Bassett and Neal Brown-in 1876. Historically, it is doubtful this ever happened, but the story was too good to be ignored.  Just as the TV cowboy craze corralled Colt into reissuing the Single Action Army in 1955, in 1957 “Earpmania” caused the company to bring out a Buntline Special, which remained in the line until 1975, with 4,060 produced. Most were blued and case-hardened with rubber stocks but some had two-piece walnut grip panels and 65 were nickeled.  The guns were serial numbered in the same SA suffix range as standard second generation Peacemakers, but their 12"" barrels were stamped “Colt Buntline Special .45.” Buntlines produced through the late 1960s also had a three- or four-digit BB (Buntline Barrel) assembly number on the underside of their barrels. During the 1980s and ’90s many Buntlines were rebarreled, adding to their scarcity. Thus, like all Second Generation Colts, the Buntline has climbed in collectability.  This  Buntline is in 100 percent condition, with a barely discernable drag line on the cylinder and comes with a wooden case that slides out and 6 antique 45 bullets and a Ned bunt line plate.Call or text REDACTED"

Unlike conventional carbon-fiber stocks made from woven carbon fabric that often suffer from side-strike structural failures, the SSG Carbon's stock is made using the same ""chipped-carbon"" Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) construction used to create load-bearing structures in Formula 1 racecars and high-performance aircraft. The SSG Carbon's chipped-carbon flakes combine thermally with the binding agent to form the SMC fror a distinctive appearance to the stock, but like the spirals on the rifle's cold hammer-forged barrel, they aren't just there for looks. The carbon chips interlock with each other to create an unparalleled tension net that is superior to steel in every direction, yet weighing a fraction of either steel or aluminum.Due to the unique recoil absorption properties of its SMC technology, the SSG Carbon is surprisingly lightweight, and its recoil absorption is unmatched. Utilizing the same barreled action and muzzle brake as the famed SSG 08, the SSG Carbon utilizes a direct trigger, legendary for its crisp, clean and repeatable break. A detachable box magazine functions either as a constant-feed magazine or it can be placed in a second position that acts as a magazine cutoff to single-feed the rifle over the tip of a loaded magazine.The SSG Carbon is built on the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action with a unique 2+1 safety function that offers three settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The FIRE mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot, and the first level of SAFE mode disables the firing mechanism while allowing the bolt to be cycled. The second SAFE position locks the bolt, at which point the bolt can be pushed down against the stock, locking the firing pin and firing mechanism out of firing position, allowing safe transportation with a round in the chamber. Simply pressing the safety's release tab and rolling it forward returns the bolt to either the SAFE or the FIRE position.The stock of the SSG Carbon has multiple mounting points for sling attachments. It also features an adjustable cheek piece, an adjustable butt plate, rubber-wrapped pistol grip, and an integrated finely adjustable rear-elevation pod.

The GLOCK 30 Gen4 in the legendary .45 AUTO offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. The Gen4 design combining a shorter trigger reach with maximum capacity. The G30 Gen4 is an obvious choice for a go-to pistol for LE and personal protection enthusiasts alike. The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested that make GLOCK firearms famous! Safe Action system; durable exterior finish; cold hammer forged barrel; durability; reliability; light weight The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back strap) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size.The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK “Safe Action” Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. The smallest back strap is integrated in the GLOCK MBS Frame reducing the trigger distance of the standard size frame by 2 mm. The medium back strap is a 2 mm back strap offering equal size of a standard frame. The large back strap is a 4 mm back strap. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts.  Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.  Internally, the original recoil spring has been replaced with a dual recoil spring assembly. The dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces the recoil while simultaneously increasing the life cycle of the assembly. Length: 172 mm / 6.77 in. Width: 32.5 mm / 1.28 in.

Available in a choice of the widely used caliber sizes of .308 Winchester or 300 Winchester Magnum, this platform provides high-precision performance and proven reliability.The .308 Winchester magazine holds 10 rounds and is available in either a 23.6-inch Heavy Barrel version or a 20-inch heavy barrel compact version. Both options feature a muzzle brake as well as a durable synthetic stock with an adjustable length-of-pull-- via stackable buttplate inserts-- and an adjustable cheek piece.As in other Steyr high-performance bolt-action rifles, the SSG 04 is built on the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action with a unique 2+1 safety function that offers three settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The FIRE mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot, and the first level of SAFE mode disables the firing mechanism while allowing the bolt to be cycled. The second SAFE position locks the bolt, at which point the bolt can be pushed down against the stock, locking the firing pin and firing mechanism out of firing position, allowing safe transportation with a round in the chamber. Simply pressing the safety's release tab and rolling it forward returns the bolt to either the SAFE or the FIRE position. The receiver is topped with a Picatinny rail for optics mounting.Another feature in the SSG 04 is the 2-stage magazine securing mechanism that uses a first stage to lock the magazine in but allows the bolt to be operated without feeding rounds in the magazine, thereby providing the user with the options of dry-firing or loading individual rounds by hand while maintaining a full magazine at the ready. Simply pressing up on the bottom of the magazine seats it in the second stage, which is ready for auto-loading.The SSG 04 A1 is also available by special order. The SSG 04 A1 replaces the standard Picatinny rail with a shroud that is attached to the receiver and covers the barrel for the length of the forend. The shroud is topped with a full-length Picatinny rail, and two short rail segments are attached on the side of the shroud for mounting of accessories such as lights and or lasers.Model   SSG 04  Purpose  Long-Range Target Shooting Tactical  Manufacturer  Steyr Mannlicher GmbH Kleinraming, Austria  Importer  Steyr Arms, Inc Bessemer, AL USA  Operation  Bolt-action Repeating  Caliber  .308 Winchester  Magazine Type / Capacity  Polymer Double-Stack Detachable Box 10 Rounds  Action Material  25CrMo4 Steel  Barrel  23.6"" Cold Hammer-Forged Heavy Barrel  Rifling   4 Grooves 1:10 RH Twist  Sights  20-MOA Picatinny Rail  Finish  Mannox  Safety  3+1 Position Safety  Trigger Type  Single-Stage Direct  Pull Weight   3 lbs 8 oz (Adjustable)  Stock Material / Type  Reinforced Polymer  Length of Pull  14.25"" min.
