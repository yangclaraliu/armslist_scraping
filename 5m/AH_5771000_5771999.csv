Also has some amazing Milling on the slide making it extremely easy to rack the slide. Also this has to be one of the smoothest slide action pistols on the market the slide feels like it is running on ball bearings! It has been one hundred percent accurate with not a single failure I am looking for a worthy trade or sale I will take $300 cash for the closest offer to it but I will be honest I will not accept low-ball offers I am pretty firm on my price I would rather trade for a M&P Shield because I have 2 of these honor defense Honor Guard 9 millimeters and one of them has to go. Also it will come with a Pearce grip extension for the 7 round magazine also has an 8 round magazine. The firearm has a removable chassis if you ever want to put a brand new grip frame on it. Also you can use Glock 42 and 43 style sites giving you the option for fiber optics but honestly the stock sights ar orange in the front white in the back and you can rack the slide with the rear sight because it is a combat style sight. Overall review on this pistol is not one single failure or problem and for $300 cash money you will not go wrong I am willing to meet the buyer at the shooting range 48 s fire just to prove that. The gun comes with its original box along with everything that came with it. You will also receive a hard case to keep the pistol in to go with that and a pocket holster you will not find a gun in polymer with a better grip and with all the options given it is the most beefed-up carry pistol on the market you can text me at REDACTED to send pictures of your offers I am looking for guns of similar types I would accept a regular Smith & Wesson Shield even though it is a down trade because I have a Apex Freedom trigger I want to installed badly. Also would accept other Sub Compact single stack or double stack pistols for carry just want something different because I have two of these. This one has the cerakote slide and a polished chrome barrel that is plus P rated so yes you can use your high-powered hot loads! You will not find that on many carry pistols on the market.

This is the ultimate 9mm carry gun. Believe it or not this actually has a 3.5 barrel, even though it doesn't look like it. The entire barrel is set back in the slide thanks to its bullpup design. The Boberg uses a very unique claw design to pull rounds out of the back of the magazine and then push it forward into the chamber. It's a very cool design. If you're not familiar with the Boberg, Google it. This gun is smaller than a S&W J frame, yet holds an amazing 7+1 rounds of 9mm. Very few of these Bobergs were made but you can still get parts and service from Bond Arms because they bought Boberg and are re-releasing this model. These don't come up for sale very often. Don't miss your chance to own this beautiful piece. I bought it used and have not fired it. I don't know the round count before I got it but the internals look like new. Includes all paperwork from factory, original case and 2 factory mags. Due to this guns unique design it transfers the felt recoil much further back making it feel very light. Also this design has a extremely easy to pull back slide. Making loading the first round almost effortless. This is a great gun for those with recoil sensitivity or don't have the strength to work the slide on a regular semi auto. This could be a great carry gun for someone. I just have my eye on something else right now and need to come up with the funds. And this one just sits in the safe so time for it to find a new home. Hopefully going to someone who will actually use it. I very much prefer all cash but I will consider half trade of another gun plus half in cash. I would only consider a full trade if it's something I absolutely had to have and it was heavily in my favor. $900 cash. Foid, ISP check and wait period required. Located in St CharlesText me REDACTEDWilling to ship at buyers expense."

Look at the pictures here, and 15 more detailed pictures in the Photobucket link. Just copy/paste the link to your browser:   http://s1040.photobucket.com/user/milsurp762x39/library/1953%20Izhevsk%20SKS?sort=3&page=1
 
 This Russian SKS made in 1953 is FFL-03 (C&R) eligible, so I can ship directly to the address listed on your FFL if you have an FFL-03 or better. I must have a copy of your FFL, emailed picture is fine.  If not, make sure your FFL-01 will take a firearm from an FFL-03 holder (me). If you're buying in state ""face-to-face"" I have a reliable FFL in my area that I usually work with for transfers, or I will use an FFL of your choosing. Buyer pays transfer fee. For a face-to-face (through an FFL, as required in WA) transaction I will accept cash or a USPS MO. For shipping I require a USPS MO for the purchase price plus insured shipping. $40 flat fee for insured shipping to the lower 48 states or Alaska. Actual shipping cost to Hawaii. Additional $10 + any extra fees I incur for shipping to CA.  Sorry, I just don't know CA law so will need the extra time to work with your FFL-01 willing to take a firearm from an FFL-03.

S&W 9mm model 6906 Compact Lightweight Stainless 13 Shot 1 Magazine As early as the 1960s, almost as soon as Smith & Wesson's 39 and 59 series of pistols hit the market, law enforcement specialists began demanding compact variants. The Devel and ASP custom guns gained popularity with federal agents, including the Secret Service, all variants of the S&Ws. It was not until 1983 that Smith & Wesson began paying serious attention to demand for compact autos. The Company's first response was this specimen's immediate ancestor, the Model 469, popularly known simply as the Mini. The 669 in lightweight stainless followed in 1985, and the 6900 series began in 1988. Here is one of the final 6906 specimens in that model’s best classic form. It was manufactured the final year of production, 1999, according to its BDX serial number prefix . This weapon served and protected our fellow citizens in California with the California Department of Corrections during the previous two decades. Note the neatly executed laser CDC Prefix identification numbers on the right side of the slide, barrel and frame. It has the third type rounded serrated trigger guard and recessed frame contour above the trigger. Note also the pinned-in ambidextrous safety, and Novak style anodized three-dot sights. Hammer is factory bobbed black anodized smooth top; and trigger is first type .365 black anodized smooth combat. Frame, of course, is specially coated lightweight alloy, and the pistol weighs only 26.5 ounces empty. Curved backstrap one-piece grip matches the anodized sights and high impact magazine finger-rest type floorplate; and note the black follower that only admits 12 round magazine capacity. Magazines are pre-ban configuration, but most of them are marked restricted, manufactured by special order for CDC during or after 1994. These are dimensionally compact pistols but they have double-stacked magazine wells; that is, they will operate with even the huge 20 round magazines that S&W marketed for its 5900. This 6906 will readily accept any 59 or 5900 magazine."

 This Yugoslavian SKS made around 1959 is FFL-03 (C&R) eligible, so I can ship directly to the address listed on your FFL if you have an FFL-03 or better. I must have a copy of your FFL, emailed picture is fine.  If not, make sure your FFL-01 will take a firearm from an FFL-03 holder (me). If you're buying in Washington State ""face-to-face"" I have a reliable FFL in my area that I usually work with for transfers, or I will use an FFL of your choosing. Buyer pays transfer fee. For a face-to-face (through an FFL, as required in WA) transaction I will accept cash or a USPS MO. For shipping I require a USPS MO for the purchase price plus insured shipping. $30 flat fee for insured shipping (yes, $15-25 less than it will cost me) to the lower 48 states or Alaska. Actual shipping cost to Hawaii. Additional $10 + any extra fees I incur for shipping to CA.  Sorry, I just don't know CA law so will need the extra time to work with your FFL-01 willing to take a firearm from an FFL-03.

(In my opinion this is the best holster on the market)As noted above, this sale does not included the RMR optic on the gun as i wish to use that on another firearm of mine. Unfortunately i do not have a slide cover plate for the milled out section that this RMR occupied so you will either need to purchase your own RMR to install (no other red dot optic brand will work), or purchase the one i have for an additional $450 (which is $150 cheaper then you will find them anywhere else right now). This gun has been used and the slide coating does show some very light wear spots, but overall is a very gorgeous gun. When upgrading, I tried to keep it's form just as appealing as it's function. Overall i have probably put over $2300 into this gun and when you shoot it you will know why. Buyer pays for any transfer fees at a location mutually agreed upon. If shipped, buyer will also pay for shipping as shipping 2-day air can get updatrds of $70. if you woudl like to meet at a gun range to shoot before you purchase, just let me know and something can be arranged."

That and all the factory goods. The firearm has seen 75 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense, cleaned and put up. So kinda how it all breaks down is by definition the gun is categorized as an enhanced DAO. However it's a bit diffrent than most other DAO guns. When the slide is racked (loading the gun), the mainspring is compressed and kept in place as with any single action mechanism. However, the external part of the hammer moves fully forward and so does the trigger. In essence you have a cocked single action pistoil that doesn't look cocked. The first shot has a longer tigger movement like a traditional double action pull, but it's not any heavier than any subsequent trigger pulls. The reset is a little longer than some striker-fired guns or a 1911, but it's only about a third of the total trigger travel arc. So because of that you get the benefits of having a singe action trigger pull with the added benefits of a re-strike capability. That along with getting the very tried and true design of the P30 pistol line up."
