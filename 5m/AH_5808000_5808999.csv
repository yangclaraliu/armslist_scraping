I am selling for a firm and fair price, call around, check online and you will see its fair. If you find it cheaper online then go for it (I don't need to be notified), my price won't change because a huge company is having a sale and is still making money since they purchased it at cost.

These Savage Rascals are great little youth guns with Savage's excellent accutrigger which allows for very accurate shooting.  The trigger pull is very light and crisp and adjustable.
Price is $200 for everything.  I will check all the usual IDs required by law such as NE purchase permit or CHP.

Through an ingenious and simple arrangement we have solved the main disadvantage of Bullpup rifles; case ejection. Traditional side ejection is not ambidextrous and forward ejection, like in the Kel-Tec RFB, is quite complex.   The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. The bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower full auto rate (when applicable).  The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies. Bolt, bolt carrier, firing mechanism, ejector chute and bolt stop are identical for all variations. The short stroke gas operated piston is fully adjustable for different ammunitions and muzzle attachments.We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

Have had it a little over ten years (bought it from the original owner and have kept it as a collector’s item ever since). It has been shot very little over all the years but has always been kept in great condition. Featuring excellent rifling, deep grooves, a flip-up sight for various ranges (in distances of yd. / ft.) and an easy-to-use smooth / tight Winchester straight pull-back bolt action. However, it does have some small blue-ing issues from over the years, but are very light.

Ammo Type: 7.62x51 (.308) – Very high knockdown caliber

It is a one of a kind rifle and has been well kept and cared for over the years. While it is a great hunting rifle and has rarely been used, it’s time it finds itself a new home with a caring owner.4

(OPTIONAL): For $40 extra, I’ll even throw in a well-kept leather ammo belt + 20 rounds of unused Winchester .308’s

The rifle itself however is $400

I plan to get another TCM, but it'll probably be a TCM-R conversion for a Glock, so I, again, won't need the 22 TCM (full length).The remaining boxes I have are for sale. The price depends on how many boxes you want.I know how much the retail stores charge (about $26/box+tax).If you want 1 box, I will sell it to you for $25.If you want 2 boxes, the price is $24 per box.If you want 3 boxes, they're $23 per box.If you want 4 boxes, they're $22 per box.The Final Price Break: 5 or more boxes will be $20 per box.These prices are fair and firm. The higher prices for fewer boxes cover my costs to travel to meet you for the transaction. If you believe you will get them cheaper elsewhere, I encourage you to buy them elsewhere.

Almost same dimensions as the Shield, but with a very nice textured grip. Three-dot sights, but front sight is large orange dot, very easy to pick up when firing. Weighs 3 ounces more than the Shield, making for softer recoil. Nice pistol, but I just don’t care for striker-fired triggers, so it’s available.
