My upper has the following specifications.... *20"" stainless Colt match grade barrel, 1/9 twist. *Black Stainless Muzzle brake (I think the contrast between the barrel and brake looks sharp). *Sota Arms Key-mod 15"" freefloat aluminum handguard. *Sota Arms Black Anodized Upper. *Full Auto BCG and charging handle. *Tasco Pronghorn Scope and mounts 3-9x40… I had this sitting in my safe from another build can take off if you don’t want. I am looking for a decent hand gun in the 5-6 hundred dollar range. I am pretty much open to offers, let me know what you have. This upper is brand new and has only been test fired at Sota before I picked it up. I even have the box it came in! Please let me know what you have, thanks for looking.

This gun is an enigmatic affront to American gun manufacturing.  I bought it just to see what it's all about and was pleasantly surprised.  Listing it because I'm downsizing my arsenal in preparation for a move."

We will be working with pistols and rifles. If you do not have a pistol - we will lend you one for free. If you do not have a rifle, we can rent you one.Date & Time: Sunday, April 24, 2016 / 9:30AM - 4:30PMLocation: 1425 SW 107 Ave, Miami, FL 33174Price: $147 (All credit cards accepted)Phone: REDACTED (Accepts texts)Email: REDACTEDPrice includes range fees but you have to bring your own ammo.
