The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45 ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of their choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size; (subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell-And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

I am not sure if their is an issue with the armslist email set up.   Just give me a call or text. REDACTED, my name is Nic.     Looking to sell my converted Saiga 12. I love this gun, but I need to get my wife a pistol caliber carbine before these crazy laws kick in, and I am short on cash from panic buying ammo :(       I bought the gun unconverted brand new about 4 years ago. If has fully drilled gas ports. I also installed an automatic tac47 gas plug. ($50) that works really well. Totally got rid of gas adjustment issues.   I converted it myself using a missippi auto arms kit ($350). This kit came with a houge grip and a very solid aluminum stock.      The gun IS MISSING THE SAFETY. This looks like a $70 dollar part to replace. I just dislike the AK safety and left the gun bolt open for home defense.      I live in Chico and I am down in the south Bay area often. I am totally open to shooting this gun with you so you can see how smooth the recoil and operation is.     I am open to trades/trades + cash.    Interested in a pistol caliber carbine (not hipoint or sub2k though) g35, older remington 870/870 police magnum, DMR type ar15 or ar10. (I value franken builds at around 60-70% of the part value.)    I am not 100% sure on the value of these due to the ban and wierd CA law changes. Just shoot me a (somewhat) reasonable offer if interested)     Please see the below album for pictures. I will be adding some better ones tonight. http://m.imgur.com/a/pePuGImgur.com/a/W9JHR"

You could spend hundreds more for another 9mm suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, multi-caliber usage, upgradability, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Guardian 9 has it all.SuppressionThe Guardian 9 compares favorably to suppressors costing more than twice as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible at the most affordable price. The Guardian utilizes K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest suppressors available.MaintenanceJust because you can take a suppressor apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable suppressors, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted an extra $50.Even if the tool worked, you can't get the suppressor apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired.And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.LongevityThere are several features designed into the Guardian 9 to ensure safe and enjoyable use beyond a lifetime.Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. Our end caps are made of softer aluminum so that if there is an end cap strike, the end cap will give way causing minimal if any damage to the rest of your suppressor. The affected end cap, and any damaged baffles can be easily replaced without having to replace the entire core.Multi-caliberWhat's your caliber of choice? 9mm? 22LR? 22 WMR? 17HMR? If you are shooting any of these rest easy knowing your Guardian 9 was designed to handle the pressures generated."

Im not a gun store, so please dont waste my time with ""Ill think about its"" or last minute ""will you take less for its"", it wastes my gas money and time and also potentially screws over another person willing to pay for it without the hassle or bs.
