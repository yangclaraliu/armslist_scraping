I purchased it a little over 3 months ago and have not had the opportunity to use it much. I've put less than 500 rounds through it. Today was the first time I cleaned it and it was just to prepare it for sale. MIL-COMM TW25B grease was used today on it, per recommendation of Sig Sauer. There have never been any jams or failures to eject with this pistol. I am the only owner it's had. It comes as is with an FDE grip module and the slide is finished in a bronze. It is a modular, striker fired pistol that gives you the opportunity to remove the Fire Control Unit and place into a smaller or larger or different color grip. The price I've listed it at is pretty firm as MSRP is over $600.Additional Features:- 3 point takedown safety system- Internal Striker Safety; prevents the striker from releasing until the trigger is pulled- Internal Disconnect Safety; prevents the pistol from firing out of battery- includes barrel/slide lock- includes paddle holster- includes two magazines (12+1)- SIGLITE Night-Sights"

Patton referred to as: "" the greatest battlefield implement ever devised."" She was originally purchased through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.The rifle is chambered in the venerable 30-06 cartridge. The SA barrel dates to 4-55. The SA rifle serial number dates to 1955 as well. That, along with like condition and Patina, suggests the barrel is original to the gun. The serial number will be given upon phone conversation only. There are no visible import marks. The stainless gas seal is the only area exhibiting any significant wear. Rust is non-existent, nor are there any signs of major battle scars. Normal wear is minimal for the time frame. The stock is a post WWII Overton Stock with evidence of a faint DOD cartouche stamp. The barrel is shiny and remains accurate. The rifle functions wonderfully and is accompanied by 5 en bloc clips. The rifle wears an OD nylon sling, befitting of the time period in both use and appearance. The weapon has the normal matching of the major US manufacturers parts of that time:Receiver- SABarrel- 4-1955Trigger Group- International Harvester Op Rod- SA Bolt- Harrington and RichardsonSights (SA). The sights are in excellent mechanical condition and show minimal wear. They remain audible, tactile and precise on the firing line.Stock- OvertonME- 2Do not have a chamber guage, but throat wear is minimal. Casing test shows a solid 1/8"" of the top of the casing, so it's definitely not ""swallowing"" it. The pkg. will come with 5 En Bloc Clips & a Hard Carry Case.*Numerous additional photos and videos upon request."

This round (also known as .22 Remington Special) was the “Magnum” of its day. The 1890 was designed by John Browning & was the first pump rifle sold by Winchester. These were manufactured from 1890 to 1932, according to the Cody Polishing Room Records this rifle was produced in 1905. Mechanically sound; functions correctly & safely with no issues. The action is crisp & smooth & the rifle is still very accurate. The bore is in excellent condition: bright & shiny with no frosting. It has a clean bolt face, the inside of the receiver still has most of its bluing, shows little signs of use. It has a 24” octagon barrel with the original sights; the front sight has a patent date of Nov 4, 1902 & the rear sight patent date is Jan. 29, 1901. The bluing is bright & shiny, deep & rich, incredible for the age. The barrel corners are still sharp, all stampings are clear & legible, there is very little bluing loss, mostly limited to some of the high spots. Minor handling marks & a few pin-head pits are found upon up-close inspection. The stocks are walnut with nice grain & finish & are solid with no cracks or repairs, just minor handling marks. The pump handle has 12 grooves, it has a Crescent butt stock with a case colored steel butt plate. The wood fits proud to the metal & the finish is original."

Brand new in the box with lock and all factory literature. Since 1959 the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on should they have to punch out over a remote area. Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.
The receiver is also coated with Teflon™ for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics.
The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in two finishes; Black and Mossy Oak Break-Up Camo Pattern.  All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight."

It has a clean bolt face, the inside of the receiver still has most of its bluing, shows little signs of use. It has a 24” octagon barrel with the original sights; the front sight has a patent date of Nov 4, 1902 & the rear sight patent date is Jan. 29, 1901. The bluing is bright & shiny, deep & rich, incredible for the age. The barrel corners are still sharp, all stampings are clear & legible, there is very little bluing loss, mostly limited to some of the high spots. Minor handling marks & a few pin-head pits are found upon up-close inspection. The stocks are walnut with nice grain & finish & are solid with no cracks or repairs, just minor handling marks. The pump handle has 12 grooves, it has a Crescent butt stock with a case colored steel butt plate. The wood fits proud to the metal & the finish is original."
