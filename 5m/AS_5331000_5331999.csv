The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 16"" Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

The revolutionary, fully-modular Remington Adaptive Combat Rifle (ACR). The ACR was initially conceived to provide today’s warfighter an American-made, reliable, accurate, and mission –configurable rifle. Three American companies – MagPul Industries Corp., Bushmaster and Remington – shared this common vision and after multiple iterations of torturous testing only the strongest materials, components and concepts survived. The ACR can change calibers from 5.56mm to 6.8mm in minutes at the user level by changing the bolt head, barrel, and magazine. The ACR can also change barrels, stocks, and accessories to go from a close-quarters battle carbine to a designated marksman rifle. Add a superbly reliable gas piston operating system, controllable full-auto fire capability, a non-reciprocating bolt handle, a monolithic free-floating handguard rail system, and intuitive, ambidextrous controls and you have a platform that is a natural fit for any operator and gives him all the options he needs."

Me saying no thanks is the worst that will happen. (I do not own any bolt guns or shotguns)**Bushnell is currently selling for $386.25 online without a mount**Last picture is a group with 3 shots touching at 200 yards.-1-4x Optic-Illuminated BTR reticle with holdovers (for .223/5.56) out to 500 yards. Illumination is bright enough to use in the mid day sun.-PCL Throwdown lever for quick power adustments-First focal plane. This means the reticle changes size based on what magnification you have the optic on. At 1x with the illumination turned on the reticle appears almost as a red dot for quick target acquisition. The higher the magnification, the larger the reticle. Because of this, holdovers are consistent on the reticle regardless of magnification setting.-crisp/clear reticle with or without magnification.Included is a 30mm cantilever mount.Mounted the optic this summer and has worked flawlessly. Obviously used but still in great condition. I am only selling because I want to try out some red dot sights."

This is the first of a new line of Centerfire rifles for Rock Island Armory. It's intended for mid-range use with a mounted scope and is perfect for varmint hunting. We've created this beauty to be exclusively chambered in Armscor's signature caliber, .22TCM - which happens to scream at over 2,800 fps. The 5 round mag can be interchanged with the 17 round .22 TCM pistol mag, turning this into a high-capacity rifle.

I say barely used because I believe I only took it to the range one time right after I bought it to test fire it. This was my 'backup' G23 so it just sat in the safe while the other one made all of the range trips. You'll be able to confirm this when you see the barrel. I've moved away from .40's so I have no need for this one (I've already sold the other one). It comes with a Talon sandpaper grip on it, 3 mags and the Glock case. I maintain my listings, so if you're reading this it is available. All 'is this still available' emails will be ignored. $500. The only guns that I would be interested in trading for would be HK Mark23, newer Colt Delta Elite or Colt Gov Rail in black, or Remington 870 (Magpul edition only).  Nothing else."

I have FS/FT two nicely modified German Mauser Model 98's (All Stamped to confirm German Manufacturing). Both Conversions equipped with very nice wood stocks (sporterized). The .243 has a Monte Carlo type stock with Redfield Scope. The 30-06 has been beautifully customized on a Boyd Featherlight Laminate stock with Thumbhole. Both in good working order, and plenty of pictures if interested. Simply text me @ REDACTED and I will be happy to provide you with whatever information you need. Would like to get $400 Each, but I am negotiable within reason. Please no low ball offers. I recently purchased both of these firearms with the intent of using them as my go-to Alabama hunting rifles. Can't shoot both at the same time though, so I would prefer selling or trading them both to get the funds for a higher end rifle calibered in .243 or .270. These are both very good looking, low maintenance, and very economical hunting rifles. Both rifles are well designed to kill Alabama Whitetail. Thank you for your interest!"

$440 firm in cash or a little better in trade.
I will consider trades if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will wait for cash.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Garland/Mesquite area or will ship for $40 more in TX.  Since this is classified as a pistol it has to go UPS Overnight, I will require payment up front, of course and copy of your FFL's license before shipping.  Thanks for looking!"
