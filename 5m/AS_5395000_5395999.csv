Here is some information on the rifle from http://www.scott-duff.com/WhoHowManyWhen.htm: “The first production M1 was successfully proof fired, function fired, and fired for accuracy on 21 July 1937. Thus began manufacture of what was to become the greatest production effort in the long history of Springfield Armory…The Winchester Repeating Arms Company of New Haven, Connecticut was the only other World War II era producer of M1 rifles. Winchester received an Educational Order on 4 April 1939 to produce 500 M1s. The first one hundred rifles, under that Order, were shipped on 27 December 1940. On 20 September 1939, Winchester received its first of many production contracts for additional rifles. Government records indicate Winchester delivered 513,880 M1 rifles between December 1940 and June 1945. The surrender of Germany in May 1945 resulted in termination of M1 rifle manufacture at Winchester as of 30 June 1945.

Normally the bead front sight was reserved for target models, but some were equipped based on availability of parts, as these were manufactured during war time. Serial #318xxx Bore looks good, no pitting anywhere and rifling’s are defined. This Smith and Wesson is in excellent condition for a gun that is 100 years old. Just a real treasure to have.  ------------------------ Some History:
Production of the .455 Mark II Hand Ejector Second Model began in 1915 and continued until 1917 with serial numbers following on from the First model starting at serial number 5001 and continuing on up to serial number 74755. Although for various reasons, as stated previously, there are some Mark I's numbered in the early part of this serial number range including those made by the using up of old parts. In total there were 69,754 Mark II .455's produced.
 
The Canadian Government purchased 14,500 directly from Smith & Wesson and in addition 1,105 were made for the commercial market after completion of the British contract. The rest went to the British Government.
When these guns were sold off as War surplus some were converted to more popular calibers due to the unavailability of the .455 ammunition, especially those that went to the United States. The two usual conversions were to .45 long Colt by lengthening the chambers and then either the cylinder was shortened or some metal was removed from the recoil shield to allow for the extra thickness of the rim on the cartridge case. The other conversion was to .45 ACP by shortening the cylinder and using .45 ACP in half moon clips or .45 auto rim ammunition.
-------------------------- Just a beautiful, and perfect shooting gun. Very accurate, a must have for any Smith and Wesson collection. All transactions are face to face in the Tulsa area. Prefer text or email. nine18-four02-zero854"

This is a Chiappa Citadel  1911 chambered in 22lr. As you can see from the pic this mimics a full sized government  1911. Has the same length and heft as a 45acp 1911 will also fit your 1911 holsters.  Great  little plinker, especially  for the price. This gun has fixed sights, left side thumb saftey, beavertail, wood grips and a single action only trigger. Also will include the original 10 round magazine, no case. Have some high velocity  and standard 22 ammo to make a deal with. This gun is used but only has a maximum of 350 rounds through it. Does have some finish wear on the slide. The finish isn't very tough and scratches pretty easily. But nothing is tremendously ugly and the wear spots are in common areas. ( more pics on request) The gun is definitely accurate but like most 22s it likes some ammo better then others. This a a great deal for someone with a 1911 who wants cheap practice, this is also good for anyone who likes to plink lol."

It has a very little slide wear visable which is purely cosmetic, very hard to se in the pictures. It has no holster wear because it was never carried.At the time of this posting, there were only 9 total and 4 blued like mine in the Armslist network. So as you may find, if this is a gun youre looking for, its hard to find in great shape; and if youre looking for a face to face transaction, this is the only one within a few hundred miles of North Central Ohio. My asking price is pretty firm at $600, as the magazines new like the two spare I have are even more difficult to find. I found no listings for new factory Beretta magazines in the original factory on the Armslist network. This gun will only become more rare as they are no longer imported to the USA by Beretta.I'm willing to meet at a fair distaince from Galion Ohio for a face to face sale. My local FFL dealer charges $25 for a transfer, and shipping costs would be on you. I'm not interested in any trades."

About a month ago I traded an Adams Arms 5.45 AR upper for this rifle at a pawn shop. The rifle is new in box. I never had the chance to fire it I've been too busy with work. It literally hangs on the wall as decor as of the month+. It appears to have Century's new ""battle gear"" stock on it (newer PAPs) as opposed to the ""cheek slap"" high rise stock. I put a power customs hammer and trigger pin retainer in it, the shepherd's hook worked but the pins and some play, this eliminated that completely (I will give the hook with it as well if for some reason your want it?). Comes with x4 Magpul PMAGs that look to be 2nd Gen ... so, I don't know, don't drop'em haha. The price tag on the rifle was $629.99 and so I am asking $600.00 even. As my schedule is busy if anything that $30 can go toward gas for pick up if things don't work out to meet up? Included all together is the rifle, x4 mags, original box/packaging, manual, and chamber flag if I can find that... I usually ditch those. Any questions feel free, rarely check email, text: SevenOhSix-977-Seven8Four1, Josh. Thanks for looking and God bless.Will require a copy of a valid GA I.D. for personal records"
