I’ve tried S&W, Springfield, Sig and H&K striker-fired pistols, and if I were going to own one, this would be it.

Beautiful and elegant, yet powerful and robust. Built on the S&W N-Frame, the same as their famous 44 magnum revolvers, this gun can digest the heaviest rounds out there without punishing recoil. The action is hand tuned and smooth, and the trigger pull is like butter, which these guns were famous for. This high quality revolver is much sought after and I've seen them go for upwards of $900 and the earlier models are valued at around $1,400. I don't want to sell this gun because it took me a long time to even find it, but a financial problem is causing me to sell it. This one is in especially great condition and shoots very accurately. Mine is worth between $750-$850, so I'm asking for $650. Trust me because I've looked around quite a bit, you will not find one of these at a price that low.****I am willing to throw in a few boxes of quality .357 ammo, 2 speed loaders, a nylon shoulder holster, and a nice brown leather strong side holster (right side)."

Unfortunately, our American companies like Thompson Center, Lyman, and Traditions are all producing cheaply made ""traditional"" muzzle loaders these days. The wood on those tends to have no grain or poor wood grain quality, and fit and finish is sloppy. Also they are using thinner brass on the furniture, and not finishing it out, especially on the patch boxes. On the Tradidtions I saw yesterday at Sportsman's Warehouse, the patch box is of minimum size, no depth to it, and bare wood on the inside, meaning no wood sealant was put on it to protect it from moisture, and the very thin brass door of the patch box certainly won't keep moisture out.  These Interarms Hawkens are SO MUCH BETTER in how they are made, everything is more sturdy, especially the brass furniture and wood quality. This one has a 29 inch , 66 twist barrel.  It has a very strong stock with good looking black mineral streaking lines that go down the full length of the stock. The buttstock is not skinny like on a lot of muzzle loaders at the local sporting goods stores. This normal thickness stock gives a wider footprint on your shoulder to mitigate recoil, meaning it will be a comfortable gun to shoot. The patch box is exceptional. It goes deep and has a lot of room for patches and primers, etc. It's not just decorative, it is every bit as functional as it is good looking, making it different and better than a lot of guns of this type. The brass furniture is excellent on this rifle, and so is the double set trigger. The sights are very good too. They are easy to use and practical in lower light. The only flaw is there are a few minor marks on the left side of the stock, and I put up two pictures of the left side showing them. A little buffing and then adding some  tung oil to the finish would probably take care of it. These rifles are $450 or more new. This one is $315. The only reason I am selling it is I want more money for bulding up a duck hunting boat for the fall season. It's a very well made rifle, and a great buy."

You can also use them for other critters, and they make a great tactical round as well. They sell for $29.49 a box at Midway, plus you would pay shipping. Sportsman's Warehouse sells them for $29.99 a box.  I have 8 boxes of them for a total of 400 bullets. Another advantage of these bullets is they weigh the same as 62 grain steel core green tip armor peircing military bullets, so you will have the same trajectory; however, the Barnes bullet will be much more accurate. And if you are building up a precision AR-15, then these are top choices for accuracy and downrange killing power. And these bullets work great for bolt guns too. I will sell you 8 boxes for the price of 7 at Midway's price, which is $206.  And am willing to meet if you live in Portland/Vancouver down to Albany along the I-5 Corridor.  I live in north Salem off of exit 258 just south of Keizer."

As a target bullet, Mike at Nosler uses these very Nosler seconds to shoot a mile in his 30 cal magnums (300 Win Mag and 300RUM).  I do not work for Nosler.  Your price on these is my cost, actually it is below my cost because the price includes insured shipping to you in the the lower 48 and Alaska/Hawaii. This is a smart buy if you shoot 30-06 or a 30 cal magnum.  So why would I sell them then, after making the effort to acquire them?   I do more duck hunting than long range shooting, and I am having a duck boat built over the next couple of months and I'd rather pay for some options cash instead of putting it on a credit card. Just a matter of economics and time.  I SAY IT AGAIN, THIS IS A VERY SMART BUY FOR YOU.NOTE: I LIVE IN SALEM.

I honestly believe the roster is BS and law enforcement should NOT be above the law.  This should be available to any good citizen of CA/USA that is able to pass the backgound check (DROS) and demonstrate proficiency.  As law stands now, if you can legally buy a pistol in CA and lawfully own this one through a private party transfer such as this.  That also applies to any other pistol that is deemed LE only. The 30 day wait does not apply to private party transfers. If you just bought/DROS a pistol you can still transfer this one no problem.This is NOT a ""build,"" 80% lower, or single shot exemption; is a COMPLETE pistol with a serial number and a factory warranty. It comes with a 10 round magazineI had to add the bullet button to make it legal (original magazine release included just in case you travel outside CA)  After the ban Jan 1, 2017 I believe that after you register this weapon as an AW you may remove the bullet button.  This is what I have heard from a few dealers now.  But there will be more to come on this I am sure.  4150 CMV Chrome Moly Barrel, 1:7"" twistThe upper and lower receiver are milled from Mil-Spec forged 7075-T6 and have Type III Class II hard-coat anodized finish.  The upper receiver has M4 feed ramps and a flat top Pictinny rail.This model has a low profile railed gas block, making it ideal for mounting optics or backup iron sights.The bolt carrier and gas key are made Magnetic Particle Inspected to ensure flawlessness.  The pistol also features a a foam padded pistol buffer tube to be fully ATF compliant. It also accepts aftermarket braces such as the Sig brace. What sets this pistol apart from the rest is the fact that it has a free float quad rail handguard manufacured from a CNC machined forged aluminum extrusion.Optics: Flat top rail for mounting sight/optics (not included, I am sure you have your own favorites)Meet at your FFL of choice for a private party transfer within 30 miles of Riverside.PayPal accepted for the asking price or send me your cash offer.  Sorry, no trades (unless you have a Ruger Precision Rifle in 6.5 or 308.  I am also looking for a nice AR10.I can not sell ""just the lower""  Note: This is a pistol, so you will need a handgun safety certificate.  You will also need proof of residency such as a California ID/DL, utility bill or vehicle registration that matches the address on your CA ID/DL (no PO box). I am doing my best to keep this post updated after responding to the numerous emails.  If I have not responded to your question within 24 hours, send another.  If it is a legal question in which I am unaware, I research it before I respond.  I suggest you do your own research beforehand.  But bottom line, I assure you this is a legal sale/transfer.  I do not have any other information regarding the newest laws signed in by Gov Brown.  I only have the advice of what I am told by FFL's.  Thank you!"
