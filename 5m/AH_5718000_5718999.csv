These receivers are a direct replacement for the G3 / HK91 / CETME style rifles. These receivers are the early German Military style profile (which are identical to the later style, with subtle aesthetic differences only). This early style profile was used by the German Bundeswehr and Portuguese Armed Forces. These receivers have been rolled, stenciled and serialized. This product is targeted towards the home builder; and manufacturers who don't have the tooling to reliably roll a flat. These parts were produced on original HK stamping dies, not on an aftermarket bending jig. Gewehr Werks has duplicated the nomenclature found on these early receivers.
No welding has been done, no weldments are included. We have built a 100 rifles with these receivers and no issues, Actual product is pictured below. NOTE these receivers now accept collapsible stocks, without any modification. We must stress that these parts have been produced using a 500 ton MINSTER press and German stamping dies!
This is the last time these early style receivers will be offered by Gewehr Werks, when these are gone that’s it! The quantity is limited, only 100 units are being offered at this blowout sale price. We are offering these parts at cost, at rock bottom, at 70% the cost of a flat. The price is $50.00 plus $15.00 shipping!
 
NOTE: These are an FFL item, must be shipped to a FFL dealer
This sale will be ending soon due to a rapidly declining number of parts left in stock. Gewehr Werks will be discontinuing the sale of G3/CETME receivers in the very near future. If you want a G3/CETME unfinished receiver at the $50 price point, the time to act is now! The remaining stock will mark the end of all sales at any price point and be the end of this product line.

These receivers are a direct replacement for the G3 / HK91 / CETME style rifles. These receivers are the early German Military style profile (which are identical to the later style, with subtle aesthetic differences only). This early style profile was used by the German Bundeswehr and Portuguese Armed Forces. These receivers have been rolled, stenciled and serialized. This product is targeted towards the home builder; and manufacturers who don't have the tooling to reliably roll a flat. These parts were produced on original HK stamping dies, not on an aftermarket bending jig. Gewehr Werks has duplicated the nomenclature found on these early receivers.
No welding has been done, no weldments are included. We have built a 100 rifles with these receivers and no issues, Actual product is pictured below. NOTE these receivers now accept collapsible stocks, without any modification. We must stress that these parts have been produced using a 500 ton MINSTER press and German stamping dies!
This is the last time these early style receivers will be offered by Gewehr Werks, when these are gone that’s it! The quantity is limited, only 100 units are being offered at this blowout sale price. We are offering these parts at cost, at rock bottom, at 70% the cost of a flat. The price is $50.00 plus $15.00 shipping!
 
NOTE: These are an FFL item, must be shipped to a FFL dealer
 
If you are interested in purchasing a receiver you can email us at gewehrwerks@earthlink.net or call us at 937-667-4605"

This gun is in great condition. It has been in a safe for most of it's life, shot very little and recently when I took it out to shoot, I decided it was time to move it on to someone who would ""use"" it. Walnut is in great shape. Bluing overall is great, just some wear on receiver, which happens on 94s. Mainly, from sitting against felt in the safe for many years. Shoots and works smooth.
Please be 18 or over, Va resident and willing to sign a BOS. The gun was recently at the Gunsmith for a disassembly and cleaning to ensure it is in proper working order after many years of being in a safe. If serious, please contact me and we can discuss a plan to buy. Thanks!"

The rimfire rifles produced by Ceská zbrojovka Uherský Brod due to their classical construction and unfailing reliability are ranked among the most sought-after long guns of their kind on the world market. Quality, long service life, accuracy and safe handling are the main virtues of these firearms intended for hunters and sports shooters. Unparalleled accuracy is attained in all CZ rimfires models, besides other things, through the use of hammer forged barrels. This is not the cheapest or fastest way to build a barrel, but it is part of our “take the time to do it right” attitude. The barrel has the muzzle threaded for a Still or Parker-Hale sound suppressor attachment. The receiver is made from a one billet of high quality steel and is provided with milled dovetail to accommodate scope mount. The trigger of the CZ 452 rimfires line is adjustable by the user. Quality and attention to details has made the CZ rimfire rifles a growing favourite among small game hunters and sport shooters. Available in both wide array of models and a wide range of prices we have a rimfire to meet any application. CZ 452 • Receiver made from a single billet of high-quality steel •"
