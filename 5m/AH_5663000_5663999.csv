I believe that a trigger upgrade was done on her by the previous owner. It has the smoothest trigger pull I have ever seen on a Glock. Really don't want to part with her, but times are tough.I can meet about anywhere in Burlingame, but thats it. My medical issues prevent me from driving. Also, we have to stick to texting, or email.

The bent bolt and action is as smooth as glass. One of the smoothest that I have ever felt and I've owned about 5. Also has a nice trigger for a Mosin. Nothing like the spongy triggers most have. This one sits because I don't want to use it because it has so many features that are worth so much more that I use my normal Mosin for range shooting. The stock is about $150, these scope sell for about $200, and the bent bolts are very hard to find as well as a Mosin that has a 20 point front leaf adjustment is rare. There is one fault on the gun and that is a slight crack under the trigger guard ( you can see in the picture ) I'm going to try and fix it. It doesn't go all the way through. I will take $475 cash FIRM just to get back what I have in it. ( That's actually less than just the parts on it, not including the gun )PRICE DROP TO $375 FIRMThis is a great price as most are willing for $300 now with no upgrades and these scopes alone are worth another $200 and the stocks are another $150+.May accept trades if they are worth more, but only if they are worth at least another $100+. If please text me at 904-5zero9-zero517.I'm located 30-40 minutes west of Jacksonville.I can send any other pictures through text if needed. Will include a soft guitar case I keep it in."

Smith & Wesson M&P94.25” barrelAPEX Tactical aluminum flat face trigger & sear kit (part number 100-054)Ameriglo I-dot night sightsTalon grips2 x 17 round magazines includedThe trigger kit makes this gun blow the doors off any polymer pistol from a shootability standpoint. No more floppy stock trigger and the pull is short with a crisp break. The difference in accuracy and follow-up shot speed is incredible. There is a reason APEX can’t keep these kits in stock and APEX has a huge following. It’s that good. This trigger kit is worth $170 not including installation!
True to any carry pistol, night sights are installed along with Talon grips. Please note that I only have the narrow back strap. The medium and large backstraps are not included.
Why the sale? I’m much more comfortable on the 1911 platform and no longer want this.
Price is $550, which is perfectly reasonable considering most of the M&Ps for sale still need sight and trigger work.
Buyer must have CPL.

This ammo is live and should be treated as such, however, because of its age (~1930s) it is best suited as components for reloading purposes. I no longer reload rifle rounds because I just don't have the time or motivation. I would pull the bullets, salvage the powder, de-prime the cases, and sell the brass to a scrap yard. This is a much cheaper way to reload for 8mm surplus rifles.Due to mass low baller spam I am setting the price to ~0.13 per round for a fixed price of $200 for all 1,529 rounds and cash only. The cheapest 8mm projectiles on the market currently are PPU at ~0.25 per bullet. At 0.13 per round you are getting a projectile, powder load, and brass to trade to a scrap yard for some money back or convert to boxer primers. You won't find 8mm components this cheap anywhere else, ever.If your email has anything other than ""I'll take it"" it's going straight to the trash folder, spammers will be blocked so don't waste your time. Just need to see an Arizona ID and you're good to go."

The KAK buffer tube has detents that allow the brace to lock into. If you were to mount the shockwave on a regular pistol tube it can spin and lose its place. The KAK tube prevents this with multiple detents allowing user adjustibility. Both are perfect condition with the exception of a small bit of finish rubbed off on the detent where the set screw was holding the stock.

This one takes some explaining so hang in there, TLDR at the end.Bought this gun at a gun show from a guy a little over a year ago. Didn't really know what to look for with these guns and it gauged at 0 with a muzzle gauge so the price was right for me. Now the guy at the gun show told me this was a CMP/DCM rifle, sat in a closet for years and he wanted to sell it since he wasn't using it. I gave it the metaphorical shot. Later on when stripping the gun down for a cleaning I came to find out this is a restored drill rifle. I know this because there is evidence of a barrel spot weld under the reciever and the cuttoff seems to have been previously welded too. It headspaces fine, so I didnt think much of it and went and shot the rifle. I noticed after firing it that it makes rings around the brass. After talking with many people, I believe this to be a defect in the chamber, which you may need a chamber reamer to fix. I am worried that this may lead to case separations in the chamber, but it has never happened to me. I do not want to invest in a reamer or pay to have a restored drill rifle rebarreled. I dont know any good gunsmiths with the capability to fix this and don't want to spend the time and money to do it. I would rather just cut my losses and move on. That is why this is listed as a PROJECT rifle. It is fully functional right now, headspaces fine, and I have fired it a couple hundred times without issues, however the chamber issue described above bothers me. I have other 1903s, so my preference is to sell this rifle to someone who wants to fix it with a reamer or rebarrel it. Will this blow up if you don't fix the issue I have described? Probably not, but YOU are assuming the risk of injury if you buy this and do not fix the issue and just go shoot the rifle since this is listed on the cheap. That is why I am writing this in full disclosure. If none of this dissaudes you and you want to just buy the rifle and shoot it, so be it but now you know the issues. I didn't know these things when I bought this thing from a dishonest salesman at a gunshow, so it is only fair to lay them out in the open rather than screw another person over like he did me.All that said the stock on this rifle is very nice. I considered either parting out the rifle or making it a wall hanger but I would rather just do a quick sale and be done with it. Smith Carona reciever. Remington barrel with no wear at all. Unsure of the grove count. Parts all do not match.TLDR; Gun is a restored drill rifle with a chamber issue. Buy and shoot at your own risk. The price is low to encourage someone to buy and fix this, I do not want to bother with it.Price will be $400 OBO, face to face sale, Ohio DL"

Rainier swages their bullets twice with lead wire in an effort to ensure the tightest uniformity as well as prevention of premature wearing of barrels. While Rainier doesn't publish their own reloading information, they recommended using lead bullet load data when loading their bullets as well as a slight taper crimp. Rainier recommends a maximum velocity of 1,500 fps. These bullets feature a lead core that is completely covered by copper plating. They are resized after being plated with approximately 0.004"" of copper plating. This unique design makes them suitable for most indoor ranges, which often require the use of bullets with no exposed lead. The base is slightly concave to maximize the bullet to bore seal.Email for details."
