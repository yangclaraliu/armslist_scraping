The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.Compact DesignFinish BlackSemi-AutomaticDouble Action OnlyTrigger Pull 5.5 - 6.5 lbsContrast SightsInterchangeable Polymer GripsPolymer Grip Shell with Stainless Insert Frame FinishNitro Slide FinishAccessory Rail9mmBarrel Length 3.9”Magazine Capacity 15 + 1Weight 26.9 ozComes in original carrying case with 2 official SIG magazines, cable lock, user manual,allen wrench and Sig Hard Paddled Retention Holster.*50 rounds were tested through the P250 at an indoor range.Price starts at $375 or best offer."

For sale are 2 (two) aftermarket High Quality Polished Stainless Steel with Beveled End Edges Take Down Unlock Pins that fit the Remington® RM380 pistol.
 
The original factory OEM part is much less refined with flat sharp edges and very dark in color which makes it difficult to visually align when installing or taking down the gun for cleaning. The beveled edges on mine make it easier to install, help keep the pin inside the slide when the gun is being fired and is very easy to see when aligning the slide for take down. Once you experience my pins you will never want to go back to the original pin!
 
The RM380 is a fine pistol but we felt that this particular part needed improvement, so I did that and now offer it to you!1st Class Mail shipping is free to the 48 contiguous states."

I'm not sure why, but it may increase its value.

I believe it can be fixed easily with a bit of heat to melt the plastic back together and smooth it out ( but it shouldn't have an effect on the rifle anyway as no pressure is applied to that area when shooting.*Other than that it looks great and seems to operate and function fine under dry fire as well as reloading with blanks.

Here is a list of included items (there are actually a few additional things, but these are the ones I am counting for the price).550Bstrong mountroller handle45 cal 3-die setbullet trayDVD550 cover550 toolholderspare partscase cleanermedia separatorcase bin and bracketprimer tubes9mm caliber conversion9mm carbide dies550 deluxe quick change kitquick change kit covermisc. Locator buttons and funnelsSuper Swage 600223 caliber conversion kit30 cal funnelI purchased all of this equipment new and it has maybe 1000 rounds through it. The press is capable of 500-600 rounds per hour and has a lifetime warranty that automatically transfers to the new owner. I am asking 85% of the 2011 retail prices I paid, which are a bit lower than today's prices. The price is firm and all items must be taken as a package.I have quite a bit other reloading supplies (primers, powder, bullets) that I would like to sell if interested. If you are getting into IDPA, IPSC, USPSA, or other high volume shooting sports, you need this stuff."

For those that don't know, this was the first all American made ak47. Comes with 2 tapco 30rd mags (1 is stippled) and a stippled Magpul 30rd mag, a quad rail handguard, and Magpul pistol grip.The good: has had about 1000 rounds of wolf polyformance non-corrosive steel cased polymer coated ammo fired through it. No cosmetic blemishes aside from the standard line from the safety. The bottom of the bolt carrier has been polished along with contact surfaces on trigger and hammer.the bad: bought the gun about 2 years ago and it functioned flawlessly with the 1000 round case of ammo. I let it sit for about 6 months and now if a fully loaded mag is used, it will fire but not cycle the next round. If the mag has about 20 rounds or less it will still function flawlessly. Maybe someone one that has experience working on ak47's can fix this easily or a gunsmith could probably fix it for cheap, it could be that the mag springs are worn out or buildup of the polymer coating from the ammo due to a hot chamber causing the extracted casing to slow down the bolt, I don't know. I've been sitting on this trying to decide if I want to fix it or sell it, but I have decided to sell it and buy a stamped ak. When purchasing this rifle, you are agreeing to purchase it with the above stated functioning issue. I will only sell face to face with someone that is a ga resident with a valid gadl and is willing to show it. A bill of sale is not necessary, but if you want one, I would be willing to provide one.

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing.

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****    The Daniel Defense Ambush .308 in Realtree Camo is the new benchmark for anyone demanding an accurate, fast-handling, hard-hitting platform capable of taking down any North American big-game animal. Built from the ground up, this rifle has been engineered to help you harvest that trophy with the precision and dependability you expect from Daniel Defense. At its core is a free-floating, 18” Cold Hammer Forged barrel, which comes standard with the DD Superior Suppression Device Extended, for reduced muzzle-flash. This top-quality barrel connects directly to the upper receiver through a robust 4-Bolt Connection System with a patent pending barrel extension resulting in increased stability, better accuracy, and reduced weight. Ambidextrous controls make operating the .308 Ambush comfortable and convenient for both right- and left-handed shooters. You can easily drop the magazine, release the bolt, or operate the safety selector from either side of the receiver. The charging handle is ambidextrous as well and also user-configurable—you can set up either side of the charging handle with a larger or smaller handle to accommodate magnified optics or iron sights for a snag-free setup. The water-transfer printing process (also known as hydro-graphics) of this finish makes for a durable, uniform coating that holds up to and resists even the harshest environments. The Ambush is fed with an optimized bolt carrier group featuring a redesigned geometry and a new extremely slick, low-friction coating to ensure smooth, reliable feeding. As a sportsman, you have an obligation to take clean shots on your game, and a crisp 2-Stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) Trigger gives you the advantage you need to deliver a precise, on-target shot that’ll bring down that elusive trophy you worked so hard to get in your sights.  We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $2,754.

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com ***** SIG SAUER presents the long awaited SIG716 Tactical Rifle line for Law Enforcement professionals and civilians. Chambered in 7.62 X 51 mm (.308 Winchester), the SIG716 Tactical Rifle line is built with the tightest tolerances, making these rifles some of the most accurate and durable AR-10 type models on the market today. The SIG716 rifles are gas-piston operated with a 3 round-position (4-position optional) gas valve – a design that keeps the receiver free of firing residue for optimum reliability under adverse conditions and extended firing. The SIG716 select-fire modes include single-shot, 3-burst, and fully automatic (Law Enforcement only). The fire control/safety selector is an ambidextrous design for easy accessibility and improved safety. All models,  including the SIG716 12.5” Tactical Patrol, the SIG716 16.0” Patrol, the SIG716 16” Precision Marksman and the SIG716 20.0” Precision Sniper, come standard with a free-floating, aluminum-alloy, quadrail forend with four M1913 Picatinny rails for lighting and laser-mounted options. Barrels are chrome-lined for extreme durability and corrosion resistance. The 16”  Precision Marksman and 20” Precision Sniper models feature heavy match barrels. The muzzle is threaded with a standard (0.625x24TPI) pattern to accommodate a wide variety of flash suppressors, muzzle brakes and sound suppressor devices. The lower receiver is machined from a 7075-T6 Aircraft grade aluminum forging. The upper receiver, machined from 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum, provides an integral M1913 Picatinny rail to accommodate a wide range of optical sight solutions. The upper and lower receivers feature a black, hard coat anodize finish. Back-up iron sights are standard on all SIG716 Tactical Rifles.   We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $1979.99.

This rifle also has a small defect; it looks like my father made a bad drill for the bidpod mount when he was building this (I've included a picture of this). The defect will be covered if a bipod is put on. I don't have any magazines for this rifle. Background check required. I can meet anywhere within the city to make the sale.
