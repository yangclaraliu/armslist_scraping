According to research, the model is supposed to be near the cylinder or on the arm for the cylinder. In this case, there is a 67 on the cylinder and a 67R on the arm of the cylinder. Taurus Revolvers began coming into the United States in the late 1960s. Ten Years later, with chronic scarcity and inflated pricing on the original Smith & Wesson revolvers, in this case the Model 15, the Brazilian copies filled an important niche and earned our respect. At some point in the early 1970s, an Atlanta Importer, Spesco Corporation, earned Taurus Import Rights until International Distributors in Miami took it around 1976/1977. Here is a classic early Taurus, with 67R stamped model designation. It is the ancestor to the Taurus Falcon, later numbered model 82. Manufacturer was Forjas Taurus of Porto Alegre, Brazil, and so marked. Type is 5 screw Smith & Wesson Pre-K frame copy, traditional double and single action revolver. Barrel is 4 inch medium Pencil type, pinned into the frame, with high serrated blade front sight, and matching windage and elevation adjustable rear sight. Chambering is .38 Special, six round cylinder capacity, and note the early serrated style fluting to the cylinders and the beveled flute edges. Grips are Brazilian Goncalo, Magna service type, with cut checkering and silver Spesco medallions. We rate it as Excellent, barrel has no signs of wear and cylinder is tight and spins freely. Bore, cylinder chambers, and mechanism are all bright and clean. We do not believe this revolver has been fired much. Timing and lockup are excellent and correct on all six positions, both single and double action. This early Taurus is not only attractive and serviceable, it is eminently collectable. Replacement pricing on the nearest surviving Smith & Wesson Ancestor, the model 67, is upwards of $700.00 and more. We have this priced at 350.00 which is reasonable for this collectors piece. We might just add it to our own personal collection if we dont sell it.We can Ship to a FFL Dealer in your area if Buyer is a Non Pa Resident. Payment with authorized credit card through our store.

It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder, case-hardened trigger, and case-hardened bobbed hammer. This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. This thirty-four year old classic revolver is a great shooter. I put sixty-five problem-free rounds through it last night at the gun range before bringing it home and cleaning it up for its pictures. I have a couple more pictures available for the asking or if you want to have these pics let me know.    Local face-to-face cash sale only.

World class gunsmith and master in mechanics and machinist knowledge... This beautiful 45 is all steel with a sweet two tone special edition combo making this a very unique and extraordinary Colt 45.

For those that know the 1911 and the top lister gunsmith names, then you know the MAN, DAVE HELTON. I can personally guarantee it as fact that when you perform a real RC Hardness test on this gun compared to a Wilson Combat or a DannyboyWesson, then you will with out doubt find the Colt Commander steel is a much Harder longer lasting metal gun, than a Wilson Combat. Yes. The Slide Watson. The frame sir. And the barrel Madame. This of course is science (ladies and gentlemen) and cannot be faked. The custom serrated front grip strap all done by Dave in Washington State, back just before he was selling his shop and training Dave Nielsen of Southridge Arms. Dave Helton was quite versatile in flexing his style and perfection into this 45. So please closely review the very self explanitory photos of the fine gun and it's impecable condition. As seen in this very gun, Dave had a touch for Virgil Tripp's incredible style and skills with a twist of Ed Brown's more foundational design lines... He also had some Egw type techniques among other original Helton tricks and techniques he rendered into this highly accurized tool for defense. This well balanced, custom built combat 45 is fully tuned to run very accurately without compromising reliability."

You cant buy or build this quality of a pistol for even close to this, I found similar pistols that had no sight and the wrong compensator for this price used and not as good of shape. My gun has no wear or scratches. Very meticulous owner. The Buckmark is also a superior design to the Ruger because of the open breech design which allows all the carbon to blow out instaed of staying in the pistol like the Ruger design. Much more reliable. Less cleaning less maintenance, better reliability."

Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. The Golden Boy has a 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, brass buttplate, with a gleaming Brasslite receiver and barrel band. The classic styling will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America's Old West, when company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original Henry lever action rifle. Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. Small game hunters and plinkers will appreciate its substantial 6.75 lb. heft. It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness, and left-handed shooters can safely use any of Henry's lever action rifles.     FAMILY:Golden Boy  MODEL:Goldenboy  TYPE:Rifle  ACTION:Lever Action  FINISH:Blue  STOCK/FRAME:Wood Stock  STOCK/GRIPS:Wood      CALIBER/GAUGE:22 LR  CAPACITY:16+1  BARREL:20""  OVERALL LENGTH:38.5""  RATE-OF-TWIST:1-in-16""  RECEIVER:Brasslite      SIGHTS:Open Rifle Sights  SAFETY:Half Cock  ADDL INFO:Brass Buttplate and Receiver  ADDL INFO:Octagon Barrel"
