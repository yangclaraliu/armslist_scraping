Vltor BCM Gunfighter Mod 4 Medium Charging Handle Assembly Ambidextrous AR-15 Aluminum Black Vltor BCM Gunfighter Mod 4 Medium Charging Handle Assembly Ambidextrous AR-15 Aluminum. Vltor products Features Extruded latching handle Smooth operation Ambidextrous latch The Vltor BCM Gunfighter Ambidextrous Charging Handle was engineered from the ground up and serves as a high end upgrade for an existing charging handle or as a replacement for a worn out or broken charging handle. Some of the enhancements that have been engineered into the Bravo Company Manufacturing Gunfighter include an internal redesign which redirects the force from the roll pin that holds the latch in place, to the body of the charging handle. By building a backstop for the extended latch to rest against while under a full load, the force is redirected from the roll pin to the back of the charging handle body. This prolongs the life of the charging handle and reduces the possibility of failure in the field. Machined from 7075 T6 Billet Aluminum and hard coat anodized (per Mil-A-8625F, Type III, Class 2), this charging handle is sure to improve the appearance, performance and durability of your modern sporting rifle.

The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gauge 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.Please contact me directly on guns4sale675@outlook.com"
