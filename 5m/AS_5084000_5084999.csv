I'm going to try and save some time by saying that the first question I will ask you is if you can legally own a pistol in Alabama. If the answer is no, don't waste either of our time by emailing me.  Secondly, I will go down on price without the ALG trigger and the bakelite mag, I would take $525. I am located in Alabaster,  I am willing to meet halfway, but I will not drive more than an hour from Birmingham. I'm selling my Pap 92 to purchase new reloading and competition gear. It has an ALG Defense AKT, Izzy bakelite mag and two other Yugo bolt hold open magazines. It has a sling adapter,  detent pin installed and the muzzle device cut free. It will come with the AKT and a Tapco G2 double hook trigger,  a factory style plum grip  (not the plum Magpul Grip shown in the picture) and the original AK grip. The only trades I am really interested in would be a Dillon Square Deal B, full size non-American made AKs, CZs, Sigs or a few others. I'm currently not looking for Glocks, M&Ps, or Taurus.  You must provide a valid Alabama DL and I would prefer to see a pistol permit. I will require a signed bill of sale.  I'm kind of shocked at some of the responses I've received and I'm reposting this to, hopefully, narrow things down a bit.  I am willing to trade up or down with boot on either side.  Thanks for looking!"

It's a 1967 No maker affectionately called a ""Sneak"" by some afficionados. It's built on a 1916 Tula receiver This rifle shows typical post-war features. Wear is consistent with an ""Unissued"" rifle, though there are some genuine Finnish army issue rack scuffs. Barrel is pristine and tight, stock is beautiful. All numbers ""Match"" in typical Finn manner. I have never shot it. Please note that this rifle comes with a green leather Finnish army sling and a genuine Finn M39 cleaning kit. Interested? Want to see more pix? Questions? I prefer Face to face in South Carolina, but I will ship to an FFL for an additional fee. Note: There is no category for Finn army surplus - so I picked Tikka.

This all-steel pistol shoots the powerful 9X18 Makarov cartridge, inexpensive and readily available everywhere. It can be fired both double and single action. It is NOT a .380 or 9mm Parabellum. There is a slide-release button on the left side of the frame, which makes reloading fast. Reloads can be accomplished by inserting a full magazine and hitting the slide release button.  Clean, simple, not very expensive, and it works. What more could you ask of a pocket auto?  This would be a perfect pistol for personal, home or automobile security use.  Contact me so we can meet and let you inspect this Makarov. I know you won't be disappointed. The price is $350 cash only, and you must show me your Oklahoma Driver's license."

M855A1 rounds or other ammo to help complete a deal in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54. 1oz.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal. Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area or I can ship for $30 more.  Thanks for looking!"

Carbines w/Tech Sights (TSR200), Uncle Mikes swivels and USGI slings. These are Appleseed ""Liberty Training Rifles"" and perfect for developing fundamentals. Each rifle also comes with two factory 10rd magazines. One rifle has the original Carbine stock and metal trigger guard, the other has the OEM ""sporter"" stock that's a bit thinner and longer and features the newer plastic trigger guard. Both have had the auto bolt release modification done (not full auto - just allows the bolt to release without using that finicky release lever) and are in fine working order.
These rifles were loaned out and shot at training events by everyone from little kids to senior citizens. They're in fine mechanical order (and super accurate!) but do show signs of use. They have lots of life left in them and I'm selling/trading in hopes someone will use them to train their kids or use for training classes. I don't get to loan them out anymore, hoping to find someone who will. 
Looking for trades of full size 9mm pistol (Glock 17 or Beretta 92 preferred), .308 bolt gun (Rem 700, Win 70, Savage 10, etc.), AR/AK, PSL, or similar military/historical firearms.

557,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5084557,For Sale/Trade:  New Faxon ARAK-21 Upper Rec. in 5.56,"Bellevue, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,100","Listed On: Friday, April 29, 2016",Rifles,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,5.56×45mm NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Note: As this listing is for an upper only, no transfer or FFL in required.  For sale is a new Faxon ARAK-21 Upper Receiver which is said to combine the best elements of the AK-47 with those of the AR-15.  The platform is built around a long stroke piston system which is described further below.  Note that the pictures show both the New in box upper receiver that is listed here in addition to my other ARAK-21 that is shown as it is currently built out on a lower receiver.
 
The ARAK-21® is a gas piston actuated, complete upper receiver assembly designed to seamlessly interface with the standard AR-15 platform.  The total extent of the interface is simply the take down pin, and the pivot pin.  The new ARAK-21® upper receiver offers you all its features with no change to your current lower receiver and can be installed in less than one minute with no tools.
 
Your ARAK-21® upper receiver will be shipped to you with one “Barrel Assembly Unit” (BAU), or two, depending on which package you purchase.
 
The BAU is comprised of the barrel, gas block, muzzle brake, gas piston, gas adjuster, and barrel trunnion.  The only removable part of this assembly is the gas adjuster knob.  The gas adjuster knob has 4 settings.  Three of the settings allow different gas flows for optimum operation, and one setting blocks the gas flow for a single shot operation.
 
The upper receiver includes the charging block, standard charging handle, lower forearm with screws, three aluminum full length picatinny rails, three insulating shims, bolt carrier assembly, lower recoil lug with spring guide rod, and dual recoil spring system.  Along with your new ARAK-21® upper receiver you will receive your owners manual, and two allen wrenches that will fit the screws that attach the lower forearm, and the front picatinny rails.
 
Due to the unique and innovative features of the ARAK-21® upper receiver, there are very few parts that are interchangeable with a standard AR-15.  The firing pin, extractor spring, and ejector spring are the only parts that are standard and interchangeable with an AR-15 upper receiver.
 
Other features include:◦The upper receiver is fully machined from an aircraft grade 6061-T6 aluminum billet in a one piece design that incorporates a full length picatinny rail (Mil-STD-1913) on the top and three additional rails on the muzzle end of the receiver, making it a full M4 style quad rail upper.  The top picatinny rail is laser engraved for optic placement.  There are also half-length picatinny rails available.◦12 ½” length BAU is available in 5.56, heavy profile. 16” and 20” length BAU’s are available in both the 5.56 and 300 BLK. There are two profiles to choose from, medium and heavy.  BAU’s can be interchanged in less than 3 minutes by removing the (6) captive allen screws on the bottom rail using the enclosed allen wrench.  ◦Long stroke variable setting gas piston system.  There are three options for gas flow, and one for no gas flow.  This allows for single shot operation.  There is also a clean out port for the gas block between the gas cylinder, and the barrel.
 
◦Charging handle is ambidextrous, non-reciprocating, foldable, spring returned and is easily relocated from left to right side without tools by the operator.
 
◦Model “39” Eight (8) lug bolt design with involute profile for both right and left hand versions.  The extractor is positioned at 3 o’clock.  This allows for a left hand version to use the same bolt by simply removing the cam pin and rotating 180 degrees and reinstalling the cam pin.◦Self-contained firing pin retention system enclosed in a rectangular bolt carrier that no longer requires a cotter pin.◦Bolted in hardened steel rail system for the bolt carrier to ride on.  This allows a metal on metal wear surface for better wear characteristics and a much smoother operation.◦The ARAK-21® system allows for a folding stock to be added, as our recoil system does not extend beyond the upper receiver to fully operate.  This eliminates the noise and feel of the buffer tube cycling back and forth."

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK light pull trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall crisp break. Typically striker fired guns have a pre travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. The VP9 you have a less than noticeable pre travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable back straps and six side panels accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest state of the art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left or right handed shooters.A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine 15 and 10 round capacity available.The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014.SKU: 700009UPC: REDACTED64"

I’ll either send you pics via email or add them tomorrow. I had this MP5 assessed by a local gun dealer for the police department and he said its 98%. Gun comes with extra stock. Also, I investigated further online mostly using an in depth article at http://machinegunpriceguide.com/html/hk_nfa_conv.HTM by expert Thomas T. Hoel of Tactical Advantage 2002, which does not explicitly apply to MP5’s but is has many comparable parts and facts. According to Thomas Hoel, after inspecting the sear, it appears to be a rare PREMIUM FBI S-F ambidextrous pack.On top is a semi-auto pack to fit a clip-on style mount. On the bottom is an altered FBI S-F pack frame which was originally configured the same as a machine gun pack. The FBI S-F ambidextrous packs arevery uncommon and command a premium price.The serial number is on the gun probably meaning is a registered receiver. The gun comes with double 40 bullet 9mm clip and a smaller clip as well. I have ~100 rounds 9mm stray bullets that also go with it. All the parts are in the pictures. I just received my active ATF FFL license (tax stamp) so this gun is licensed with the ATF form 5’s for the gun and a form 5 for the silencer. I inherited the guns in Texas and have my cousins form 4 paperwork as well when he purchased the gun used in 1989. Average Selling price for MP5’s as of June 2015 (adding a little as prices have gone up) is ~$33k as my chart is from June 2015 not 2016. I’m selling for the same OBO. The rare PREMIUM FBI S-F ambidextrous pack, adds extra value to the gun and should sell for a premium on a resell especially in this market.Sell is complete AFTER I receive funding for the gun. I’ll drop it off at any authorized Class III dealer via permission ATF/ NFA permissions. Feel free to call if you have any questions or leave a message and I will call you right back if I’m not available. Highest regards,"

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol"
