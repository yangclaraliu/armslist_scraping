The Automag III is also called the “flame thrower” for the fire that comes out of the barrel when you shoot!  I have another one of these hand-cannons that I shoot and keep for self-defense – it is an awesome weapon, never jams, extremely powerful (the .30-carbine goes through body armor, cracks engine blocks, etc), never rusts, and the gun with its 6.5 inch barrel is super accurate!  Try a hollow point or soft point 30-carbine load, it packs a wallop!  But, then it should, this is rifle ammunition in a pistol. Go ahead, make Dirty Harry’s day, buy this hand-cannon.
 
My selling price of $1,400 is firm.  In fact, my selling price for a FACTORY NEW, NEVER FIRED AMT AUTOMAG III is less than a used Automag!  But don’t take my word for it, see a typical selling price of a used Automag for yourself, go to: https://www.gunsamerica.com/910511780/AMT-IAI-Auto-Mag-III-30-carbine-6-1-2-barrel-original-box-copy-of-manual-1-mag-Millett-adj-site-rar.htm

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

The 2nd K should stand for 'Kompakt', indicating a shorter barrel.The revolving type firing mechanism, flying firing pin and the rotating safety latch are incorporated into the slide. The barrel latching in the slide is done via three latching ribs. The pistol is equipped with an external hammer with a safety rest to avoid accidental discharge. The revolving type firing mechanism and the external hammer make it possible to fire the first shot directly by pulling the trigger with a round in the chamber, while the gun is unlatched with the released hammer. The hammer may be cocked with the thumb also. The revolving safety mechanism in the slide allows safe loading the latched pistol."
