I love this gun and have put nearly 500 flawless rounds through it. This is my daily carry, so it does have some very slight holster wear. I would like to do a straight trade for another nice 9mm such as Sig's, CZ's, Beretta's, or possibly Glock's. Open to both SA and DA. May be open to a 2 for one trade if you have a couple cheaper firearms you'd like to offer, but one has to be a 9mm handgun and please no High Points, Jiminez, etc. Just not my cup of tea. The gun comes with the box, three 17rd. mags, the two back straps for the grips, lock, and first test fire shell. The etching color fill is just red nail polish, but is very durable and easily removed by me if you so desire. The sights are not night sights, but rather fluorescent enamel paint. I'll throw in an Alien Gear IWB holster if you have a IWB holster in your trade. I value the FNS9 at $450 and the holster at $25, so the whole package being $475 or roughly equal trade value. I'd like to meet in the West Valley (101 & I10 area). Must have valid AZ ID, non felon, and wiling to sign BOS. Please respond with pics or your trade offers. Thank you.

It has the Colt factory letter which states it was made in 44 WCF caliber and that it came with the 4 3/4's inch barrel which it has and with the correct 2 line address. Its in very good condition with an old factory refinish and hammer. Probably sent back to Colt in the early 1960's as that's the type of hammer it has. Since then its been used some and retains 80% of the finish, quite alot of the case coloring on the right side but the left side is mostly dark. It has some very lite surface pitting on the edges, probably got left in the holster and the leather had some moisture in it to cause the pitting. Its only on about 10% of the gun, the bore is good with no pitting inside at all. The markings are all legible and all correct. Its serial number is 207xxx, made in 1901 and it has the factory letter, it was shipped to a dealer in Kansas. The grips are original Colt hard rubber grips and they are well worn, but no cracks or bad chips. They fit the gun very good and look original to me, worn but still nice. Overall the gun is great looking,old but still with lots of case color and blue,agreat action and bore,not perfect but not priced like a high condition SAA would be either."

It has the Colt factory letter which states it was made in 44 WCF caliber and that it came with the 4 3/4's inch barrel which it has and with the correct 2 line address. Its in very good condition with an old factory refinish and hammer. Probably sent back to Colt in the early 1960's as that's the type of hammer it has. Since then its been used some and retains 80% of the finish, quite alot of the case coloring on the right side but the left side is mostly dark. It has some very lite surface pitting on the edges, probably got left in the holster and the leather had some moisture in it to cause the pitting. Its only on about 10% of the gun, the bore is good with no pitting inside at all. The markings are all legible and all correct. Its serial number is 207xxx, made in 1901 and it has the factory letter, it was shipped to a dealer in Kansas. The grips are original Colt hard rubber grips and they are well worn, but no cracks or bad chips. They fit the gun very good and look original to me, worn but still nice. Overall the gun is great looking,old but still with lots of case color and blue,agreat action and bore,not perfect but not priced like a high condition SAA would be either."

The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.

It has the Colt factory letter which states it was made in 44 WCF caliber and that it came with the 4 3/4's inch barrel which it has and with the correct 2 line address. Its in very good condition with an old factory refinish and hammer. Probably sent back to Colt in the early 1960's as that's the type of hammer it has. Since then its been used some and retains 80% of the finish, quite alot of the case coloring on the right side but the left side is mostly dark. It has some very lite surface pitting on the edges, probably got left in the holster and the leather had some moisture in it to cause the pitting. Its only on about 10% of the gun, the bore is good with no pitting inside at all. The markings are all legible and all correct. Its serial number is 207xxx, made in 1901 and it has the factory letter, it was shipped to a dealer in Kansas. The grips are original Colt hard rubber grips and they are well worn, but no cracks or bad chips. They fit the gun very good and look original to me, worn but still nice. Overall the gun is great looking,old but still with lots of case color and blue,agreat action and bore,not perfect but not priced like a high condition SAA would be either."

It has the Colt factory letter which states it was made in 44 WCF caliber and that it came with the 4 3/4's inch barrel which it has and with the correct 2 line address. Its in very good condition with an old factory refinish and hammer. Probably sent back to Colt in the early 1960's as that's the type of hammer it has. Since then its been used some and retains 80% of the finish, quite alot of the case coloring on the right side but the left side is mostly dark. It has some very lite surface pitting on the edges, probably got left in the holster and the leather had some moisture in it to cause the pitting. Its only on about 10% of the gun, the bore is good with no pitting inside at all. The markings are all legible and all correct. Its serial number is 207xxx, made in 1901 and it has the factory letter, it was shipped to a dealer in Kansas. The grips are original Colt hard rubber grips and they are well worn, but no cracks or bad chips. They fit the gun very good and look original to me, worn but still nice. Overall the gun is great looking,old but still with lots of case color and blue,agreat action and bore,not perfect but not priced like a high condition SAA would be either."

These cars are notoriously reliable. Runs excellent; the car was driven from Ill. to S.C. without as much as a hiccup. It has all the bells and whistles from the factory. The drive train is the P71 Police Interceptor set-up. Interior is in good shape. There is one split in the passenger side back seat. Tires are in excellent shape. The only thing it needs is some very minor body work. After the vehicle was decommissioned, whoever took off the roller and push bars didn’t know what they were doing. But it amounts to nothing more than a few minor dings that can be easily fixed. There isn’t an ounce on rust or anything of that nature on the vehicle. The other item it needs is an idle air control valve on the throttle body, and the only thing this inhibits is when you start out on accelerating, there is a momentary hesitation, but it immediately goes away and the vehicle rock and rolls. I have the original title from Ill. Asking $4,200 trade value or $3,700 cash or best reasonable offer. Please inbox me with any questions."
