I have 3 of these.  I am keeping at least one for myself, and will only sell/trade the other 2 to someone that appreciates them and their significance as much as I do... or I would have put them up on eBay a long time ago.

Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip. The KRISS Vector SDP is the Non-NFA semi-automatic pistol variant of the KRISS Vector platform. It features a short, threaded, 5.5” barrel. A rear quick detach sling point assists with carrying the firearm. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector SDP are the Magpul MBUS sights, full length picatinny top rail and a Glock Magazine.

The P320 slide rides on all-metal rails in a solid stainless steel frame for greater stability. The serialized unit lets you change everything from size to caliber to grip at will. With the P320's 3-point takedown safety system, once the magazine is removed and the slide is locked to the rear, shooters simply rotate the takedown lever for disassembly without tools or trigger manipulation. A smooth, crisp trigger pull and short tactile reset deliver heightened accuracy. SIG has given the Subcompact model a smaller slide assembly and grip frame for easy concealed carry."
