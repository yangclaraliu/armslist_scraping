Manufactured by Remington Rand in mid-1944, this pistol is completely original as shipped during World War II. All of the component parts are correct for the period of manufacture. The slide lock and 8-rib mainspring housing are of the later war serrated design. The barrel is correctly marked HS (High Standard subcontract) and is dulite blue finished. The ordnance crossed cannons cartouche, FJA acceptance stamp, P proofs, and serial number are all stamped through the finish, showing some burnishing, indicative of an original finish pistol. Likewise, the feed ramp is milled in the white. The original parkerized finish rates about 97-98% overall with only a small amount of normal handling wear. The grip straps retain virtually all of their finish and there is absolutely no rust or any pitting. The Keyes Fibre grips are correct and in excellent condition also, showing almost no wear. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is mirror bright with sharp rifling. The original finish/excellent condition ""R"" marked Risdon WWII contract magazines are correct as well. Remington Rand was a very innovative company, always seeking to improve manufacturing techniques. The company contributed greatly to the war effort and by war's end arguably made the highest quality 1911A1 pistol available. This is a super clean example of the best personal sidearm available during WWII. A great addition to any military collection!"

I've fired it anywhere from 200-300 times with wolf and 7n6 without issue.I believe it is a stamped receiver with chrome lined barrel but I'm not 100% and am not a self proclaimed AK expert.I also believe DDI took over Waffen Werks in Nashville, TN and now backs these rifles.Recent auctions on Gun Broker are going for and have sold these Waffen Werks 5.45 guns at over $700.If this doesn't sell now, I'll hold on and try again once Hillary is elected, likely asking some more :mad2:"

Until and unless I can get more, then this is all they wrote. Like all of them, it needs a good cleaning after long term storage. They were represented to be 1949 (or thereabouts) variant of the Classic Star Model B and is marked "" Modelo Super "" on the right hand side of the slide. I am not sure of the year of production. This particular gun appears to be in excellent working order, and in good cosmetic condition Has a very nice vintage look. The photos are of the actual firearm and acurately depict the condition. Most notable imperfection are scratches on the frame towards the top of the trigger area. The magazines look original and seem to also be in very good condition. Grips are in excellent shape. Has the feel and weight of the old Army 1911, but somehow feels more comfortable in the hand. This model was made from 1946 to the end of classic-model production in 1983. The major change in the ""Super Model "" over the standard model B is the replacement of the swinging link with a Sig 210 (or modern Star) style closed cam path integral to the barrel. Related to this, a full-length guide rod with captive spring, and a quick take down lever were added as well. All of these models have a magazine safety, but one slightly different from the later S variants, and the extractor is modified to double as a loaded-chamber indicator. Additionally, the sights are improved in shape to make them easier to see, and minor changes were made to the trigger system. I had an opportunity to take one of these to the range. It is very comfortable to shoot (I.M.O. with small to medium size hands). Nice and tight groups. For a 9mm, very easy to keep on target while pumping out rounds into the bullseye. Went through about 250 round of reloads and cheap Wolf's brand. My 12 year old son had a failure to eject and a double feed, but he was limp wristing it somewhat. He is a little guy, and a 9mm is a little too much for him to handle with consistency. Except for a minor mag issue, I had no problems of any kind. One of the mags didn't feed well at first, but was an easy fix after adjusting the lips (were spread a little to far apart - not uncommon for these firearms and will not be accepted as a basis for return). Unless you are using an unconventional grip, the arch on the top part of the back basically eliminates the chance of slide or hammer bite. ""Daddy"" likes and kept one for myself."

The Quarter Circle 10 Pistol MUR is a highly rigid upper receiver designed specifically for pistol-caliber AR builds. Our upper receiver design is derived from the operator-quality VLTOR MUR receiver, and with the help of VLTOR engineers and our pistol caliber expertise, we’ve brought you the only possible choice for a dedicated pistol-caliber build.
The Pistol MUR is constructed to mil-spec standards, but adds a thicker receiver wall for increased rigidity and strength in blowback operation. This sturdier design contributes to increased accuracy and reliability, extends the life of interfacing components, and is a perfect aesthetic match to our lower receivers. These are slick-side uppers, reducing weight and complexity by doing away with the superfluous forward assist. Furthermore, the QC10 Pistol MUR has a redesigned ejection port engineered with wider pistol cartridge cases in mind."

Borrowing proven 1911 ergonomics, they also have natural pointability that improve speed and accuracy while making them comfortable to shoot.
With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are perfect for backup and concealed carry. Features taken from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release lever and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the double action striker-fired trigger that provides a smooth, consistent pull. All Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum, while slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended so they cannot hang up, slide serrations are deep, and the large sights are quick to target. With a design so innovative it holds several patents, the critical advantages of Solo creates a new standard of performance.Contact us at Dan's in Richmond KY. REDACTED"

This gives you 3 options to choose from all at a steal of a deal saving $3,000 plus depending upon your choice!!!!!I bought it brand new last year and am the only owner. It has exactly 230 rounds through it and like all of my machines, they are completely broken down, cleaned and lubricated after EVERY use and in perfect condition.   All 3 packages include all items mentioned, I am just modifying the ammo amount and reducing the price also due to requests that I have gotten. I noticed that Buds gun shop has the exact same set up without any ammo in the exact same model 14019 for $14,669 and I have seen it priced as high as $15,000 at other places online.   Rumors are that these are going to go up in price with all of the crazy stuff going on, and this is certainly an investment that will continue to increase in value over time. Hope you enjoy the pictures, I have more that I can send via email if needed. Look forward to all emails, comments and responses. Have a great day!!!!"

I purchased this brand new from Impact Guns and it has sat untouched since I bought it. The gun has never been fired, cleaned, or taken apart. It comes to you exactly how it came from the factory. Complete with all paperwork and warranty information along with an extra set of black grips that comes with all you see in the case. These are very hard to find with the full rail. Since it is a handgun you must be 21 years old and a PA resident. We will have to meet at an FFL dealer of your choice to conduct transfer paperwork and background check. Cash only, no trades.Feel free to contact me with any questions and thanks for looking!"
