Pictures seen here: http://kalispell.craigslist.org/spo/REDACTED.htmlAbsolutely excellent condition Kifaru backpack. I purchased the pack less than 2 years ago for $662, but recently adopted a 2 year old and became a dad, so I need to sell my overnight gear. You’ll receive everything that came with the frame and bag. They have not been modified at all. I’ll also provide the receipt (attached) so you can be covered by the Kifaru warranty. I could not find any signs of wear to photograph. I’m keeping the separately purchased accessories for my day pack. I’m not ready to give up hunting altogether. I don’t want to discourage you from using the Highcamp as a daypack, however. The Highcamp was originally my daypack in case I knocked an elk down, and it worked great because it cinches down so small but can expand, but I’ll have to settle for something else.I’m an ultralight hunter and this was definitely pack of choice. The frame weighs 38oz. The bag weighs 32oz. Both have incredible versatility and modularity, and can handle a lot weight, comfortably. This is by far the best pack I have ever owned. It isn’t even in the same league as the Eberlestock and Badlands packs I’ve owned. If you do enough research and talk to enough people, you’ll find it universally accepted that Kifaru packs outshine the other top tier packs as well, such as Mystery Ranch, Kuiu, etc. You just cannot beat the comfort and load bearing capacity of Kifaru. If you’re on the fence about which brand to go with, I’d spend some time on rokslide.com and read reviews. You’ll find quickly that many of the members, especially the admin and senior staff, are dedicated hikers and outdoorsman and know what they’re talking about. They always try to be neutral between brands, but, as you’ll see, almost all of them give kifaru packs the advantage. This universal approval is what drove me to buy kifaru, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. Outside of rokslide, if you are talking with someone who has tried a variety of packs, you’ll find that almost all of them swear by Kifaru.A good place to start for reviews would be here: http://www.rokslide.com/forums/showthread.php?5249-Kifaru-Mystery-Ranch-KUIU-BadlandsRokslide member Bitteroot Bulls did an extensive and unbiased comparison on some of the top of the line packs, and, in the end, admitted that Kifaru edged out the competition.

I think it's the softst shooting .45 I've ever shot. Not quite as soft as a 9, but kind of between what a 9 and a 45 feel like. The safety is also a decocker. Look up the reviews on a Beretta PX4 Storm .45. Also the lightest full sized .45 I've ever picked up. Only a few hundred rounds through it, so just barely broken in properly. Accurate, dependable and easy/fun to shoot. First shot is double action, then turns into single action. Amazing single action trigger!!!Reply through AL, or for quicker response you can text me @ REDACTED. Again, will only sell today at this price!!!"

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability. The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. At just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck.The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.

Not only do handloaders maintain control of the ammunition assembling process, but there’s an overwhelming feeling of self satisfaction when you knock over that plate, hammer the X ring or drop that buck of a lifetime with ammunition that you handloaded.LOCK-N-LOAD®: Reloading is all about control. The patented Hornady® Lock-N-Load technology offers complete control, allowing you to change dies and begin loading another caliber in seconds.ELIMINATE HASSLE: The Hornady Lock-N-Load system features quick tool change technology that allows you to switch rifle and pistol dies, powder dies, check dies, bullet seaters or crimp dies without having to change the whole die head. This unique technology is featured on our Lock-N-Load Classic and Lock-N-Load AP presses. In addition, Hornady conversion bushings can convert other brands to the Lock-N-Load system."
