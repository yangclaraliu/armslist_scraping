Made by Sarsilmaz in Turkey, and imported by Sar Arms ( a division of EAA in Cocoa Fl. ) The SAR-B6-9 is one heck of a nice little pistol.
It features a polymer frame with a stainless steel slide so it is completely corrosion resistent making it perfect for concealed carry. Ultra smooth slide release. Traditional double action with a very smooth double action trigger pull and a crisp release when the hammer is cocked. It also has a half cock feature that allows for a shortend double action trigger and a great option between hammer down and hammer back carry. Safety acts as a cock and lock in single action but also prevents trigger pull in hammer down and half cock positions. Mid range compact size is excellent for concealed or open carry. Pistol features a 3.8"" barrel and comes with a 13 Round mag. Design is based on a CZ-75 and all CZ-75 based mags will fit although the 17 round full frame mags will extend outside the frame. 3 dot sights. Textured grips.

$1,950 firm for everything or higher in trade value.  I can also take some more off if you don't want the MI sights or all the mags, just let me know.I might consider trades, but only if it's a good deal as I don't need anything right now.  If it's not a good deal as far as the value goes, then there is no reason to offer it, sorry, just trying to save everyone some time.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal.  Are you wanting the rifle, all the mags and the sights or?? and are you wanting a straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns and bolt-guns.A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Ammo in common rifle and pistol calibers to help with a deal, but I have PLENTY of ammo, so keep this in mind before offering.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics to help, but I have nice optics sitting now for future projects.Ftf in the Dallas area or will ship insured for $40 more and must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

$880 firm in cash or higher in trade value.  No hurry to sell, just wanting to free up some cash to finish some projects.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

Some bluing wear but otherwise very nice condition. Beautiful walnut grips. One 7 round magazine included. Serial number 86XXX. Upper sideplate maked as follows: DREYSE Rheinische Metallwaaren & Maschinenfabrik ABT. SOMMERDA.The pistol had an interesting feature for the time: when the gun was ready to fire, the firing pin projected through the back of the breech block, serving as an early handgun-cocking indicator. For cleaning, the frame, receiver and slide pivoted forward on a pin in front of the trigger guard, Breaking the action open for easy cleaning. I have fired the gun, and it is surprisingly actuate and fun to shoot! No failure to feeds or malfunctions of any kind. It operates on a simple blow-back design, but of a very unusual design. The barrel is fixed to the frame (probably why it is so accurate), and the recoil mechanism is fitted above the barrel. It can be hinged and open by moving a small lever, and can completely field disassembled without tools.The blueing is in good condition, with a bright shinny barrel and good rifling. The grips look great. This would make a great addition to your pre-WWII significant arms collection.Legal transfers only (stupid WA law), although it can be sold directly to C&R FFL license holders. There is a place in south Skagit County that does transfers for $25.  I travel from time to time as far south as Seattle and more often north to Bellingham and could probably meet along the way.  I can also ship to your FFL for $30.I can send more pictures; Airmslist only allows me to post one picture.Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

244,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5241244,For Sale:  Quality .270 Ammo Federal Remington 270,"Dallas, Dallas, Texas",FREE,"Listed On: Saturday, March 5, 2016",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 20 boxes of quality ammo, 6 boxes(110rds. to be exact) of Remington 140gr. Premier Core-Lokt Ultra Bonded PSP and 14 boxes(270rds. to be exact) of Federal 140gr. Vital Shock Nosler Accubond.  Can't find either of this 140gr. ammo in stock anywhere right now, so this may be it??, but when it was available the Remington sold for around $30ea. and the Federal was $35+ea.   
$580 FIRM for all the ammo, please do not offer less, you will not get a response, I don't need to sell it and I'm sure I'll get another .270 rifle in the future.  This ammo sold new for $680+ before any tax and/or shipping online, so at $580 it saves you at least $120.  Or I will split it up, $150 for the 110rds. of Remington and $450 for the 270rds. of Federal or may do $150 for 90rds. of the Federal.  Also, I've had several trade offers for USED firearms that sell new for around $500-$550.  Just because it is ammo and not a firearm, I am not going to straight trade $700 worth of new factory ammo for something that sells used for $450-$500, maybe, I am going to need a little cash on top. 
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal as far as the value goes, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now, pretty simple.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  We can do current price to current price on ammo.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Garland area or will ship via UPS for $25 more.  Thanks for looking!"

The blueing is in pretty good condition, with some wear and discoloration from the years. The faux stag grips are also in great condition. Comes with one factory mag. I have fired the pistol with several ammo types, and it operates great. No failure to feeds or malfunctions of any kind. It has the feel of a small version of a full-size browning or 1911; I get the feeling that is would operate underwater or after being dropped in mud. The safety lever also holds the slide back, then the gun can be disassembled without any tools. These pistols regularly saw service in the French army during WWI.This would make a great addition to your pre-WWII significant arms collection.   Price is firm, but I may be interested in interesting antique, muzzleloading or unique firearm trades.   Sorry, but I'm not interested in non-firearm trades.Legal transfers only, although it can be sold directly to C&R FFL license holders. There is a place in south Skagit County that does transfers for $25. I travel from time to time as far south as Seattle and more often north to Bellingham and could probably meet along the way.

The blueing is in good condition, as is the rifling. I fired the gun, and it functions correctly. What really makes this gun nice is the real stag grips with H&R seal in center. These were produced from 1916 into the 1920's. Initially, the .32 was a virtual copy of the Webley 1906, with internal improvements being made by H&R to the Webley design. Featuring a concealed hammer, 3.5"" barrel, eight-round capacity and both grip and slide-mounted safeties, the H&R version was an excellent weapon that never caught on with the American public. With sales slow, production was halted in 1924, but the pistol remained in H&R's catalog as late as 1939. Popular with collectors today, this is regarded by many as the highest-quality H&R firearms ever produced.This would make a great addition to your pre-WWII arms of interest collection.   Price is firm, but I may be interested in interesting antique, muzzleloading or unique firearm trades. Sorry, but I'm not interested in non-firearm trades.Legal transfers only (stupid WA law), although it can be sold directly to C&R FFL license holders. There is a place in south Skagit County that does transfers for $25. I travel from time to time as far south as Seattle and more often north to Bellingham and could probably meet along the way. I can also ship to your FFL for about $30.Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

Thanks for taking a look. Up for sale today is a durable and rugged battle rifle chambered in 7.62 NATO. This particular rifle is no beauty queen but she will hit what you point her at. From the best of my knowledge and the collective information I've gathered from the interweb, this rifle is labeled as an L1A1, though she has many metric parts. There is a bit of light surface rust on the rifle, nothing damaging or that a good scrubbing with a brush and CLP shouldn't fix. It was assembled on a great Hesse receiver that accepts metric mags only. 21"" metric bipod cut barrel with metric gas block and front sight. She sports a wonderful set of metal STG58 handguards that are bipod cut and have STG58 bipods resting nicely in them. The barrel has nearly new looking bore that is bright and shiny but does not have threads cut at the muzzle. There is one small spot of pitting on the outside of the barrel, everywhere else on the barrel is in great condition.The lower receiver is metric as well tho has a L1A1 trigger assembly inside and L1A1 rear sight. L1A1 plastic pistol grip and butt stock.I've not shot it but the previous owner shot about 40 rounds thru her. I purchased this because I felt the need to own a 7.62 battle rifle but decided to build an AR in 7.62x39.The current price of $850 is as the rifle comes with SIX mags and 120 rounds of ammo. The price is slightly negotiable and trades will be entertained. Not looking for anything in particular so send an offer, the worst I will say is no thank you."

-original Romanian wood furniture with original factory finish (wood has some dings and nicks)
-original cleaning rod
-currently has black US K-VAR grip
-comes with US Palm 30 round mag (not pictured)-of course it takes standard 7.62x39 AK mags and drums 
-comes with original manuals -added rare Chinese Military folding spike bayonet for AKM. This is heavy duty and pins to the front sight base. The Chinese Military had produced these for their newer AK's to give them the same feature as their Type 56 AK's. I bought the bayonet new in cosmilean 15 years ago for $100. They had already put the ban on importing from China before then and I should have bought more!
-bayonet functions and looks perfect on this AK, it can also be removed by driving out the retaining pins. You could then put it on a different AK. -also included is an original chinese wood lower handgaurd with factory under folding bayonet notch cut out. This is the correct lower handgaurd for this bayonet. It is brand new, never installed. (Not pictured)
 
Rilfe has about 1000 rounds through it, which is nothing for these guns. Always cleaned and oiled after use. This is a used AK, and as you would expect, there is wear on the finish in several spots. Of course there is no rust, corrosion or damage. Always taken care of and kept in controlled safe. I require bill of sale for my own personal records OR FFL on your dime.

$1,060 firm in cash or may look at trades.I might consider trades, but only if it's a good deal as I don't need anything right now.  If it's not a good deal as far as the value goes, then there is no reason to offer it, sorry, just trying to save everyone some time.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal. Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns and bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.

This one needs to have a swab run down it. I just have not had the time. Has less than normal the amount of wear and the barrel is a number 2 gauge! Wow. The bolt has a spray impact coating that is designed to keep the bolt clean over time. This coating will wear off or can be removed by a light bolt polishing, but there is no need. THe rifle is ready to shoot now and very happy in rough conditions. Barrel at the muzzle has been machined to accept a silencer, but not threaded. Please note. This gun is heavy and would easily work with a bipod. Nevada residents or FFL only, No felons. Thanks"

$900 firm in cash or higher in trade value, if you can find it in stock at the same price or cheaper, go for it.  Will not respond to lower cash offers or ridiculous trade offers.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area or will ship for $30 more.  Thanks for looking!"

Magpul MOE furniture - buttstock and pistol grip. With the DDM4V5 Complete upper, that means the Bolt Carrier group is a Daniel Defense BCG that is full auto rated, MPI, Shot peened. Barrel is a chrome lined, cold hammer forged, 1/7 twist barrel. Flash hider is a Daniel Defense ""flash suppressor"". Upper receiver engraved ""5.56"" and ""DDM4V5"". Quad Rail is a Daniel Defense Lite Rail II with QD sling attachment points on both sides (4 total). Very light rail, which makes this rifle feel overall incredibly light and balanced. Daniel Defense Vertical Foregrip. It has a 1"" flashlight mount and pressure switch tailcap on it. Never used the tailcap pressure switch, as I got it from an aquaintance who upgraded/changed light setups. Has one Magpul PMAG 30 Round Magazine.In exceptional condition. Just selling to make room, so I am in no hurry to sell. This is a high quality AR-15 that will last a lifetime.Text preferred to (405) 229-2two4zero. Can email as well.
