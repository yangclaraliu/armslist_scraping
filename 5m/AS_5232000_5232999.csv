I decided to polish the slide on this Kel Tec PF 9mm just because I like the polished look. It has a belt clip and a Red Laser Max laser which works good. It comes as seen. No extra magazines or instructions or anything else. Nice small compact gun. I unscrewed the rear sight and the front sight will need to be glued back on or hot melted. I have both the front and rear sight and they will come with the pistol. $350 with the laser or $300 without the Laser Max laser. Text me at REDACTED Kevin Trades will be considered but I should probably sell this gun for cash.

Its name refers to the barrel length which is 3.8"" long, 0.7"" shorter than the standard XD(M). Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level. The ideal grip angle of the XD has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. The 3.8 model features non-slip slide serrations which have a kink in them, unlike the standard model which has straight serrations.

Has a sling. Looking to sell or trade. Value is $800-1000 which is what they go for on gunbroker and was appraised at by a local gun shop. Trades I like are a 9mm carbine, a nice AK setup, AR, or ??? Pretty open to ideas. Can add cash up or down. I am in no rush to sell or trade so no lowballs please.

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers. Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 NATO is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels.

We took the bedrock precepts behind every riflescope we build – optical precision, rugged reliability and uncompromising performance – and pushed them ever farther for the AR-platform. The Bushnell AR Optics 1-4x 24mm Drop Zone-223 reticle riflescope features target turrets (0.1 mil click value) for pinpoint-precise adjustments, plus caliber-specific reticle to deliver every round with peerless accuracy. The scope features fully multi-coated optics for incredible brightness and the fast focus eyepiece delivering maximum accuracy and reliability. Drop Zone-223 BDC reticle is calibrated for 55-62 grain, 223 REM/5.556 loads. Zeroes at 100 yards, with aiming points out to 500 yards. Nitrogen purged to remove any vestige of internal moisture, and O-ring sealed to prevent the entry of dust or moisture. Made of high-durability aluminum alloy, anodize-finished and sealed to protect the inside from elements. Riflescope is rustproof, virtually scratchproof and a beautiful complement to even the most expensive AR platform firearm. Please note that the scope’s erector cap assembly (located on the bottom of the scope windage and elevation control housing) may limit the possibility to use extra-low or low scope rings on AR Optics riflescopes. Most commonly, medium height rings provide the clearance necessary to eliminate contact with the cap and the scope base or receiver on most firearms. Please check the clearance necessary on your individual firearm prior to selecting scope rings.

BUYER is solely responsible for being legally allowed to own and receive this rifle and/or pass the background check at a receiving FFL. Rifle product description is as follows:The CVA APEX is, according to CVA, the best break-action, multi-barrel interchangeable rifle system on the market today. Just by shouldering the APEX, the serious shooter will notice a vast superiority to its competitors in both balance and fit. But the real test comes with the shooting. And it is in the shooting that two very important features make the APEX really shine.First, every APEX barrel is made by Bergara Barrels™, which provide a level of accuracy performance that is unequaled by any muzzleloader/center-fire rifle on the market today – due to its premium, custom quality. These Bergara Barrels, all made of the highest quality 416 grade stainless steel, have quickly become recognized as some of the most accurate production barrels in the world. And while many of the world's most highly regarded center-fire manufacturers use Bergara barrels on their guns, only CVA offers them in a muzzleloader too. It is these Bergara barrels that enable CVA to guarantee our APEX series muzzleloading rifles to be the ""The Most Accurate Muzzleloader You've Ever Shot -- Or Your Money Back."" Second, APEX’s ambidextrous butt stock is designed specifically for scope shooting, with a height of comb that positions the shooter perfectly in line with the optics. The result is a rifle that shoulders and points as naturally as your favorite shotgun – just like it’s an extension of your body.As for versatility, the APEX can be quickly and easily set up with a wide range of Bergara Barrels in 15 different muzzleloading and center-fire calibers. Plus, every APEX features CVA’s trigger guard actuated breeching mechanism, which is extremely simple to operate. And its innovative trigger design provides an incredibly clean, crisp pull that is adjustable from approximately 3 to 4.75 pounds. Every APEX also includes a Quake® Claw® sling and a custom DuraSight® Z-2 Alloy™ rail mount.SPECIFICATIONS416 Stainless Steel, Fluted, BERGARA BARREL™ 27” in Muzzleloader, 25” in Center-Fire1:28” Twist for Muzzleloader, 1:9”-1:20” for Center-FireAmbidextrous Synthetic Stock with Rubber Grip Panels – Black or Realtree APG™ CamoCrushZone® Recoil PadDuraSight® Rail MountQRBP - Quick Release Breech PlugReversible Hammer SpurQuake® Claw® SlingAdjustable Trigger7.5 lbs.
