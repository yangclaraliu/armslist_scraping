Double/Single action provides a very safe and time proven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. . Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. . Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm. 92 FS.

This is match quality ammoFrom The Remington Web Site:Golden Saber Bonded is the ultimate extension of our revolutionary Golden Saber HPJ™ bullet concept. Through an exclusive Remington process, the lead core is hot-bonded to the brass jacket. The result is exceptional weight retention - up to 97% when fire through automobile glass - while maintaining phenomenal terminal performance when shot through heavy clothing or into bare gelatin. And the bonding process does not cause a reduction in accuracy performance - jacket and core concentricity and resulting gyroscopic balance has been maintained to deliver match-grade accuracy.Unlike competitive bonded handgun bullets, expansion, penetration, weight retention performance when fired through barriers such as wallboard and plywood has actually been improved. The unique design and bonding process also produces a bullet that requires less energy to initiate expansion. At the same time, the jacket stiffness and wall thickness is designed to eliminate over-expansion, thus maximizing penetration. These ultra-high performance characteristics make Golden Saber and Golden Saber Bonded ideal for overall Federal law enforcement applications."

It would make a cool framed piece (that actually works well!), or decent small caliber piece for your night stand.

The metal has a really interesting look to it as seen in the pictures. No problems that I have experienced. I also have a large amount of magnum ammo available if you are interested.

541,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5308541,For Sale:  Original Springfield M1835/40 musket,"Ashville, Birmingham, Alabama",$ 475,"Listed On: Tuesday, November 29, 2016",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Original Springfield Model 1835/40 (cap lock conversion). This is a neat example I picked up a few years ago. The Springfield 1835/40 was the last US-issue musket manufactured in flintlock configuration. This example is one of many that was converted to cap lock, and possibly saw use by the Confederates during the Civil War. The gentleman I purchased it from said it was found near the Prairie Grove battle site in Arkansas. This is a rare contract M1835/40, made by L. Pomeroy under license to Springfield (date appears to be 1844). I believe only 7,000 M1835/40 muskets were made by L. Pomeroy, and some were later rifled and given a rear sight, but this one retains it's original front sight and lack of rear sight. It is a .69 caliber smooth bore barrel. There is pitting on all of the exposed metal, but the metal under the wood or any area that was covered seems to be in much better condition, making me think this was probably a barn find. The middle barrel band was missing, so I replaced it with a reproduction M1842 middle band, as the M1835/40 shared many common parts with the M1842. The ramrod trumpet is also pitted, but the stem is in excellent condition, very strong and not fragile, comes out of its slot very easily. The lock internals were mostly missing, and I began replacing them with parts from an M1842 lock, but it is still missing the mainspring (meaning the hammer is loose). The original nipple was removed and lost before I purchased the musket, but the threads are in good shape. The stock is in incredibly good shape, and the inspection cartouches are still clearly visible on the left side of the weapon. The stock is clearly original. Also comes with the correct bayonet, which came with the musket when I got it, and shows equal wear with the exposed metal on the barrel. The inside of the socket is clean and mostly rust free, though. I believe the musket and bayonet have been together since the war. Rough as it is, it's a great original and rare musket for a wall-hanger or conversation piece.  Asking $475 plus shipping, obo. Cross posted."

GA, Georgia, United States",$ 595,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 12, 2016",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm selling a beautiful RANDALL Model 14 - 7.5"" ATTACK with Sawtooth/Sawteeth/Serrated Back Blade. The knife has a FORWARD CURVED Nickel Silver Hilt. 7 1/2"" blade of 1/4"" stock. Extra heavy 7/8"" wide tang runs through the channel handle, which is firmly fastened with epoxy. This knife was designed to meet the demand for an almost indestructible all-purpose knife, though it is especially suited for combat and survival purposes. It comes with a Green Micarta Border Patrol Handle with brass ferrule for a wrist thong, and an early SULLIVAN'S HOLSTER SHOP Sheath with the TAMPA, FL stamping. The sheath is well oiled, heavy leather with SINGLE-STITCHING. The first batch of 100 or so sheaths sent to RANDALL from G.G. (Sullivan's) for acceptance approval contained some double-stitched and some single-stitched sheathes. This was in late 1986. Thereafter, all Sullivan Sheathes were double-stitched. So, obviously, this is one of the first and few SULLIVAN demo sheathes to be used by Randall. Also, for only the first 2 years or so of production, Sullivan used the Silver Snap. This sheath has the silver snap. Prior to 1986 G. G. (Sullivan's) made almost 100% of their sheathes WITHOUT the hone stone pocket. This sheath HAD a hone stone pocket, but it was removed for some reason. You can see the holes in the leather where the hone stone pocket was prior to removal. The brass rivets have some ""greening"". Overall very little signs of use. A few small scratches on the blade. I am only posting a couple of photos on this listing. IF INTERESTED, MESSAGE (Email) ME and I will send many more photos. Many containing close-ups of the knife and of the sheath."

Not sure that JMB ever even considered adding that feature to his masterful creation but it makes for a great addition to the tactical deployment  of this firearm in places where evil hides. Having a light fixed to your pistol makes a lot of sense, freeing up the other hand to open doors, cradle loved ones, or to hold off the bad guys enough that you can less their treat to you while removing them from the fight. Many Tac-teams have employed them all over the world but as we see it they are uniquely American. Take notice how the end of the light-rail is angled to match the ball cuts of the slide for a very clean look, a detail often ""overlooked"" by other manufacturers.

I am the original owner but CORE offers a lifetime no BS warranty which covers anything and everything no matter what happens, and no matter if the rifle changes hands 50 times. Arguably the best warranty in the industry! Founded and operated by veterans that know how to put out a quality rifle built to extremely high standards. The rifle is like new with only one range trip, totaling 90 rounds. Mid-length gas system on a Mil-Spec 1:7 twist rate CMROV 4150 black nitride barrel. It took roughly $3K to put this perfect racehorse together! I don't expect to get near what I've got in it. I will sell it as it sits for $1785 (well over a grand less than I have in it).
