Thanks for taking a look. Up for sale today is a durable and rugged battle rifle chambered in 7.62 NATO. This particular rifle is no beauty queen but she will hit what you point her at. From the best of my knowledge and the collective information I've gathered from the interweb, this rifle is labeled as an L1A1, though she has many metric parts. There is a bit of light surface rust on the rifle, nothing damaging or that a good scrubbing with a brush and CLP shouldn't fix. It was assembled on a great Hesse receiver that accepts metric mags only. 21"" metric bipod cut barrel with metric gas block and front sight. She sports a wonderful set of metal STG58 handguards that are bipod cut and have STG58 bipods resting nicely in them. The barrel has nearly new looking bore that is bright and shiny but does not have threads cut at the muzzle. There is one small spot of pitting on the outside of the barrel, everywhere else on the barrel is in great condition.The lower receiver is metric as well tho has a L1A1 trigger assembly inside and L1A1 rear sight. L1A1 plastic pistol grip and butt stock.I've not shot it but the previous owner shot about 40 rounds thru her. I purchased this because I felt the need to own a 7.62 battle rifle but decided to build an AR in 7.62x39.The current price of $850 is as the rifle comes with SIX mags and 120 rounds of ammo. The price is slightly negotiable and trades will be entertained. Not looking for anything in particular so send an offer, the worst I will say is no thank you."

I would consider it 99.5% condition. There is a very small scratch on the end cap of the pistol grip.Marlin only made about 1300 of this particular model. It is the MR, meaning it has a 22"" barrel with pistol grip stock. According to Marlin this was one of the first of this caliber produced, the serial number dating it too late to 2002, early 2003 (pre-Remington merger) It also has an interesting serial number. Currently, there isonly one other 1895MR on the market nationally/internationally that I can find, and it's not near this pristine. I'd like to see this go locally, but I will likely be listing on gun broker next week. I have 2 fullboxes Hornady Leverevolution 325gr FTX for an additional $80.Obviously this isn't for everyone. This is for the guy who desires pre-Remington quality and doesn't want the same 45/70 that everyone else has.

This would be great for someone who is looking to get their ccw and needs everything, or someone who already carries and just wants a mid sized piece with all the accessories and ammo with it, ready to go. The .40 S&W is a good self defense round, and its also fun to shoot. If you are a felon, drug dealer, mentally disturbed, or otherwise not allowed to, or just plain shouldnt own a firearm please move on, I will not sell this to anyone that I am not comfortable selling it to. If you do not have a carry permit we will need to meet at a pawn or gun shop, or some other business with an FFL to do a background check, and ill need to write up a bill of sale and check your ID. I know this seems kind of like a pain in the ass, but I gotta cover my ass. Anyways, you are looking at $800+ worth of gear, even with the glock being used, for $500. Its a good deal, and I really am pretty firm about the price, I may pay for the background check if need be and we meet halfway drive wise should you live far from me. If you would like to shoot it first, I can meet you at a range and you can put a few rounds through it. Any questions, feel free to ask. Thank you."

(2) 1/2x1/8'' Neodymium magnets hold the knife in very secure.Knife sits almost completely flush inside the brass boarderV cut on one side to allow the knife to be pried out with your finger. PLEASE NOTE:The ""gerber"" pocket clip on the knife CAN be removed to make the knife sit entirely flush if so desired. (I personally wear mine this way) (see last pic showcasing my own personal model)I design all my models to last a lifetime and be handed down to a special loved one. All of my models are HEIRLOOM GRADE, and NOT cheap china made products.My models begin from nothing but raw stock, I do not buy blanks of any kind and glue/solder more purchased items on them, this is the REAL DEAL.These belt buckles have a much larger diameter loop that prevents belt gouging by being thicker and less ""wire like"". It is far less likely to ""cut"" your belt on the bend unlike most other belt buckle loops.(if you have a very expensive, high quality full grain belt, you will appreciate this thicker diameter loop over most other belt buckle loops)My models are intended to be used in a manner of passing the belt ""behind"" the D ring of the buckle and tucked behind the rest of belt when being fastened around the waist. My loops are not intended to have the belt come through the loop a second time. If you have any questions I can easily send you a picture of this method.This is to keep the buckle as low profile as possible when wearing it.Will accommodate belts up to 1 1/2'' in width and 1/4'' thick skived and non skived.they are seasoned to age in appearance and not meant to look like robot pressed truck stop junk.These are meant to from day 1 look as if you had received it from your grandfather after 40 years of use.no two will be alike due to the hand honed nature of my products.Please note:This model has been designed in mind to have a particular advantage that perhaps some of the other ""knife belt buckles"" do not have: Ours is pretty much LEGAL anywhere in the USA (please check your local laws to confirm of course as laws CAN change) This Stainless Steel Gerber ""Exchange a Blade"" Knife, Is displayed closed within the front of the belt buckle and being Shown unobstructed in the belt buckle, it CANNOT be considered a concealed weapon under these conditions. Unless a shirt or jacket were hanging over.This is important to consider, especially if you live in a ""blue"" state...ships from NJ FREE SHIPPING

Daniel Defense created a hunting side called Ambush Firearms. Tactical tough, but hunting-oriented. The Ambush Firearms 6.8 Hunter is an MSR that’s a lot more like the rifles deer hunters of the younger generation use. While mossy-backed dudes like me might prefer a Model 94, the newer generation wants a Mossy Oak-patterned rifle, and Ambush delivers. The heart of the rifle is a flattop AR-15 in 6.8Remington SPC. However, Ambush takes that basic black rifle, and inside they put a Geissele Super Semi-Auto trigger, a beautifully clean, crisp trigger that breaks at 4½ pounds (with more than half that on the take-up). The cold hammer-forged barrel is medium-weight, chambered in 6.8 SPC and with your choice of 1:10 or 1:11 twist. The muzzle is threaded, so you can install the flash hider or muzzlebrake of your choice, although it comes with a knurled thread protector. So if you’re not keen on flash hiders, don’t feel the need for a recoil-reducing brake or to mount a suppressor, just leave it as-is. The stock is a Daniel Defense butt stock, but again, since the Ambush uses a mil-spec-diameter receiver extension, you can swap the stock for one of your choice, no tools needed. On a conventional bolt or lever-action hunting rifle, the stock is what it is. Too long? Too bad. The big advantage of the Ambush (indeed, all ARs) is that the stock can be set to any of six lengths. The receiver has a Picatinny rail on top, so mounting a scope is a piece of cake. Scopes with integral rings bolt right on, and separate rings will allow you to put any scope of your choice up top. The forearm has its own rail on top, so you have a top rail the full length of the receiver and handguard. The forearm is a clean tube, a design that free-floats the barrel and allows Daniel/Ambush to wring all the accuracy out of their top-notch barrels. The forearm also has three sections of rail on it, a curious addition for a hunting rifle. On a tactical rig you’d mount a light or laser there, both items the game warden will frown on. However, the fourth item on the handguard is very interesting. It is a sculpted hand grip, making the cylindrical forearm feel much more like the forearm of a traditional shotgun or rifle. If you’re switching from a more traditional rifle to the Ambush 6.8, this forearm addition is going to trick your forward hand into believing that no change at all has happened. And you can position that grip wherever you like on the forearm tube. Two of the details of a hunting rifle that matter a lot to people are balance and weight. At six pounds even, before you put a scope or sling on it, one can hardly call the 6.8 Ambush porky. At that, it is lighter than a lot of the rifles that have been lurking around hunting camps since WWII. And as a bonus, the adjustable length of pull of the stock (from 311/4 inches OAL to 34.82) lets you easily adjust the rifle to the shooter, or the weather-dictated clothing, not vice-versa."

This rifle has SN4059819, a WWII rifle, and a genuine historical piece that has seen interesting times. According to J. Poyer, “The 1903 Springfield Rifle and its Variations” (a highly recommended reference book), the receiver is estimated to have been built in late 1943. The scope is a high quality Hi-Lux reproduction US Military M82G2. Early WWII sniper scopes were available commercial Weaver production, quickly followed by a variety of military versions. The M82 scope was a Lyman Alaskan, with the tapered reticle instead of crosshairs (M81). The M82 was replaced by the M84 scope in 1945. This rifle has a new Krieger Criterion barrel, a top grade barrel; new American Walnut “C” type pistol grip stock set with oiled finish, and properly cartouched to match serial number; all USGI parts; original style gray-green re-parkerized metal to provide the correct finish; head space gauged; all critical areas inspected. The rifle has been test fired and is ready to shoot. Ships in a Plano Gun Guard case. please text me on 505-750-7802  Thanks"
