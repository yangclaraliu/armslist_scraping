No wear on finish or internal components, and the bore has no imperfections. I carry one of these personally, excellent for CCW.

Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $30 more.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

Retaining accuracy and reliability is a complicated balance in that the chamber needs to be slightly modified from the NATO to improve bullet hook-up in the throat, while keeping to functional properties of the NATO body dimensions. The result is Noveske proprietary chambering. The steel used is a type of 416r and hardened to about 30 HRC prior to any machining. These barrels are button rifled with Noveske proprietary 7 PT button. This rifling profile differs from that in the chrome lined barrel line in that the lands have a slightly more trapezoidal shape. This design and the type of stainless used helps the lead edge of the rifling from eroding as fast as it might with conventional rifling, and the barrels tend to outlast others. This 13.7” rifle features permanently-attached KX5 flash hider, making the true & legal barrel length 16”"

$1,000 firm in cash or a little better in trade.  At a couple places I found this one still in stock it was selling for $1,050 before any other fees.  Looking for a folding brace for a Sig P556 and nice replacement trigger.  Lots of trade offers so far, but nothing I'd rather have over this one. 
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18""
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18""

I'm selling this as new since it's been in the case and I never took it out. Buyer must meet me at my local FFL dealer.DETAILSIn the post-War years, as 1911s became increasingly common in the civilian market, shooters and custom shops found new ways to upgrade their .45s. Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have.Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application.If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series.ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONSKU PX9151LPCACaliber .45 ACPManufacturer Springfield ArmorySights (detailed) 3-Dot Fixed Low Profile SightsGrips Cross Cannon™ Double Diamond CocoboloFrame Finish Matte Rounds with Polished FlatsFrame Material Stainless SteelBarrel Length (in) 5.0 inMag Capacity / Rounds 7rdNumber of Mags 2Accessory Rail No"

IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO DEAL WITH SOMEONE FAIRLY NEW TO FIRE ARMS (HAVE USED BUT NEVER OWNED) PLEASE MOVE ON. SOME ON HERE FLAT OUT STATE THIS, FINE THAT IS YOUR RIGHT. I MAY HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. BUT I HAVE CASH, A VALID AZ DRIVERS LICENSE, NO RECORD AND HAVE DONE A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH TO KNOW THE VALUE OF THE PIECES I DESIRE. I WILL NOT LOW BALL YOU OR DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN, JUST PLEASE BE WILLING TO ANWER SOME QUESTIONS!I am looking for 2 pieces to begin with. I am looking for a rim fire 22 rifle. I camp often and would like a plinker gun to keep around for the small critters and something I can practice with and do some target practice with. I have been researching and have come to like the Rugar 10/22. I understand it is a great first rifle and offers many add ons and chances to build. I would LOVE for it to be a break down if that is at all possible. I like how easy they are to store. But if I found a good deal on another I might consider it. I tend to like the black but that is not a deal breaker. If it has a scope, great, but not a deal breaker either. If you have larger clips that would be a plus. Basically I understand these are rifles that you can add to and change and grow with and I feel this is a great one for me. If not a Rugar, the Remington looks like a good choice too. Now if you feel there is something that is just as good or better I am open to suggestions. I simply want a well cared for plinker gun I can get my feet wet with and a gun that I am proud to own. Age isn't as important as knowing it was well cared for!The second gun I am looking for is a 12 guage pump shot gun. I have been looking at Mossberg and other similar guns. Basic is best for me here. The one thing I want is a short barrel. It is not a hunting gun, it is protection. This will not only spend time in my camper but will be by my bedside and be loaded with 00. So a short barrol for close and small hallways is important. I am also short and my wife is super short. Compact is important because I will teach her to be comfortable with it too.If you feel you have a well cared for piece that fits either of these wants please send me the name and model and your price. Pictures are very very helpful. I will pay a fair price and won't try to hard negotiate. Tell me what you want and I will be honest and upfront. If you treat me with a little patience and don't treat me like an idiot you are going to go a long way in making a deal. I have run into a butt load of hard core types who seem to have no patience for a beginner. Well, we all started somewhere right? I might be popping my cherry a little latter in life but I am serious. I have cash, will sign a bill of sale, have ID and will meet anywhere in the east valley. If you are easy to deal with and fair, you probably will make a customer for life. My collection will grow! These are just the seeds!!!! I look forward to talking."
