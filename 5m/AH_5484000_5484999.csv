These have become scarce in recent years, especially in this condition!  It comes with 3 magazines and the original holster. I'll also throw in 65 rounds of .380 acp target loads if purchased locally.  I have fired this pistol and it shoots extremely well and functioned flawlessly.  I had plans to modify it, refinish it, and use it as a concealed carry gun, but its in too nice of condition to mess with it. This pistol was designed by John Moses Browning, the inventor of such firearms as the 1903 Colt Pocket Hammerless and m1911, which is why it looks similar in design.  Originally these were made by FN in Belgium and called the m1903, then after the Germans occupied Belgium during WWI, Husqvarna in Sweden picked up production in 1917.  This one is in one of the finest conditions I've ever seen with all number matching (including all small parts), original finish, original lanyard ring (these are often missing), and appears to have been made in the early 20s according to its 4 digit serial number. The frame also has markings indicating it was issued to the 9th Infantry Regiment and was gun number 323.  The m1907 is very similar to the 1903 Colt Pocket Hammerless, but parts and magazines will not interchange.  Magazines and the majority of parts should interchange with the original FN version though.  The m1907 has a larger frame, longer slide and barrel, and features a last round hold open thanks to the design of the magazine and the added lever on the side of the frame.  Originally these were chambered for the 9mm Browning Long, but were converted to .380acp when they were imported into the U.S. by pressing an insert into the chamber of the barrel.  Original barrels can be found online for as cheap as $20 if you desire to shoot the original 9mm Browning long round.  Please, no tire kickers. I won't waste your time, don't waste mine. I've been burned too many times in the past by holding items for people who change their mind and don't have the common courtesy to notify me, so first come/ first serve. I prefer face to face, but I'm willing to ship to your FFL for $45. I'm also willing to travel up to 45 minutes away to meet with a buyer."

Zero failures or malfunctions. Zero!Upgrades include the following: Beautiful Rosewood double diamond 1911 style grips. (stock black rubber grips included) All internal upgrade parts from the CZ master gunsmiths at Cajun Gun Works: American made stainless steel old style CZ 85 Combat trigger polished to a high shine. Much more comfortable than the stock recurve trigger and of course highly attractive. A CGW floating trigger pin was also installed. Cajun Gun Works Short Reset System which consists of their extended firing pin, reduced power firing pin spring, new spring steel firing pin retaining pin, reduced power firing pin block spring, and their own FP block lifter arm, along with a reduced power hammer spring. Many hours of internal polishing and tuning went into this gun. Yes, it certainly does make a difference. It's buttery smooth in DA and has a nice crisp, slightly rolling SA break and 50% shorter reset. I left the stock hammer to give it a smooth rolling break and not be too touchy to still be a safe and reliable defensive/carry gun. I also added a modified Pierce XD grip extension to the 10 round magazine for a full three finger grip. Also included is the factory 14 round extended magazine, carry case, manuals, cleaning tools, etc. Price is firm. You will hard pressed to find another RAMI decocker model, much less one that has been upgraded with these world renowned parts that carry a lifetime guarantee. I have much more in the gun and upgrade parts alone than my asking price. You will find it to be in superb condition and an exceptionally smooth operating weapon. Never carried.

Brand new, never fired! The MP5K is the ultimate close-quarters weapon. Created for use in very confined spaces, it is optimally suited both for active engagement of individual targets, and for personal defense.Up for sale from my HK collection is a brand new SP89 (mp5k) built by T.P.M. Outfitters out of Carrollton, TX. Ken Clark and Matt Sidley of TPM have an outstanding reputation for being excellent HK smiths, right up there with Turner Fabrications, Investment Grade Firearms (IGF), and Parabellum Combat Systems (Ghilliebear). Don't be fooled by the cheaper, poorly built weapons like Vector, Bobcat, Coharie, Special Weapons (SW), Atlantic Arms (AA), Pakistani Ordnance Factory (POF), or MKE. This is as close as you can get in quality and accuracy to a genuine German HK SP89/mp5k without paying $6-7k for a factory HK weapon. The welds on this pistol are cleaner than some of my factory HK roller locking weapons (HK 91, 93, etc.). This comes with a full auto bolt carrier and was fully tested by TPM to run flawlessly in semi and full auto so it would make a perfect host for your registered auto sear or trigger pack (NFA rules apply). Comes with the following upgrades: clipped and pinned SEF trigger group (extra $100); shell deflector ($125); and hammer forged 3-lug / threaded barrel ($50) to easily accept either type of suppressor (silencer). This has been a safe queen since I bought it and has spent its entire life in a climate controlled environment. Condition is nothing less than flawless as the day I got it. No optics have ever been mounted so there are no claw marks from rails or scope mounts on the top of the receiver like some other MP5's out there. I guarantee you will not be disappointed! Get this while you can, before Hillary gets elected or Obama's Executive Order bans their transfer. Includes one 30rd curved mag. Private sale if local, with no FFL fees or BS to deal with, or I can accept a certified check or USPS money order and shipping will be $35 to your FFL from a private individual, or an additional $25 if my FFL must ship it. Please be sure it is legal to own in your state/area. Feel free to contact me with any questions or for additional pics.To get an idea of their reputation, see TPM Outfitter's PERFECT feedback score on Gunbroker with over 260 transactions since 2010:http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewUserFeedback.aspx?User=1595831"
