$440 firm or higher in trade. 

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now and will be needing some tires in the next month or so.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

$1,200 FIRM in cash or higher in trade value.  

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal and the value is there, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now and am needing some tires in the next month or so.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Also, Pmags for both AR-15 and AR-10.

The XD(M) pistol from Springfield Armory redefines what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M) has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M) 5.25"" Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition.

The XD(M) 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M), which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The slide on the Competition Series has been lightened to ensure rapid cycling. Add in more XD(M) features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place.

I also have a wind chart built for it that's taped to the stock of the rifle just never got around to ordering the actual turret. This gun has a lot of time and $ put into it but I'm currently building a gun from dead down range so I can even shoot further that's why I'm getting rid of the gun. Browning no longer sells the A-Bolt so these are hard to find. The rifle itseelf new is $1,100, the scope new is $600, the custom turret is $250, the reload I had built was $350, all the ammo I have is $150, the glass bedding/trigger work was $450, the accessories on the scope was $150.

Once fired, the barbs, or electrodes, are launched up to 15 feet towards your subject. The barbs can penetrate up to 1"" thick of clothing. Once penetrated, either clothing or skin, the wires deliver the electric current to the subject. While the voltage and amperage of a TASER Gun are lower than those of direct contact stun guns, the current is much more effective. This is because TASER uses their patented Neuro-Muscular Incapacitation technology in their electrical current. What this means is that the current the TASER Gun generates mimics that of the human body. So, once the electrical current is delivered into the human body, the body's brain and central nervous system cannot discern what's going on and ""freaks out"". The brain and nervous system doesn't know what to do. Further, the M26C can also be used as a direct contact stun gun in a close encounter situation. Simply pop out the cartridge and its ready for use as a stun gun. Taser Guns also available at Taserproducts.comFREE PRIORITY SHIPPING....DELIVERY WITHIN 3 DAYS"

This Browning will shoot 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3/ 1/2"" shells making it perfect for whatever type of shooting you plan to do from trap shooting at the range to hunting quail, duck or goose out in the field! The Cynergy made technological bounds with the invention of its low profile MonoLock hinge, and innovative recoil pad. It has long appealed to many shooters with it's contemporary looks and its ultra-low profile. The Cynergy field takes the technological advantages and great looks and gives them with a more traditional style recoil pad that will allow customizing the length of the stock to the shooter. If you're an all-around, one-gauge shotgun shooter, the Browning Cynergy is probably the only shotgun you will ever need to buy. It's a perfect weight for carrying and sweet to swing with its ventilated top and side ribs on fast-flushing birds and yet very strong with its steel receiver. The Mono Lock Hinge means there is 300% more surface area to pivot on, for less wear and more stability. No other over and under shotgun gives you this strength where it is so critical. The rectangle locking pins provide additional strength and the action features a ""wear-in"" relief that allows wear without hindering lock up. When you pick up a Cynergy and shoulder it, there is a natural blending of arm and shoulder and many hunters' minds are made up in an instant. This shotgun is brand new in the box with all the chokes and paperwork. Please feel free to contact me with any questions. (253) two, two two -9977"

It was upgraded with a Falcon Arms trigger, hammer and sear. It is a metric receiver and will use any metric FAL magazines. Argentine FALs were produced under license from Fabrique Nationale by the government-owned arsenal FM (Fabricaciones Militares) at the Fábrica Militar de Armas Portátiles ""Domingo Matheu"" (FMAP ""DM"") in Rosario.

The chrome lined Argentine barrels are highly prized for their accuracy as well durability. This rifle would be a prized addition to any collection and is sure to go up in value as very few ever made it to the states. I would like to see it go to someone local before listing in nationally.

The rifle is non-numbers matching, however all parts have the correct Steyr waffenampt codes of WaA623 or WaA77 for the year 1942. The barrel is in not counterbored and is great condition with a shiny bore and no pitting. The bluing is in great condition throughout the rifle as seen in the pictures. A serious addition to this rifle is an original year matching k98 issued sling stamped L.L.C. Thuringen 1942. Another perk is an original issued k98 12 1/2 ‘’ cleaning rod with that is stamped 22 which matches the receiver code of 4022. Also this rifle has the correct WWII front sight hood and not some cheap repro.

The bolt is Steyr coded WaA623 and completely matches itself with all parts coded 4420 which is pretty close to the receiver code. The stock is also stamped WaA623 and is a beautiful specimen and also has an unusual bonus of having a large M stamped below the takedown disk which indicates that it was used by the Kreigsmarine or the German Navy. Most K98 stocks have the H stamp for the heer or Army. The M stamped stocks are rare. The stock serial number is 2260 which matches the front and rear bands, band spring, and bayonet lug. All of these parts are also stamped WaA77 or WaA623. Overall, this is a beautiful all time period rifle and would make a great addition to any collection.

It has a 14.5"" barrel that was professionally cut, crowned and had a Noveske Flaming Pig muzzle device pinned and welded.  MoA is still 1.5, and has an insanely low amount of recoil allowing for lightning fast follow up shots. The sights hardly leave the target.  Included in the price is both an EO Tech 512 ($400) and EO Tech G33 Magnifier ($600). Also included are the Magpul back up iron sights, 3 MOE rail sections and attached GG&G vertical grip.  It is the folding stock variant and has the standard handguard.  Great rifle, possibly the best 5.56mm platform on the market in terms of reliability, ergonomics, stability and accuracy.  Takes standard M4/AR15 Stanag mags.  I simply need the money to finish other projects.  EO Teck 512 and G33 are genuine and will come with original cases and paperwork.

*Read below knowing the first time you fire it and use 5.56mm ammo like the caliber in the add clearly states, and you have a single issue. Call me and I will gladly take the rifle back and give you a refund. I stand behind what I say below entirely. 

*Full disclosure, it does not like to cycle wolf ammo after the barrel has been cut. I did not adjust the gas system or recoil spring after I had the barrel modified so weak .223 loads can cause a failure to feed due to the fact there is not as much gas coming back into the gun as with the 16"" barrel and cheaper .223 rounds are made with the bare minimum powder to cycle the weapons system.  Federal, Winchester and other brands of brass cased .223 cycle flawlessly.  Any and all 5.56mm cycles without issue as well.  Bottom line, buy good ammo, have 0 problems.  If it is of major concern to you, note that the recoil spring will eventually be broken in through firing and you will be able to fire weaker loads. Also you can easily fix this problem by ""conditioning' the recoil spring by leaving the bolt locked to the rear for long periods of time, enlarging the gas port, or by taking 1 or 2 links out of the recoil spring (Please do not attempt the last two unless you know EXACTLY what you are doing).  So, I just have directed my energies elsewhere and have not done this yet. Mainly by being deployed overseas. lol Rest assured, as soon as I do fix these issues and test the rifle, this message will come down and the price will go up.  Thank you for your consideration."

This gun was purchased as part of a large estate so there will be plenty for sale over the next upcoming weeks but this one is a very nice Marlin Golden 39-A ""Mountie"" .22LR lever action rifle. This gun is in great shape for it's age and it's a very neat variation of the 39A. The overall the bluing and metal is in very good to excellent condition. It appears that there may be been some kind of inlay on the marlin stamping on the barrel which is still very sharp and deep and someone scratched a number""hopefully not their social"" into the bottom of the grip tang, which I also have included a picture of. Overall, This gun is very cool and a lot easier to take down and clean than it's Winchester predecessors. The wood appears to have some very light blems on this original oil finished stock which are no big deal and could easily be repaired but most probably wouldn't for the collector value of the firearm.

The barrel/action are stainless steel with a matte black TriNyte anti-reflective coating. The barrel is 24"". This gun has the X-Mark Pro adjustable trigger installed and it was manufactured after the recall so recall trigger is not needed. It has a OD green synthetic stock with black Hogue grip panels and a swing-open magazine floorplate. Capacity is 4+1. I have added a Leupold 2 piece scope base, 1"" Leupold medium height rings, and a Leupold VX-3 3.5-10x40mm with CDS (Custom Dial System) with the Windplex reticle. I have also added a Leupold sunshade, Leupold flip-up lens covers, and Leupold neoprene scope cover. The CDS allows you to get a custom dial from Leupold for any load you fire.The scope is NOT sighted in yet (the gun is unfired).  This is a great hunting rifle capable of taking most anything in the lower 48 states with the right load.

I have $1250+ invested in all of this. I am willing to sell for $900 cash FIRM. I am NOT interested in trades at this time. Comes with all the original boxes, paperwork, lock, and the packaging for the accessories. Located in Northwest Columbus in the Hilliard/Dublin area. Must be an Ohio resident who is not restricted from owning firearms.

Featuring the TriNyte Corrosion Control System, the Model 700 XCR stretches
the durability limits of stainless steel by coating the stainless steel
barrel and receiver with matte black TriNyte for a more classic look with
less glare for superior stealth. It's every bit as impervious to extreme
conditions, with the same proven track record in accelerated saltwater
testing. TriNyte delivers scratch and corrosion resistance dramatically
superior to standard stainless steel as well any protective coating by any
other manufacturer. The Model 700 XCR II is also optimized for sure
handling in adverse climates. Its feature-laden olive drab green synthetic
stock is a technological marvel that looks and feels the part with Hogue
rubber overmolding featured at the grip and forend areas. These
revolutionary enhancements give you a positive grip in the slickest
environments. Shots are made infinitely more comfortable with the SuperCell
recoil pad. X-Mark Pro Trigger System gives a level of crispness and shot
control once only available through high-dollar customization. Choose from
a wide range of hard-hitting big-game cartridges, all delivered with the
track-driving accuracy only a legendary Model 700 barreled action could

This thing shot amazingly well-with PMC 147gr plinking ammo, i was getting 1-1.5"" fairly easy. with PPU 168gr match/Fiocchi 168gr match/federal 168gr gmm, it was about .5 or better depending on how well i shot. like i said, it's a lazer.

I will ship in a hard case( not the factory one ) would like to keep this together as a whole set up-will only split the scope from rifle, if i have it all spoken for. would like to get $3450 shipped for the whole deal. If both parts are spoken for(scope/rifle) would take $1000 for the scope(no laure mount as that goes with rifle) and $2450 shipped for the rifle. If you look at whats added to the rifle(BUIS, bipod) this is a really good deal for a barely used OBR. 

I can be reached via e-mail. I will take money order since it's such a large amount. Thank you..

This is the model 36 and has some collector value or would be an awesome deer rifle. The guys on the marlin page tell me that the ""glenfield"" models were sold for less money at department stores but are the same rifle. They said value $400-$450 so I'm thinking for this price it should go quick. I'm not looking for trades at this time but I will listen to offers."
