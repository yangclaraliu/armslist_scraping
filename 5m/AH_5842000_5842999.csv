Made in Newbury Park. Has use and some wear, but these things are built like a tank and not much will harm them. I've had a lot of fun with this, and going slowly, with a little practice, plinking cans at 20 feet or a little further is possible. This one has a well made leather pocket holster with it, which holds 5 extra rounds. I am not the original owner so you'd be at least the 3rd. No box, but I do have an after market belt buckle for it, which I never used myself, it came with it. They say that these are good, close range, last ditch guns, I don't know about that, but they are kind of fun to shoot. $250 with holster and buckle, or $225 without the buckle.

This has less than 100rds though her and is one of the highest quality Uberti’s I have ever handled. This comes with the factory box, the pistol, and a Leather handmade Viking leather holster. This pistol is an amazing modern retake on the classic 1873 design. The lockup and timing of this pistol is great. I would keep this, but I already have a full size 357 magnum revolver.  Mainly looking for cash, so not really looking for trades on this, but may consider some if they interest me. Would consider a 4 or 6 inch 38/357 mag revolvers. Rugers, Smiths, etc. Also would take very partial trade for Stripped Metal Ar lowers. Most trades will need boot on your end, but for the right deal i may consider it on my end. Need to meet in Norman on this."

All three components fit perfectly together and are In great condition as they have never been put into a build. I'm asking $600 firm for all three, I will also throw in a lower parts kit without trigger group. Lower description- Precision CNC machined from solid billet 7075-T6 aluminum, the SP223 Billet Lower is the first step to building the best AR15 possible. Mil-Spec is just a starting point for Seekins Precision. Specifically designed for serious tactical shooters, the SP223 has features not found on standard AR lower receivers that significantly improve handling and performance. The Seekins Precision Enhanced Bolt Catch comes standard on the SP223. Shooters can easily drop the bolt from either side with our ambi-bolt release feature. Custom screw in dowel pins are used to secure these components, eliminating the use of roll pins, hammers, and pin punches for installation.An oversized winter trigger guard allows the use of gloves while maintaining precise trigger control, and the trigger reset adjustment screw allows fire control tuning for optimum performance.The quick access mag release and beveled mag well assist with rapid, positive magazine changes and works with most all magazines including Magpul P-Mags and Surefire high capacity magazines.To assist with exact, no hassle assembly, the rear take down detent has also been relocated under the grip. All of the features and superior design combine to make the SP 223 lower receiver a significant upgrade over common mil-spec lowers.upper description-Seekins Precision’s Integrated Rail Mounting technology (iRMT) uppers integrate the rail mounting points into the upper retaining the stiffness of a true monolithic upper while allowing the rails to be completely modular. This new upper design is considerably thicker in the most critical area and will aid in squeezing all of the potential accuracy out of your AR15 rifle. Instead of a standard barrel nut our iRMT system uses an externally threaded, Steel barrel nut with 1-1/8” wrench flats on it for simple installation. No special proprietary wrenches needed.SP iRMT-R upper is compatible with Seekins Precision’s BAR rail and MCSR railsrail description- Modular Combat Suppressor Rail (MCSR) V2 is a high performance, free float hand guard system designed to be compatible with the use of a suppressor. Precision machined from 6061-T6 aluminum, the inside diameter is large enough for most suppressors to fit inside, protecting the shooter from suppressor burns. The aggressive use of cooling slots helps dissipate heat from both the suppressor and barrel, as well as make the hand guard extremely lightweight for your AR-15 rifle.The Seekins Precision MCSR comes with an aluminum barrel nut and mounting hardware, has anti-rotation tabs and is Type III Hardcoat Anodized matte black."

It has been sitting in my gear bag so now it up for sale.
Another item as old as Original S.O.E Gear, the Butt Pack is one of John Willis' earliest products, and except for a few updates here and there, it has been the same for over a decade.
The Butt Pack is designed to integrate to any of our vests or rigs, as well as to modular belts, or MOLLE vests and armor carriers. It is an all-purpose general storage pouch capable of carrying survival gear, medical equipment, comms products, and more -- customers have carried MREs into the field, water bladders, magazines, boxes of ammunition, and more. It remains one of our most popular items for its versatility.
It comes complete with two pop flare loops, an internal 8"" drawstring rainfly, a zippered pocket built right into the lid (ideal for Clif bars, notepads, clotting agents and bandages, and more), and PALS on the front of the lid and the sides of the body, as well as the interfacing PALS grid on the rear.
The Butt Pack attaches via quick release fastex to our rigs and vests, or via PALS to other objects such as armor carriers or even backpacks. The back and lid have scuba webbing platform system to maintain shape under load and further strengthen our famous bombproof construction.
roughly 10"" tall x 9.5"" across x 6"" deep. Has a 6"" drawstring rain fly as well so these can be over stuffed.
If you have any questions please let me know."

I felt the same way, trust me. But evidently this is one of the few Kel-Tec products that's not a cheap hunk of crap (the other being this rifle's younger 5.56mm brother, the RDB), and it definitely feels and shoots solidly and reliably. Brand new condition Kel-Tec RFB. I took it to the mountains once to zero it at 100 yards, fired 38 total M80 spec rounds from 5 different magazines to ensure reliability--there weren't any failures. Have to sell it because I'm going with another FAL instead and I'm a FAL fanboy. The RFB is a really nice-handling bullpup that's extremely pointable. There's complaints about recoil but compared to other 308 battle rifles I've fired the only more easier shooting one is the SCAR. These rifles are very easy to accessorize and upgrade if that's your thing.  Comes with one Thermold repair kit, ask about other FAL repair kits as well. Price is firm."
