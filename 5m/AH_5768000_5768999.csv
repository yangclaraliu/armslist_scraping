It's a fantastic gun and I love it, however I recently shot and wrote a review on the Smith and Wesson Shield .45. This gun was purchased new in November of 2015 currently has around 250-300 rounds through it. No signs of wear or chatter marks. I usually carry this everyday but it primarily spends time in my girlfriends glovebox as she is quite used to it. So now I carry the 19 almost daily.I've always taken care of it, wiped it with Ballistol after carrying/firing. Has a Talon Grips Rubber Grip on it (removable) 2 mags one with the Pearce Grip Extension (doesn’t add capacity) but it can with a magguts kit!The Glock 42 is fantastic little gun to shoot, compared to other small(ish) .380 they are almost recoilless, when i first shot it I was astounded. Glock is synonymous for unprecedented reliability, and being the epitome of simplistic. With very few parts it manages to be 100% reliable and accurate. The 42 is about a thumb width wide and about the size of a iPhone 6+ in length. The gun is operated like any other Glock, which is nice if you want to continue the Glock product line in your collection.Stock Glock sightsWill include a Dara Holsters AIWB (appendix inside-the-waistband) holster ($50 value)20rnd box of Hornady Critical Defense .380 ($22 value)Again, the gun has served me well and would continue to do so, I just fell in love with that Shield. New, locally these Glock 42s can be found at stores for around $419.99 plus 1.0675% tax, I’m looking to sell mine with all of these ‘goodies’ for $350. Pretty firm.All sales will be done in the legal/correct way for a private sale in nc. Must have CCW Permit, I don’t want your purchase permit, keep that for yourself for a store.Meeting face to face only, not shipping. If you’re wanting to do a transfer at a FFL that will be paid by you and will be done at Carolina Gunrunners.DO NOT OFFER ME A TRADE UNLESS:1. It's a Shield .45 without thumb safety or 2. You want to trade for cash."

There are a lot of extras in this deal, 200 rounds of Hornady Ammo; Bushnell Elite 1500 Range Finder; and the original M1A green synthetic stock. I am not interested in trades, Sorry"

This allows the capability to cross-carry a pistol and a revolver and only one caliber of ammunition. Taurus Security System (TSS) Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Transfer Bar The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear. Features: • Manufacturer – Taurus • Action – SA/DA • Caliber – 9MM • Barrel Length – 2” • Finish – Stainless Steel • Grip Type - Rubber • Capacity – 5 Rounds • Length – 6.5” • Height – 4.37” • Width – 1.38” • Weighs 22.2 oz. unloaded • Lightweight and compact for easy concealment • Davidson’s GuaranteeD Lifetime Replacement"

I originally bought the gun thinking it would be a good inexpensive alternative to an AR-10. However, the gun is hard to handle and to be completely honest not fun to shoot. It leaves bruises on my shoulder every time I use it (yeah I know! Insert joke here!) Plus ammo is about $1 a round and these days that isn’t exactly do-able for me. So, I am looking to trade it for a handgun that I will use regularly, a Walther PPQ, any HK pistol or any 1911 type pistol. If you have a nicer 1911 or HK I could toss some cash in but would prefer just an even trade. My rifle comes with 3 mags, a sling and a box or two of ammo. It does not come with a case. Let me know what you have and we can go from there."

This variant is no longer imported into the USA with the original classic bakelite-style furniture. When you do see them for sale, they now use black polymer furniture. The supply of these high-quality AK-47's from Radom in Poland has diminished substantially as the Radom factory now has multi-year government contracts to fulfill, limiting the number and range of products they can offer to the civilian market.This AK-47 pistol has a 9.25"" barrel with a classic Krinkov-style flash hider on the end. The 7.62x39mm round is ideal for short barrels as the velocity lost at that barrel length is substantially less than lost by smaller calibers such as .223 (5.56x45mm) at the same length. It is perfect for turning into a short-barreled rifle (SBR) with a stock, or adding a pistol arm brace to avoid making an NFA item. Alternatively, one could attach a bungee sling and use it as is. This AK-47 was originally bought as it was the last import shipment that I knew would be coming with the original bakelite-style furniture. Selling to fund a custom bolt-action rifle project.Price is as pictured. I can throw in a standard steel milsurp 30-round magazine for an extra $20 if one is desired by the buyer. I am not interested in trades at this time."

The Chinese were known for making high quality SKS's. This SKS was imported pre-ban and had to have its bayonet removed on importation but the original sling was kept with it as well as the cleaning rod. The cleaning kit is also still in the buttstock. Replacement bayonets (they are not serial numbered) can be had online or at gun shows for $15-20. This rifle was never fired by the original purchaser nor myself. In fact, I removed some small residual cosmoline off of the rifle when I took ownership and cleaned the rifle with CLP.
This rifle was obtained in a multi-gun package purchase from the original buyer and collector who was selling off his collection in groups due to getting up there in years. This gentleman is the kind of collector who takes care of but never shoots his collection so I know it was in good hands.
As the rifle is in significantly better condition than the only other ones I can find for sale online at J&G (which have beat up metal and wood with bayonet but without sling), the price is set at $400. If you need ammo, I also have plentiful boxes of steel cased 123 grain FMJ ammo for $5 a box of 20.
At this time, I am not interested in trades."

This gun cycles reliably with all #00 buck and #4 buck shot that I've tested out on the platform (I've tested it with Federal, PMC, Remington, RIO, and S&B). The conversion includes an Ace Ltd. folding metal stock, pistol grip with internal storage, ghost ring sites, tri-rail (so that the option of a welded steel rail directly to the gas tube remains possible for guaranteed holding zero), vertical foregrip, and an Ottocomp custom muzzle break that is very effective.All Russian Saiga shotgun were banned from further import by President Obama's executive order 13622 and thus no more will be entering the country. As the supply is fixed, the price will only go up with time. These are the only AK-47 pattern shotguns and rifles built at Izmash in Russia on the same assembly lines that build the AK-47 pattern rifles for the Russian military. Thus I am pricing the gun at $1500.I am not interested in trades at this time."

The latest MK 3 version builds on the previous iterations with completely new styling, fine oil finish walnut, a precision alloy receiver and a hammer-forged barrel. The BAR features accuracy and performance that will make autoloading enthusiasts out of the most skeptical riflemen. Classic in looks and contemporary in performance. The BAR MK 3 is the hunting rifle that sets the bar for every other autoloader on the planet with accuracy and speed -- and a caliber selection -- that is not matched by any other hunting autoloader. The MK 3 is available in the most popular hunting calibers from whitetail hunter's favorite 243 Winchester to the hard-hitting 300 Winchester Magnum. Cartridges are fed from a detachable box magazine, so be sure to keep a spare in your pocket for fast reloads.    **This is a special order item and IS NOT STOCKED IN OUR STORE and full payment must be made prior to us submitting the order.
