When I started out to have it customized by Jim Stroh, Alpha Precision, Inc. in 1993, money was no object. I had bought the gun new in 1993 (gun manufactured, November 1992). I told Jim, ""This is going to be my carry arm. Foremost, I want it to be completely reliable. However, I want it to be very accurate, too. Lastly, I want it to be beautiful."" His response was a simple, ""I can do that.""I was put on a two-year waiting list and in 1995 I received what has proven to be the finest gun I've ever owned. I gave Jim free hand and he went to town, including too many to mention all customizations, such as: melt the entire gun to be snag free, beavertail grip safety, melted-in Bomar adjustable sight, trigger job, ramp and barrel throat recut and polish for positive feed, ejection port lower, shape and polish, barrel customizations and bushing fit, slide tighten and lap to frame, jewel hammer and barrel hood, master blue slide and small parts, beading frame, and some less obvious customizations that I cannot remember at this time. The gun functions flawlessly, is a pleasure to carry and shoot and the trigger pull has astounded and wowed every shooter who has tried it. It has a few cosmetic dings as evidence of being my carry arm for so many years, thank God never used against anyone, but they are minor for the new owner to perfect. The gun has been fired, at most, four hundred rounds in its lifetime and its parts are as new. I hope it will go to someone who needs a lifesaver gun. I will ship from my FFL dealer to yours. I welcome your questions. Selling price $2,400.00. Call Kelly REDACTED.Special Note: Jim Stroh was chosen ""Pistolsmith of the Year"" 1996 by the American Pistolsmiths Guild."

The quality and amount of gun you get for the money from FN is amazing. To compare: since Glock seems to be the industry standard for polymer striker fire guns, this one is more comfortable in the hand than a Glock, it looks better than a Glock(if you care about such a thing), and in my personal experience, the reliability of this gun surpasses that of a Glock. I've put over 500 rounds through this gun since it was brand new and have had zero malfunctions. The only reason i'm getting rid of it is because it has an external manual safety and I like my guns with no extra bells, whistles, switches, levers, or buttons.Price is OBO. Shoot me an offer."

The gun is chambered in 9mm and the full size has about 100 rounds through it and the subcompact slide, barrel and everything has never been fired. I have periodically carried the full size so there are marks on the polymer handle from handling but they are not scratches or scuffs, merely just from contact. The full size slide and barrel have minimal wear and are truly in great condition as the gun has seen few rounds. This is the sig pistol which has the removable trigger which can be easily switched into a subcompact or full size pistol. The trigger is similar to the DAK and I olny say similar because it functions the same way but I'm not sure if thats what they called it on these pistols.This gun is great for someone who wants the adaptability to the situation which calls for either and the full size is a VERY smooth and accurate gun. I thought that I would be inclined to carry the subcompact but my hands are just too large to feel comfortable. Both frames have a magazine each which function well.I am only open to trade for a P226 in .40 which I am prepared to include cash for. I will take the best offer."

Fully loaded with premium accessories, with individually tuned and fitted features, the PT 1911 leaps from the box already equipped to go head-to-head with the current Model 1911 market’s most dominant names, with more trimmings than even many custom-built competition guns.
 
Includes box, safety key, etc.
- Hammer-forged -not cast- ordnance grade steel frames, slides and barrels. These are individually hand-fitted to match-level tolerances during assembly. - The forged match-grade barrel is individually fitted, with a polished feedramp, polished barrel throat, an air-gauged solid barrel bushing, plus a hardened barrel link and lug for long wear and an enduring fit in heavy-duty use.  The hammer/sear/trigger setup is individually fitted and tuned, receiving a U.S. gunshop-equivalent of a “trigger job.” The internal extractor is individually tuned. There are no “drop-in” parts. All accessories and operating controls are individually fitted. Each and every part is machined to tolerance levels that surpass even today's industry standards.   - Skilled pistol smiths hand-fit and tune each gun. The slide, barrel and frame are etched with matching serial numbers.This is the deluxe model with additional upgrades. It has a Picatinny accessory rail forged into the frame! Loads of extra 30-LPI checkering for a secure, comfortable grip. The grip’s front strap combines machine checkering centered in vertical grooving. The flat mainspring housing is also machine checkered, as is the magazine catch, while the slide stop is horizontally grooved. There is also checkering underneath the trigger guard.
- Longitudinally-grooved ambidextrous safeties are extended competition/combat style and work with a satisfying click. The left and right safety shafts are tongue-and-groove but, contrary to the typical mating of straight-edge-meets-straight-notch, here the two parts meet in a “+” lockup. The safeties are further held together by the right grip panel, which covers an arm of the right-side safety. - The grip panels narrow to their respective centers, giving a pleasing grip. - Extended deluxe fitted beavertail grip safety, with raised boss at the base to ensure engage even if your grip is slightly offset in a quick draw.
- Skeletonized match-type trigger with 3 lightening holes. - Trigger over travel adjustment screw. - Grip slots milled into front of slide for a custom touch.- Series 80-based firing pin safety system. - Genuine Novak® Sights – 3 Dot system secured with an Allen screw. Front & rear sights are dove tailed into the slide. - The guide rod flange is beveled on its lower rear face where it bears against the two “feet” holding the barrel link and link pin. This modification, a custom touch, improves function by allowing the flange and barrel “feet” to mate more closely, thus improving overall reliability."
