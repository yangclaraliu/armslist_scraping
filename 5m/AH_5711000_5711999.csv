The wood on the buttstock is beautiful, but the buttplate needs to be fitted. When I got it, you could see daylight between it ant the buttstock. A friend of mine offered to fit the buttplate. All he did was put some filler in the crack. At least he didn't do any sanding on the wood or grinding on the metal - and he didn't charge me. I intended to fix it, but haven't gotten around to it. Also, sometime in the last 110 years, the full mag tube was modified into a button mag. That's what I liked most about it.I've got another gun in lay-awake and have decided to see if I can sell this to help speed up the process of paying that one off.I shot this one today to make sure everything works. It does. I'll include about 1/2 box of factory JSP ammo I have for it. It is what it is. I'll take $500 for it. If you want to trade, trade value is $1200. HaFTF near Lexington, NC.

She is 1 of 1000 that were made during the 3rd and last run of the 629 Mountain Gun.The 629 Mountain Gun was a limited run/edition revolver that was also done for the model 29. They were produced to be a ""lightweight"" backcountry carry gun. There were only 3 production runs of it between 1989 to 2005, making them sought after by collectors. Total production number for both models was 15000 with 6 dashes/changes on the 629 during the timeframe of production. My 629-6 Mountain Gun was in the 3rd and last production run. There were only 1000 629's produced during that run. The Mountain Gun had square butts until dash 4, then went to round butts. It came with a tapered 4"" Barrel that was 2ozs lighter than the 629 Classic. Mountain gun also had beveled/curved areas around the end of the cylinder for smoother placement of the revolver back into a holster. The MG had a smooth textured trigger, whereas the Classic had the target style serrations texture. MG maintained wide hammer. MG front sight post was all black, as well as rear adj. sight post. The classic had red front sight post with white outlined rear post. The dash-6 came with the lock.

It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature.The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots.
