I’m selling my H&K USP 45 Compact. I’ve shot about 150 rounds out of it and it’s in perfect condition. The gun comes with the following:
2- 8 Round Magazines
1- 10 Round Magazine
GGG Rail Adapter
Night Sights (Green Front/Orange Rear)
Extended Ambidextrous Magazine Release
Custom Grip
Custom Kydex Holster
 
The Kydex holster was fit with a Viridian C5L laser/light I used to have on the gun. The gun fits in the holster without the laser/light attached but it’s not a snug fit. I currently have the laser/light on a different gun which I will sell installed on this gun for the right price.
 
The gun has never been dropped or in the dirt. I always keep it cleaned and oiled with CLP and it’s in overall excellent condition. The only reason I’m selling it is because I’m a woman and it’s too big for my hand so I bought a gun with a smaller grip which I use as my primary gun now. 
The gun cost around $1,100 new. The accessories on it cost around $300 so I'm into the gun $1,400. Asking only $998.
I live in San Diego and will ship if needed.
 
Email, text or call if interested, thanks

434,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5910434,For Sale:  Leupold IMS 34MM Mount and Mark 8 1.1X - 8 CQBSS with Horus H27 Reticle,"Gadsden, Gadsden, Alabama","$ 2,900","Listed On: Monday, November 21, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,For sale is my Leupold Mark 8 CQBSS 1.1x - 8x scope. It has the horus H-27 reticle and is illuminated. It also comes with the Leupold IMS mount. It has a 34MM tube. The Optical clarity of the scope is unparralled in a scope of this variable power range. The 1.1 power and red dot is very fast for any CQB scenario. It is a first focal plane scope meaning the reticle grows with the magnification. Ultimately meaning whatever your holds are at 8 power they will be the same at any other magnification. I'm only parting with it because I have two of them. This is a very fair price with the mount included. Most are $3500 just for the scope.  It comes with magnetic scope lens covers. This is a rugged battle tested scope.  Serious offers only please. Do your research on the scope it is mounted on an SPR and can easily get first round hits out to 800 meters. If your serious email me and I'll send up to date pictures of it.
