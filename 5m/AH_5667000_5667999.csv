Engine and transmission are in working order however project is in unfinished condition. List of unfinished work includes carpet, upholstery and headliner, 4 side windows (Windshield and rear glass good.). Body is in unoriginal condition with welded panels and lots of body work. Paint appears to be a one stage enamel look and is not perfect ( has specks and ocassional run but gets tons of compliments and unnoticeable from a few feet... Have been told it's a ""3 foot paint job"" meaning imperfections are indiscernible from a short distance... None the less paint could benefit from a good polish or is a great starting point for someone to do a better paint job, with 90 plus percent of the bodywork being done already... At least that is my professional opinion, but then again that is taking into consideration that this is not a $20,000 show car... It is a chopped up fabricated hot rod with a custom fit engine perfect for a drag car or a builder wanting to do more modifications to a beautiful car with months of work already out of the way. ** THIS IS A PROJECT** And needs a new owner not afraid to tackle all of the small intricate details it needs. It has a set of wide ""show"" wheels that are wider and taller in the rear, giving it a mean stance; however for clearance issues are only good for rolling off trailer and chugging into a driveway or car show. Higher offset (backspaced) wheels will be required for higher speeds. Rear side window frames have been converted from rolling to fixed during fabrication and the door window tracks are missing/ will require fitting. And I have done my best to disclose other imperfections in the photo, but compared to other rust bucket yard ornament cars from the 50's... This car is in great shape for the right individual. Thank you for your interest. Please don't hesitate to contact with your inquiries."

This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol. The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger. Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands. The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.Features:Caliber: 9MMCapacity: 14+1Magazines: 1Barrel Length: 4""Finish: Black Frame, Black SlideAction: Double OnlyFast Action Trigger"

Too many guns and not enough time. It is a full-size polymer frame semi-automatic pistol chambered in the potent .22 Magum round. It comes with (2) 30-round capacity magazine's and factory case and manual. That's a lot of firepower and plinking fun, for such a light weight pistol. This gun is perfect for your “Bug Out Bag.” A careful distribution of polymer and aluminum around key steel components has reduced the pistol's weight to a feathery 13.6 ounces when unloaded. A fully loaded magazine will only add 6 more ounces to the total weight. The pistol has a narrow profile overall. The front-to-back distance in the grip is a bit longer than usual in order to accommodate the .22 Mag. cartridges. The full-length grip also has a subtle pie-wedge shape, narrowing at the front under the trigger guard. The overall effect is a grip that is quite comfortable to work with, even for shooters with smaller hands. The PMR-30 has an ambidextrous safety that is easy to reach and operate. The slide arrives from the factory fitted with bright fiber-optic sites, and it's drilled and tapped to accommodate a scope base. The frame has an integrated Picatinny accessory rail to allow shooters to attach various lights and laser sights. I also have 100 rounds of .22 WMR ammo that I will sell with the gun for an extra $30."
