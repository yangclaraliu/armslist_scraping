The 21A does not require racking the slide thanks to its intuitive tip-up barrel design. Just insert the mag, load the barrel with one round, apply the safely, and your set for any encounter. It has been shot very few times on the practice range so it shows hardly any signs of wear. The 21A has recently become a collectors gun as they are no longer manufactured and are scarce. The following is taken directly from the Beretta website: Comparable in size to a smartphone and weighing only 11.5 oz, the ultra-concealable Bobcat is the ultimate pocket pistol.The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber without racking the slide. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by giving an easy and absolutely safe way to check the bore and and remove a live cartridge. Jamming and stove-piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas."

The white and green boxes are especially early and hard to find.  This would be a nice collection to go with a Chinese SKS or AK.  This ammo was banned from importation in the 90's, there will not be any more!  I checked gunbroker ""sold"" prices and Norinco is selling regularly for $25/box which is insane, but look for yourself. I will take $80 for all 8 boxesI will NOT split up the package and I am not interested in shipping it at this price. I have only seen 8 different Norinco packaging styles, and you have 5 of them right here."

The action is a Eddystone US Model of 1917 with a Douglas ""Premium"" barrel, chambered in 7mm Remington Magnum caliber. The barreled action is mounted in a Monty Carlo style, tiger stripe maple, one piece stock that is in great condition, with only a few dings and dents. The blueing on the barrel is in 98% condition. The buttstock has a Pachmyr recoil pad attached to it. Mounted to the action is a vintage Bausch & Lomb Balvar 8A - 2.5-8x variable scope on a Balvar base. The rifle also has a M.H. Canjar adjustable trigger. "" This trigger is a double set, so you can set it for hunting or make it super sensitive for long distance shooting. My Dad's passion as a young man in PA was shooting groundhogs or crows at 300-700 yards! This is a very beautiful and unique rifle. I am a left handed shooter, so it doesn't work for me.

Only want to trade because I prefer my SGL for sentimal reasons, even though I think the SLR is a better rifle with the features it comes with. I have the factory box and paperwork with accessories the rifle came with. I also have 7x Bulgarian Circle 10 waffle mags and a ton of ammo I can include depending on what you have to offer.And just as a head up, the GM for K-VAR has made a comment at SHOT Show 2016 regarding the availability of these rifles. Apparently these particular rifles will be very limited with importation this year due to the Bulgarian factory having to fulfill military contracts overseas in response to the war on ISIS. He expects them to be sold out in all warehouses this year early."

The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the sought-after characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols but in a more concealable design.
The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.
And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.
Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.
An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.
Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm."

It consists of a brand new Predator 212cc Gas engine coupled to a brand new standard GM 10si 100 amp alternator. Which can produce up to 1400 Watts of charging power. The whole thing is mounted to a very solid steel frame with rubber feet for vibration isolation. The alternator bracket is laser cut from 1/4"" steel plate. This generator can produce around 50 amps (700 watts) with the engine at only about 1/4 throttle, which means it is super quiet, very fuel efficient, and it will last a very, very long time. Lots of careful design and planning went into the making of this generator.  Sure, you can buy a regular generator from a big box store, however, that generator's engine will run at 3600 RPM, non stop, which will drastically shorten it's life, also, it will be incredibly loud, and there is no way to store any of its energy for future use. When you shut off your regular old generator, you will be out of power completely, which means you have to run it continuously. With this generator, your battery bank, and inverter, you only run it when you need to recharge your batteries, and you will still have power all night, rain or shine.  This generator would be perfect for an off-grid solar cabin, tiny house, bug out location, or RV. Just because the sun isn't shining, that does not mean you can't recharge your batteries. Preppers, you really need one of these!  If you are interested, come check it out!  Located near I70 and Ward Rd in Golden, CO. Call Jeremy for the address (7two0) - 6two5 - 99seven7.
