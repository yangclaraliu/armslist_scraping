I got this from a friend last year after we opened its Soviet-era spam can and fired a couple hundred rounds of it. It fired fine at the time.

I bought this stuff online in April '16 and it fires flawlessly. 40 rounds are on 10-round stripper clips in a box, while the other 40 rounds are loose.To reiterate, this ammo is CORROSIVE! It fires without issue in clean and fully-functional firearms,* but if you're an inexperienced shooter, I'll fill you in on a secret: After shooting this stuff - and before you you do anything else - thoroughly clean your firearm(s)' action, chamber, bore, and magazine(s)!If interested, email me for the address.

While not generally sought after by most mosin guys they are considered high quality built. The trick to buying a type 53 is finding one in good condition as these saw a lot of use. This gun has a small crack in the stock and a missing nut. Probably why it has a crack. I have fired it in another stock and it functions great and is in good overall condition with a good bore.

The default caliber is 9mm, but 45acp is also available upon request.The Signature Series Recon features the same proprietary thinned frame as the rest of this series. It allows you to get a firm steady grip, even with smaller hands. The barrel is crowned and the bushing chamfered to enhance the overall smooth appearance and feel of a pistol that has been meticulously gone over to remove each and every sharp surface. Nothing but the finest components are used in the making of all the Signature Series, and the Recon is no exception. The Grips are custom made thin grips, made from G10 that have a very distinctive pattern to them. They include a thumb relief cut which gives the shooter faster access to the magazine release. The Recon comes standard with Nighthawk Custom's new one-piece magwell that's cut from a solid 2½” block of solid tool steel and features a rounded comfort heel. The Front Strap and Mainspring Housing feature Richard's Scalloped cut, which make it comfortable for shooters of all types. The rear sight is the extremely popular Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eight Night Sight. The rear of the slide is serrated at 40lpi to match the serrations of the rear sight. The familiar Heinie logo is engraved behind the rear cocking serrations.

The Remington Model 41 Auto-Angling Trap (an improvement over their earlier Leggett Trap and model 39 Trap) was used during the1943, 1945, 1949, 1951, 1953 and the 1955 Grand Americans. The trap had several improvements to their old Leggett trap plus an auto-angling base was attached. It was developed in 1941 by Remington. The trap was released with a long rod and pipe from behind the trap line prior to the 1951 Grand American. By 1951 the Clyne Brothers of Ohio had developed the Clyne Electric Pullers which were attached to the trap and the targets were released electrically by a button from the scorers table in 1951, 1953 and 1955.  These traps were actually installed and in use at New Milford Rifle and Pistol back in the day.  As a matter of fact the piping is still present in the upper trap house and the lower trap house has the piping and dog house still in place.  These have been in storage for 50 years and are ready for a new home to the serious collector of trap shooting history.  Very heavy cast construction.  They have been moved outside and covered due to some renovations at the club.  Since none of us are old enough to have used these traps we can not be certain that they are complete but examining old pictures it looks like everything is there but are sold as is.  One of the hinge achors is still installed so when a buyer comes forward we will have to get that removed.  We may be able to deliver this as well for a fee."

It is hexagon about 14' in diameter, with a 10 1/2' center ceiling. The walls are at minimum 62"" high or so. It has provisions for a stove, with canvas flaps to cover the hole if not using. It also has vents up high with covers that can be opened or closed with cordage. All the poles and rope are included. There is webbing with hooks all over the inside to hang mosquito netting, shelves, supplies and the like. This would make a great hunting tent, reenactment prop that is actually functional, or wedding tent (if you wedding has an army-green theme!)This tent is owned by my son's boy scout troop for many years, but it's really too big and heavy to carry for their outings. They mostly go backpacking, and this is most certainly not a backpack tent! You could probably fit a dozen men in the tent, with lot of floor space for cots, cooking apparatus, hunting equipment, etc. I'm sure I could fit 25 boy scouts sleeping on the floor!I'm selling this for my son's troop, with all the proceeds going to his troop's general fund. I can help the buyer take it apart and stow it away. Comes with lots of directions (printed on canvas and sewed into the tent!) and the original matching large canvas bag.Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"
