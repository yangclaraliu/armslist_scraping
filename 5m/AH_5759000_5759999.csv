This fine O/U is still in excellent condition and comes with everything pictured including the shotgun, soft case, Fitted Ultralight Briley tube set, & tools. Year of manufacture is 2000 with it returning to Kreighoff in 2002 for inspection and service (all was well). We have also learned that this was received by Briley in March of 2000 direct from Krieghoff for fitment of the ultralights before being sent to Paxton Arms. It was received back to Briley several times between then and 2014 for a number of things including inspection, service and repair of the ejectors.This was originally built as a 28"" Skeet gun but has been upgraded to the 30"" sporting barrels with tapered flat rib and Briley titanium choke tubes. The screw in choke job on the 12ga barrels was performed by Briley in 2003. We were not able to find out who performed the fitment of 30"" barrels, neither Briley or Krieghoff were able to find any record so perhaps this was done by Paxton Arms?This beautiful shotgun features the standard engraving and action with nickel latch & pin upgrade as well as Super Scroll wood with custom stock dimensions (LOP approx. 15"", drop @ comb approx. 1-1/2"").The condition is excellent with very minimal minor handling marks here and there to the wood (most notably about three or four small dings to the left front area for the forend). The bluing is excellent as well with just one small area of finish loss on the left side just in front of the forend, and a small patch of speckling from some light surface rust that has been cleaned up (just above the forend on the left side, no pitting & barely noticeable). Looks to have been very well cared for and shot minimally."

It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.
The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

Liberty Buy-Sell5939 SE 82nd Ave.Portland, OR 97266REDACTEDhttp://www.libertybuysellpdx.net/Open Monday through Saturday. 10-7From the manufacturer's website:Joe Meek was born in Virginia in 1810. His brother preceded him to the West, where Joe visited in 1828. He signed on as a member of Sublette's fur brigade or 1829, and came with the brigade to the Popo Agie Rendezvous of that year. After this Rendezvous, Joe Meek spent several years trapping and exploring the mountains of the west before he became a member of Joe Walker's party and returned to the 1834 Rendezvous at Ham's Fork.Joe was famous and reowned among his contemporaries as a hunter and fighter of grizzly bears. On one occasion, to show his disdain for a man and to illustrate his reckless bravery, Joe slapped a grizzly with his ramrod and survived the episode.Joe married a Nez Perce woman and together they had eight children.Upon the decline of the fur trade, he helped with wagon trains to Oregon and later played an active and militant part in the formation of that state. After the massacre at the Whitman Mission in Walla-Walla, Joe was sent to Washington to ask for settler's protection. He arrived in Washington in 1848 after a long and eventful journey, and at his urging, Congress passed an act organizing the Oregon Territory, to which President Polk appointed him U.S. Marshall.Joe Meek died at his farm home near Hellsboro, Oregon on June 20, 1875. The knife we offer in his name is an all around utility knife and an excellent working knife.5-1/2"" blade, 1/4"" stock, 1"" wide, Stag handle, made with D-2 steel"

If you know what you are looking at then you know this price is way, way, below retail and they are not that easy to find.The Mossberg 590 Mariner Tactical Pump-Action Shotgun comes with a corrosion-resistant Marinecote finish, inside and out, to withstand the punishment of harsh saltwater environments. This is an ideal self-defense shotgun. The 590 Mariner also makes a practical, low-maintenance home defense shotgun and is one of the best firearms to carry while fishing or camping in bear country. The 590 Mariner is an extremely compact, fast-handling shotgun that stows in minimum space and deploys in an instant. The U.S. Military's choice of Model 590 pump shotgun for combat attests to the design's reliable function and durability. The Model 590 utilizes dual action bars to prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action, and a single, large locking lug locks the bolt into the barrel extension, ensuring a solid steel bolt-to-barrel connection. Dual extractors take a solid grip on the shell's rim for reliable extraction, and an anti-jam shell elevator ensures reliable feeding. Shooters can reach the top-mounted safety quickly with the thumb of either hand, making it naturally ambidextrous. The Model 590's simplistic design makes fieldstripping easy by tapping out a single pin, and the magazine cap-nut removes for cleaning the spring, shell follower, and any debris in the mag tube. The 590 Mariner Tactical Pump-Action Shotgun comes with a synthetic buttstock and forearm, a durable recoil pad, and sling swivel studs. The Model 590 cycles 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells interchangeably. Includes Mossberg Speed Feed stock, and heat shield that I have added.Sorry, no case.Priced to sell at $495 CASH ONLY NO TRADES PLEASEIf Interested Please call REDACTED Thanks"
