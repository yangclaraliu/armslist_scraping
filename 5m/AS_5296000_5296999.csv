The reason I'm selling is because this is a BLEMISHED lower. The only thing wrong with it is that some grips do not flush with the back end of the receiver, as the photo indicates. 
Comes with CMMG trigger pack, PSA buffer tube/buffer, MOE grip and a MAGPUL ASAP sling mount. 
Regular old A2 Grips fit it just fine. It's just grips with a backstrap it seems to have a hard time with. I didn't realize this was the ""imperfection"" when I purchased it as I figured there was cosmetic issues but that was not the case. Other than that this is a 100% functioning lower. I'm just starting over from scratch as the MIAD grip I installed (MOE grip included) did not fit with the large backstrap.

Up for sale today is a durable and rugged battle rifle chambered in 7.62 NATO. This particular rifle is no beauty queen but she will hit what you point her at. From the best of my knowledge and the collective information I've gathered from the interweb, this rifle is labeled as an L1A1, though she has many metric parts. There is a bit of light surface rust on the rifle, nothing damaging or that a good scrubbing with a brush and CLP shouldn't fix.It was assembled on a great Hesse receiver that accepts metric mags only. 21"" metric bipod cut barrel with metric gas block and front sight. She sports a wonderful set of metal STG58 handguards that are bipod cut and have STG58 bipods resting nicely in them. The barrel has nearly new looking bore that is bright and shiny but does not have threads cut at the muzzle. There is one small spot of pitting on the outside of the barrel, everywhere else on the barrel is in great condition.The lower receiver is metric as well tho has a L1A1 trigger assembly inside and L1A1 rear sight. L1A1 plastic pistol grip and butt stock.I've not shot it but the previous owner shot about 40 rounds thru her. I purchased this because I felt the need to own a 7.62 battle rifle but decided to build an AR in 7.62x39.The current price of $850 is as the rifle comes with SIX mags and 120 rounds of ammo. The price is slightly negotiable and trades will be entertained. Not looking for anything in particular so send an offer, the worst I will say is no thank you.  AR10's to to the top of the list!!"

It has never been fired. I simply never have time to go to the range.
This is an ideal weapon for competitive or casual clay shooters.
 
Full Description:
 
The Benelli SuperSport Semi-Auto Shotgun has highly advanced features needed to win sporting clays competitions. Several key features of the SuperSport reduce recoil and shooting fatigue, enabling shooters to stay on top of their game for longer periods of time. The buttstock utilizes Benelli's ComforTech® recoil reduction system that reduces recoil by as much as 48%. The ported barrel also reduces recoil and especially muzzle rise, allowing shooters to keep on target for fast follow up shots. The SuperSport operates with Benelli's Inertia Driven™ System that has proven itself in the field to be ultra-reliable, cycling both 2-3/4"" field loads and 3"" magnums interchangeably without adjustments. The recoil operated Inertia Driven System is the epitome of simplicity, with just 3 main parts: the bolt body, an inertia spring, and a rotating bolt head. This super simple design does not use gas to cycle the action, so smoke and burnt powder residue do not enter the gun's mechanism, allowing it to remain cleaner than a gas-operated semi-automatic shotgun. A rotating bolt head features steel locking lugs that lock into the steel barrel extension, creating a steel-to-steel lock that becomes even tighter during firing. The Benelli action is known to withstand tens of thousands of rounds with no failures. The SuperSport features a unique carbon fiber finish synthetic stock with a non-slip, dimpled checkering pattern on the forearm and pistol grip. A QuadraFit™ modular buttstock allows shooters to easily adjust the drop, cast, comb height, and length of pull in minutes. Benelli uses Crio® System barrels and extended Crio choke tubes on the SuperSport that are cryogenically treated to provide an even-grained, slick surface that minimizes pellet deformation, and produce tight, uniform shot patterns. A lightweight ventilated, stepped rib, with a red bar front sight and mid bead, provide an excellent sighting plane. The Benelli SuperSport is an outstanding Semi-Auto Shotgun for high volume shooting. Comes with 5 extended Crio choke tubes (C, IC, M, IM, F), wrench, and a hard gun case."

These were produced in a limited run of 5,000 and are no longer available, especially in brand new condition. It's a derringer, but it's not what most people think of when they picture derringers. This gun is chambered for .45 caliber bullets and 410 shotgun shells. It's an over-under two shooter with a removable trigger guard and a leather side-draw holster. The USA Defender is solid steel, no polymers or plastics, and the gun has been universally praised by critics; just Google it. The gun ccomes with a trigger lock, all original paperwork and the original Bond Arms case. I always kind of thought of derringers as impractical weapons from another era until I saw and read about this gun. Bond Arms' whole deal is to reinvent the derringer and salvage its reputation. They're entirely successful with this gun. Cash is king, but I'm always on the lookout for late model Glocks, etc.Any questions, just ask."
