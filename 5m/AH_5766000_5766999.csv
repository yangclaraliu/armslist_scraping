Very rare, H.B. serial number, not very many of these made. The trigger has been upgraded with a NEU-trigger mod, making the trigger pull stunning. It pulls straight back, no creep or over-travel, at around 5 pounds. Includes 4 MSAR XM-17 waffle mags (3 translucent, 1 OD green). The rifle takes most any standard AR-15 magazine, yes including steel or aluminum GI Mags (20rds or above) keep in mind will most drum mags will not seat all the way into the receiver. Also includes the hardcase (it was for a piece of medical equipment, but it works great as an incognito hardcase). DOES NOT INCLUDE the Leopuld optic. It really likes TulAmmo steel case, it runs perfectly through the rifle. Likes high quality brass. This rifle has become unreliable with cheaper brass ammo like Perfecta bulk from walmart. Steel case still seems to work 100% fine. This is part of the reason why I am selling. Rifle is in excellent cosmetic condition, inside and out! Has some wear on the right side of the stock and the receiver from brass ejection. Can meet in the Wichita, Newton, and the surrounding areas.

Serial number dates it to 1918 manufacture. comes with 1 factory two-tone magazine. It is missing a peice of one of the grip panels, but doesn't impede function, or comfort while shooting. Grips are fairly inexpensive to replace, just haven't got around to it. I'm certainly no expert on these guns, and not really into collecting relics. The research I've done shows pricing between $500 (very poor condition, major rust) to over $1,000 (Like new), so I'm going to have the trade value at $800.Armslist really messed up the pic, can send additional a through email if I need to."

Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.

Calico still makes guns, but they do not make this version any longer i think it was too expensive to manufacture, the quad rail is high quality and solid. the spent casings fall out the bottom from a hole, you can add a bag to catch them.This is the rarest gun in my collection.

His name is Rob Oneil should have seen the security from the uniontown police dept. they did a hell of a job keeping this situation very secure to say the very least. Low profile and a lot of packed iron..     He talked about the history of the seal teams and the the rituals he went through to join the team. He spoke of the political correctness that has infected this country to allow the cancer of shirea law to fester.      The most profound subject of his speech was something we can all relate to and was the reason I wanted to share this experience with you. He spoke of the idea of stress and communication. He made the point that stress (all stress) is self induced and our choice to let it affect us. Emotionally we tend to react not respond.. Reaction is the first thing we tend to do  under stress which restricts us from doing what we should do which is respond. The less we let stress effect is the more we are able to respond quickly. This makes sense if you think of the mentality these guys are trained to have and I believe we can apply this to everyday life. It seems thinking can be relative to reacting instead of a trained response to all life stress.     He mentioned that one thing you'll find about seals is that they all have a sense of humor. Seems as humor  helps with stress it helps you respond and communicate even so without words.

Adjustable rear sights and a fiber optic front sight. Also included is a cross draw nylon holster made by Barsony. Got orginal box too.Why so cheap?Rod has a wiggle to it as if it is bent. However after rod was removed it looked straight. There is a small variance of gap between forcing cone and cylinder as cylinder rotates. So if you want to deal with the warranty of Rossi, or know how to fix it, have at it! I don't feel like dealing with it.It does shoot. Infact I have been shooting it the whole time with the wobble until I discovered it - I think it was like this when purchased. :-(Groups about 2-3"" at about 20 yards."

The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. The bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower full auto rate (when applicable). The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies. Bolt, bolt carrier, firing mechanism, ejector chute and bolt stop are identical for all variations. The short stroke gas operated piston is fully adjustable for different ammunitions and muzzle attachments."

It has been well maintained and protected over the years. If one knows just a little about the nostalgia of owning a Marlin 336, 35 Remington you’ll appreciate the value of this deal. The reasonable value of this rifle is far more than $500, especially considering the popularity with collectors and the condition of the walnut stock and the barrel. I am asking $500 firm.  It is mounted with a Redfield Revolution 2-7x33 scope. I did a dead zero sight-in last week and got tight groups at 50 and 100 yards. The scope is new, with box, taken to the range once. I will include at least 50+ rounds of ammo, about a $70 value. I will also include a vintage suede/canvas “Allen” soft gun case, purchased on ebay for $65 NOTE:  Saturday morning I am traveling to Cabella's in Garner. If you live in the greater Raleigh area and would like to see this rifle you can meet me at Cabella's. Contact me to arrange a meeting.  I will be there early.

The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. The bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower full auto rate (when applicable). The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies. Bolt, bolt carrier, firing mechanism, ejector chute and bolt stop are identical for all variations. The short stroke gas operated piston is fully adjustable for different ammunitions and muzzle attachments."
