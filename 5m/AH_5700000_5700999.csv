Most notable on the Taurus PT92 is the innovation of a three position frame mounted ambidextrous safety which allows this gun to be carried in classic double action(cocked and locked) mode, as well as functioning as a double action decocking lever. Other features include choice of blued or stainless finishes, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and the Taurus security system.  SPECIFICATIONS: Mfg Item Num: 192015917 Category: FIREARMS - HANDGUNS Type :Pistol Action :Single / Double Caliber :9 MM Barrel Length :5"" Capacity :17 + 1 Safety :Ambidextrous Grips :Checkered Rubber Sights :Fixed Weight :34 oz Finish :Stainless   TAURUS PT92 AFS 9MM STAINLESS RAIL Manufacturer: TAURUS Model: PT92 Caliber: 9MM Capacity: 17 Barrel Length: 4.75″ Finish: Stainless"

So kinda how it all breaks down is by definition the gun is categorized as an enhanced DAO. However it's a bit different than most other DAO guns. When the slide is racked (loading the gun), the mainspring is compressed and kept in place as with any single action mechanism. However, the external part of the hammer moves fully forward and so does the trigger. In essence you have a cocked pistol that doesn’t look cocked. The first shot has a longer trigger movement like a traditional double action pull, but it’s not any heavier than subsequent trigger pulls. The reset is a little longer than some striker-fired guns or a 1911, but it’s only about a third of the total trigger travel arc. 
 
So because of that you get the benefits of having a ""single action"" trigger pull with the added benefits of a re-strike capability. That along with getting the very tried and true design of the P30 pistol line up."

Offer it in all major self-defense calibers, that’s how. When the Springfield Armory® XD-S® arrived on the scene in 9MM and .45ACP , its svelte profile quickly made it the pistol to beat for concealed carry. The thin, single-stack design allows it to melt into the body when carried, yet it’s shockingly easy to control. Even those with larger hands can get most of three fingers on the grip. Practice is everything, so rather than go for uncomfortably and uncontrollably small, we aimed to create a handgun that’s easy and pleasurable to shoot while still offering amazing concealment. You’ll enjoy your range time with the XD-S® and become a better shooter as a result.

The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it. The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use. Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

Barrels is marked ""5.56 NATO 1/7 CL MP PALMETTO"".  You would be hard pressed to find a higher quality barrel than an FN at any price point in the AR/M4 world.  The lower is a PSA as well machined from aluminum forgings 7075-T6, hardcoat anodized MIL-A-8625F, Type III, Class 2, milspec diameter receiver extension, M4 stock, staked M4 lock nut, standard carbine buffer and an un-notched hammer compatible for 9mm use.  The stock has a home made cheek riser with closed cell foam on it to keep my sight picture as effortless as possible, but of course it can be taken off if it doesn't suit your setup.  I don't think that will be the case though very few people today understand rifle fit and it's link to repeatable accuracy as almost no stocks off the line are set up for the masses.   The BCG is PSA's premium and made of mil-spec carpenter 158 steel, Shot peened, high pressure tested and mag particle inspected.   Gas key is machined out of bar stock, chrome lined phosphate coated, and secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked per mil-spec. Bolt carrier is phosphated outside and chrome lined inside.  The charging handle is a PSA gunfighter which is fantastic if you decide to run a scope so you don't have any issues racking a round.  Aftermarket I added a 5"" Picatinny rail on the bottom forward section of the KeyMod handguard in addition to a QD swivel and mount for 1 1/4"" webbed slings.  It's been properly installed and secured with LocTite Blue thread locker.  Currently there is a standard USGI 2 point sling on it since I shoot offhand quite a bit when not in a climber, but I will include a 2 point adjustable Condor Speedy as well which attaches to the buttstock and allows a few more options when hiking around.  You will receive 3 brand new never used Magpul 30 round mags with dust covers so you are going to be ready to hit the range with everything you need to have a lot of fun.  I will also include an old school Colt alloy 8 round mag which will come in handy if you ever try to use a Lead Sled b/c the older models don't let you fit the rifle upright with a hi cap mag.  This rifle will not come sighted in as I had a Leupy 12x on it which is not for sale it's going on my AR-10.  There is a set of Magpul MBUS iron sights on as you can see though so you are fully ready to hit the range.  These came off another AR I rarely use so they are not sighted in for this PSA(I reset them to mechanical zero).  I will also throw in a spring loaded bipod which packs up small and is easy to take into the field with you on a hunt.  It's helped me take many a hog.This is a cash only sale and for pick up at my home in South Tampa please.  If you have a valid FL carry permit we can do the entire transaction at my home.  If you don't have a permit then the only way I will conduct the sale is if we have a local dealer do a NICS check and you fill out the appropriate forms.  Sorry to be a stickler, but this is my comfort zone.  I'm happy to pay the NICS and FFL fees for the transaction at a local dealer.  If you have a favorite that's fine I have a local outfit I like as well.  I prefer a small mom and pop dealer in Brandon just great folks, but we can work that out if we get that far."

THanks for looking. A couple years ago I set out to build a rifle for my wife. She needed something small and compact and as lightweight as possible. I ended up Frankensteining a few diferent rifles to build her the lightest weight AR that is still accurate. The lower is a Bushmaster Carbon 15 Lower with CMMG components. The upper is a Smith and Wesson with a HBAR. The carbon 15 Comes with a pencil barrel and carbon fiber upper as most of you probably know the pencil barrel whips after about 5 shots through it and is inaccurate. I still have it and it is yours if you'd like it. You cannot change the barrels on them as the have a proprietary barrel nut. I went with an S&W setup. The rifle has a Gen 2 MBUS sight and the F post setup. It is short and lightweight. The upper that is on their is a race upper, and has no dust cover. Wel,l me and the wife got a divorce and I'm surely not going to hang onto it. I've got a 30 round mag for it and a blackhawk case that you can have as well. The rifle has about one mag through it and has been meticulously maintained. Also included is a Bushnell Red Dot sight. You can be shooting this afternoon! Please call or text for more information.

There were approximately 8000 of these produced and issued. The serial number is at the beginning of the run and features the police departments code of arms with shield in front of the sight. This pistol is unique for several reasons. Firstly, limited production of 8000 and this is serial number 0XXXX. It is an all there every number matching pistol including mags and box. This is the combat model known as the pre-T model. 1961 and before, features the original combat sights and internal extractor. To my knowledge this is the only example for sale like it. One other can be found but it is a post 61 that features the tangent sights and is known as the C-series. Moving along the shield located in front of the sight is actually backwards. Normally the top of the shield is closest to the shooter and the bottom further away. However, in this example the top of the shield is actually pointing away from the shooter and the bottom of the shield is closer to the shooter. Finally, the condition of the pistol is great. All of the markings can be read and seen. Making it easily identifiable and this weapon was issued to a specialized unit within the Buenos Aires police department. They were the individuals that you didn't want to visit you at home. I have personally shot this weapon and it is without a doubt the most accurate semi-auto I have ever shot. This is an amazing and rare example of a Browning Hi-Power. Unfortunately I must sell it. If you have any questions please contact me. More pictures can be made available upon request. I have edited the picture to make the serial numbers unreadable. It can be made available for any serious inquirey."

For over 100 years, the 1911 pistol design has earned high praise for its near-perfect ergonomics, reliability, and effectiveness. Springfield Armory® engineered the original EMP® with an all-new patented short action. Seventeen re-designed parts later, the EMP® came out a smaller, more comfortable, and more concealable package optimized for the smaller 9MM and .40SW calibers. Among the community of those who know, it has earned a reputation as one of the most shootable compact pistols ever. The all-new 4″ Lightweight Champion™ offers a longer four-inch barrel that presents increased sight radius and more practical accuracy.

The Thompson mag will need to be shaved down so that the button will latch into the magazine.  My brother bought this a few months back for a hefty price, then he needed money so I purchased it from him.

Both rifles are excellent shooters, but being that I don't have access to or time to shoot these at extended ranges I can't justify keeping these around.

No mag included-Manners T3 stock with aluminum pillars and bedded by Robert, two flush cups on side with three standard sling swivel studs as well.-Custom trigger adjusted to 2.5 lbs.280 AI has less than two boxes of ammo through it, just enough to sight the scope in and shoot a few groups. 284 Winchester Specs:-Sportsman 78 LA fully blue printed (Identical to a Remington 700, Remington only made these for a few years only difference is the roll mark on the side of action.)-Custom oversized ground recoil lug, pinned to receiver.-Rock Creek barrel, 1-8.7"" twist, threaded 5/8-24 with custom matching thread protector, I believe it’s the M24 contour-Bolt spiral fluted and original Remington handle removed and replaced with tig welded pacific tool and die straight threaded handle with knurled bolt knob. Handle was fitted to action by SSG prior to being blue printed by RW Synder.-Complete action, bolt, barrel, recoil lug, and thread protector have been finished in black nitride.

Both rifles are in excellent condition. I would like to get $2,200 each plus actual shipping to your FFL (scope, rings, mount, bi-pod, and mag not included).

I bought it impulsively about a year ago. I have never used it. It is basically new. It has a two year trasferrable factory warranty. My priorities have changed and need to sell it since it just sits there on a shelf. Below is the description from Armasight's website. The cheapest I could find it online was $3600. Will sell it for $2800. No trades. Let me know if you have any questions or if you want me to send your more photos. You can text or call me at REDACTED Thanks!Description from Armasight's Website:Armasight is excited to introduce its latest and most technologically advanced family of Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sights to the Sporting, Law Enforcement and Military markets. The Zeus product line is based on the latest FLIR Tau 2 VOx microbolometer core and is composed of ten (10) different models -- each optimizing performance, price and state of the art technology for a variety of uses and mission applications ranging from the seriously committed hunter to the military designated marksman. While primarily designed as a weapon scope, the Zeus functions equally well in its collateral assignments as a magnified spotting scope or handheld thermal imager.The Zeus is a solid state, uncooled, long-wave infrared, magnified dedicated weapon scope intended for day and night engagements without the need to remove the sight from the rifle. The 24/7 mission capability is only one of the strengths of Zeus. The thermal imaging technology also allows you to detect targets by cutting through snow, dust, smoke, fog, haze, and other atmospheric obscurants. Unlike the use of laser targeting or near-infrared illumination to augment night vision equipment, the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight is extremely difficult to detect with other devices as it emits no visible light or RF energy.In addition to being the smallest and lightest in their class, Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sights are characterized by their simple and intuitive controls, functions and features that are layered among direct button adjustments, direct combination button functions, and electronic menu selections. This ""layering"" of easy-to-understand control functions provides the operator with a framework for customizing his preferences and exploiting the robust variety of setting options available in the Zeus. The Zeus has a series of selectable color modes based on a rich, upgradeable software package. A wireless remote switch is included to activate the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight when positioned in the ""standby"" mode. The Zeus has the ability to record imagery and is equipped with a video-out capability in operator selectable NTSC or PAL formats. The Zeus uses the same multi-pin connector to provide both video-in imagery, where there is a need for map or rangefinder display overlays, and external power access.Zeus weapon installation is easy, repeatable, and reliable based on a unique and highly user-friendly MIL-STD-1913/WEAVER/PICATINNY rail compatible quick-release locking mechanism. The solid state technology and software algorithms combined with a complimentary color reticle platform used in the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight ensure maximum reticle contrast, high level target accuracy, and boresight retention that cannot be achieved with mechanical boresight adjusters and traditional ballistic drums. This level of accuracy is translated into the electronic zoom (e-zoom) function of the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sights which can be progressively increased from 1x to 2x and 4x without changing the point-of-aim to point-of-impact relationship of the targeting reticle.Armasight is convinced that the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight represents one of the most sophisticated sighting devices available to hunters, SWAT Teams, and the Military on the market today based on superior price-to-performance value.Special User-Adjustable Imaging ToolsActive Contrast Enhancement (ACE) -- a digital ""Contrast"" correction that allows for a smart scene optimization based on dynamic adjustments where a variety of contrast levels occur depending on relative scene temperature.Second Generation Digital Detail Enhancement (DDE) -- a ""Sharpness"" correction that is digitally enhances the picture to present clearer imagery, significantly improves edge sharpening and further reduces image noise.Smart Scene Optimization (SSO) -- a fine-tuning computational correction that significantly improves an overall visual acuity for targets that have thermal signatures similar to a surrounding background.Automatic Gain Control (AGC) -- a ""Gain"" correction that used to automatically adjust the gain to an appropriate range, the weaker the image signal, the stronger the gain.User-Controlled Manual Non-Uniformity Correction/Flat-Field Correction (UCMNUC/FFC). There is a mechanical shutter between the camera sensor and the lens. This shutter is used to perform a non-uniformity correction (NUC) also known as flat-field correction (FFC. During FFC, the shutter presents a uniform temperature source to each detector element in the array.

Threaded barrel, milled reciever and trigger group. Factory chromed barrel. All matching serial #'s. Black monte carlo stock. 30 rd detatchable magazine. Comes with the shown SKS and the 30 round steel mag. Modified to accept SKS 'duckbill' magazines. Chrome barrel is perfect, absolutely no rust or pitting. Finish is in pretty good shape as well, no rust or major wear on the blue. This is pretty much as good as your going to get for a 'entry price range SKS' these days. Gun shops are selling SKS's that look like they have been on the front lines of the trenches for 450$. No FFL fee, no shipping fee, no tax buying from me. A SKS at a shop can quickly turn from 450$ to 500$+ after tax and fees. Never shot it with this steel mag, so mag may require some fitting.
Cash only. All emails wanting paypal will be ignored. If you don't have your drivers license on you when you come to buy it, you aren't buying it. Must be willing to sign a bill of sale. The firearm is sold AS IS and is stated on the contract you will sign. I am not responsible for any inherited problems the gun comes with, or any damage, physical, mental, or property base that may come from its operation. I bought this firearm from Sooner State Pawn about a year ago I believe, and it has not been transfered or sold since.
Not really interested in trades unless it's for another SKS."
