As you can see it has been treated well. It is built like a truck. Although it was never dropped out of a tree or had harsh abuse, this bow would probably keep on shooting if you did not purposely try to damage it. Ruggedness is a valuable part of the design of a bow. Some of the newer ones look kind of flimsy, but they will shoot faster. Having a beefy frame and good tough, quality parts and components is also nice safety feature. A shooter can always keep a bow safe and ready to shoot, but this one keeps it simple. It lends itself to a quick, accurate inspection before firing. It has a new scope with yellow tinted see through scope covers with good mounts. The limbs, cams and string were replaced @ Barnett.

It has never cut anything and has only been cliped into my pocket for 8 months. Retails for 130.00 and I am asking for less than half of that. My loss is your gain! Will ship anywhere in the US. Please watch Youtube videos of this knife and you will be amazed at the fast deplyment of this weapon.*  The Fox 479 G10 Black Folding Karambit is the best self-defense tool and utility knife utilizing the most effective and effecient advancement in the knife industry today: The patented Emerson Wave. When removed from the pocket, this wave shaped protrusion on the spine of the blade catches the edge of the pocket, instantly deploying the blade with only one hand without the use of springs! It doesn't get any faster than that in a self-defense situation.
Manufactured by Fox Knives in Maniago, Italy, using one the highest quality and strongest steels: NC690Co Stainless Steel. This provides a fine and consistent edge, enhanced edge retention and sharpening receptivity, and corrosion resistance for those far off and exreme locations.  The Fox Karambit Model 479 features a retention ring that can be used for blunt force impact as well as a more sure and secure grip.
The tiger claw shaped and black teflon coated blade provides devestatingly sharp tip and blade surface with a thickness of .12"" and 3"" in length, offering a total of 7.5"" when fully extended, and 5"" when closed. It utilizes a liner lock and weighs in at a mere 4.02oz. The adjustable pocket clip allows ambidextrous use. It designed for tip-up carry with the Emerson Wave feature for fast deployment in a reverse grip to most effectively utilize its slashing power from its pocketed resting position in an upward motion, but can also be utilized in the forward grip.
This tool has been field tested in the most extreme climates and and proven to be of the highest quality on the market today. Whether you need to a utility knife to open boxes or clamshell packaging, or a self-defense tool to open a can of whoop ass, the Fox karambit is a force to be reckoned with of the highest quality and the most reliability in any situation where a need arises.

There's very little info in the ads and they rarely mention what the gun being sold actually is and say contact x email address for more info. They also don't list a city in the location, just Kentucky Kentucky. I even received two emails today about a rifle I sold and removed my ad for months ago. Both worded the same but with different email addresses. Seems like armslist is starting to cater to these ass monkeys. How else would they get the info for an ad thats been deactivated for months?
