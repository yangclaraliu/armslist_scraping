These Remington Woodsmaster rifles are known reliable, accurate deer and mid sized game rifles. Grab some ammo, fine tune the rifle scope and you're ready for season!The history of the Remington Model 742: Model 742 Autoloading Centerfire Rifle In December of 1959, the Model 742 was introduced replacing the Model 740. In January of 1960, the Model 742 was introduced in grades of A, ADL, D and F with caliber's in .257 Roberts, .270 Win, 300 Savage and the BDL versions. January of 1962 brought the new version of the Model 742C and CDL (carbine) in .280 Rem, 30-06 and the .308 Win. In January of 1963, the 6MM Rem was added. January of 1964 brought about the discontinuation of the .280 Rem in the CDL grades. The 150th Anniversary edition, in limited quantities, came about in January of 1966 in BDL grade, right and left hand stocks in caliber's of .30-06 and .308 Win. January of 1968 brought in the .243 Win and ADL calibers with a change to the checkering on the ADL and C grades, thus eliminating the A and CDL grades. January of 1976 brought about the Bicentennial Edition in limited quantities. The 7MM Express Rem cartridge was the new designation for the .280 Rem in January of 1980. In December of 1980, the Model 742 was discontinued and replaced by the Model 4 and Model 7400.   Quality materials and sound manufacturing practice went into the making of this gun. The receiver was expertly milled and finished cut to design specifications. The barrel was forged and rifled by skilled barrel makers. The coloring vats added a dense gunmetal coating to the metal parts. The stock and forearm were seasoned in wood kilns then shaped by experienced wood workers. A durable and long lasting wood finish was then applied to bring out the natural wood grain. All parts were carefully assembled to make a strong and smooth working action. The ""Woodsmaster"" Model 742 was the latest in Remington's line of outstanding autoloading high power rifles. This gas operated rifle was designed for rugged hunting use and built to Remington's rigid standards using quality materials. The Model 742 is take-down in design, meaning the barrel and action parts could be removed for maintenance and care. Two grades were supplied...Standard and the new BDL ""Custom Deluxe."" Standard grade listed both rifle and carbine length models. A five (5) shot capacity was available in both models, counting four (4) cartridges in the detachable clip magazine and one (1) in the barrel chamber. Extra clips could be ordered. A new ""step-down"" receiver styling design for the BDL provided a level-line sighting from stock to sights. Front and rear sights were removable on all grades for additional telescope mounting sight requirements. Barrel screw holes could then be filled with receiver plug screws removed from the receiver. The featured BDL stock of American walnut now included the cheek piece and Monte Carlo design for comfort and more effective sighting. A BDL cheek piece for left hand shooters with left hand safety was optional. The new ""taper-flow"" fore-end improved the front holding position on the BDL. Custom checkering was applied with an attractive basket weave pattern. This interlacing checkering design was furnished on the stock and for-end of the BDL Grade. The form-fitting BDL pistol grip was accentuated with black cap and white spacer. A cap and spacer of the same material were also fitted to the fore-end. To all grades, the tough wearing Du Pont RK-W ""bowling pin"" wood finish added a lustrous quality appearance.

Included is the original factory paperwork, factory box, 10 round magazine, 30 round magazine, and child saftey lock. Here is what I have all in on the gun:1. Pistol - $569 - current price on Gun Broker2. Noveske Flaming Pig KX3 - $125 on Midway USA3. Kel-Tec Compact Forend - $49 on Kel-Tec's website4. Kel-Tec Single Point Sling - $16 on Kel-Tec's website5. C-Products 30 Round Magazine -  $9.99 anywhereThat is a total of $767 in the gun. Now, a little about the gun. I bought this in 2013 before I started building AR pistols. It has maybe 300 rounds through it. I have kept it well lubed and maintained. It is a fun and reliable little pistol, concealable in a backpack, ample firepower for bugging out, and a great truck gun. Without a muzzle device like the KX3, PLR's are known to be loud and have a huge sideways concussion blast. By already having the KX3 installed, the gun is much more reliable, fun, and tame to shoot indoors or outdoors. It has been sitting in my safe for almost 1 year now unfired due to the fact that I have a few different AR pistols that I now use at the range. The price is fair and firm. It is a 40% discount relative to what you would pay for everything new. That is unheard of on Armslist. I have priced it to move. Cash only. If you want to purchase it, we will meet at my local FFL in Apex, NC and do a proper transfer. I will pay the $30 transfer fee."

A favorite among competitive shooters and sportsmen! Whether you're looking for power, accuracy, or excellent fit and finish, the TX200 MkIII has it. It's ideal for anything from competing in local field target matches to hunting. The TX200 Mk III features a Lothar Walther barrel and a richly finished Monte Carlo stock with a raised cheekpiece and deep, flawless bluing. In addition to the superior fit and finish, the TX200 Mk III features a two-stage trigger and an automatic safety. Loading is via a sliding breech, which is revealed when you cock the underlever. You have to mount a scope since it doesn't come with open sights. The TX200, is known for accuracy! It's great for hunting, shooting spinners, killing tin cans or popping paper targets. Enjoy the relatively quiet report and moderate recoil from a gun that has a long heritage of accuracy. -------------------------------------------------------------------
