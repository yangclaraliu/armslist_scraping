It has beautiful wood and deep blue metal finish on the octagonal barrel with a color case hardened receiver. The photos just don't do it justice. One of the most appealing steel frame finishes, the colors come from a genuine case-hardening process on frame and rifle-style fore-end cap that sets these rifles apart from other models, without the bright “Here I am!” of the brass and silver rifles. In the woods, where they’re right at home, the deep bluing, dark walnut, and mottled case colors form their own basic camouflage that your Great Grandpa would have been very familiar with while hunting deer or elk, and we like to think he would have been quite appreciative to have this Henry along. Merging old with new, the profile of the Color Case Hardened rifles is conventional, and the caliber is also long-established. The .30-30 dates back to 1894, and while it may be considered ancient today, the modern hunter can handle anything from coyote to grizzly, with the right load. The rifles themselves are built in the Rice Lake, Wisconsin, factory, 100% American, in traditional form with octagonal barrel, adjustable buckhorn and bead sights, and checkered walnut furniture. The modern part comes from the quality steels we used, the transfer bar safety, the Henry magazine tube loading, sling swivel studs, a drilled and tapped frame, and a ventilated rubber recoil pad. I work a lot of hours, but I am normally around on Wens. during the day, and Tues. and Thurs. mornings and will answer emails as soon as possible. Cash only, no trades.

It has a good bore and I had the headspace recently checked by a gunsmith. Includes a bayonet that fits. I'm only looking to get back what I put into it as far as the price, so please be reasonable.Its markings match the ATF 1954 badged one here: http://www.turkmauser.com/gew98/More info:""M38 ( or more correctly, M938, as printed in Turkish instruction manuals) is not a specific rifle type, but a General Indication of all of Turkey's MAUSER Action rifles, whether Intermediate or Standard length Actions, and whether made in Turkey or Refurbiushed from Foreign (read German) Made MAUSER Rifles.1938 was chosen because it was (a) the year of the passing of Mustafa KLemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkisjh republic and its first president ( Turkey's ""George Washington""...a Military hero and commander, a head of a revolution, Liberator of his occupied land , and initiator of its Secular Constitution and coming into the Modern World.)1938 was also the year CZ set up a complete factory in Turkey to MAKE from scratch a truely ""Turkish "" rifle, with Mauser design, and in the now standardised 7,9 caridge. ( Kirikkale a suburb of Ankara, under the control of the Askeri Fabrikalar (Administration of Army Factories).By 1950, the AS FA had developed to such a degree that it was re-organised as a Government owned Corporation, and change its name to MKE ( Makina ve Kemia Endustrisi). In the 1950s, a requirement for a small lot of Refurbished rilfes, led to the production of the ""ATF"" series, Using WW I Militasry Aid Gew98s as the basis, and converting them/re-furbishing them to the General ""M938 design"", the same as all the 1930s conversions had been done.The reason for this was that (A) there were substantial quantities of Gew98s needing rebarrelling or restocking, and (b) the production line of the ""Kirikkale"" Turkish mauser had ceased production in 1946, and the Factory was now re-tooled for making other things, and about to get into Licensed manufacture of Semi Auto and Full Auto rifles.The ""ATF"" stands for ""Askeri Tufiki Fabrika ( Army Rifle factory...an Army depot or Workshop dedicated to Repairing Rifles etc, as had existed under ASFA back in the 1930s and 40s, for conversion of WW I rifles to the ""New Standard"".The marking ""98 Th"" indicates the origin of the receiver, as a guide to Unit Armourers; The rifle Looks like a Kirikkale, but the barrel is Large Shank, Not Small shank, as in the K'Kale;Bolts are the same ( standard M98 length) and the stocks are interchangeable with a little adjustment ( OAL length of Reciever front ring is different) and Wooden handguards are slightly different.From my Survey ( Parallax Turkish Board) ATF rifles mere "" made up"" in 1954 to 1956, at a rate of about 5,000 a year.By the late 1950s, all Turkish Mauser Rifles were relegated to a Turkish Soldiers Conscript training, as the Regular Army was Armed with US Garands, and eventually H&K G3 rifles.The ATF marked rifles are the last in a series of Turkish Mausers, which stretch from the M1887 BP rifle thru to interned Ex-german Kar98k rilfes, and all the Conversions and refurbishments of the 1930-1956 periods.All the Modern smokeless Mausers ( M1890 etc) were eventually cvonverted to 7,9mm cartridge, and the stocking up unified into a common pattern (""the M1903"" Stock).THis was to use a common bayonet Hilt for all Turkish Rifles (the M1903/30 type)Regards,Doc AVAV Ballistics."""

The 16.25"" chrome-lined, hammer-forged barrel has a removable 6-port muzzle brake with a 14x1mm left-hand thread. It has a reinforced black polymer stock set with a stainless steel heat shield inside the lower handguard and a fixed, intermediate-length buttstock (13.4"" LOP). It has an 800m rear sight. It ships with one 10-round mil-spec Bulgarian Arsenal magazine, sling, cleaning rod, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. Arsenal's Las Vegas-made SAM7R rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. All firearms manufactured by Arsenal, Inc. use 100% brand new components, and every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank. Arsenal's hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel and eliminates internal voids and cooling deformations. Each forged receiver blank requires more than 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal's meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequaled strength, precision, and durability.

There are quite a few 7.62x25 jungle conversions that came out of Vietnam and are mostly very crudely done out of a lot of worn and junk parts. This gun appears to be mostly WWII original Colt parts. I tried to show in the pictures the careful welding and machining that was done on this one. Notice how nicely the slide face is machined and the extractor moved over for the smaller cartridge head and the ejection port is opened for the longer case.

I purchased and added these to this gun because I was wanting a new carry gun, but since handling it I have come to accept that single stacks don't fit my hands so well, I'm much more comfortable with a double stack. I would consider trades or reasonable cash offers...please dont low ball me as those offers will be ignored.

Gaston Glock's masterpiece would go on to gain worldwide acceptance with shooters in both professional and civilian circles, the GLOCK 22 Gen 3 has become one of the most popular duty sidearms ever produced. The Gen 3 GLOCK 22 is another evolution of the game changing design with forward-thinking features that bring the pistol into the 21st century. New finger grooves and an updated texture on the grip ensure that you have a firm grasp even if your hands are muddy or worse yet, bloody. GLOCK also added a standard light rail to the Gen 3 pistols to allow shooters to mount their choice of lights. Police, military, competition shooters and those looking for a means of defense turn to the Glock 22 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments. Featuring a large 15 round magazine capacity that offers more than enough firepower when it is needed most.

The gun has only 100-120 rounds maximum through it total.  Gun is great for youth or women as the recoil is low and the .243 caliber is good for white tail deer hunting. This caliber and cartridge shoots very flat out past 300+ yards (1200 feet) so you can always hit the vitals zone on a deer across a greater range of distances than a slug gun will ever hit. Check out articles on this model and you'll see for yourself.This premium model has a stainless steel barrel and bolt-action, a nice synthetic Savage Accu-Stock (which is an aluminim bedding system for the receiver), the Savage Accu-Trigger (adjustable pull trigger), and a removable 4-round stainless steel box magazine.Gun is in excellent shape.  Here what is being sold: The Savage 16FCSS model 17777 rifle complete, a Leupold VX-1 3-9X-40mm scope (mounted), a Leupold scope cover, (2) Savage 4-round factory magazines, (2) boxes of .243 100 grain ammo, the original Savage box and Savage manual.$$$ I would like $600 for the package $$$ NOTE: I will ship at the buyers cost and the sale will need to be completed thru FFLs for legal transfer.  If local to the Avon NY area, I will meet at the FFL for your NICS check ($10) and complete the private sale. I would like a certified bank check or cash for payment. You can also see my seller history and record on eBay with for my ID of ""faville1"".  Thanks for reading this far."

Gaston Glock's masterpiece would go on to gain worldwide acceptance with shooters in both professional and civilian circles, the GLOCK 17 has gained universal respect.  The latest GLOCK 17, the Gen4, is chambered in 9mm Luger features a modular backstrap system that allows a shooter to tailor the rough textured grip of the pistol to their hand size for optimal ergonomics. Making the pistol even more user-friendly, GLOCK has introduced a reversible magazine catch on the Gen4 pistols, now right and left-hand shooters can enjoy the pistol as Gaston Glock envisioned. To tame the recoil of the 9mm cartridge, GLOCK has introduced a dual recoil spring system that not only makes the GLOCK 17 a soft shooting pistol but also significantly increases the service life of the pistol.   Police, military, competition shooters and those looking for a means of defense turn to the Glock 17 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments.

Clean title for both boat and trailer in hand. Had about $600 worth of repairs done to the motor (still have receipts), but it has been sitting for the last 3 months. I have taken the boat out and cleaned it bi-weekly to keep it in good shape, just haven't had the time to take it out and bills are more important right now so I have to let it go. Motor runs really well but currently has some build up clogged in the lower unit which isn't allowing water to travel up the tube and come out of the pisser at the top of the motor. All you have to do is take the lower unit off and unclog it with a long piece of metal (i've done it once before with the help of a friend, but i'm not very mechanically savy so i'd rather sell for a reduced cost and let someone else take it apart). I can start it up and let it run in person to show how well the motor runs, just again needs to have that tube unclogged.
