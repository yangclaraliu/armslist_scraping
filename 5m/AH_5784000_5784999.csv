The Benelli Super Black Eagle II Semi-Auto Shotgun sets the standard for high performance and versatility in semi-automatic shotguns meant for hardcore hunting. The SBE II features a rugged, weather-resistant composite stock, finished with the Realtree Max-4® camo pattern designed specifically for waterfowl hunting. Filled with cattails, swamp grasses, and cane, Max-4 blends in with marshlands as well as corn stubble and other agricultural cropland. At the heart of the Super Black Eagle II is Benelli's ultra-reliable Inertia Driven™ operating system, consisting of just 3 main parts: the bolt body, an inertia spring, and a rotating bolt head. The Inertia Driven action cycles 2-3/4"", 3"", and 3-1/2"" shotgun shells interchangeably without adjustments. This super simple design does not use gas to cycle the action, so smoke and burnt powder residue do not enter the gun's mechanism, allowing it to remain cleaner than a gas-operated semi-automatic shotgun. The smaller mass of parts in the action, and no heavy gas operating components housed inside the forend, make the SBE II an extremely trim, and fast handling semi-automatic shotgun. The ComforTech® recoil reduction system tames recoil from magnum waterfowl loads and reduces muzzle rise for fast shooting on multiple targets. Benelli manufactures all Super Black eagle barrels and choke tubes with their Crio® System, which creates an even-grained, slick surface resulting in less resistance against wads and shot for uniform shot patterns and cleaner barrels."

I just recently bought this rifle from a member of the US Army Marksmanship Unit off SnipersHide and it has less than 500 rounds through it. He had gotten it for his wife to shoot but she never took interest. I bought it from him to see if I might be interested in precision long range shooting and after taking a class I'm hooked! So much so that I'm wanting to build a custom rifle, so this one has to go. The rifle will come with some very nice upgrades including, an aluminum bolt shroud and bolt knob from LRI. It also includes a .30 cal muzzle brake from Midwest Industries. It will come in a Plano all weather tactical hard case with custom cut foam. It will also come with the two 10 round factory PMags. One mag has been modded to allow the bolt to close when the mag is inserted. I have the factory box as well, if you want that. The scope, rings, bipod, and twenty round mag aren't included. This rifle is a tack driving beast. I started load development on it and got a couple loads that are shooting 5 shot groups at 100 yards under .5 MOA. That wasn't even using a bench rest, just the bipod and my hand as a rear rest. This rifle could easily be a .25 MOA rifle with the right load and proper bench rest. Ill be happy to share my recipe with the buyer. This rifle was banging a 8x12"" steel silhouette at 730 yards with ease. These rifles are hard to come by, especially in 6.5 CM. No need to wait, and this one has all the popular upgrades already done. Plus you don't have to waste your time or money working up a load for the rifle since I've already done the work for you. I'm asking $1550. No trades as I'm needing to sell to build a custom bolt gun. I'm located in Shelby county but I'm willing to travel within reason. Text me for the fastest response. I can text any specific photos you may be interested in. Overall condition of the rifle is 9.8 out of 10. Text me at REDACTED"

The bottom is a DPMS and the top is a Smith and Wesson 5.45. I've had this rifle for a few years now and moved to Arizona about a year ago and have not fired it since. Fires great and was serviced by a gunsmith shortly after I purchased it years ago to maintain and ensure it was in working order. Fires 5.45x39 ammo, a smaller Russian round. But don't let that fool you. These rounds are sharp tipped, light weight, and high velocity developed for the AK-74 platform. The S&W top is rare and can easily be replaced with a 5.56/.223 Top as the bottom of the Rifle is technically a .223/5.56 platform. No hangups, ammo always fires, accurate, less recoil than 5.56 and thus can be fired very quickly on target. Rifle includes a strap, 4 magazines, and some 2,000 rounds of 5.45 in spam cans. these cans are now fairly rare in the US but the ammo can still be easily purchased online in smaller quantities. one of the spam cans has been opened but only a few rounds shot out of it. maybe 100 or so. each spam can contains 1080 rounds in packages of 20. $1000 firm. no trades."

Built in 1889 according to factory letter.  28"" sleeved barrels choked IC and light modified (by gauge), 2.5"" chambers.  Sleeving done by E.C. Ashthorpe of Severn Stoke, Worcester, and the seam is nearly invisible.  Approximate dimensions: 14"" LOP to front trigger, 1.5"" DAC, 2"" DAH, ~3/16"" cast off.  6lb. 7oz and very well balanced.  Features Lancaster's distinctive vine-leaf engraving.  Very good condition but does show a bit of bluing wear on the floor plate and muzzle.  Includes Jeff's Outfitters canvas and leather case with accessories and reproduction trade label.  I also have a flat of assorted 2.5 inch shells which I can include at extra cost.  May consider trade for Darne slide action shotgun, or partial trade for Walther PPK or Colt New Frontier 22/22WMR convertible. Delivery to front range area possible.  Scammers and lowballers will be ignored.  While not as well known in America, Lancaster made guns of similar quality to Holland & Holland, Purdey, and Boss.  Annie Oakley owned four Lancasters.  The O-grade is a unique boxlock built on Frederick Beesley's patent self-opening mechanism, similar to Purdey's self opening sidelock which was also invented by Beesley.  Most London gunmakers outsourced production of their boxlocks to the bigger Birmingham firms; it has been suggested that Lancaster's O-grade was so named because it was built by Charles Osborne.  Many more photos available on request."

Gander Mountain, the cost is 319.99 plus tax which is  about $32.00.  So add the 40.00 difference to that and you are saving over $70.00 bucks getting one from me.  There is a gun store down south that sell them for 349.99 plus tax, so if you are in the market for a SCCY CPX-2 and you want to pay as little as possible, give me a call at REDACTED and ask for Kevin.Thanks"
