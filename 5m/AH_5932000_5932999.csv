It shows it's wear a little bit but shoots great. These pistols are always hated on but it has been great to me. You can also buy rebuild kits for like $70 and replace all the guts and make it brand new again. It is in full working order though. I have two mags for it, one with the flat bottom and one with the extended pinky grip. It comes with just the Pistol, 2 mags, a few rounds of hollow points and a cheaper fabric OC belt loop holster that I actually really like and it fits the pistol perfectly. I am selling because I found a Sig I want to buy. I hate to get rid of it and people hate on hipoints alot but it really is a great gun for the price... Id rather carry this than nothing. This is more of an open carry gun (could conceal if you wanted) but many chose not to because it does not have a firing pin blocker. If you know what your doing, it's not a big issue. Has a good safety and if you carry it chambered your safe doing so with the safety. Sizes (compact):6.75inch full length3.5inch barrelWeighs 25ozs (equiivilant to like a medium size jar of sauce)I am asking $240 because that's what I paid for it and with the extras included I think it is worth at least that. I would consider an offer but im pretty firm on price. I dont need your emails saying it's over priced because if you were to order one new it would cost even more and take about a month to even get. I am only available today (9-24) because I leave for work Sunday and will be gone until Wednesday so if you are seriously interested lets meet up and get you protected. You must have a valid ID and be willing to sign a bill of sale proving ownership. If you want your own for your records I can print you an extra one or bring your own.REDACTED"
