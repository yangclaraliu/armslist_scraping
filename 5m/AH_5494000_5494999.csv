For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****    Browning has over 50 years of experience with bolt-action high-powered rifles. Today’s X-Bolt rifle inherits the strongest, most note-worthy features of its predecessors. The X-Bolt White Gold model has a Monte Carlo stock. This feature is recognized as the comb steps sharply down toward the heel of the buttstock, allowing more contact between the recoil pad of the stock and the shooter’s shoulder. With this design, the recoil of the fired shell comes directly back or in-line with the stronger part of the inner shoulder, making the rifle more pleasant to shoot, especially when a long day at the range is expected. The X-Bolt White Gold is beautifully adorned with a polished Stainless steel receiver that is drilled and tapped for scope mounts with Engravings both the front and rear. This rifle also has a polished Stainless steel barrel. Its stock is a gloss-finished, finely Checkered with a rosewood forend and grip cap. The White Gold’s beauty is really on the inside, in how it shoots and what makes it so accurate. The three-lever Feather Trigger™ system is probably the most comfortable, simple trigger on any bolt-action rifle on the market. There is no take-up or creep and very little over-travel. This is the kind of trigger serious hunters and shooters demand. Next is the superb free-floating barrel with target Crown, then triple-checked for interior finish, straightness and air-guaged for total uniformity. No doubt, this rifle has it all. Looks, handling and most important, dead-on accuracy.   We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $1349.

This medium frame, 6-shot revolver features comfortable rubber grips and a deep, lustrous finish. With fixed sights and a custom Single Action/Double Action trigger for improved accuracy and speed, the 65 is the perfect partner for whatever trouble lurks around the corner.Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.Features: Caliber: 357 MAGCapacity: 7Barrel Length: 4""Finish: Matte Stainless SteelGrip Black RubberAction: Double/SingleWeight: 38 ozRate of Twist: 1:16.5""Frame: MediumWidth: 1.496""Front Sight: FixedLength: 10 1/2""Grooves: 6Safety: Taurus Security System Transfer BarRear Sight: FixedHand: RightHeight: 5.48"""

  I have a DDI AK47 rifle chambered for the legendary and cheap 7.62x39mm round. These are some of the nicest AKs you can buy and are VERY hard to find for sale. They are constantly sold out and it is sometimes months before they make more of these rifles. This rifle is built off of a like-new Hungarian AK parts kit, with a new receiver, barrel and Tapco G2 trigger. The quality rivals even the mighty Arsenal rifles. This rifle comes with the Magpul pistol grip, fixed stock and handguard, as well as a cut-down Magpul vertical grip. I am including two Magpul AK magazines, a Tapco AK 74-style muzzle brake and one 40 round box of TulAmmo.The finish on this gun is amazing! Very smooth and tough as nails. I've only shot 120 rounds through this rifle, but it has been flawless. No issues at all. For a 7.62 gun, this one is pretty soft-shooting too.
If you have any questions or offers, please email me. Thank you for your time. :)"

Its rugged and built really well not like a parts kit.  Action is very smooth like silk.  trigger pull is light, i use it as my sniper rifle. will come with the scope and 2 mags. has a few blemishes from use, the top rail cover has some nicks in it from spent brass, nothing serous and clearly a shooter. One of my all time favorite rifles and apparently half of the free world for decades. I sold it and bought it back already once before.  I need the money so im making a sacrifice.  text me at REDACTED"
