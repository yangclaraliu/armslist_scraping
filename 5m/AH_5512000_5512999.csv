It's a 5+1 also. Some info: I purchased this at a gun show, and someone had actually epoxied a pistol grip to it. The grip obviously wasn't meant for it, but I bought it as a project to clean up. I removed all the epoxy, got a better grip that actually fits it, oiled it and put it up. You'll notice by the grip there is some bluing that has been taken off, but other than that it's a great gun and is reliable. It's a good deal at $150, a little bluing and it would be a great looking gun. The best way to get ahold of me is to text me at 405-four three zero-0024 or email me. No trades."

Created by General John Taliaferro Thompson shortly after World War I allowed it to acheive great combat success during World War II. The Tommy Gun was so successful that continued combat use covered many decades of battles following WWII. During prohibition it was the weapon of choice for Chicago gangsters; Bugs Moran, Machinegun Kelly, Al Capone and even John Dillinger. The ferocious firepower proved to be extremely accurate and the small size fit perfectly into a violin case making it concealable. Standard Manufacturing Company has teamed up with Thompson and designed a Tommy Gun that looks similar to the original. The walnut stock and grip are exquisitely finished, 16.4"" barrel with an over all length of 34.5"". Machined from aircraft grade aluminum to 1/2 size frame allows for hours of fun.

Made with the same materials and quality control as all Glock semi-automatic pistols, the G43® is a carry gun with the power of a 9mm field gun that you can count on for survival. Internally, the Glock 43 employs the same striker fired, short-recoil operated, and locked-breech barrel as the larger framed Glock pistols. The Safe-Action trigger system makes shooting in stressed situations infallible. The rough textured polymer grip provides a solid hold, and while the G43 is quite concealable, the grip offers shooters enough surface area for ultimate control. The white-dot front sight and the white-bracket rear sight provide rapid acquisition in dim lighting situations. The length, shape, finger rest, and size of the trigger opening are the same as the larger pistols, and the trigger is the same size, making them all familiar to those who already use Glock pistols. The Glock 43 Semi-Auto Pistol is a reliable, easy to maintain firearm that's perfect for everyday carry. The G43 comes with 2 ultra-reliable single-stack 6-round magazines. REDACTEDKRISTI"

The reason is that it was designed--and has kept evolving--to be and remain the most accurate, durable and reliable semiauto handgun on the market. Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies. Superior Reliability The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period Match-Grade Accuracy out of the Box Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of  match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class.  This is the pistol that became the military's M9.  They evolved it for their purposes, but this was the gun that started it all.This was originally made in Italy, and then Beretta began making them here also.  This pistol can be bought as either the Italian or the US-made version.  This is the ITALIAN version.  Some say one is better than the other, I won't get in that discussion.Accessories: 2 MagsAction: Semi-automaticBarrel Lenth: 4.9""Capacity: 15RdFinish/Color: BlueFrame/Material: AlloyCaliber: 9MMGrips/Stock: PlasticManufacturer Part Number: JS92F300MModel: 92Safety: AmbidextrousSights: 3 DotSize: FullType: Double ActionMSRP: 699  MAP:  $598  Action: Semi-automatic Caliber: 9MM Capacity: 15Rd Color: Blue Material: Alloy Tube Size: Full Accessories: 2 Mags Barrel Length: 4.9"" Grips/Stock: GripStock Safety: Ambidextrous Sights: 3 Dot Size: Full Type: Double Action"

With high visibility low-profile sights and a slim-contour frame, the XD® Mod.2™ Service Model is a feature packed full sized double-stack pistol.

The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod. 2™ Service Model a safe and easy to use pistol. And of course, GripZone® ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2™ apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2™ Service Model on target for round after round.

These are a variant of the famous German K98 Mauser and are a blast to shoot. Includes a mounted AIM Sports 2-7 adjustable power scout scope with duplex reticle. Would make an accurate and interesting deer rifle as well as a decent shooter as well.More information on the M48A:After World War II, the Yugoslavs took this design and incorporated minor modifications. Although very similar in general appearance to that of the German rifle, many of the parts of these two rifles are not interchangeable, especially the bolt and related action parts. M48s are usually distinguished from the 98k by the top handguard, which extends behind the rear sight and ends just in front of the receiver ring, although this feature exists on other models as well. The M48 was designed with a stock similar to the 98k, but it has a shorter intermediate-length action and receiver, as does the similar M24 series Mauser. The M24 series Mausers were built from prewar Yugoslav Model 24 Mausers and then refurbished with newer Belgian parts, and usually have straight bolts, while the M48s have curved bolts. Most M48 stocks are made from thicker Elm or Beech wood and have a thick stainless steel butt plate at the rear of the stock. The M24/47 stocks are mostly made of thinner Walnut or Beech wood and do not have a milled stainless steel ""cupped"" butt plate. The M48 was also designed to remove the follower from stopping the bolt from closing when the magazine is empty. M48's are regarded as a military surplus firearm and can be collected in the USA, Canada and Australia at a generally cheap price due to the plentiful numbers recently imported from Europe, most of which had never been used in combat. Most M48s were put into government storage shortly after they were manufactured. Most M48s that are encountered in the United States and Australia today show only slight wear—usually from storage. Many rifles are sold with accessories, including bayonet, bayonet scabbard, leather bayonet frog, ammo pouches, cleaning rod, and field cleaning kit. The rifles are normally sold coated in the protective grease 'cosmoline' which needs to be cleaned out before the rifle is fired. The condition is frequently excellent due to a Yugoslavian maintenance program that cleaned and inspected the stored rifles in rotation every 5 years until that nation's breaking up.The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.com"

The previous owner  that I purchased it from claimed that USDS in Greenwood mounted the sights and installed the trigger. This is the thumb safety version. I however removed the safety since it is not my carry gun. I do have the safety and can reinstall it if requested. Comes with factory box, fired case, lock, two factory mags, 3 factory grip inserts, factory manual, stock trigger and stock rear sight. Does have a minor holster wear on end of slide from previous owner, other than that the gun is in good shape. Cash value of $475 or trade for Glock 17/19 Gen 3 or 4. FTF metro Indy only.
