The Gun has always shot great, even at long range (completes well with my buddy's FN SCAR17). I bought the gun when I lived in Texas and hunted Hogs frequently. Now that I'm not able to hunt with 308 in Indiana, I have not found a reason to shoot it in a while. It's been covered in FlogLube CLP for about a year now. The gun is very clean, it's actually only had maybe 300 rounds through it, All quality loads (Never Hands Loads, No Steel Case) I mostly shoot PRVI 168gr HPBT, or Remington Sierra Matchking HPBT. It has a fixed stock on it at the moment, but I will include the original collapsapsable carbine stock, tube, buffer and springs. The trigger has been modified (By Bill Springfield) down to a 4lbs pull. If that doesn't float your boat, I have many other triggers I can give you. It has a Hogue grip. It has a free float handguard with a picatinny rail'd gas block.Everything on the gun is great, with the exception of a scrape on the castle nut, from when my wrench slipped, replacing the stocks once. That said, it's a castle nut. I can buy you a new one if you'd like. Price is Firm, I have no real need to sell. Included will be the Orignal DPMS Case, Gun, and two steel DPMS 19/20 round Mags that came with it. Get in touch if you're interested. At the time of posted, the pics are not attached.

Magazine: (1) 20- Round Warranty: Lifetime    It's All About Accuracy. Rock River Arms has been in the manufacturing business since 1996, making them relatively ancient for the AR world. Brothers Mark and Chuck Larson are the owners of the Colona, Illinois based company. Between 1981 and 1991, the two worked at Springfield Armory, where Mark was the head armorer. From there, the Larson's then went into business with Les Baer to form Les Baer Custom and specialized in manufacturing premium 1911 pistols. In 1993, the two parted ways with Baer and began building AR-15's for Eagle Arms in Coal Valley, Illinois. At the same time, they formed their own company, which became known as Rock River Arms. In 1997, the Larson's severed ties with Eagle Arms after the company was acquired by ArmaLite. In 2003, after outperforming 10 other leading manufacturers in rifle testing trials, Rock River was awarded the DEA contract to supply the agency with 5,000 AR-15's. As a direct result of winning the contract, Rock River also began supplying the FBI and U.S. Marshals Service under piggy back contracts. At the heart of the Rock River Predator HP design is its direct gas impingement system. Gas is tapped from the barrel as the bullet passes by the port located below the rifle's front gas block. The gas then rushes into the port and down a gas tube located above the barrel and into the upper receiver. From there, the gas tube funnels into the bolt carrier. This gas system unlocks the bolt and begins the cycling process, but only after the bullet has exited the barrel. Direct gas impingement has several advantages over gas piston systems. First and foremost, impingement systems are usually lighter in weight. They also tend to be more accurate, less expensive to manufacture and much easier to free- float the barrel. Unlike other AR-10 manufacturers, Rock River does not build their rifles in an assembly line process. Instead, a skilled armorer is dedicated to building just the lower assembly while another armorer is in charge of strictly building the upper. Once the lower and upper assemblies have been completed, yet another armorer is in charge of fitting them together. Every major component of the Predator HP starts out as either bar stock or a forging. Upper and lower receivers are made from forged and mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum alloy that is then anodized to a surface hardness of 70 on the Rockwell scale. All components are held to extremely tight tolerances to ensure maximum accuracy. After final machining, each receiver is carefully polished to remove dings, scratches or any other minor imperfections left over from the forging and milling process. Once polished to a perfect mirror sheen, the receivers are then bead blasted and sent out for hard coat anodizing. This polishing step is unique and the reason why minor receiver imperfections normally found in front of the magazine well on other rifles are not encountered on Rock Rivers. Smaller parts like the bolt stop, safety and trigger components are investment castings made from 8620 steel that are case hardened between 89 and 92 Rockwell. After installation, the barrel's feed ramp is highly polished and contoured into the upper receiver, thus eliminating the common ""step"" between the barrel extension's feed ramp and upper receiver that are found on most AR-10 rifles. As a result, Rock River enjoys significantly improved reliability with all types of .308WIN ammunition. Once the rifle is fitted, the barrel is lapped and additional touches made to ensure superior workmanship, accuracy and quality. The Rock River Predator HP is equipped with a 20- inch 416-R stainless steel heavy barrel that is cryogenically treated in-house. Built by Wilson Arms, not to be confused with Wilson Combat, the Connecticut based company has been in the business of manufacturing high quality, button rifled barrels for over 60- years. Wilson makes the barrel, then flutes and cuts the chamber. Rock River hits the chamber with a finish reamer and cryogenically treats the entire barrel. Even though the exact process is a closely guarded secret, what is known is that Rock River gradually takes the barrel down to 300- degrees below zero in precise stages, then incrementally brings the temperature back up again to 200- degrees above zero to provide maximum stress relief and ensure accuracy. Though the .308 chamber drawing is also a guarded intellectual property of Rock River, the company has stated that the process is generous around the cartridge body, but has a standard throat with a shorter, steeper leade. This shorter leade works well for .308WIN/7.62X51 because the 7.62 NATO cartridges are loaded to a lower pressure than the .308WIN. The aluminum free-float handguard is a bit larger than most other manufacturer's include, but is designed to dissipate heat more efficiently under sustained fire. It has been knurled to provide a positive grip surface and is hard coat anodized to offer a lifetime of reliable service. A Hogue grip further improves handling and control. The Predator HP includes the best production 2- stage trigger on the market and is a standard feature on most Rock River rifles. While iron sights are not included with the package, a Picatinny flat-top receiver provides a solid platform to mount optics. The Operator A2 buttstock mounts firmly to a shooter's shoulder pocket, while providing solid cheek weld when used in conjunction with optics. Unique to the LAR-8 line of AR-10 rifles is the fact it is engineered to accept FN-FAL pattern magazines-- either inch or metric pattern. Back when the Rock River .308 rifle was on the drawing board, there were millions of surplus FAL magazines on the world market and since the FAL is considered the overall most successful 7.62NATO battle rifle, the move made sense. However, after almost six decades of service, these FAL surplus magazines are beginning to show their age. Luckily, Rock River is now producing a wide assortment of affordably priced polymer FAL magazines. For years, Rock River fans have been clamoring for an LAR-8 that accepts Stoner (Magpul) pattern magazines, but the likelihood of this becoming reality remains fairly slim as it would mean eliminating one of the most popular features of the rifle-- its ambidextrous release lever. While many other AR manufacturers insist on MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspection) and HPT (High Pressure Testing) every part to ensure that parts will not fail, Rock River disagrees. The company feels MPI and HPT fatigues parts and should only be conducted on random parts to ensure batch quality, and those tested parts should never be installed in a customer's rifle. This attention to detail on every aspect of the rifle, combined with Rock River's renown tight lower-to-upper fit, ensures a solid build every time. The rifle carries an impressive 1"" accuracy guaranty and is backed by the company's lifetime warranty. Overall, the Predator HP is a well- built, extremely accurate and highly reliable AR-10 rifle that is 100% built here in the U.S.A."

MSRP from KAC $248.74, SAVE $$$M4 RAS Forend AssemblyDescription:The KAC M4 RAS (Rail Adapter System) was developed for use on the US military's M4 Carbine, and with over 1 million rails issued to date, it is one of the most battle proven designs available for the AR-15 platform. This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M4 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle's barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories. Includes three KAC 11 Rib Rail Panels. Specifications: Length: 6.25""Weight: 8.9 ozFree Float: NoMaterial: AluminumFinish: Black AnodizingRifle Requirements: The M4 RAS is a drop-in replacement part for standard, 2-piece polymer, M4-type handguards. The rifle must have a carbine length gas system, delta ring assembly, fixed front sight/gas block, and round handguard end cap. Lighter barrel profiles work best (M4 or Government contours). Heavier barrel contours may require modification to the inside of the rail. For AR-15/SR-15 based platforms only; not compatible with SR-25 variants. Installation instructions are included.

We have seen a couple of these Apache series sell for $800 in very good condition. If you are looking at this ad then you probably know of this model. Remington stopped production on the Seneca green due to lack of sales also known as the K-Mart nylon. The Mohawk brown was always a top seller and the Mohawk brown 10C was very popular due to their new magazine fed option rather than the rear loader, also not near as many produced. The Apache was an instant sought after model due to the shiny black stock. The Apache black and stainless was a fancy model and kept the sales of these great light 22 rifles high on every firearms enthusiast's list to own. One very small scratch on the receiver we almost didn't mention that may even just rub out because it is so minor. We left it alone. The loading tube is in the buttstock. We believe this to be the cleanest Apache we have seen and you just don't see these out there. May trade for FNAR."

Store bought tarps to cover this much area would cost at least twice as much and are not designed for long term outdoor use like these vinyl ads."
