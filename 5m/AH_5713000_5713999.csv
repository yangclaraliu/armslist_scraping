Condition: Like new
XD®’s come loaded with features that set them apart from the competition. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator give the shooter instant tactile and visual feedback about the condition of the pistol. This means you can know at a glance – or at a touch – if there is a chambered round and if the striker is cocked. Three separate safeties guard against accidental discharges and provide extra peace of mind. The Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ prevents unintentional rearward movement of the trigger. The grip safety keeps the pistol from firing unless the shooter has a firm grasp on it. And an internal firing pin block goes the extra mile to bring you a pistol fully designed with safety in mind.
The accessory rail that comes standard on every XD® gives you the flexibility to mount a light, laser or other accessory on your pistol. An ambidextrous magazine release means the XD® doesn’t care whether or not you’re a lefty. And the high polish stainless steel magazines drop free with refreshing eagerness."

Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific up front as it makes it a lot easier.  I don't mind questions at all(cash buyers no problem), but please don't string things along with 10-20 messages only to offer a crap trade in the end.  State the details up front if it's a trade, so I can tell you if I am interested or not.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  A few things I might use or use more of:  
Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts(no std. triggers wanted), nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  FosTech Echo trigger.
Quality stamped AK-47 with side rail optic mount, preferably something with a nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov stock would be a plus.  The RAS47 is nice with the trigger group they include and the Zhukov stock, but I've read about too many issues with their cast trunnions and bad/faulty rivets.
A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Maybe a good 9mm carbine or pistol with ""arm brace"", Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it.  AR 9mm, CZ Scorpion or others??  Want something with a good trigger, so thinking AR 9mm will be easiest and best value.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56, Federal preferred.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech or Vortex magnifier, maybe two Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle and 1-2 with 7.62x39 reticle.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship to TX resident for $30 more.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

The gun comes with box and all original items in box including 2 magazines, original trigger, original light green tipped spring and lock. When I purchased this pistol I was unhappy with the operation and felt there was a hangup and grit not acceptable for a Colt product or a Gold Cup, perhaps caused by the rougher material on the frame rails. I contacted Colt and they gladly took it back and polished the frame as well as the sear and hammer, lightening the operation and improving the trigger over stock. I have and will attach the paperwork from this service as documentation. The Pistol shoots as well as many other even higher end 1911s and I personally compare the trigger (even though it is series 80) on par with my Les Baer.I currently have a kidney bean shaped trigger, but will include the original alloy 3 hole.

The rifle is an excellent shooter and is very accurate. I'm the second owner of the rifle and have put maybe 200 rounds through it. The rifle is burnt bronze and a silverish grey color and looks sweet. The rifle package comes with everything needed to hit the range. Below I will compile a list of everything that is included in the package along with the cheapest prices I can find on the web.M1A- $1500EBR Chassis- $1000Larue LT 608 - $200Vortex Viper Pst 2.5-10x44 - $600Rings - $50Tango Down Bipod - $220180 rounds of 308 - $706x mags- $100ishIm asking for $3000 which I think is more than fair because its the best package deal compared to the rest of them here on armslist. I prefer a FTF transaction here in Indiana but will ship to an FFL that accepts firearms from an individual for extra $$$ for shipping. This is a very sweet rifle and definitely a conversation starter at the range. I'd love to keep it but its a little too heavy for me and I have a couple other projects that could use the cash. Low ball offers will be ignored and trades of less value will be expected to be accompanied by either cash or other boot to even the trade. Can also send additional pics upon request.

When you shoot, bottom ejection makes sure there are no empties flying to the side, across your line of sight to distract your aim.
