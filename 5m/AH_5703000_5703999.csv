Doesn't have to be clean all the way, but must have enough cosmoline off for a thorough inspection. The gun has to be in what I would call 'very good' condition. That means small, minor defects like a scratch or two on the blueing or stock would be alright, but major marring or pitting of the blue, or a beat up stock is a no go. Must have all original parts with matching serial numbers (Things missing like bayo's and cleaning kits are fine though). Not interested in pinned barrels, threaded only. Highly preffered milled trigger group over stamped. Absolute must bolt must be unmodified and gun must have original magazine. Pretty much just a classic, plain jane SKS that's in good shape.Not really interested in packaged deals, but if you've got something good, email me. If you think you have something close enough to what I want, email me. I would probably go over 400$ if you have a really nice specimen. Send a bunch of pictures, that's always good. Worst I can say is no. Would preffer not to go through an FFL just to avoid fees, but if you want to be sure you're selling the gun to someone that can posses one I understand.

This is a classic 1950's target/varmint rifle and scope combination that will continue to appreciate in both value and desirability."

This gun has very attractive wood on it - much, much better than most BLRs that are out there. The metal is about 98% and the wood rates about 95-97%. The action is smooth like butter, tight, and solid. This is a gun that could be used for a lifetime of hunting, then passed on for the next generation. I might consider firearm trades but it would have to be an enticing offer and the gun would have to be at least as valuable as the gun I'm selling. Cash is king!Thanks"

Unique grip angle points naturally and puts your hand high under the bore, resulting in the softest recoil of any polymer pistol I’ve fired. The trapezoid sights are fantastic (wish I had them on my other pistols!), and quicker to pick up than three-dot sights. Only selling because, try as I might (with Springfield, H&K, S&W, Sig, CZ and others), I just don’t care for plastic striker-fired pistols.

On firing, the slide and barrel are locked together for a few millimeters of rearward movement, after which the barrel is cammed down at the rear. By this time the bullet has left the barrel and the pressure has dropped to safe levels, whereupon the slide completes the rearward stroke, ejecting the spent cartridge. The recoil spring then propels the slide forward, stripping a round from the magazine and in the last few millimetres of forward movement the barrel is cammed upwards, locking the slide and barrel together again. A SIG Sauer P 226 S Sport Stock, an all stainless steel variant, with heavy barrel and adjustable LPA match sights.Instead of the locking lugs and recesses milled into the barrel and slide of other Browning-type weapons (such as the Colt M1911A1, Browning Hi-Power and CZ 75), the P226 locks the barrel and slide together using an enlarged breech section of the barrel locking into the ejection port. This modified system, which was devised by SIG based on Charles Petter's Modèle 1935A pistol and their own SIG P210, has no functional disadvantages compared to the original system, and has since been copied by numerous firearm manufacturers.[6] The slide of the pre-1996 P226 was a heavy gauge, mill finished sheet metal stamping with a welded on nose section incorporating an internal barrel bushing. The breech block portion was a machined insert attached to the slide by means of brazing and a roll pin visible from either side. Since 1996, production has shifted to CNC machining and the slide is now milled from a single piece of stainless steel. Therefore, the current standard P226 has a Nitron coated, stainless steelslide. This resulted in a stronger slide, which was necessary to chamber the more powerful .40 S&W and .357 SIGcartridges.[citation needed] The frame of most models is made from hard anodized aluminum alloy. The standard SIG P226 incorporates a decocking lever on the left side of the frame above the magazine release button, which first appeared on the Sauer 38H prior to World War II, which allows the hammer to be dropped safely. In chambering or firing a round, the actuation of the slide automatically cocks the hammer. By using the decocking lever, the hammer can be de-cocked without actuating the firing pin block, making it impossible to accidentally fire the weapon by using the decocking lever. Furthermore, using the decocking lever makes the weapon ""drop safe"", which means the firing pin will be blocked from striking a loaded round unless the trigger is pulled. Pulling the trigger and slowly lowering the hammer does not make the weapon ""drop safe"", and can result in an accidental discharge if sufficient force is applied to the hammer. Properly decocked, the pistol can be holstered safely and can be fired in double action mode by simply pulling the trigger. The SIG P226 has no manual safety. Double action trigger pressure is approximately 44 N (9.9 lbf). Subsequent shots are fired in single action mode with a lighter trigger pressure of approximately 20 N (4.5 lbf). As with other DA/SA pistols such as the HK USP and Beretta 92F, some training is required to minimize the difference in point of aim caused by the different trigger pressure between a first double action shot and subsequent single action shots.

Its modular construction makes it easy to modify with a variety of options and accessories, while still being affordable both as a base pistol and as a fully-accessorized system. Cool, Futuristic DesignEven while designing a plinking pistol to be used for informal shooting, Beretta did not cut corners. The lines of the Neos bear the unmistakable flavor of renown Italian designer Giugiaro--the same mind behind several of our most attractive offerings. The result is a sleek and ergonomic rimfire pistol that feels as good in the hands as it pleases the eyes. Fully-Modular ConstructionThe Neos is constructed of five modular parts that may be easily disassembled and reassembled without any tools. The ergonomic grips are constructed of super-durable fiberglass-reinforced technopolymer with non-slip inserts for a comfortable and warm hold. The barrel is available either in the classic Beretta blue finish, or in stainless steel (""Inox""), to satisfy the tastes of every shooter. Most of these elements may be replaced with the rich assortment of accessories that is available for this fun .22 semiauto.High PerformanceReliable, durable, easy to maintain and remarkably accurate, the Neos features an integral rail that accepts Weaver-style scope mounts as well as a fully-adjustable target rear sight. The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack, 10-round stainless-steel magazine features an easy-grip knob that allows you to compress the spring from outside, thereby making loading extremely quick and easy. The ambidextrous manual safety can be engaged with the firing pin cocked or uncocked. If you are in the market for a superbly-engineered plinking or practice pistol, give the Neos a close look--it won't fail to surpass your expectations."

This is 1923 vintage number's matching weapon of war (I sold the 1927 rifle). I didn't check the numbers on the bayonet (not sure if they even have numbers there). This rifle was manufactured when the former Soviet Union still had its baby fat.  While I am not a historian, I believe at the time supporters of the old monarchy had armies that were still fighting the reds for supremacy of mother Russia.  If this rifle could tonly talk... (probably wouldn't make much of a difference if it could, unless you could speak Russian).  Likely hasn't seen the light of day since it was likely refurbished after the end of WWII.   Has the more desireable and durable hex receiver. Includes all accessories shown. This is the most complete package I've seen to date. Arsenal refurbished and caked in cosmoline. Wood looks good with only minor nicks. Metal looks good. Should clean up beautifully. If you want a Mosin, then this is the one you have been waiting for. I am not sure which arsenal it came out of, so don't ask me. Figure it out from the symbols on the receiver. I have no idea what they mean, but plenty of websites that will explain it all to you. Great for re-enactors, hunters, or for just collecting a piece of histoy. Way to nice to  use for swaping in a modern stock.  All sales are final,"

Total production number for both models was 15000 with 6 dashes/changes on the 629 during the timeframe of production. My 629-6 Mountain Gun was in the 3rd and last production run. There were only 1000 629's produced during that run. The Mountain Gun had square butts until dash 4, then went to round butts. It came with a tapered 4"" Barrel that was 2ozs lighter than the 629 Classic. Mountain gun also had beveled/curved areas around the end of the cylinder for smoother placement of the revolver back into a holster. The MG had a smooth textured trigger, whereas the Classic had the target style serrations texture. MG maintained wide hammer. MG front sight post was all black, as well as rear adj. sight post. The classic had red front sight post with white outlined rear post. The dash-6 came with the lock.

The heart of the R.E.P.R. Heavy Barrel is our revolutionary gas piston system.  Constructed using the highest quality materials, built on our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI™ raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance- delivering the highest level of performance. The R.E.P.R. Heavy Barrel upper and lower receivers are fully machined from billet 7075 aluminum, resulting in a superior fit and finish.  Its 12.5” Modular Rail System allows quick, tool-less access to the piston system via a removable top rail- that delivers 100% return to zero when reinstalled. The R.E.P.R. Heavy Barrel comes with a two-position gas block with normal and suppressed settings.  Gas block is easily accessible enabling the user to pre-restrict the gas flow to the piston system, allowing the rifle to run smoothly and compensate for the added back pressure from running a suppressor. Gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws. An innovative side-mounted, non-reciprocating charging handle design allows shooters to keep eyes on target during reloads.  The covered slot design prevents gas blowback to the face when firing suppressed.  The R.E.P.R. Heavy Barrel uses LWRCI™ manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged Heavy barrel that is precisely torqued in our factory.  Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity."
