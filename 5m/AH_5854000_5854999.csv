Bore still has nice rifling and the rest of the metal is in good condition with no pitting. The action works as it should and is in good condition as well. Gun metal has VERY few nicks and bumps but considering the age, is overall very nice. The stock has a few nicks, but the forend is pretty rough on the bottom portion.

This is M855 62 grain green tip penetrator ammo. Technically it's not armor piercing but has a steel core and is designed to go through kevlar and light body armor, so of course, the Government wants to ban it. Get it while you can!You can buy American Eagle XM855 and it comes in cardboard boxes, no bandoleers, no stripper clips, no ammo can, and it is NOT USGI, (AND you pay TAX!) You can also buy foreign green tip that's loose in the box.....and it is not the same either. Neither are USGI and have different packaging and potentially a lower reliability. They don't go by Milspec for nothing!!This TAA is US Milspec and shoots exactly the same as Lake CIty. (It's made with the same components). It is Nato marked 5.56 ammo and hard to find in bandoleers, strippers and cans like this.TAA is a US second source supplier for 5.56 ammo and is definitely good stuff.BUT I only have a couple cans available and when they are gone I can't get anymore.In Bandoleers: 120 rounds in stripper clips and cardboard sleeves, all tucked into a four-pocket Bandoleer complete with strap, safety pin (for adjustment of the strap) and one magazine charging spoon. This is just the way the USGI's get their ammo and it's easy to load mags and handy to have as it's ready to hit the range.Available by the can only.There are seven (7) of these bandoleers in each can (.50 caliber can size, in perfect shape!) packed carefully with cardboard packing to ensure it stores and transports well. Seven (7) bandoleers of 120 rounds each gives each can a total count of 840 rounds of some of the finest USGI green tip ammo you can get for your 5.56 rifle.Each can of 840 rounds is just $325.00 cash (comes out to a bit less than $50 per bandoleer and gets you a free ammo can to boot!). I Also have ONE can of LC green tip avalable, same type and packing but recent Lake City. $350 for that can and as with the TAA, will not sell bandos separately.Face to face local CASH sale only - absolutely no shipping, so please don't ask!IF you don't like the price, you can always make a REASONABLE offer, but I won't respond to lowballers.Only a small amount of this fine ammo available so grab what you need quickly!Note: I don't need comments on my price being higher than the foreign stuff you can order online....it's not the same ammo and none of that will include the can, bandoleers,strippers, etc. There are different values so understand and KNOW what you are buying.If you don't need the bandoleers and components, or the can, buy someone else's ammo...I will not split this up.If you don't like my price, I don't need or want to hear it....feel free to buy from someone else."

The only very minor cosmetic imperfections are a couple very small marks around one of the rear sling loops where I tested out a sling, and a couple areas on the top rail where I had my Elcan Specterdr mounted - other than that, it's perfect. Comes with the following: -7 Genuine SCAR 17 mags (5 FDE, 2 black) 3 of them are brand new in packaging. -Shooting Sight adjustable 2 stage trigger - Amazing trigger, just as good as the Geissele if not better. -Gripod GPS 2 FDE VFG/Bipod (genuine) -Striker Enterprises E.A.C.H charging handle -FDE Ergo Grip -Tactical Link Convertible 1-2 point QD bungee sling -Blue Force Gear Tactical Sling Mount Comes with original box, manual, stock trigger, and stock grip. This is an amazing firearm and I hate to sell it, but I'm purchasing a .308 conversion kit for my HK23e Machine Gun and need the funds. shipping. No trades."

(GSAD)Golden State Arms Distributors, Inc. (GSAD) was incorporated in California in July 1984. This business was another surplus arms importer, with a retail store located at 1097 Aviation Blvd. in Hermosa Beach, CA (N/W corner of Prospect at Aviation). They utilized a warehouse at 630 Mary Ann Drive in Redondo Beach, CA. The importer marking on a number of their surplus imports indicated GSAD MANH. BEA., CA, presumably for Manhattan Beach, CA. This company and it's owner were not affiliated with Golden State Arms of Pasadena, CA or any of their affiliated company names. ================================================== ===============http://www.chicom47.com/Importers/ImportCompanies.htmG.S.A.D: Golden State Arms Distribution located in California. They had many locations including Redondo Beach, Manhattan Beach, Pasadena, and Santa Fe, CA. These guns are the most mysterious as they arrived in America about the same time as the Clayco guns, except they had less manufacturing markings. They simply state 7.62x39mm “Made in China” GSAD, in a usually faint roll stamping, that’s it…no factory codes and no exporter markings. Many argue these got here before the Claycos, thus the reason for the additional markings on the Claycos. The majority of these rifles were bought up by companies in Hollywood to be used in the production of movies and have come to be referred to as “movie guns.” In the late 1980s, production of movies showcasing the Vietnam War had tapered off and the movie guns were sold by the hundreds by the movie houses to distributors nationwide. GSAD however, had been in the firearms importation business for many years prior. Their claim to fame was being an importer of Enfield type rifles. They also imported weapons under the name Globco as early as 1957. GSAD is also to have been rumored as the source of firearms for the Bay of Pigs invasion, as well a clandestine asset of the Central Intelligence Agency. GSAD is known to have imported rifles in the 053xx range, as well as atleast serial #'s 0787x through 09xxx, in both fixed stock and underfolding configurations. ""Double-underfold"" models with folding spike bayonets and underfolding stocks have also been reported. GSAD imports are usually marked over the trigger guard on the left side of the receiver:"

Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

This is serious fire power. From the factory: The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or Credit Card.

$800 in cash.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace, I can add??  Have someone looking at it this weekend, but listing once more just in case.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"
