In development for more than four years, the VP series debuted in 2014 and is Heckler & Koch's latest handgun and the first striker fired HK Since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.
Experience gained by HK engineers with the P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP line, but the VP series breaks new ground with with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “precise pull” trigger. The nt result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
Hk pioneered the first striker-fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistols designs.
The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP uses HK’s Ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable back straps and six side panels- accommodation all hand sizes.
Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistols’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
Although influenced by other HK models, the VP has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-ark handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and magazines release can be easily activated by left- or right- handed shooters.
A unique VP feature is HK’s Patented charging supports- simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operation VP pistols easier for shooters with reduced hand strength.
The Vp Pistols use the proven P30 Steel Magazines (15round for 9mm, 13rd for .40 S&W; and 10-round capacity were required by law). The VP Series has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.
HK’s Famous cold hammer forged barrel – made from canon grade steel – ensures long service life. Similar HK Barrels on P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance test in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VP’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment (black) finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.
VP pistols are made in heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.
Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP Series are a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK Products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And the VP is remarkably value priced."

If you know what you are looking at then you know this price is way, way, below retail and they are not that easy to find.The Mossberg 590 Mariner Tactical Pump-Action Shotgun comes with a corrosion-resistant Marinecote finish, inside and out, to withstand the punishment of harsh saltwater environments. This is an ideal self-defense shotgun. The 590 Mariner also makes a practical, low-maintenance home defense shotgun and is one of the best firearms to carry while fishing or camping in bear country. The 590 Mariner is an extremely compact, fast-handling shotgun that stows in minimum space and deploys in an instant. The U.S. Military's choice of Model 590 pump shotgun for combat attests to the design's reliable function and durability. The Model 590 utilizes dual action bars to prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action, and a single, large locking lug locks the bolt into the barrel extension, ensuring a solid steel bolt-to-barrel connection. Dual extractors take a solid grip on the shell's rim for reliable extraction, and an anti-jam shell elevator ensures reliable feeding. Shooters can reach the top-mounted safety quickly with the thumb of either hand, making it naturally ambidextrous. The Model 590's simplistic design makes fieldstripping easy by tapping out a single pin, and the magazine cap-nut removes for cleaning the spring, shell follower, and any debris in the mag tube. The 590 Mariner Tactical Pump-Action Shotgun comes with a synthetic buttstock and forearm, a durable recoil pad, and sling swivel studs. The Model 590 cycles 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells interchangeably. Includes Mossberg Speed Feed stock, and heat shield that I have added.Priced to sell at $495 CASH ONLY NO TRADES PLEASEIf Interested Please call REDACTED Thanks"

There are a lot of extras in this deal, 200 rounds of  Hornady Ammo; Bushnell Elite 1500 Range Finder; and the original M1A green synthetic stock. I need some cash to pay bill so I am not interested in trades, Sorry."

STI makes some of the best competition .45's in the world but most of them start north of $2k. To get a great quality 1911 to ""working man"" shooters they developed the Spartan line. They are assembled in Texas by STI smiths to the same quality levels as they race guns, but without all the bells and whistles. They are considered by many to be the best under $1k 1911's on the market, and for good reason. This one has adjustable Bomar style sights on the rear and a fiber optic insert on the front. The trigger is the classic ""glass break"" adjustable trigger they are known for. This great gun has had less than 100 flawless rounds through her, I just prefer my Les Baer.F2F with VA resident non-felons within about 45 minutes of Charlottesville.
