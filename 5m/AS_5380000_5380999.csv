Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. This is an excellent condition pistol with all of the factory gear as well as 6 Hk mags a kydex holster and magpouch, and a Condor tactical pistol bag.for more pictures or to buy click>>>Used HK P30"

I unfortunately just need a quick sale because I have a baby on the way. Make offer. Has vintage redfield scope on it true to 1950's. This gun has been in a gun sock within a wool case for the many many years. It looks as if the gun has only seen light for a brief period of time to show off to a friend or family member. Everything matches on gun, all original. Will send additional high resolution pictures if you message me. The resolution on uploaded pictures doesn't do gun justice.

The combination of SAO trigger, cold hammer forged barrel and near perfect lock-up offers shooters outstanding accuracy that sets the P220 apart from other 45s. The new P220 Compact is a 6+1 capacity pistol featuring the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail frame and extended magazine base for a stronger grip. The new beavertail frame design allows the shooter to access his or her grip from the holster with confidence even under the stressful conditions. The extended magazine floorplate lengthens the grip just enough to provide a firm grip for even large handed shooters. Topping the Compact frame is a shorter, “commander-length” slide housing a 3.9” cold hammer forged barrel. Like all P220 pistols, the Compact features a rock solid lock up and superb out-of-the-box accuracy and performs above and beyond because the SIG SAUER® design allows for unparalleled performance regardless of bullet type or weight. In a world full of concealed carry options, the P220 Compact’s improved ergonomics, slim profile and shorter slide and frame, make the pistol an ideal choice. And with the SIG name you know that when it comes to protecting your life you’re backed by a standard of excellence unmatched in the firearms world.This sig is used in good condition with an unopened factory sig mag and OD green condor pistol case.for more information or to buy click>>>Used Sig 220"

Buyer will be responsible for background check and transfer fee. Feel free to message with any questions you may have. Thanks for looking!Here is a more detailed description I was able to find online:LWRC M6A3The Land Warfare Resources Corporation’s M6A3 is a select-fire tactical rifle chambered in 5.56 NATO and 6.8mm Rem. SPC. LWRC, founded in 1999, specializes in making AR15- and M16-style rifles, but with a handful of trademark features. The M6A3 is similar to the standard model, but unlike the standard it was designed for precision shooting.The M6A3 has a mid-length short-stroke gas-piston, which functions the same way as the standard, but the mid-length is supposed to reduce recoil. It operates by propellant gases cycling from the barrel into a tube and then they’re directed onto a piston, which drives the bolt back. Since gas isn’t entering the bolt directly, carbon buildup is reduced in turn the bolt requires less maintenance. The bolt was treated with a proprietary nickel coating that makes the action corrosion resistant and adds a permanent lubrication, which increases functionality in wet or sandy conditions. Lastly, the M6A3 has an adjustable gas system that allows shooters to regulate gas pressure for different cartridges, weather conditions or tactical situation.Features include a cold hammer forged barrel, so a machine carefully carved the grooves in the bore. This process improves the rifling’s durability. The barrel itself was treated with NiCorr, which is often compared to chrome, but unlike chrome it applies evenly. NiCorr treatment makes the barrel wear and corrosion resistant, and adds lubricity and durability. It has an adjustable stock, a target crown that helps maintain barrel harmonics so when a round is fired the barrel’s vibrations won’t throw off the projectile’s trajectory, an ergonomically Magpul grip, adjustable BUIS sights and Picatinny rails for easy mounting of optics or accessories."
