This model 642CT is in great condition and shows only minor wear. Included with the gun is the box, lock, factory literature, and I'm including a Galco leather holster. The streamline, lightweight, no-snag design of the Smith & Wesson® Model 642 CT Airweight® makes it an ideal concealed carry double-action revolver. The internal hammer of the 642 eliminates the risk of the hammer getting snagged on clothing, holsters, or purses when drawing the weapon in a self-defense situation. The Crimson Trace® Lasergrip activates automatically when the gun is held with a natural firing grip, allowing the user to place shots precisely in any lighting conditions, as well as to shoot quickly with the head up and both eyes open. The laser sight unit is integral with the synthetic grip and interferes minimally with the revolver's sleek concealed carry design. A snag-free, low profile front sight and fixed notch rear sight provide a back up to the laser sight. The 642 CT is double-action only, making it an extremely fast personal-defensive handgun to deploy in stressful situations, as there is nothing to remember to do except point and pull the trigger. The Model 642 CT is built on Smith & Wesson's famous J-Frame, it has a 5-shot cylinder rated for +P .38 Special ammunition. Stainless steel and alloy construction resist corrosion caused by humidity and perspiration when the revolver is carried close to the body. The Smith & Wesson 642 CT Airweight Double-Action Revolver carries easily, deploys rapidly, and has enough firepower to handle any self-defense scenario.

This is not the new, less expensive direct gas version; this is the full featured piston drive model that will stay nice and clean. Quick, scoop this up before election season rolls in and jacks up all the prices! MSRP for this rifle was $3194.43.The rifle is in nice shape and shoots sub-MOA with factory ammo. You heard right, this is a proven shooter, so less risky than buying new (if you can find one). It is chambered in the very flat shooting .243 Winchester caliber, and has about 300 rounds through it. It has typical wear for that round count, with some wear around the ejection port and some polishing on the bolt carrier. Otherwise this thing is pristine.Standard equipment on this rifle are a POF 4lb single stage match trigger with anti-walk, anti-roll pins; nickel-boron coated bolt carrier assembly; multi-postion gas piston system adjusts for standard, suppressed, or bolt action fire and back again with a simple 90 degree turn of the knob; chrome-moly 20"" barrel: flat-top upper assembly with Magpul free-float, Hunter fore-end; billet lower with winter trigger guard; Magpul grip with storage; effective and attractive muzzle brake, Magpul adjustable buttstock; hard shell case; basically everything that's cool.Optional stuff included for this includes: 4-16 x 50 Pentax Gameseeker rifle scope with precision-plex BDC reticle, mounted with Burris Zee rings; lightweight 6-7"" bipod; extra Magpul module rail on the fore-end with a sling mounting ring on it; and a Magpul angled vertical grip.Due to current laws here, I will not be including the Magpul 20 round magazine that came with the rifle, but I will include a 10 round steel mag to get you started. Also included are a set of Lee reloading dies, Hornady LnL length bushing, Lee trim gauge and shellholder, RCBS small base sizing die, a couple hundred rounds of clean brass (some primed); some once fired brass, uncleaned and unprocessed; almost 400 87gr Hornady V-Max bullets; 200 Berger 95gr classic Hunter bullets; a few 55gr Nosler Varmageddon bullets; and some 105 A-Max blems.This gun has been very reliable and operates perfectly. I really hate to lose a proven performer, but the wife says I can't hav 2 AR10's. My loss is your gain.If you're in Northern Colorado, I'll cover the transfer fees if you meet me at my FFL in North Loveland. Otherwise, I'll ship FFL to FFL for $45. Ask any questions before bidding or buying. It is your responsibility to know your local laws, so don't purchase if you can't receive this gun."

This unit is shorter than standard military NVM's which will not allow me to mount to my helmet and bring the eye cup to my eye, which is why it is for sale. This unit works great, has great resolution, it is WPT Generation with Gen 3 resolution and 10,000 hour life expectancy. This unit would be good as a hand held, weapon mounted, or with head mount from ATN. White phosper shows black and white image instead of green and black. This unit comes with a picatinny rail mount. I am second owner of NVM. Consolidated Training Group, LLC, which trains law enforcement and military was 1st owner, they used it for half of an hour and I have used it for about an hour. I offer a 3 day inspection period return policy. If you are unfamiliar with night vision products, the number one rule is DO NOT expose the front lens to normal everyday light, this can damage the unit. DO NOT look at camping fires at night and things of exceptional brightness, this unit has auto 10 second bright light shutoff as a safety but damage may still occur. Keep the front cap on until you are in the dark and ready to use. This understood, you have 3 days to inspect and use this monocular with no risk."

$360 firm in cash.  I thought this one was sold, guess not, please do not contact me if you cannot follow through with a deal, pretty simple.I might consider trades, but not in need of anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.
A few things I would not mind having back-ups for right now would be, Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it.  Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts kits without trigger parts, nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" model only.  Just let me know how much cash you need on top, if you have one of these firearms to trade.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty now, so not in need of any specific caliber.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics like Eotech and Aimpoints with nice magnifiers, just give me the model and trade details.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship insured for $20 more and must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

It is possible that the Type 53 saw use but it is doubtful, as the initial production of the Type 53 was quite close to the end of the conflict. If there was indeed any use it would have been on a VERY limited scale. There were M44's in combat in Korea but it is assumed by most they were Russian M44 carbines supplied to the People's Army by the Soviets. It is clear that the Type 53 saw extensive use in the Vietnam War, as the Chinese supplied these carbines in large numbers to their follow communists in North Vietnam. These carbines were in turn given to the Viet Cong. There was such wide use of the Chinese carbine in Vietnam that many of the Type 53's seen in the US are GI bring-backs. There are rumors that some of these carbines were scoped with a turned down bolt, but it is likely that the M91/30 sniper rifle was mistaken for this ""sniper carbine"". The Mosin Nagant sniper rifle was prevalent in its own right in Vietnam, with the Hungarian manufactured model being encountered in large numbers as GI bring-backs. The Chinese also sent the Type 53 to allies in Cambodia and other areas in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam era.For sale or trade.

The SuperNova Tactical comes with a choice of either ghost ring or open rifle sights, and a protected, front sight post that allow rapid sight acquisition, while holding up to rugged environments. The receiver comes drilled and tapped for a Weaver® 423M base (not included). A choice of either a full pistol-grip stock or Benelli's ComforTech® stock are available. The ComforTech recoil reduction system tames heavy recoil from magnum loads and reduces muzzle rise for fast follow up shots. The full pistol grip stock allows user better 1-hand control of the weapon when using the off hand to open doors or clear brush from one's view. A shim kit enables adjustment of drop and cast. A short barrel with a fixed, cylinder choke are ideal for fast work at close range. Benelli constructs the SuperNova with corrosion-proof polymer over-molded on a skeleton framework to form single-piece receiver and buttstock for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. All metal parts have a non-glare, anti-corrosive finish. The polymer forearm pushes a rotary-head bolt back with dual-action bars. Aggressive ribbing on a contour-tapered forearm provides a secure hold while cycling the action under any circumstances. A magazine disconnect button on the bottom of the forearm allows user to quickly unload the chamber without releasing another round from the magazine to quickly load another round via the ejection port. The Nova utilizes a magazine cap that doubles as a tool for pushing out the single pin that holds the trigger assembly in place; the shotgun can be fieldstripped down to basic components in less than a minute. The Benelli 12 gauge SuperNova Pump-Action Shotgun handles all 2-3/4"", 3"", and 3-1/2"" ammunition. The gun comes with integrated sling attachments."

Soon after it's development, the call went out for a new (but more compact) lever rifle suitable for pistol calibers. Soon John Moses Browning produced the Model 1892 prototype for Winchester -- and the rest is history.This 1892 Winchester is in the hand gun caliber .357 Magnum  with top ejection. The opening price is $800.00. It retails for $1200.00 This gun belonged to an FFL dealer that never fired it and it has never been registered to a private individual. So technically the gun is new and unfired, but has no box. I will leave it here for 15 days with the best offer as of 27th of May. Don't let this be the gun you wished you had bought. Ships only to FFL. Buyers responsibilty to know the laws in your area about this gun. Shipping to your FFL is actual cost. Bank, personal check, or USPS money order prefered.
