Excellent shooter! It's an Agentina Hi Power. Argentina contacted with FN Herstal in Belgium in the early 1960s for a number of Hi Powers.

Argentine-made Hi Powers were produced by Direccion General Fabrications Militaries (commonly called FM) at their arms factory, Fabrica Armas Portatiles Domingo F. Matheu in Rosario, under Belgian FN license from 1969-1989 with FN inspectors watching close by. These were produced for the Argentine military and national police with a heavy manganese phosphate finish as a clone of the MkII 1965 version of the HP. Unlike many foreign-made BHP's, these Argentine guns are not simple clones with questionable interchangeably, but true license built models, and are marked as such."

I'll include the OEM ""hunk-of-rubber"" pad, for your comparison. Ideal for smaller-statured, women, and recoil-sensitive shooters and the shorter LOP also affords much faster shouldering for alpha males. Consider, this is a HARD-TO-FIND-STOCKED $376 new item from cheapest Budsgunshop.com to $410 ableammo.com e-tail + transfer + background check (~$35)/else sales tax; and I've put $75 shipped/improved parts in so, at this asking price, you've already saved minimal $55-90 SAVINGS BEFORE your/my time to order/install/fit/BENEFIT from custom add-ons.  This shotgun does have a few insignificant handling marks and/or very faint scratches, such as those shown on the RHS receiver, but overall she is 98+% like new.Finish is ""Express matte"".  Comes with original box, paperwork, OEM trigger lock, and all swapped out OEM parts.Asking $430 CASH reduced but FIRM FTF in greater Memphis area though, at that price, does NOT include the XS Tritium Big Dot option.  Must show current TN DL and be willing to complete PRIVATE (2 copies only) Bill of Sale which includes 4473-like questions to attest to legal purchase/ownership ability.  And if you have reservations about exchanging this Bill Of Sale, I will NOT sell to you so please don't waste our time.I am willing to ship at cost but your FFL must be willing to accept shipment from non-FFL.  This can be as little as $25 CONUS insured per USPS Priority if you'll forego the OEM box.  Non-local payment by USPS MO ONLY; no, I don't do PayPal.OPTIONAL AT $75 EXTRA: as pictured (but not yet JB-weld affixed), I can add a XS Sight Big Dot Tritium SG-2001-3 front sight over the existing standard bead. Extremely fast/ideal under ALL lighting conditions.Will consider trade for 2.25-3"" .357Mag SP101, 870P 12GA or NAA Mini/Pug 22Mag/LR +/- cash. But I'm reasonable; let me know what else you have.IF AD IS STILL UP, SALE IS STILL AVAILABLE.Thanks for looking.GW"

I picked this up from an older gentleman who set it aside several years ago. It is bulk packed and I never counted it when I purchased it from him, but I was told that it was 1000 rounds and I trusted him.
With the upcoming elections, you can bet that there will be another run on ammo. God forbid if Hillary gets in, she has already said that she would tax the heck out of ammo.
I am asking for 400 dollars firm for this military grade brass cased ammo and it will come in an older metal ammunition can. I am open to trades, but would really prefer a partial trade towards a Colt 6920, Colt 6721, or Colt Expanse AR. Of course, I would ad cash as needed.

This is the same Lake City Arsenal amunition that has been issued to our frontline troops for years and it has the NATO head stamp on it. This is military ammo and it is hotter than standard 223. I picked this up from an older gentleman who set it aside several years ago. It is bulk packed and I never counted it when I purchased it from him, but I was told that it was 1000 rounds and I trusted him.
With the upcoming elections, you can bet that there will be another run on ammo. God forbid if Hillary gets in, she has already said that she would tax the heck out of ammo.
I am asking for 400 dollars firm for this military grade brass cased ammo and it will come in an older metal ammunition can. I am open to trades, but would really prefer a partial trade towards a Colt 6920 or Colt Expanse AR. Of course, I would ad cash as needed. I am also interested in AR uppers and maybe a Spikes Lower.
You can call or text me at 210-seven 22-zero six 33. I am located in San Antonio, but would be willing to meet either in San Marcos, Buda, or even Round Rock depending on the deal."

Amazing pistol..just too pretty for me and finding a match for it (my OCD requires me to own pairs...) at a decent price would be next to impossible. Includes 2 Ed Brown Magazines, Ed Brown carrying pouch, bushing wrench, lock, and Ed Brown 1911 manual. Selling for $2550 shipped to your FFL. Thanks _________Executive CarryThe Executive Carry is essentially the Executive Elite modified for carry. It's the solution for those who prefer a smaller model 1911, but insist on complete reliability. The slide has been reduced to the minimum possible (4.25"") without significantly impairing the legendary reliability of the 5"" slide. The frame has been modified with the innovative Ed BrownBobtail® housing which reduces the projecting butt of the mainspring housing without sacrificing the full size frame and magazine capacity. The Bobtail® minimizes the print under your jacket when carrying and reduces weight. Officer's frames reduce magazine capacity and limit grip, while keeping the projecting, sharp butt. Slides shorter than 4.25"" are notorious for reduced reliability. These problems are eliminated with the Ed Brown Commander Bobtail® configuration, which reflects the genius of John Browning with an innovative modern flair. The functional simplicity has yet to be matched. Unique with the Executive series pistols is the 25 LPI checkered frame and ""half checkered"" Bobtail®. This pattern is not too rough on the hands, but not too fine for a secure grip. The Executive Carry is truly at the top of its field. Get promoted to an Executive Carry - it's a serious tool for the competent professional!The Executive Carry features the following:4.25"" Commander model slide, single stack commander Bobtail® frame. The John Browning traditional design innovatively modified for concealed carry, without significantly detracting from reliability or accuracy.Weight: approximately 35 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted.Exclusive 25 LPI checkering on forestrap and Bobtail®.Matte finished slide for low glare, with traditional ""square cut"" serrations on rear of slide only.Fixed dovetail 3-dot night sights with high visibility white outlines."

It's a fine gun in its own right, however, and is just as tough, if not quite as pretty and polished as a S&W. It fires .38 Special, the classic police caliber, and was produced from 1980 to 2001, when it was fully replaced by the Model 82, which is similar, but has a heavier barrel. The latch location is also different from modern Taurus guns, being in the same place as a S&W revolver's latch would be.Locks up very tightly on all cylinders, and is completely in time. All FOID rules, waiting periods, etc, followed."
