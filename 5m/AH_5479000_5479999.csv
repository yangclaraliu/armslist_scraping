With a new trigger and frame assembly, the TP9SA has been redefined for the American shooter. The TP9SA features a striker decocker that allows for safer disassembly as the trigger does not need to be engaged to field strip the pistol. This feature gives the operator added reassurance of a safe platform. The TP9SA also has a cold hammer forged barrel and the slide is cerakoted with 3-dot steel sights. The grip panels and front and rear grip have two different stippling styles to fully engage the shooters hand under any adverse condition. A longer trigger guard enables the operator to use the TP9SA while wearing hand protection. The grip design allows a slimmer feel while still containing an 18+1 capacity in 9mm. Comes with two 18-round magazines, polymer holster, paddle attachment, belt attachment, two interchangeable backstraps, cleaning rod, and a brush."

I have soooo many parts and extra parts it's hard to remember all I have, but I'll do my best to list everything. If it does not sell thats fine by me. Figured I'd throw this out there before I submit my paper work.First off it is in GREAT shape, no ding, dents, or scrapes. Probably have 250-300rds through it. It started life as a 556 swat with a Sig brace. I picked up a different lower to put the Swiss side folder stocks on it. BUT, I hated the fact I had to use the clear Sig mags. I sent it to a buddy (Sig certified smith) and made it to accept all 223/556 mags on the market. Now for the parts;1) 2 side folding retractable stocks. One is a little different than the other. Also have a short recoil pad if you want.2) Sig brace, let's keep it legal. 3) Sights, I have the fiber optic diopter on it, with the matching fold down post, and the hooded post. Also have the original picatinny rail with the fold down sight, and the newer picatinny fold down sight with the taller front post to match. 4) The original pistol grip, and a 556xi grip. 5) Aluminum 556 swat rail, and lighter fishgill w/rails. I can get an original 552 rail if you'd like. 6) Extras: charging handle, trigger group (internals only)7) I also have the Sig micro dot sight (not pictured)Any questions or want more pics just ask. Pleas know the laws on this if you put the stock on. I have WAY more in this that what I'm asking. Trades: Tavor with giessle trigger and/or optics.             Desert Tech MDR (good luck with that one)            Elcan Specter DrThanks for looking!"

It came from Germany wrapped with warnings in German that I couldn't read. The grip is an HK-91 grip ordered from HK Parts. I then had the gun professionally Cerakote'd by Palmer Ordnance in Seabeck, WA in order to make the metal from the G3 wood furniture, the HK lower, and the PTR upper all match. Finally I added a Nightforce SHV scope (3-10x 42mm .250MOA). This gun is a beauty and shoots great. I still have all the original jungle green furniture, which will be included. Also included are 6 magazines, 5 steel and 1 aluminum, all surplus G3 magazines. I have the original box for the scope and the hard case that the gun was shipped in. I put a lot of money into this project building a very nice shooter. This is as close in looks and feel as you will get to an original HK-91 without breaking the bank (I mean, it is more HK than PTR at this point anyway). Unfortunately I am selling to fund other gun projects. Asking $1300 without the scope, $2000 with the scope."

Has the HK metal lower on it, clipped and pinned SEF options. F is a redundant semi auto. The wood furniture is from German army G3's. It came from Germany wrapped with warnings in German that I couldn't read. The grip is an HK-91 grip ordered from HK Parts. I then had the gun professionally Cerakote'd by Palmer Ordnance in Seabeck, WA in order to make the metal from the G3 wood furniture, the HK lower, and the PTR upper all match. Finally I added a Nightforce SHV scope (3-10x 42mm .250MOA). This gun is a beauty and shoots great. I still have all the original jungle green furniture, which will be included. Also included are 6 magazines, 5 steel and 1 aluminum, all surplus G3 magazines. I have the original box for the scope and the hard case that the gun was shipped in. I put a lot of money into this project building a very nice shooter. This is as close in looks and feel as you will get to an original HK-91 without breaking the bank (I mean, it is more HK than PTR at this point anyway). Unfortunately I am selling to fund other gun projects. Asking $1300 without the scope, $2000 with the scope."

I got the rifle on trade and made sure it shoots safely and loads correctly. The Archangel stock is AWESOME. I love the rifle but I have my eyes on a .308 deer rifle, so my Mosins need to go to make room in the safe. This rifle has a single 5 round detachable mag! This is my abosolute favorite feature of the stock, the detachable mag that feeds well! The stock also has an adjustable check rest and shoulder pad so you can set it to your desired length of pull. It makes it much more comfortable to shoot. The previous owner stripped the bluing in favor of a more stainless look. I cleaned it and keep it protected with Froglube (love that stuff). It keeps it in good shape.The bolt handle has been bent from the typical straight to make it feed easier. I just have an extended nut on it right now because I liked the functionality but it can be replaced with anything. I will include the accessories that I have for it which includes the tool kit, bottom section of the original stock and oil can.
