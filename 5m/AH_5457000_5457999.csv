I can make a deal on a few hundred more rounds of WWB.   I also have a Crossbreed Supertuck Holster that I can keep or will sell with this package for just $30 more... I figure if you don't want it, I can put it to use with something else.  But if you like these, then I'll give you a great deal on the one for this gun."

Every design feature on the SDP Compact Alpha is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The polymer pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Alpha.

Retail on these uppers is $1200 give or take, but when I purchased two of these uppers last summer, I paid $1,320 per upper including sales tax.  Again, this upper is completely new and unused.  It has never been mounted or fired, unless perhaps text fired at the factory.  I've been very please with my other ARAK-21, which I completed right away but I've decided that I'd rather pick up a smaller pistol rather than have a two ARAKs in the collection."

This is the Remington 700 VTR (Varmint Tactical Rifle) in the more rare 308 caliber. This rifle has had 230 rounds thru it, and is in immaculate condition. It has the triangular, ported bull barrel and is dead nuts accurate with very little recoil. It has a fully adjustable trigger, and comes with a nice sling. From Remington's website:""A fusion of our most advanced performance features in both tactical and varmint rifles, the Model 700™ Varmint-Tactical Rifle (VTR™) is a revolutionary system optimized for extended-range precision and mobility. Its triangular barrel contour is a product of years of rigorous research and development focused on reducing weight, enhancing rigidity and promoting rapid heat dissipation.
To decrease recoil and muzzle jump, this uniquely contoured 22"" barrel has a machined-in, integral muzzle brake. Along with the new barrel design, we brought together a host of other cutting-edge features on our super-accurate Model 700 platform. The results are nothing short of astounding.""But, perhaps the best part of this deal is the scope attached to it. Its a Leupold VX-III 6.5-20x40 Long Range. The scope has 98% Light Transmission and is a true sight to see in fading light, (or in the darkness of a dimly lighted feeder!). The scope alone sells for anywhere from 650-759$ and as soon as you look thru it, you will see its worth every penny! Its a side focus, longe range scope that is in the same class as Nightforce and Zeiss. Very lightweight, and comes with Leupold's unlimited lifetime warranty. (Fully transferable to each owner). The scope is mounted with Leupold 30mm rings and premium bases. As you can see, I have spared no expenses with this rifle. I am asking a fair price, and will not entertain lowball offers or trades."

Later years, the sks-m was imported. You tend to see a lot more of those. They have the thumbhole stock and no bayonet.

However this is a numbers matching rifle, complete with bayonet, cleaning rod, and trap door cleaning kit. Total of 3 steel magazines. All original and has not been altered. The only thing not original is the two screws on the sides of the stock that hold the magazine well in place. This is truly a collectors item and not something to be turned into a tapco turd.

With a Bullpup configuration, it incorporated a grip that could be swiveled left or right so the magazine could lay on either side of the operator's arm like the modern day arm stabilizers/brace for the AR-15. The old Bushmaster Firearms logo had an image of this weapon. I believe the Mr. Gwinn son started Bushmaster Fireamrs. Shares the same magazine, bolt, and flash suppressor as the M-16/AR-15.

This firearm will shoot 2 ¾”, 3”, or 3 ½” 12 gauge shells. This shotgun has a 28” barrel, actually measures at 27 5/8” and comes with two improved cylinder, one modified, and one full choke. Chokes are distributed by Traditions and also work on Fausti Shotguns. This shotgun has a box lock action with single trigger, selective fire, and automatic ejectors. This shotgun has a vented top and center rib on the barrels. The stock and forearm are hand cut checkered walnut, with a rubber recoil pad. The stock has a full length of pull and measures in at 14 3/8”. Shotgun weighs in at 7 ½ lbs. This shotgun was not imported in great numbers as Stoeger did not actually import this firearm and the importation relied on domestic importers, but Stoeger did list this shotgun and it retailed out at $919.00 back in 2000, which is when this firearm was built. This shotgun is in sound mechanical condition and is tight but it has been used as you can tell from the pictures. I see no rust or major damage, just normal wear and tear from normal use. There are some minor scuffs on the barrel up toward the muzzle and there are there a couple of dings on the vent top rib. The wood has some dings and dents here and there and I tried to show these areas in the various pictures supplied. This firearm would grade 80% plus according to the NRA grading system. There is no factory manual or box. This firearm is no longer imported into the US. Good luck. . If you have any questions please feel free to contact me, REDACTED, ask for John.

It is the best pistol I have owned and definitely the most accurate pistol I have shot. With the extra backstraps and sidestraps, it can be made to custom fit any size hands and feels perfect once you find the right combination. 
 
It has a very small amount of stippling in each side of the frame where you can rest your trigger finger. This was done by the previous owner, not my style but it has grown on me. It came with 10-8 Performance fiber optic sights which I hated so I put the factory 3-dot sights back on. They are the cheap glow in the dark sights but that's just what I prefer for target use. Will come with 2 15 round mags, 30 rounds of hollow points, all the back and side straps, mag loader, fiber optic sights and the HK box. 
 
My price is $500 FIRM FIRM FIRM. Only reason I am selling is because we need the cash but I will be buying another one of these as soon as I can!
 
If you are a lefty, for an extra $40, I will throw in 2 Alien Gear Holsters."

Yes, it has a steel frame among other special features. Very Rare, less than 200 imported into US.  Manual safety, carry cocked and locked like 1911 for single qaction first and all shots. Capable of double action first shot if you so desire.  Nickel finish throughout. I did not like the original magazine catch so I sent pistol to Beretta and they installed a Billennium magazine catch which has the same nickel finish.  Th pistol was made during the Clinton gun ban so it orriginally included plain 10 round magazines.  I upgraded the magazines to the correct nickel 15 round Billennium magazines with thick rubber bottoms.  Because of the extra weight and 9mm caliber, this is a highly coveted pistol for competition shooters.  The frame is a Vertec type giving a straight grip like a 1911.  Shot very little, total round count less than 50 rounds.  I shot it myself and it is extremely accurate.  I'm a honest no BS kind of guy so I will not waste your time and ask that you give me the same courtesy. PAYMENT: Postal money orders get fastest shipping.  Personal checks, business checks, bank/cashiers checks or any other payment method shipping will be held till funds fully clear my bank - usually that is within 10 business days.

I was told they were specifically for the 10903A3 but might fit other 1903 variants. Not being familiar with that rifle, I make no guarantees nut if you want tobring your action over and check them out, that would be cool.You will need to finish the inletting (fine-fitting) and sand and finish the stocks. Add a nice buttplate and your action is ready to install and use. Again, unfinished and semi-inleted, but a great base for that 1903 boltgun project!No action or other parts are provided or included....just that rough stock.One is a nice lighter weight stock with a tapered fore end, the other is wider with a squared fore end tip and a Monte Carlo cheekpiece.Both are nice and will make beautiful stocks once finished.These are American Walnut. Gtain is nice but nothing fancy. That said, the PRICE certainly is the deal....just $40.00 cash each - your choice.THAT is a steal for these.....if you bought these from a retailer thay'd be triple this price so I exect these to go fast."
