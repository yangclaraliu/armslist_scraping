Please note most of our uppers are currently in stock and usually ship out within 24hrs of purchase. However due to high demand for these products we might have to build and test fire your upper the week of your order. We ask that you be patient this could take an additional 5-7 business days to complete and ship. If you're worried about lead time please call us for updated inventory.  WARNING!!

Designed to work with both Colt/RR and Glock style AR builds. Compatible with standard mil-spec uppers. There are also numerous dedicated 9mm upper options that work. Requires the use of a unique magwell conversion (Colt/Rock River style) with UZI mags or a dedicated 9mm lower with Glock mags. 9mm on an AR15 platform operates by blowback and does not need a gas block or gas tube. Threaded 1/2x28 instead of 1/2x36 to give you greater versatility when choosing a suppressor. Integrated feed ramp and barrel extension. Since the “barrel extension” is an integral part of the barrel, the length stated is the true overall length. For example, an 11” 9mm barrel has the same outer dimensions/length as a 10.5” 5.56 barrel. IMPORTANT: A standard 1/2x28 flash hider will not have enough clearance for a 9mm round to pass. Before installing a muzzle device, ensure a 9mm round will drop freely through the muzzle device bore.  You may use this barrel with a lower receiver that is a Registered SBR, Machine Gun, or Pistol. Possession of this barrel along with a Non-NFA lower receiver is Prohibited, except when installed on a Pistol configuration firearm.

Awesome gun, light recoil for .357 sig, even with hot Underwood ammo. Just not the right gun for me. $1400 is about right for the TRADE value for the gun in barely used condition (exactly 60 rounds through it since I bought it new) and all the extras in my opinion. This stuff is just over $1500 new, and I will take the new value of your items when considering a trade. I will accept $1200 cash for everything (somewhat negotiable). If we're trading multiple guns or gun plus cash, we'll figure something out that works for both of us. You can text me at REDACTED.

It's the shorter barrelled version, 20"" I believe. Nice bore, very nice overall condition, very handy and fun to shoot, and disassembles very easily for storage/transport. One issue with the gun - I replaced the firing pins with titanium firing pins and have had some light primer strikes since then. Regular pins will fix the problem (I don't have the old ones - one was sticking, hence the replacement). I'm not really interested in doing the legwork on that, so the gun is priced around $200 cheaper than you see most of these going for.  Price is $250 firm.     I'm in Oak Harbor, but I can meet in between Mt. Vernon/Burlingotn. Buyer pays transfer fee. More pictures on request. Text/Call REDACTEDThanks, and have a great day!"

It has an iconic place in American sporting culture and has been held in high regard by shooters since it was introduced in 1936, earning the moniker ""The Rifleman's Rifle"".[1] The action has some design similarities to Mauser designs and it is a development of the earlier Winchester Model 54. The Model 70 was originally manufactured by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company between 1936 and 1980. From the early 1980s until 2006, Winchester rifles were manufactured by U.S. Repeating Arms under an agreement with Olin Corporation, allowing USRA to use the Winchester name and logo.[2] Model 70s were built in New Haven, Connecticut, from 1936 to 2006, when production ceased. In the fall of 2007, the Belgian company FN Herstal announced that Model 70 production would resume. As of 2012, new Winchester Model 70 rifles were being made by FN Herstal in Columbia, South Carolina. In 2013, assembly was moved to Portugal"

This gun is $400 brand new. The reason I'm asking for $400 is because it comes with a $70 Blackhawk M4 style stock and Blackhawk pump. It also comes with $200 worth of ammo. It is mostly 00buck and rifled slugs. This would be a great home defense gun. This is a $670 value for only $350. Please call me if your interested. My name is Cliff and my number is REDACTED.

This police package comes to us from an estate sale.
The revolver is a Smith & Wesson Model blued 10-5 that shows ""character"" and wears it with pride! This was the everyday carry weapon for this police officer until his retirement many years ago. Bore and cylinder are clean and everything feels tight. The rear sights and front ramp have white paint lightly dabbed on for the ""old school"" edition of fiber optic sights we have today.
The revolver has lots of holster wear and some light freckling in a few spots, but I think it is in better aesthetic condition than I would have expected from a career long everyday use and carry gun. The grips closely resemble custom-made dark walnut Bull's-eye target thumb rest grips. There is some wear in a couple of areas, primarily on the inside corners where they rubbed while in the holster.
My experience with Model 10-5 revolvers is that they are really fine shooters with nice triggers. I took this one out to the gun range tonight thinking I would shoot the handful of loose .38 caliber I had in a range bag just to make sure it fired okay. That was just a tease, as I ended up shooting that handful and a box of 50 Remington factory ammunition. It is a really good shooting gun with a nice trigger and the custom grips made for a really comfortable hold and lack of felt recoil.
The holster is a Jay-Pee Spring Lock Safety Swivel Holster that features a trigger guard click retention button to keep the pistol securely inside the holster until it can easily be removed with a push of the finger as you draw the pistol. It also has space on the belt to hold a dozen .38 Special bullets.
The belt is a Bianchi 42 with adjustable sizing and quick connection prongs.
This is a really cool police package that will easily take you back in time to when this officer carried his gun with this belt and holster.Contact me for additional pictures.
