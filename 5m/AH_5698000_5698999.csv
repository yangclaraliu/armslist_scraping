We designed our grip with ergonomics and controllability in mind. Our grip shares the angle of the classic 1911 pistol for the most natural hand position and comfortable feel. This pistol grip incorporates an oversized trigger guard covering the gap between grip and lower receiver which can wear on the shooters hand and easily accommodates for gloves. Installation is simplified by the fact the integral trigger guard doesn’t require a roll pin so there is a reduced chance of damaging the lower receiver.

The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.
 
Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols.

Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed steel front sight, picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs.

I know the SR22s can be hit-or-miss in terms of quality but this one is a great specimen.  It has shot flawlessly and accurately right out of the box.  It has probably only jammed two or three times, total, out of 400 rounds downrange, and that was with a wide variety of ammunition from very good to very cheap bulk stuff. 
It has always been kept clean and in a climate controlled safe.  No scratches or wear at all.  Very nice fit and finish.
Gun comes like new with the original box, plus...- Extra magazine (total of three mags)- Hi-Viz fiber optic front sight mounted on gun, with extra light pipes in different colors (original front sight also included of course)- Nylon zippered case- Fobus paddle holster- Nylon magazine pouch with belt loop so you can wear two mags on your belt (not pictured)- The extra grip sleeve- The smaller magazine floor plates- The envelope from Ruger with the fired cartridge case- Instruction manualI’m also throwing in 200 rounds of unopened CCI Mini Mags.
Price is $300, firm. 
I would take less but my wife won’t… LOL.  She’s got her eye on a little Glock 43.
Message me if interested and include a number where I can call or text.
Terms are cash, pick up at my place in south Lincoln.  Buyer must have a valid Nebraska CHP, or NE driver’s license plus purchase permit.

Excellent shooter! Slightly different grip angle that is actually more natural, and the trapezoid (triangular) sights are easier to pick up than the regular three-dot type. Because of the grip angle, your hand is up near the bore axis, resulting in a softer recoil than most polymer pistols. Steyn is the “other” Austrian gunmaker (some say this pistol is what Glock should have been!) of high quality firearms. Trouble is, I just don’t care for striker-fired pistols; if I did, this is the one I’d keep.No shipping, no trades; at this price will meet only in Chattanooga area (as far as S.

It's a banned model, no longer allowed for import. Somehow I bought this one from a 2013 inventory. I'm the first owner. The Saiga models are supposedly the best and I beleive they have a chrome lined barrel. I spent a lot of time meticulously cleaning it and getting some lubricant on it, since it had sat for so long.This one is compatible with the military style AK74 handguard (with some other modifications) if you plan on changing it. It's also got an optics rail.It comes with all the original packaging, a ""Circle 21"" magazine, and a little cleaning kit (I think? I haven't opened the pouch).I don't know a ton about these, but I know they are sought after. If you have any questions feel free to ask.Yes, these are my pictures.Thanks!"

The Barrel, and Bolt are from Brownells, and i believe are satern manufactured I bead blasted the barrel for a more matte gray finish than stock.every thing was checked for square uppon assembly and barrel torqued to 53lbs (according to my bench notes).Accuracy at 100yds has been sub 1"" with most groups averaging less than .5""s, these were all shot during rough load work up. I have not finalized the loads for this uppper, but so far 31.5grn of cfe223 behind a 123amax is showing promise, id suggest the new owner work around that range to see what comes up as the best. Ive shot my steel plate out to 500yds with this rig in its semi tuned fashion and making consistent hits is not that difficult.The scope is a Leupold Mark AR, older model that has the better turret covers. its a 6-18x40, has a forward objective focus ring, and the CDC turrets for a 5.56 (if your inclined you can purchase turrets for any cal and load from Leupold for bout 60 bucks a set). Dail ups have been accurate and consistent and return to zero has been perfect. It comes with the buttler creek caps.Rings are cheap aluminums, but when checked for alignment theye were perfect on this upper. Ive replaced with shitty over size nobs with decent nylock stainless hardware.Bipods a utg and is actually pretty good quality, i didnt build this upper for serious knock around hunting, so the cheaper bipod works fine for what i do. If you plan on really beating on the rig tho a tougher pod might be in order.first picture is of when i first completed the upper and was working on initial load development, optics and barrel finish are visible in second picture.Any questions feel free to hit me upIll trade for other gun or bow stuff450 no scopethanksKeao3152000"

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.The PMAG 20 GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring for commonality, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.Made in U.S.A.Check out this product on my website! http://www.battlecreekarmory.com/product-p/mpm55620rg3b.htm"

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color.  Made in U.S.A. Check out this product on my website! http://www.battlecreekarmory.com/product-p/mpm55630rwg2f.htm"
