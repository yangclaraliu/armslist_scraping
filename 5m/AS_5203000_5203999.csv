Have fired a few magazines of corrosive ammo (left over ammo from previous ak74) but it has only had commerical ammo through it since then, and no signs of corrosion anywhere in the barrel or reciever. Total of 400-500 rounds have been fired through the rifle.  I was going to modify the rifle, but cannot seem to convince myself of doing all of that work to a banned Russian rifle.  So I will see if anyone else will be interested in the rifle before I go through with modifying it.  Comes with original 10 round magazine, 3 Tula Magazines (one not included in photo), and one circle 21 magazine.  Also have 780 rounds of silver bear, 750 rounds of WPA, and 550 rounds of hornady that go towards the trade (30 round magazines and ammo will not be a part of the trade for a SLR104ur)."

The Strike One semiautomatic pistol is the fastest, most controllable, most accurate, and hardest hitting service pistol in the world. Unsurpassed Engineering The frame of the Strike One is engineered with exacting and unprecedented standards. The operating frame block (made of the best 42CrMo4 steel) features 5″ full length rails for total axial and torque control of all moving parts, pins, and springs. The frame itself, with its unique and true 3D molded hand grip (not just “millings” on a flat surface) comes today as the only service pistol in the world with a full fledged IPSC standard magazine insert (miniskirt). This allows Special Operation and SWAT teams to work as if they were using a competition pistol. Unsurpassed Shooting Feel The Strike One operates on a horizontal plane, without risers and without a long, rubbery trigger pull (known as trigger creep). It has a crisp and short firing pin release giving the feel of a competition type trigger. This is the secret, along with a lightning fast locking mechanism, that gives the Strike One its unbelievable semiautomatic firing speed. It is faster than any other pistol ever manufactured because of the in-line barrel operation."

I would describe it as more of a flat wood grain hunting style finish rather than a high gloss show finish. This gun is fantastic condition and needs nothing. I had a local gunsmith go through the gun and smooth everything out for reliability and accuracy (cost me about $100 to have this done). The gun functions flawlessly. I am 4 for 4 on Indiana deer with the gun over the last couple years but have decided to build another caliber with my brother for the upcoming 2016 season. I wish I could afford to keep it and complete the build but the budget doesn't allow it! I do have a number of high quality 44 mag custom loads I could sell with the gun as well."
