It's a Steyr Gewehr 88 from 1890, way before WWI when the German Empire still had a Kaiser (emperor) and looks to be having used in the fight with the Ottoman Empire (Persia, now Iran). It is also often erroneously referred to as “Mauser” or “Mannlicher”.  It has all the hallmarks and markings that make this a rifle to have, from the Emperor's crown to the Ottoman insignia.   Kaiser Wilhelm II was Germany's last emperor and this baby could have seen action in Iran, then the 1st World War, on to WWII.  The bore's rifling is still exceptional an the rifling twist is incredible, especially with this extra long barrel. Rounds chamber tight and the rifle works flawlessly, we shot 2 boxes and the accuracy is incredible! You can actually see those 8mm extra large bullets hit where they impact, even at a distance. Speaking of which, it has a flip up sight for long range shots. Whatever you hit with this baby, it's going down hard...  With the sight in regular mode, it is sighted to 273 yards, then you can flip it up and it's range is from 500 yards, with approx. 110 yard increments to a total range of 2187 yards.  5 shot clip, which can be strip loaded for fast reloading...  At 124 years of age this puppy will give most modern rifles a run for the money especially in accuracy, my buddy with his scoped rifle couldn't believe the distances that this will hit at, without even a scope.  REAL German quality, even after a 124 years, it becomes very apparent when shooting it.  While you can just hang it on your wall as a show off rife, it will be a real joy to shoot, take it hunting and show your buddies how it's done Old School...  You WILL NOT run across another one like, it is very rare...  Cash Only! $600 Or best Offer, will entertain all reasonable offers"

The engine has a small nickel size hole under the block from the 3rd cylinder blowing through the block of the engine. So this vehicle will need a new engine.

This ammo did not operate well in the firearm. When manually cycling the firearm with snap caps, it extracts and ejects just fine, so i suspect that it may be ammo-specific.

The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun.*The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.*The .40 SUB-2000™ can be configured in the following magazine types: GLK22, GLK23, BERETTA96, S&W4006, SIG226.
