Remington has begun to convert these surplus rifles into a NEARLY NEW CONFIGURATION. Each rifle will have a NEW BARREL, NEW M24 ACTION (marked with the original M24 designation and drilled and tapped for the receiver mounted open sights), and trigger. Aside from these critical parts, all other system parts will be 100% serviceable military surplus, if at all possible (new parts were substituted where needed).Â Additionally, the rifle will feature the original stock and external hardware that was ISSUED and USED in service by a US Army Sniper. Pictures best represent what you will receive as this is the EXACT firearm.Manufacturer: Remington Arms Company, Inc.Â Model: M24 7.62 NATO S.W.S. Collectors EditionÂ Caliber: 7.62 NATO/.308 WinchesterÂ Barrel Length: Heavy Profile 24""Â Capacity: 5 Round Internal BoxÂ Description: Designed for and used by the United States Military, the M24's popularity also stretches from SWAT teams nationwide to International Military and Government agencies. Based on Remington's legendary Model 700â¢ and 40-Xâ¢ rifles, famous for their ""out of the box"" accuracy, the M24 has quickly gained a reputation for precision among the sniper system community. An essential element in the M-24's accuracy is its heavy, hammer-forged, stainless steel, Rem-Tough powder-coated barrel. The barrel's unique 5-R rifling delivers combined advantages of reduced bullet deformation and metallic fouling, even pressure curves, higher bullet velocities and longer barrel accuracy life. The M-24's H-S PrecisionÂ® aramid fiber-reinforced, fiberglass stock with an aluminum bedding block, is utilized for exceptional strength and dimensional stability in all weather conditions. Combined with its sophisticated sighting options, the M-24's Sniper Weapon System remains the standard against which all sniper systems are compared.Â Â Overall Length: 1,092.2mm (43"")Â Barrel Material: 416R Stainless Steel Twist: 1/285.75mm (1/11.5"") Rifling: 5 radial land grooves Barrel Finish: Powder-coated Rem-Tough Trigger Adjustable External: 1.98-7.94 Lbs Butt Plate Adjustment: 50.8mm (2"") Weight with sling: 5.4 Kg (12.3 lbs.)

Â This is the only reason I am selling, I don't know if I'll ever take this one out or not and could use the cash for other projects. Â I was told the trigger on this model is an STI competition, the finish and slide serrations are very nicely done, one piece steel guide rod and it's bushing-less with a recessed crown bull barrel with tighter tolerances for improved accuracy and it has adjustable target sights. Â It also has a flat top solid rib slide to help with recoil, very nice 1911 without the BIG price tag of other competition 1911's.
$1,060 in cash or better in trade value. Â Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades. Â If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? Â Â Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns. Â Trades: Â 
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails. Â FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger. Â Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus. Â 
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger. Â A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.

The glass is very clear and it is perfect for an AR platform rifle. It has a 1-4 magnification and works very well at close range with both eyes open or at longer ranges if you want to use the MIL dot for range and holdover. The dot and the circle are illuminated with adjustable brightness and it has a mil dot reticle. The clear glass and the adjustable reticle brightness work great in low light conditions. Scope comes with a Vortex Cantilever 30mm picatinny mount with a 2"" offset. It sits forward enough to allow you to mount a manual folding rear sight. Also comes with a Throw Lever on the magnification dial. Trust me; you will love this in the field if you need to change magnification in a hurry. You never need to take your eye off your target while you search for the dial. The ONLY reason I am parting with this fine scope is because my eyesight and the reticle do not get along. My stigmatism makes the red dot distorted and I depend on it in low light conditions. I have original box and the Vortex warranty is lifetime."

I'm asking $1600 for it. That $1600 price will include everything that it came with originally plus a inside the waist band holster, approx. 300 range rounds, about 20 hollow point protection rounds also. Along with a 50 round carry case and a 8+1 aftermarket mag that works well. From the factory, it came with 2 mags and a double mag holster and outside the waistband holster. Now if I get my $1600 price, you get everything. If you try to make any offers, I will not include any of the extra stuff for it. I'm trying to be fair. This is a very rare gun and every single review raves about this gun. Watch any YouTube video you want on it. It's a bullseye shooter. Not just a target shooter. This gun will help you shoot more accurately. It is a match grade barrel because this gun spends time with a gun smith before it leaves the manufacturer to ensure that the parts fit like a glove. I've shot approx. 300 rounds threw it. Very little use and oiled and cleaned after every use.Â Text 65one-26O-7284 text me for pics.

The trigger has three positions 1: safe, 2: standard 4lb pull, 3: Auto reset mode which give the trigger much less take up, and assisted reset meaning after firing reset is automatic. You do have to slightly let off trigger for reset but reset length is minimal this does allow for a faster fire rate. With a small amount of practice you can obtain firing rates near full auto. I have this trigger in 3 of my ARâs and love it. Even as a standard crisp drop in trigger its amazing. Go to www.TacConUSA.com for more info.

Â This is Smith's scandium frame SWAT revolver that holds eight rounds of 357. Â It is tapped for mounting an under barrel rail for lights or lasers, and also for mounting a top rail for optics. Â Both rail sections and mounting hardware are included, as well as the factory case. Â It does have the original brown paper wrapping, if that is a factor for you. Â This pistol has fired exactly 126 rounds of 38 special. Â I'm not the first owner but I know the original owner well so I know that count is accurate. Â I have six Â moon clips that will come with the pistol, three are filled with HPR 38 special hollow points, 24 rounds total. Â Also included is a full box of Hornady Critical Defense 357 magnum hollow points. Â I did add some black cherry VZ grips as pictured. Â They are very comfortable grips, but the original rubber grips are included as well. Â For trades, I'm really only interested in a Sig P229 Legion model in 9mm. Â I may consider another 229 but it has to be 9mm. Â No 40 cal, no 357 Sig.Â I'm also interested in an older Colt Series 70 government size. Â Not interested in series 80 at all. Â I like lever action rifles, too. Â I'd consider either a 30-30 or 45-70, or possibly a mare's leg. Â Preferably an older Winchester or a Henry.Â Otherwise, the only other trade I couldn't resist would be a Dan Wesson Valor with the black finish.I'm willing to add cash if your offer is worth more. Â And I'm willing to meet halfway to make a deal. Â Transaction will take place at an FFL. Â The new private party laws are stupid but it's not worth losing my job. Â Let me know if you'd like any additional pictures or if you have any questions.Â Thanks for looking!"
