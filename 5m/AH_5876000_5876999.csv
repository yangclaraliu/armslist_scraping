Made in USA! COLT! Special Limited production Nickel with extra cylinder.  Three digit matching serial numbers on both cylinders, grip frame, trigger guard, frame and barrel lug.  Cut for shoulder stock (factory).     Sorry, no box.  It has been handled, so it has some handling marks - certainly nothing major.  There are no drag marks on the cylinders.     Note:  A recent examination of the cylinders makes me lean toward the gun having been fired,  although there is little evidence of it.  The bore appears as new.     This is the first 1860 I have ever handled, and I have never handled any revolver that felt so ""right"" in my hand.  It feels like an extension of my fingers, and has absolutely excellent balance.  The action is very smooth.  Also, in my opinion, The plating looks as nice as any nickeled ""Colt Snake"".     If you are interested, stop by for a look.  A face to face transaction is preferred.  If you need me to, I can send pictures.  Since it's a Black Powder gun, I can sell to an adult in any State, unless you live in Illinois or the handful of other places that would require it to go through an FFL.  You are responsible for knowing if you can directly receive this pistol or not - research your own local/state laws!     Email questions.  I'm not really looking for much in the way of trade.  If I have to ship, you pick up all of the shipping charges.     Thanks for looking!     Note:  It seems that this pistol, since it is actually worth something, has been the target of multiple (unsuccessful) scammers.  So, see below:     Be advised that ANY PURCHASE THAT IS NOT FACE TO FACE, MUST BE PAID WITH A POSTAL MONEY ORDER; NO EXCEPTIONS!"

Remington has begun to convert these surplus rifles into a NEARLY NEW CONFIGURATION. Each rifle will have a NEW BARREL, NEW M24 ACTION (marked with the original M24 designation and drilled and tapped for the receiver mounted open sights), and trigger. Aside from these critical parts, all other system parts will be 100% serviceable military surplus, if at all possible (new parts were substituted where needed). Additionally, the rifle will feature the original stock and external hardware that was ISSUED and USED in service by a US Army Sniper. Pictures best represent what you will receive as this is the EXACT firearm.Manufacturer: Remington Arms Company, Inc. Model: M24 7.62 NATO S.W.S. Collectors Edition Caliber: 7.62 NATO/.308 Winchester Barrel Length: Heavy Profile 24"" Capacity: 5 Round Internal Box Description: Designed for and used by the United States Military, the M24's popularity also stretches from SWAT teams nationwide to International Military and Government agencies. Based on Remington's legendary Model 700™ and 40-X™ rifles, famous for their ""out of the box"" accuracy, the M24 has quickly gained a reputation for precision among the sniper system community. An essential element in the M-24's accuracy is its heavy, hammer-forged, stainless steel, Rem-Tough powder-coated barrel. The barrel's unique 5-R rifling delivers combined advantages of reduced bullet deformation and metallic fouling, even pressure curves, higher bullet velocities and longer barrel accuracy life. The M-24's H-S Precision® aramid fiber-reinforced, fiberglass stock with an aluminum bedding block, is utilized for exceptional strength and dimensional stability in all weather conditions. Combined with its sophisticated sighting options, the M-24's Sniper Weapon System remains the standard against which all sniper systems are compared.  Overall Length: 1,092.2mm (43"") Barrel Material: 416R Stainless Steel Twist: 1/285.75mm (1/11.5"") Rifling: 5 radial land grooves Barrel Finish: Powder-coated Rem-Tough Trigger Adjustable External: 1.98-7.94 Lbs Butt Plate Adjustment: 50.8mm (2"") Weight with sling: 5.4 Kg (12.3 lbs.)

$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, probably a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price, please do not offer less as you will not get a response.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.
Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.  Thanks"

$1,060 in cash or better in trade value.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.  
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

I am very comfortable with my 5.56 and .308 rifles, This rifle will also be partially funding upgraded optics on my other rifles as well.if you have any questions or want more pictures, i would be more than happy to oblige. Currently the only firearm i am ACTIVELY looking for is the KEL-TEC RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) and the MSRP for a Brand New one is $1,272 so it would NOT be an even trade.

The glass is very clear and it is perfect for an AR platform rifle. It has a 1-4 magnification and works very well at close range with both eyes open or at longer ranges if you want to use the MIL dot for range and holdover. The dot and the circle are illuminated with adjustable brightness and it has a mil dot reticle. The clear glass and the adjustable reticle brightness work great in low light conditions. Scope comes with a Vortex Cantilever 30mm picatinny mount with a 2"" offset. It sits forward enough to allow you to mount a manual folding rear sight. Also comes with a Throw Lever on the magnification dial. Trust me; you will love this in the field if you need to change magnification in a hurry. You never need to take your eye off your target while you search for the dial. The ONLY reason I am parting with this fine scope is because my eyesight and the reticle do not get along. My stigmatism makes the red dot distorted and I depend on it in low light conditions. I have original box and the Vortex warranty is lifetime."

I'm asking $1600 for it. That $1600 price will include everything that it came with originally plus a inside the waist band holster, approx. 300 range rounds, about 20 hollow point protection rounds also. Along with a 50 round carry case and a 8+1 aftermarket mag that works well. From the factory, it came with 2 mags and a double mag holster and outside the waistband holster. Now if I get my $1600 price, you get everything. If you try to make any offers, I will not include any of the extra stuff for it. I'm trying to be fair. This is a very rare gun and every single review raves about this gun. Watch any YouTube video you want on it. It's a bullseye shooter. Not just a target shooter. This gun will help you shoot more accurately. It is a match grade barrel because this gun spends time with a gun smith before it leaves the manufacturer to ensure that the parts fit like a glove. I've shot approx. 300 rounds threw it. Very little use and oiled and cleaned after every use. Text 65one-26O-7284 text me for pics.

The trigger has three positions 1: safe, 2: standard 4lb pull, 3: Auto reset mode which give the trigger much less take up, and assisted reset meaning after firing reset is automatic. You do have to slightly let off trigger for reset but reset length is minimal this does allow for a faster fire rate. With a small amount of practice you can obtain firing rates near full auto. I have this trigger in 3 of my AR’s and love it. Even as a standard crisp drop in trigger its amazing. Go to www.TacConUSA.com for more info.
