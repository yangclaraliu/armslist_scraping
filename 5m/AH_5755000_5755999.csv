We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— VX-6 1-6x24mm (30mm) Custom Dial System German #4 Dot  Matte German #4 Dot Reticle   These typical European-style reticles are bold and easy to see, especially against tangled backgrounds and shadows.   Our VX-6 takes all the advantages of our Quantum Optical System and multiplies it times six. You get virtually every feature you can imagine legendary ruggedness, stunning optics, and a huge 6x zoom ratio that shortens the distance to your next trophy. With a VX-6 atop your favorite rifle, the advantage is all yours. Quantum Optical System   Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold's newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max design software and evaluation using Leupold's Zygo Interferometer to minimizi dont ee wave front error and increase resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold. Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Lead Free   Leupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction.   6:1 Zoom Ratio   A helpful 6:1 zoom ratio delivers crystal clear images from edge-to-edge throughout the entire magnification range. Many higher Leupold scopes provide the best picture at each end of the zoom ratio, leaving the middle ranges weaker on clarity and resolution. The Leupold 6X erector system was engineered from the outset to provide consistently exceptional image quality across the entire visual field throughout the entire zoom range. Twin Bias Spring Erector System features berylium/copper alloy leaf springs and 30% more holding force to withstand the most intense recoil and abuse.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Pop-Up Rezero Adjustments   Pop-up re-zero finger click windage and elevation adjustments assure maximum adjustment range, precision and instant re-zeroing. The adjustment dials can be repositioned to align with the marked zero indicator of the adjustment without changing the adjustment setting of the scope. This allows the shooter to know the original zero of the rifle in the event that further adjustments are made in the field. To reset the zero simply lift the dial and rotate it until the 0 on the dial is aligned with the zero indicator.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Extreme Fast-Focus Eyepiece   The extreme fast-focus eyepiece ensures a generous eyebox, superior field of view and optimal diopter adjustment in the field. It allows the user to adjust through the full range of diopter adjustment in one complete turn of the eyepiece.   30mm Maintube CDS (Custom Dial System)   Leupold CDS models allow you to quickly dial your elevation to different sight-in ranges with a custom adjustment matched to your specific ballistics information. The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers. Every CDS dial features MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-2, VX-3, VX-6 and VX-R even more accurate and rugged. How the CDS System Works The CDS System works by laser-inscribing your scope's elevation dial to match your load, velocity and conditions. Your scope will be in perfect synch with the way your rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads. Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account:   1/4 MOA Finger Click   Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments 1 cm per click).   Extended Battery Life Tactile Leupold Indicator with Range Estimation   Tactile Leupold indicator also features built-in range estimation functions and graphite O-rings for easy operation.

The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers. Every CDS dial features ¼-MOA click or 1 cm click (metric versions), finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-2, VX-3, VX-6 and VX-R even more accurate and rugged. How the CDS™ System Works The CDS System works by laser-inscribing your scope's elevation dial to match your load, velocity and conditions. Your scope will be in perfect synch with the way your rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads. Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account:  BAS (Ballistic Aiming System)  Leupold’s® Ballistics Aiming System™ is comprised of five specialized reticles – Boone and Crockett® Big Game, Varmint Hunter’s, LR Duplex, LRV Duplex, and the new SA.B.R. reticles – which take into account the variables crucial to accurate, long-range shooting. A special ballistics indicator ring allows users to customize their power settings for their cartridge’s ballistics, then saves that setting for easy reference in a hunting situation. With multiple aiming points for longer ranges and varying wind speeds, and infinite power selector settings to match your rifle’s ballistics, the Ballistics Aiming System can help you master the art of accurate, long-range shooting. It has proved so successful in helping hunters learn how to shoot accurately at long range, we’ve expanded your BAS options with additional reticles offering many of the same benefits as the original reticles. We’ve also made them available in more riflescopes than ever. With practice, the Ballistics Aiming System will teach you how to gauge the distance to your target, where to place your reticle for that distance, and even how to compensate for wind deflection. With the Ballistics Aiming System and some practice, you’ll consistently make shots you wouldn’t have attempted in the past. Accurate, long-range shooting is probably one of the most difficult hunting skills to master. For many hunters, it remains a combination of hard-won experience, intuition, and a little luck. Together, the reticles of the Ballistics Aiming System give the hunter very useful tools for successful hunts with clean and efficient harvests. By practicing with the Ballistics Aiming System, all hunters can add science to the art of long-range shooting, and master this important skill. One System, Five Unique Reticles The Boone and Crockett Big Game reticle and the Varmint Hunter’s reticle use the same principles to help you hone your long-range shooting skills, though each has been tailored to meet the needs of big game or varmint hunters. With practice, using each will become a natural part of your shooting. Unlike other range estimating reticles, the calculations made here are incredibly simple, and take the guesswork out of long-range shooting. Each reticle provides a series of aiming points. The first aiming point, the intersection of the Duplex® reticle, is to be used at 200 yards with most common cartridges, and 300 yards with several flatter shooting, longer-range loads. The Boone and Crockett Big Game reticle and Varmint Hunter’s reticle also provides you with two different power selector ring settings, indicated by large and small triangles on the power selector. These allow you to select the hold points best suited to the cartridge you are using. In some cases, the smaller triangle setting can be used with your slower, heavier bullet load, and the large triangle setting with your faster loads in the same rifle. The new SA.B.R. reticle also features holdover points and a power selector matched to different load settings for muzzleloaders and shotguns. The LR Duplex and LRV Duplex reticles are designed to be used only at the maximum magnification settings. For example, a 30-06 with a 180gr spitzer bullet and 2700 fps muzzle velocity would use the smaller triangle setting. In the same rifle, a 150gr spitzer bullet with 3000 fps muzzle velocity would use the larger triangle. We have designated three sets of cartridges to be used with the large and small triangle settings, and sight-in distances of either 200 or 300 yards, described as Group A (large triangle, 200 yard zero), Group B (large triangle, 300 yard zero), or Group C (small triangle, 200 yard zero). Verify the aiming points by shooting at the actual distances at which the hold points in the reticle are intended to work. With the LR Duplex and LRV Duplex reticles a shooter can tailor the reticle to his or her load by varying the magnifications, thus altering the subtensions. With all four reticles, remember: practice, practice, practice! 1/4 MOA Target 1/4 MOA Finger Click   Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (¼-MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments – 1 cm per click).

Matte Illuminated CMR-W 7.62 Front Focal Plane (FFP)   Every feature was put in place for one purpose: to help you get the maximum advantage from your rifle, whether you’re hunting or in competition   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold’s index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered.

With a powerful 6:1 zoom ratio, the Leupold VX®- 6 delivers crystal-clear images from edge-to-edge throughout the entire magnification range. Leupold’s Quantum Optical System™ with legendary Xtended Twilight lens coatings and DiamondCoat 2™ combine with edge blackened lead-free lenses for astonishing clarity and light transmission. The extreme fast-focus eyepiece ensures a generous eyebox, superior field of view, and optimal diopter adjustment in the field. Illuminated reticle VX-6 models feature either traditional or super bright FireDot™ illumination. The 1-button low- profile design allows users to choose between 12 intensity settings. Proprietary motion sensor technology (MST™) automatically deactivates illumination after five minutes of inactivity, yet re-activates as soon as any movement is detected. A rugged 34mm maintube, Twin Bias Spring Erector System™, and pop-up re-zero finger click adjustments assure maximum adjustment for range and precision. Waterproof, shockproof, and backed by the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee/ Leupold Golden Ring® Electronics Warranty, the Leupold VX-6 sets the standard for riflescope performance. Varmint Hunter (Illuminated) Reticle Quantum Optical System Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold’s newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System™ is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout—the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max® design software and evaluation usingLeupold’s Zygo® Interferometer to minimize wave front error andincrease resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt—from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity—all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations. Xtended Twilight Lens System Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System™. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System®, using Leupold’s® index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths.

DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast. 2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves. Lead Free Leupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction. 6:1 Zoom Ratio A powerful 6:1 zoom ratio delivers crystal clear images from edge-to-edge throughout the entire magnification range. Many higher power scopes provide the best picture at each end of the zoom ratio, leaving the middle ranges weaker on clarity and resolution. The Leupold 6X erector system was engineered from the outset to provide consistently exceptional image quality across the entire visual field throughtout the entire zoom range. Twin Bias Spring Erector System features berylium/copper alloy leaf springs and 30% more holding force to withstand the most intense recoil and abuse. Generous Eyebox The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high power, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight pictue that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime. Pop-Up Rezero Adjustments Pop-up re-zero finger click windage and elevation adjustments assure maximum adjustment range, precision and insant re-zeroing. The adjustment dials can be repositioned to align with the marked zero indicator of the adjustment without changing the adjustment setting of the scope. This allows the shooter to know the original zero of the rifle in the event that further adjustments are made in the field. To reset the zero simply lift the dial and rotate it until the ""0"" on the dial is aligned with the zero indicator. Blackened Lens Edges Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance. Twin Bias Spring Erector System Extreme Fast-Focus Eyepiece The extreme fast-focus eyepiece ensures a generous eyebox, superior field of view and optimal diopter adjustment in the field. It allows the the user to adjust through the full range of diopter adjustment in one complete turn of the eyepiece. CDS (Custom Dial System) Leupold CDS™ models allow you to quickly dial your elevation to different sight-in ranges with a custom adjustment matched to your specific ballistics information. The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers.Every CDS dial features ¼-MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-2, VX-3, VX-6 and VX-R even more accurate and rugged.How the CDS™ System Works The CDS System works by laser-inscribing your scope's elevation dial to match your load, velocity and conditions. Your scope will be in perfect synch with the way your rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads.Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account: MST (Motion Sensor Technology) An important feature of select Illuminated reticle models is the Leupold-exclusive Motion Sensor Technology (MST). A single touch of the button or twist of the dial activates the illumination, offering several different intensity settings (depending on model) including a high/low indicator (FireDot reticles only). The reticle will automatically switch to “stand-by mode” after five minutes of inactivity, then reactivate whenever the rifle is moved. This eliminates the need for excess movement reaching for buttons, while extending battery life (powered by a readily available CR-2032 coin cell battery.      Low High   Actual Magnification 4.00 x 24.00 x   Linear Field of View (ft/100 yd) 28.00 ft 5.00 ft   Linear Field of View (m/100 m) 9.30 m 1.70 m   Eye Relief (in) N/A 3.70 in   Eye Relief (mm) N/A 94.40 mm       Weight (oz) 24.30 oz   Weight (g) 689.00 g   Objective Clear Aperture (in) 2.05 in   Objective Clear Aperture (mm) 52.00 mm   Elevation Adjustment Range 68.00 moa   Windage Adjustment Range 68.00 moa     UPC: REDACTED29"

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— Mark 4 LR/T 4.5-14x50mm (30mm) M1 Illuminated Front Focal Mil Dot  Matte Illuminated Mil Dot   Mil Dot reticle was designed to help the US Marine Corps estimate distances. It's now standard for all military branches. Range estimating with the Mil Dot reticle: With practice, the Mil Dot system is simple to sue. Dots are spaced in one mil (milliradian) increments on the crosshair. Using the mil formula, the shooter can create a table based on the known size of the object targeted. Just look through the scope, bracket the object between dots, and refer to the table for an estimated distance to the target. Leupold scopes fitted with the Mil Dot reticle include more specific instructions on its use.   Front Focal Plane (FFP)   The reticle magnifies along with the image, so you can estimate range at all magnification settings. These reticles are ideal in tactical situations, yet also provide greater accuracy of range estimation for hunters and target shooters.   Every feature was put in place for one purpose: to help you get the maximum advantage from your rifle, whether you're hunting or in competition. Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— Mark 4 LR/T 6.5-20x50mm (30mm) M1 Mil Dot3  Matte Mil Dot Reticle   Mil Dot reticle was designed to help the US Marine Corps estimate distances. It's now standard for all military branches. Range estimating with the Mil Dot reticle: With practice, the Mil Dot system is simple to sue. Dots are spaced in one mil (milliradian) increments on the crosshair. Using the mil formula, the shooter can create a table based on the known size of the object targeted. Just look through the scope, bracket the object between dots, and refer to the table for an estimated distance to the target. Leupold scopes fitted with the Mil Dot reticle include more specific instructions on its use.   Every component of your Leupold Mark 4 LR/T variable Leupold riflescope is working together to help you make every shot count, whether you're at the range, hunting, or in a tactical environment. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.

266,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5755266,For Sale:   US Night Vision IR Defense Systems IR Hunter Mark II 640x480 Thermal Weapon Sight,"Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska","$ 6,500","Listed On: Monday, September 26, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The IR Hunter Mark II is the perfect thermal weapon sight and with good reason. It is a combination of over 20 years of night vision system design and feedback from the original IR Hunter. This led us to our new improved Mk II version that is only available in 640x480 resolution because we only want to deliver the best to our customers. We chose to upgrade the sensor to the new MicroIR 12um Micron technology that is extremely impressive and also uses less power, which increases battery life. We also decided to combine this new sensor with a Mil-Spec Emagin OLED micro display that delivers a super crisp, sharp image per customer request. We also added a 60hz fast frame rate to every Mk II system at no additional cost. The fast frame rate will be very useful for leading a shot on a fast moving target. Another nice feature of the new Mk II is that the 12um system delivers 35% more magnification than a 17um system. This gives you more magnification for less money out of your pocket which might help explain why the IR Hunter Mk II is the lowest cost 640x480 system on the market today. The IR Hunter Mark II still contains all the features and ergonomics of the original IR Hunter in a sleek package made to securely fit on your rifle. You should find comfort in operating the Turret Knob controls as they are located where you expect them to be, same as your day optics. Button controls are nice, but in the dark, downrange, under fire, your natural instincts will appreciate the IR Hunter's similarity to your day scope. One of the key decisions when buying a thermal weapon sight is whether to get a dedicated scope or Clip-On system. The IR Hunter Mk II allows you to have the best of both worlds. The system works as a Clip-On out of the box with no accessory required on a selection of 1x, 1-4x and 1-6x day optics (ask for approved optics list). Delivering super sharp detailed symbols and reticles combined with our high precision adjusters allows you to simply sight in, and quickly make the ballistic corrections the shot demands. 35mm is 2.5-20x Magnification  Specifications: Sensor Type: Uncooled VOx (Vanadium Oxide) Thermal Sensitivity: <50mk Sensor Resolution: 640x480 Frame Rate: 60hz with a 30hz Power Save Mode Spectral Response: 8 - 12 um Display Type> OLED Display Resolution: 640x480 PixelsBasic Features: E-Zoom, Polarity (optional color) Advanced Features: DCE – Digital Contrast EnhancementETR – Enhanced Target RecognitionStart Up Time: >4 SecondsVideo Output: Analog RS-170 (with Optional Cable)Battery Type: 2 each CR123 3VBattery Life: 3.5 Hours @ 60hz / 5 Hours @ 30hzWeapon Mount: LaRue Tactical QD Rail Mount Reticle: Simple & Complex ReticlesMOA Adjustments Weight 1.5x Model 825 grams2.5x Model 990 gramsDimensions 1.5x Model – 6.5” L x 2.9” H x 3.1” W2.5x Model – 7.4” L x 2.9” H x 3.1” WDiopter: -6 / +4Eye Relief: 27mm Environmental: -40c to +55c Operating -45c to +75c Storage  Warranty: Purchasing this product entitles you to a 3 Year Warranty from the original date of purchase.

282,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5755282,For Sale:  Leupold VX-R 3-9x40mm Ballistic Firedot Illuminated Riflescope,"Coral Springs, Broward, South Florida",$ 549,"Listed On: Monday, September 5, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Price Match! We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.————————      VX-R 3-9x40mm Ballistic Firedot Illuminated Riflescope  Matte Ballistic Firedot Illuminated Reticle When you combine a state of the art illumination system with the exclusive FireDot Reticle you get the VX-R only from Leupold, America's Optics Authority. Quantum Optical System   Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold's newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max design software and evaluation using Leupold's Zygo Interferometer to minimize wave front error and increase resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk Leupold's when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.   Index Matched Lens System   A Leupold exclusive, this system has nearly perfected Leupold's already impeccable light management. Leupold engineers specify different coating materials for each lens surface in the riflescope, based on the lens index of refraction, placement and function, layering each coating to eliminate reflections and maximize light transmission. The result is unparalleled brightness and extremely sharp resolution across the entire visual field.   DiamondCoat   This coating on the exterior lenses gives you the ultimate in abrasion resistance and light transmission. The result is a flawless sight picture over a lifetime of hard use. DiamondCoat has made a difference in battle; now it can make a difference where you hunt.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature Leupold's exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside Leopold's scope even more than Leupold's proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set Leupold's.   Lead Free   Leupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get Leopold's eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   FireDot Illumination   Select models are available with Leupold's exclusive FireDot Reticle System in Leopold's choice of FireDot Duplex, FireDot Circle, Ballistic FireDot, FireDot LR Duplex, FireDot 4, FireDot Pig Plex, FireDot TMR and FireDot SPR. Once activated, the dot within the reticle illuminates with bright, sharp definition, while the rest of the reticle is non-illuminated. This combination leads Leopold's eye naturally to the center aiming point and makes target acquisition quick, precise, and simple.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System One Turn, Extended Range Focus   The one-turn, non-locking eyepiece accommodates a wider spectrum of visual acuity, even in diminishing light. Near-sighted, far-sighted, or anywhere in between, adjusting the focus of the reticle is smooth, fast, and precise. An Alumina rubber eyepiece guard is included with select models.   3:1 Zoom Ratio MST (Motion Sensor Technology)   An important feature of select Illuminated reticle models is the Leupold-exclusive Motion Sensor Technology (MST). A single touch of the button or twist of the dial activates the illumination, offering several different intensity settings (depending on model) including a high/low indicator (FireDot reticles only). The reticle will automatically switch to 'stand-by mode after five minutes of inactivity, then reactivate whenever the rifle is moved. This eliminates the need for excess movement reaching for buttons, while extending battery life (weed by a readily available CR-2032 coin cell battery.   1/4 MOA Finger Click   Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments 1 cm per click).

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.————————      Mark 6 1-6x20mm (34mm) M6C1 The all-new Mark 6 1-6x20mm scope was engineered based on the years of elite riflescope making expertise in order to deliver relevant performance features to competition shooters and tactical operators in mid-range to CQB scenarios. Built around a rugged, ultra-bright daylight visible illumination system, the Mark 6 1-6x20mm offers a true both eyes open situational awareness at 1x, while also offering the ability to identify and engage targets out to several hundred meters at high magnification. Several notable mechanical/optical advances include the new low-profile, mil-based ZeroLock™ windage and tactical features that are common throughout Leupold’s Tactical product line. Hands down, the most commonly used phrase we hear from tactical end users is, “smaller, lighter, faster” when describing the perfect optic. Leupold Tactical Optics; we listened. And delivered. elevation dials to prevent unintentional adjustment in the field and caliber-specific front focal plane reticles.  Matte IlluminatedCMR-W 5.56Reticle   The CM-RW reticle is a natural progression of the very popular CM-R² reticle featuring the inclusion of wind holds, as well as additional ranging features. The CM-RW reticle is comprised of a 0.5 MOA center dot surrounded by a 5.0 MOA inverted horseshoe for a perfect combination of precision and speed. There are two versions of the CM-RW available. One representing 5.56/.223 class ballistics, and one representing 7.62/.308 class ballistics. The two MIL scales built into the reticle design - hash marks on the horizontal stadia and the vertical scale on the left side above the main horizontal line - can be used for both calculating distances and measuring objects downrange. The tic marks on the vertical stadia serve a dual purpose, allowing the user to quickly estimate the distance to 18” targets while serving as precise holdover points for targets between 300 and 1200 (900 for 5.56/.223) meters. The horizontal bars down the left side of the reticle are also 18 long at the distance indicated, and additionally there are 4x4 squares located 12 above this horizontal line to allow for additional range   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold’s index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   Front Focal Plane (FFP)  The reticle magnifies along with the image, so you can estimate range at all magnification settings. These reticles are ideal in tactical situations, yet also provide greater accuracy of range estimation for hunters and target shooters.

335,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5755335,For Sale:  Leupold Mark 4 LR/T 8.5-25x50mm,"Coral Springs, Broward, South Florida","$ 1,350","Listed On: Monday, September 5, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Price Match! We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— Mark 4 LR/T 8.5-25x50mm (30mm) M1 Illuminated Tactical Milling  Matte Illuminated Tactical Milling Reticle   The Tactical Milling Reticle expands on existing Mil Dot reticles by using various sized and spaced hash marks on the vertical and horizontal stadia for increased ranging precision, accuracy, and quick one-meter range estimating reference point. All Mil Dot calculations are TMR compatible. To use the system, simply determine the range to the target using the mil system, then use the corresponding aiming point that is matched to your cartridge to engage the target.   Leupold Mark 4 riflescopes are built to a higher standard. In fact, Leupold build them like our lives depend on them, because Leupold know yours will. Incredible accuracy. Impeccable optical quality. Outstanding ruggedness and absolute waterproof integrity. Leupold Mark 4 riflescopes excel in even the worst conditions, including the rigors of competition and hunting. Every component of your Leupold Mark 4 LR/T variable Leupold riflescope is working together to help you make every shot count, whether you're at the range, hunting, or in a tactical environment. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— Mark 4 ER/T 6.5-20x50mm (34mm) Front Focal Tactical Milling M5A2 Locking Adjustment   Description:  Matte Tactical Milling Reticle   The Tactical Milling Reticle expands on existing Mil Dot reticles by using various sized and spaced hash marks on the vertical and horizontal stadia for increased ranging precision, accuracy, and quick one-meter range estimating reference point. All Mil Dot calculations are TMR compatible. To use the system, simply determine the range to the target using the mil system, then use the corresponding aiming point that is matched to your cartridge to engage the target.   Front Focal Plane (FFP)   Every feature was put in place for one purpose: to help you get the maximum advantage from your rifle, whether you're hunting or in competition   Designed and engineered with the military sniper in mind, Leupold quickly responded to the need for a second generation of precision long-range riflescopes with the Mark 4 Extended Range/Tactical. Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.

You get virtually every feature you can imagine—legendary ruggedness, stunning optics, and a huge 6x zoom ratio that shortens the distance to your next trophy. With a VX-6 atop your favorite rifle, the advantage is all yours. Quantum Optical System  The Quantum Optical System is a new way of thinking about optical system design and is a significant leap forward in performance. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout—the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max® design software and evaluation using Leupold’s Zygo® Interferometer to minimize wave front error and increase resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt—from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity—all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.  Xtended Twilight Lens System  Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System™.

432,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5755432,For Sale:  Leupold VX-6 3-18x50mm,"Coral Springs, Broward, South Florida","$ 1,499","Listed On: Monday, September 5, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Price Match! We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— VX-6 3-18x50mm (30mm) Side Focus CDS Illuminated Leupold's VX-6 takes all the advantages of our Quantum Optical System and multiplies it times six. You get virtually every feature you can imagine—legendary ruggedness, stunning optics, and a huge 6x zoom ratio that shortens the distance to your next trophy. With a VX-6 atop your favorite rifle, the advantage is all yours.  Matte Illuminated Boone & Crockett Reticle  Leupold worked closely with the Boone and Crockett Club to create the first optical product to bear the Club's name. With practice it will hone your long-range shooting skills, rpoviding precise aiming points for easy-to-remember range increments as well as wind deflections   Quantum Optical System   Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold’s newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System™ is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout—the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max® design software and evaluation usingLeupold’s Zygo® Interferometer to minimize wave front error andincrease resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt—from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity—all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold’s index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Lead Free   Leupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction.   6:1 Zoom Ratio   A powerful 6:1 zoom ratio delivers crystal clear images from edge-to-edge throughout the entire magnification range. Many higher power scopes provide the best picture at each end of the zoom ratio, leaving the middle ranges weaker on clarity and resolution. The Leupold 6X erector system was engineered from the outset to provide consistently exceptional image quality across the entire visual field throughtout the entire zoom range. Twin Bias Spring Erector System features berylium/copper alloy leaf springs and 30% more holding force to withstand the most intense recoil and abuse.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Pop-Up Rezero Adjustments   Pop-up re-zero finger click windage and elevation adjustments assure maximum adjustment range, precision and insant re-zeroing. The adjustment dials can be repositioned to align with the marked zero indicator of the adjustment without changing the adjustment setting of the scope. This allows the shooter to know the original zero of the rifle in the event that further adjustments are made in the field. To reset the zero simply lift the dial and rotate it until the 0 on the dial is aligned with the zero indicator.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Extreme Fast-Focus Eyepiece   The extreme fast-focus eyepiece ensures a generous eyebox, superior field of view and optimal diopter adjustment in the field. It allows the the user to adjust through the full range of diopter adjustment in one complete turn of the eyepiece.   CDS (Custom Dial System)   Leupold CDS models allow you to quickly dial your elevation to different sight-in ranges with a custom adjustment matched to your specific ballistics information. The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers. Every CDS dial features ¼-MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-2, VX-3, VX-6 and VX-R even more accurate and rugged. How the CDS System Works The CDS System works by laser-inscribing your scope's elevation dial to match your load, velocity and conditions. Your scope will be in perfect synch with the way your rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads. Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account:   MST (Motion Sensor Technology)   An important feature of select Illuminated reticle models is the Leupold-exclusive Motion Sensor Technology (MST). A single touch of the button or twist of the dial activates the illumination, offering several different intensity settings (depending on model) including a high/low indicator (FireDot reticles only). The reticle will automatically switch to “stand-by mode” after five minutes of inactivity, then reactivate whenever the rifle is moved. This eliminates the need for excess movement reaching for buttons, while extending battery life (powered by a readily available CR-2032 coin cell battery.   1/4 MOA Finger Click   Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (¼-MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments – 1 cm per click).

The surface metal shows very little wear and the roll marks are all crystal clear and deep, including the Colt Logo in the upper left side of the slide. This pistol is a prime candidate to be stripped and professionally re-blued. This decision will depend if you’re a collector or investor.   The grips are in excellent condition along with the original magazine. This Type II was only manufactured from 1908 thru 1910 with the only change from the Type I being the 3 3/4"" barrel as opposed to the 4"" barrel on the Type I. (The Type II is more difficult to come by than the Type I, III and IV due to the fact they were only manufactured for only a few years.) In the year 1911, the Colt Hammerless 1903's barrel bushing was discontinued and incorporated into the slide. Colt discontinued manufacturing the 1903 Colt Hammerless in 1945.   Asking Price: $640.00"

Awesome conceal carry piece. This has been my favorite carry gun. The 32 acp round has plenty of power with hardly any recoil. This is a great piece for the lady's who are sensitive to recoil. Also great for anyone who has trouble racking the slide. This model has the tip up barrel to load the first round. So there's no need to rack the slide! Also this gun fires in double action and single action! And is equipped with a thumb safety for safe carry locked and loaded, hammer up or down! The original blued tomcats had issues with cracking. This was NOT an issue with the much stronger stainless INOX model. This package will include a beautiful set of Beretta walnut grips, a very nice upgrade over the factory plastic grips. 3 factory 7 round magazines all fitted with Pearce pinky extensions to give you a full grip. A like new condition ankle holster. Also included is around 600 rounds of factory new ammo! And not just fmj! Half the ammo is hollow points! You're getting everything pictured for $600!  Please keep in mind this includes well over 200 dollars worth of ammo alone. The extra mags and walnut grips were over 100 bucks too! So you're basically getting this very rare Beretta for like 300 if you buy the whole package! I'd consider selling the ammo and gun separately but I'd rather keep everything together. Not interested in trades at this time unless it's something very much in my favor. I'm only selling to payoff a gun I have on layaway. This gun is an excellent shooter. I've put over 500 rounds through this gun and have only had 2 failures. And I believe those were caused by me and not the gun. I completely trust this gun's reliability. And it is super accurate considering how short the barrel is. This gun is the ultimate in concealability. This is the gun I carry when I can't carry. It doesn't show at all! So let's sum up:Rare stainless, sa/da with safety, tip up barrel for no racking, easy to conceal carry and shoot, wood grips, 3 mags, holster and enough ammo to keep you shooting a long time!This is a great deal! Don't miss out! Foid, ISP check and wait period required. Text me REDACTED"

It is a very accurate rifle. It will need sighted in again since I recently removed the scope to fire at the range through the iron sights. Very nice condition.

Ran two mags through it, had it cerakoted and it has since just sat in the safe and looked pretty. Why? I bought another Glock 19 to carry and thus, I don't need two. Inlay was done using Forster Gold Inlay kit, not cheap model paint. Comes with three mags and the stuff it came with from the factory. Light is a TLR-4 flashlight and red laser combo that works just great. If the deal is right I do have some additional factory Glock mags and 9mm ammo to trade. Long story short, if you're looking for a low round count Glock that has a cool bling factor to it, this one is for you! If you're looking for a Plain Jane factory specimin (which is still awesome and cheaper), this isn't what you want. No hurry to get rid of it. If the right deal doesn't come along I'm happy to keep the safe queen.
Conditions of sale or trade:
1) You must be at least 21 years of age
2) You must have a CURRENT/VALID Minnesota ID and be willing to present it at the time of trade (no exceptions)
3) you must have a CURRENT/VALID MN PTP or PTC and be willing to present it at the time of trade (no exceptions)

Looking mostly for a Marlin 1895 (JM-stamped preferred) or Henry steel big boy but I am open to others.Okay, so I guess I have to put this because some people get pissy when they can't get me to pay over new-retail price for their used guns. I base my offers off of the prices that I see on Bud's Gun Shop (budsgunshop.com). If you paid $700 for a rifle that sells new on Bud's for $500 then I am sorry that you overpaid but that is not going to get me to raise my offer. If the rifle is $500 new then I will not offer you $500 for it used. The exception would be a model such as a JM stamped Marlin that has actually gained value since it's purchase. It is a pretty simple concept that some people can't seem to wrap their heads around."

Manufactured for display at the Shot Show a few years ago, this particular model was never offered for public sale. All of the Steyr SSG family of rifles are famous for extreme accuracy. This rifle features a cold-hammer forged heavy barrel measuring 16-1/4"" in length and has a flash hider/brake threaded to the muzzle bringing overall barrel length to 18"". The operation of the bolt is extremely smooth and the trigger breaks clean and crisp. The action features the Safe Bolt System (SBS) with unique 3-position safety. The safety is a thumb operated wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The FIRE mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot, and the first level of SAFE mode disables the firing mechanism while allowing the bolt to be cycled. The second SAFE position locks the bolt, at which point the bolt can be pushed down against the stock, locking the firing pin and firing mechanism out of firing position, allowing safe transportation with a round in the chamber. Simply pressing the safety’s release tab and rolling it forward returns the bolt to either the SAFE or the FIRE position. The receiver is topped with a Picatinny rail for optics mounting. It features a camo finished synthetic stock which is adjustable for LOP using stackable buttplate inserts, is adjustable for drop, and also has an adjustable cheek piece. The detachable synthetic magazine holds ten rounds of .308 Winchester ammunition. It comes with a quickly detachable Harris SL bipod. Overall condition is excellent. There are a couple of marks to the stock on and around the trigger guard but little other wear. The metal finish rates very nearly 100%. The mechanics appear to be in perfect working order and the bore is like new. It appears that this rifle has been little more than test fired. The ""GOD"" Austrian date code on the barrel and receiver indicate the rifle was proof tested in July, 2009. The rifle comes with a black Steyr marked hard case but is without manual or other paperwork. A unique and handy weapon that would be ideal for shorter precision shots and should be readily adaptable to use with a suppressor and subsonic ammo.Buyer pays $20 shipping."
