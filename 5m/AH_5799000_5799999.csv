$800 cash.
Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades considered would be, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns in this order.  A few things I can think of now on trades:  
Stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers, will consider all brands, depending on your value, lower parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  FosTech Echo trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles as well, depending on the value placed on it as I like to build lowers/rifles with quality parts and can do it much cheaper than buying them complete.
Quality stamped AK-47 with side rail for optic mount, preferably with a nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock would be a plus.  I really like the RAS47 models with the nicer trigger groups and Zhukov furniture, but I've read about too many problems with their cast trunnions an bad/faulty rivets.
A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Maybe a quality 9mm or 45ACP pistol with ""arm brace/stabilizer"", ideally a good deal on a Sig MPX Gen 2 with folding arm brace, so I can change out the trigger easily, I like nice triggers, otherwise, I might consider other similar firearms. 
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56, Federal preferred.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifier, maybe two Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle and 1-2 with 7.62x39 reticle or similar 1-6x.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship for $40 more, since it will have to be overnighted to your FFL.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use. The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

Rifle near new condition, very accurate. new barrel for this rifle is $ 900. And you wont see any degrade in accuracy for another 2600 rounds or so with the current one, as long as you treat it with respect. I might add you will need to be on top of your game to notice anything at that point. Rifle is equipped with the AI SAS muzzle break which reduces recoil to that of a .308 Win."

I don’t like striker-fired pistols, but out of curiosity took it to the range and fired 175 rounds of FMJ and 25 rounds of Hornady XTP hollow points (124-grain), with zero problems. Typical striker-fired trigger (which I don’t care for), but it is a great size for carry. The textured grip is excellent, and it has 3-dot sights with a big orange front sight which is very easy to pick up. The barrel is 3.2” long, and dimensions are: 6.2”L x 4.6”H x 0.96”W (height is 5.2” with the 8-rd mag). It weighs 22 ounces, which helps makes recoil softer than the Shield. Nothing but outstanding reviews on-line for this pistol, and if you like striker-fired guns, you’ll really like this one; it’s just not for me.

This one's a real gem:  a truly mint condition example, completely original finish, all original parts with matching serial numbers,  genuine 1993 West German manufactured  Sig Sauer P228 in 9mm. Impressed date stamp ""KD"" denotes a 1993 manufacture date, as does the corresponding serial number beginning with  ""B 191.""  It has the impressed Kiev Germany proofmarks along with the German Federal Eagle surmounted above the ""N.""  It comes with the original owners manual  and cardboard sales box which also contains the matching serial # for the gun.  I also have the two original Sig Sauer mags it came with, along with some of those 9mm ""Black Talons""  that were controversial at that time in the early 90's, that also help unofficially date the gun.   But I am the original purchaser,  the only owner, and the only person who has ever even handled this firearm since its acquisition by me 23 years ago, so I know its provenance completely without any gaps or questions about its history whatsoever.  I purchased it in late 1993 in Orlando Florida. It was one of my very first semi-auto handguns, but at that time I was totally new to the gun world, and so I bought a lot of different guns at that time.  As I got more immersed into shooting sports and tried lots of different things,  I very quickly became a Glock admirer for personal carry (sorry, some  people just like that low bore axis), and this gun, after being shot no more than 3 or 4 times at the range in the first month or two I had it, quickly became an ""inside-the- desk drawer- gun,"" and has remained that way for the last 20 plus years.  That's why it's so pristine:  It has no holster wear bc it was never holstered, the only barely visible wear it does have, are some very, very light and faint mini-scratches just from being picked up and put back in the drawer every now and then, and from being moved when I simply moved to different cities over my life .  But from the 3 or 4 times it may have been shot over twenty years ago, I doubt I put more than 200- 400 rounds in it total, so it has an extremely low round count.  It's still flawless, I just tested it recently with a new mag prior to placing this ad.  It is almost quite literally a gun that has been time capsuled for over 20 years.  I have more photos but apparently Armslist only lets you upload a single photo, so people who are serious potential purchasers may ask me to send extra pics directly to you"

I bought this rifle earlier this year and it has less than 100 rounds thru it. It will come with the box and everything that comes with it when bought new. I had zero malfunctions when I shot it using several types of ammo.
I am only selling it to help fund a M1A
These sell for $700 with one magazine plus shipping and transfer fee when you can find them in stock. I’m asking for $650 with 6 or 7 mags. I’m not sure how many I have.
You must be an Alabama resident and over 18 to buy this gun. I prefer a fact to face sale but I will ship it to your FFL holder who must accept transfers from an individual.
