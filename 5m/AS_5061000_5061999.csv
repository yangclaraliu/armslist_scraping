It features a matched Yankee Hill upper, lower, and 14.7"" diamond fluted barrel with a pinned and welded phantom muzzle break. The barrel has a 1:7"" twist rate and a free-float spectre length handguard with a spectre gas block and black gas tube. The rifle has a Norgon ambidextrous mag release, Seekins Precision bolt release and mag release, Ergo Suregrip Tactical Deluxe, Magpul ASAP plate, and Ace Ltd. adjustable M4 SOCOM stock. It also has a FailZero nickel boron BCG, Rainier Arms Raptor (by AXTS) charging handle, BAD Ambi-Safety Selector, ""Molon Labe"" dust cover (with a black spring) YHM EZ-Pull takedown pins, Spike's Tactical heavy buffer, and an LWRCI single stage combat trigger with a 5.5 lb. pull. The forend features a Magpul rail sling attachment point, Magpul ladder rail covers, and a CQD aluminum vertical grip with a cutout for a pressure switch. The optic is a Burris MTAC 1.5-6x scope with an illuminated reticle on a Burris PEPR QD base. Even the springs on this rifle are quality made in America springs. I did not skimp in any way, shape, or form on this build. I had NEVER planned on selling this rifle, but I found a girl that I love more than this rifle and I need the money to help pay for an engagement ring. The rifle has a couple dings on it, but it still has less than one hundred rounds fired out of it. This rifle is still not even close to being out of its break-in period. I'm including five mags, two hundred rounds of assorted ammo, lock, and a hard case. Price is firm at $3,000. I realize that the asking price is high, but this rifle is worth $3,500. I am not interested in trades at this time. I'd prefer to sell to a CWP holder. Thanks for looking."

Pistol wears an aftermarket OD green finish, which I do not know exactly the composition other than it was ""baked on"". There is also some skateboard grip tape attached to the gun, which was done also by the original owner. The pistol functions flawlessly, but does have 2 cosmetic issues to note. First, on the left side of the slide, the screw that holds the safety on is cracked. It can easily be replaced but I never got around to it. Second, as seen in the pictures, the hammer is slightly bent to the left, which I assume is from being dropped (I didn't do it). There are no dings or dents though. It is in very good condition otherwise. Comes with 2 mags, case, and cleaning tool. I am asking $1100 OBO. More pics available upon request"

This is a custom AR-15 (5.56 NATO and .223) that is USED, but in like new condition. It shows some basic signs ofwear and tear, but nothing that isn't purely cosmetic and easily remedied. I have fired less than 500 rounds through this rifle since I got it. When I bought the rifle, it was a very standard AR-15. I have added a lot of time and energy into modifying it. I am selling it because, unfortunately, I ended up wanting a different configuration. The rifle has been tested in its current configuration that you see and works flawlessly. I have nothad a single malfunction. Note that because the M4 profile barrel, this is a HEAVIER rifle. If you are looking for something lightweight, this isn't for you.  
Specs are as follows:   
Upper and lower are from Terminal Performance, a small VA based manufacturer.  
Standard milspec BCG, charging handle (with extension), trigger group, buffer, buffer spring, and receiver parts kits.     
UTG milspec 6 position buffer tube.    
LMT SOPMOD stock.   
Magpul MIAD grip (comes with extra grip options), and Magpul extended trigger guard.  
Magpul MBUS Gen 2 back up sights.  
16"" Doublestar M4 profile, chrome lined barrel with 1/7 twist rate and low profile gas block.  
Troy Industries Medieval flash hider.   
Midwest Industries Gen 2 mid length freefloat handguard (10"").   
Magpul sling attachment.    
Magpul rail covers.   
Magpul verticle foregrip.    
Green laser sight.    
The rifle does NOT come with magazines.    
 
The price is the price and I am not willing to bargain down. All sales are final and no returns or exchanges will be accepted after the sale. Buyers must be VA residents and willing to meet me in a place that is convenient for both of us in the Northern VA area. All buyers must show ID, and have either a valid conceal carry permit from any state, or some sort of paperwork demonstrating good behavior (military ID, DoD/DHS CAC, LEO ID, etc), or must submit to a background check via NICS if they do not have any of those documents.

Gun was only shot once by my wife and is in new condition with original box and 1 magazine. I live on Fort Hood but can meet near the killeen area. Price is $315. Must be willing to sign bill of sale and provide TX ID or CHL.The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement."

It has a little minor scuff on the butt of the gun, but it's really unnoticable. Other than that, the gun is in great shape. Comes with two magazines.  PRODUCT DESCRIPTION The CZ 75 B Stainless is the first stainless steel firearm to bear the CZ name. With the exception of an ambidextrous manual safety and rubber grips, the stainless version is functionally identical to the CZ 75 B. The only difference is an improvement in corrosion resistance, though many will argue that there is an improvement in appearance as well. CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol. All steel construction (except alloy framed compacts) High capacity double column magazines Hammer forged barrels Ergonomic grip and controls Unparalleled accuracy Slide-in-frame design for better recoil control 3 dot sighting system (Tritium night sights available) Smooth double action and crisp single action Extended service life due to advanced design and superior materials Firing pin block safety Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.     SPECIFICATIONS Product Name CZ 75 B Matte Stainless – 9mm  SKU 91128  Firearm Type Handgun  MSRP $783.00  Chambering 9mm Luger  Magazine Capacity 16  Magazine Type Double Stack  Frame Matte Stainless Steel  Grips Rubber  Trigger Mech DA/SA  Sights Fixed Three-Dot  Barrel Cold Hammer Forged  Barrel Length 4.6 in  Weight 2.31 lbs  Overall Length 8.1 in  Height 5.4 in  Width 1.4 in  Safety Manual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety"

This gun is beautiful and has not been fired. From the website:In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise."

It’s easy to appreciate so much for so little. The Thunder .380 has earned a worldwide reputation of quality and is truly one of the best performance-for-price buys on the market. It’s lightweight, small-frame and ideal capacity combines with Bersa’s time-tested reliability and accuracy to make the Thunder .380 an excellent choice for personal protection. The Thunder 380 has a light aluminum alloy frame that reduces weight for easier carry, yet the pistol still retains enough mass (weight) to help tame recoil. Due to the small frame, the pistol is very well suited for female firers, and males with smaller hands. The magazines, however are designed with an extra section of grip, so that all fingers of the firing hand are accommodated. The blowback, fixed-barrel design theoretically aids accuracy, and it appears that the vast majority of Thunder 380 users report favorably on that issue. The nearly straight-in alignment of the chamber and the topmost cartridge in the magazine seems to be responsible for the pistol's reliable chambering and cycling. The frame features a long rearward tang over the grips, which effectively protects the shooter's thumb web from hammer-bite or slide-bite. There are several safety features built into the Thunder 380: a slide mounted manual safety and decocker that blocks the hammer, a magazine disconnect safety that prevents firing if a magazine is not inserted, a long double-action (DA) first trigger pull, an inertial firing pin, and (in some models) an integral key-operated trigger lock.  $275 firm.

It is virtually identical to the A-5 but lacks the magazine cutoff and has a locking shell carrier. (The bolt release button must be depressed to allow shells to be loaded into the magazine.) They came in 12 gauge only with various barrel lengths and chock offerings. Some were made with 20"" cylinder bore barrels for riot guns. During WWII the US Army Air Forces bought a large number of these guns which were used by bomber crew gunners for practice (shooting clay targets from moving platforms) and by security forces in the riot version. There is some evidence that they were also available to bomber crews for recreation.720's show up occassionally that have the US parkings and proof markings on them while others do not. Because of their age and their influx to the civilian market following the war some of these guns have various after-market modifications, especially the Poly Choke. Magazine capacity is four and with one in the chamber this gun will hold five 2 3/4"" 12 gauge shells. A plug in the magazine will reduce total capacity to 3 to comply with various state and Federal regulations.I'm asking for 400 obo"

It is a great gun but it was an impulse buy. The gun is in EXCELLENT shape and obviously comes with both barrels both have the fiber optic sights from the factory and the slug barrel is rifled. I will include a box of Magnm slugs (3"") and a box of shells (3""). Any questions please feel free to email, text or call. $595/OBO 708/721-3734 or ask for DanThe 935 Combo offerers a Turkey/Deer combo and a Waterfowl/Turkey combo. The barrels for the turkey and waterfowl shotgun are overbored to 10 gauge bore dimensions. Unlike other backbored brand barrels, this unique design spans the entire length of the barrel, providing a gas ''cushion'' for the shot charge. Not only does overboring reduce felt recoil, it also reduces pellet deformation and internal barrel friction, resulting in the exceptionally uniform, dense shot patterns for which Mossberg overbored shotguns are renowned. Both combos are finished in Mossy Oak Infinity, one has a 24'' fully-rifled Slugster barrel and 24'' Overbored Turkey Barrel, and the other has a 28'' and a 24'' Overbored barrels. Both combo feature fiber optic sights."
