On the other side it simply has the nazi eagle and letter N stamped into the slide and frame along with the serial number. I have tried to research the pistol and it seems like the serial number is one before the factory was captured leading me to believe it was taken from a soldier. I just came into possession of the gun in a trade not knowing what it was. I am open to trade offers. The grip on the opposite side was broken so I ordered a replacement set for the gun. I'm located in Corbin KY but often in Lexington. U can text or call me at REDACTED. Thanks
