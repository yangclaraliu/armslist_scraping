It has the Boone & Crockett reticle. It also has a oversized bolt knob a friend made for me but it included the factory standard knob as well.Also included is the bipod shown in the picture. For Sale $1200 cash, or $1700 with the Leupold instead of the Vortex. I will also entertain trades for higher end firearms like Dan Wesson, CZ, higher end bolt guns, and possibly high end optics. Located in the Knoxville/Fountain City Area but willing to travel a reasonable distance for the right offer."

Lorcin .380 - I cleaned it up and threw some paint on it last year. I believe they call it ""polishing up a turd"" but it was looking rough, so I did it. It is picky with cheaper ammo, but I don't have issues with the white box Winchester 95 grain. Comes with a few extra magazines."

Some trades will need boot on my end, some will on yours. Mainly looking for cash though, so trade will have to be really worth it. Pickup in Norman only. Thanks for looking and happy hunting."

This will be clear when you inspect the rifle in a variety of areas like the hammer, shell deflector and bolt carrier group.  The Colt was taken out of the safe a couple of times a year to ensure it was wet and put right back.  Even though the windage and elevation are set on mechanical zero I was able to take it to the range the week of July 4 and shoot 5 @ 100 to 8"" offhand.  Obviously for optimal accuracy you will need to take the time to dial it in to a zero distance of your choice with appropriate elevation/windage changes.  Brought it home and gave it a thorough cleaning and it's ready to go to work for it's new owner.   *20"" heavy barrel, 1 in 9 twist for .223/5.56.  For those not into the geekery of ballistics the twist rate might not mean much to you.  The slower the twist rate and longer the barrel the lighter the bullet for best accuracy.  Ideal for a 20"" 1 in 9 is a 55g, but of course you can shoot whatever .223/5.56 cartridge you like.  Compare this to say a 16"" barrel 1 in 7 which is better suited for a 62g/75g.  *Non-removable carry handle and the A2 buttstock even has the neat old school field kit compartment.  Colt factory A2 battle sights which were built around the Marine's 300 yard BZO protocol(8/3), but can be adjusted to accomodate any zero distance you like.*3 brand new Magpul 30 round magazines with dust covers(only 1 is pictured the others are in a storage case) and even an old Colt factory 8 round alloy mag.  The Colt mag is especially handy if you do any bench shooting off the older model Lead Sleds which don't allow for hi capacity mags to sit AR/M4 designs aligned.  *Uncle Mikes soft case with 5 external mag pouches, open pocket center slot and a forward velcro closed compartment.   Carry handle and shoulder strap.*Barska carry handle scope 4x20 with BDC out to 500 yards.  Brand new and obviously never sighted in.  This scope has a mount which allows you to maintain use of the irons even with the scope mounted which is quite ingenious.  Focus adjustment on eyepiece and BDC turret with additional windage and elevation turrets.  The box and materials have a mil-dot card, lens cap covers on bungee, lens cloth and sighting instructions.*2 different slings:  A brand new Condor Speedy 2 point with adjustable web and a standard 51"" USGI carry sling with metal hardware(shown mounted on rifle pictures) so plenty of options to fulfill your offhand shooting nuances.  *Not pictured, but included is a spring loaded bipod that lightly clamps to the barrel which is nice if you need a make shift shooting rest on the go.  Fits perfectly in the front velcro pouch of the soft case."

Trijicon suppressor night sights co-witness the RMR.  Trigger is a Suarez International with polished trigger bar, lone wolf stainless striker block, competition striker spring with an approximate pull weight of 2.5 lbs! Has Talon rubber texture grips and 4 mags. It's not a must sell but cash for my current project would help. It's a superb pistol with the RMR and the Lone Wolf slide is flawless and also has front slide serrations."

Despite initial resistance from the market to accept a ""plastic gun"" due to durability and reliability concerns, and fears that the pistol would be ""invisible"" to metal detectors in airports, Glock pistols have become the company's most profitable line of products, commanding 65% of the market share of handguns for United States law enforcement agencies as well as supplying numerous national armed forces and security agencies worldwide. Glocks are also popular weapons amongst civilians for home/self defense and concealed/open carry.The company's founder, engineer Gaston Glock, had no experience with firearm design or manufacture at the time their first pistol, the Glock 17, was being prototyped. Glock did, however, have extensive experience in advanced synthetic polymers, knowledge of which was instrumental in the company's design of the first commercially successful line of pistols with a polymer frame. Glock introduced ferritic nitrocarburizing into the firearms industry as an anti-corrosion surface treatment for metal gun parts.The Glock 19 is effectively a reduced-size Glock 17, called the ""Compact"" by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19 has a barrel and pistol grip that are shorter by approximately 12 mm (0.5 in) compared to the Glock 17 and uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, with available capacities of 10, 17, 19, and 33 rounds. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, the mass of the slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, locking block, recoil spring, guide rod, and slide lock spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19.Features:Length: 185 Mm / 7.28 In.Width: 30.00 Mm / 1.18 In.Length Between Sights: 153 Mm / 6.02 In.Height: 127 Mm / 4.99 In.Barrel Height: 32 Mm / 1.26 In.Barrel Length: 102 Mm / 4.01 In.Unloaded: 670 G / 23.65 Oz.Glock 19 FS 9mm Gen4Speed Loader All BlackLoaded: 855 G / 30.18 Oz.Trigger Pull: 2.5 Kg / 5.5 Lbs.Trigger Travel: 12.5 Mm / 0.49 In.Barrel Rifling: Right Hand, HexagonalLength Of Twist:2 50 Mm / 9.84 In.Standard: 15Optional: 17/33 includes three 15 Round Mags4 Backstraps Lock"

The foregrip is made by ATI. Only selling this because I bought a pistol and need the cash to recoup the cost. I've owned this shotgun for approx. 8 years, only took it to the range once, and have kept it oiled and in good shape since. Asking $300 OBO. Will drive up to 10 min from 44039 to meet.

I just got it from the original owner, and it's a fantastic build. But I can't help thinking that I'm not really going to have a ton of use for the .460 and will mostly be shooting this pistol in .45, so why not offer this up to someone else who will. 
 
Kimber Custom II in .460 Rowland Pistol began life as a stock Kimber Custom II. The pistol was sent to Master Gunsmith Bobby Pritchford of Pritchford Custom Gunworks. The slide was milled to accept a Kensights adjustable rear sight with Trijicon lamps. A Kensights Trijicon front sight was installed. The Slide was re-blued and pistol was polished. A set of Magpul 1911 Grips were installed. Then a Clark Guns .460 Rowland barrel with compensator was hand fitted to the pistol. Both .45 ACP barrel and the .460 Rowland barrel were throated and polished The feed ramp on the pistol was polished. I have PDF invoices for all the custom work. Pistol will include the .45 ACP barrel, the .460 Rigby barrel and 250 rounds of Underwood Ammo .460 Rowland. The 230 gr kicks out at 1400 fps and the 185 gr at 1575 fps.
 Just to be clear since everyone has asked, you DO get BOTH barrels. The original .45 ACP barrel has been throated and polished and is included with the sale. 
Total Breakdown: Kimber Custom II - $800
Clark Custom Guns .460 Rowland Kit - $300
Kensights Front and Rear - $200
Magpul Grips - $20
Custom work - $800

The Beretta 92 pistol evolved from earlier Beretta designs, most notably the M1922 and M1951. From the M1922 comes the open slide design, while the alloy frame and locking block barrel were first used in the M1951. The grip angle and the front sight integrated with the slide were also common to earlier Beretta pistols. The Beretta 92 first appeared in 1975, the FS has an enlarged hammer pin that fits into a groove on the underside of the slide. Overall condition of this firearm, based on Blue Book of Gun Values guidelines, is 87%."
