I took it to the range where I shot it no more than 50 times. Function was perfect. It has been packed away ever since and is in excellent condition. Before packing it up I took off the grips to clean and lube inside. I slightly marred the grip screw on one side which can be replaced. I also very gently polished the feed ramp as I had heard that some HP rounds didn’t want to feed perfectly, and polishing was recommended. The mags fit tightly in this model. Sig discontinued the P230 about 2005. Thus it is valued by collectors for its relative rarity, especially one in pristine condition. Original box, manual and two mags are included. Recently, a well worn P230 in SS sold on Gun Broker for $660. Buyer should have a valid TN Handgun Permit."

In pristine, like new condition- fired at range day purchased, cleaned, & temperature controlled safe kept. The Nighthawk Custom Pistol soft carrying case/rug has eight inner pockets for the magazines, two large pockets behind the magazine holder, and one large zippered pocket on the outside to hold a couple of boxes of ammunition.Nighthawk Falcon- the newest edition to our custom line of firearms, the Falcon has already set a sales record since its premier at the 2011 SHOT. It's easy to see why when you look at the sleek lines, as well as the practical features which make it a formidable fighting weapon.One of the new features includes the introduction of our new one-piece fully machined mainspring / magwell combination cut from a 2 ½"" block of tool steel. Rather than coming to a sharp point at the base of the grip, the integrated mainspring housing / magwell is rounded for comfort while not sacrificing any grip length. It assists in reducing print thru clothing while carrying concealed. You will not find a stronger part.Sights are the new Heinie Ledge which allows the rear sight to be used to cycle the slide with one hand should the need arise.Three ball-radius cuts run the full length of the slide top to direct your eyes quickly to the front sight.Rear cocking serrations are a series of eight ball radius cuts per side instead of our normal serration pattern. Rear of the slide is hand-serrated at 40lpi which matches the rear of the Heinie Ledge Sight. Barrel bushing is an extra thick variety which is chamfered around the edges. Front of the slide has been recessed where the front cocking serrations would normally be and the barrel crowned to complete the custom look."

Final price reduction!! This is the Standard Model M1A with 20” GI barrel dropped into the Sage EBR Mod 0 stock. This is the rock solid setup that the U.S Military used to repurpose many of the M14 rifles that were in storage and bring them up to a modern platform with increased accuracy.This M1A EBR features an adjustable stock and adjustable cheekpiece, pistol grip, and plenty of picatinny rail space for added gear. Included with the stock is the Sage Detachable Cantilever Sight Base (DCSB) that provides an absolute rock steady solution for mounting a scope to the rifle. (The scope pictured is also included with the sale). The attached scope is a Nikon Monarch 3 4x-16x BDC reticle and has been sighted in at 100 yards.A few internal upgrades to the rifle were also added such as a Sadlak Op Rod Spring Guide and a SEI Muzzle Brake. The combination of the muzzle brake and the EBR stock produces almost no felt recoil and allows for very quick follow up shots. This rifle is very accurate, typically producing 1 MOA goups, and has been my favorite hog hunting rifle. However I am now looking to sell it for my next project.

This is the Montgomery Ward version of the Mossberg 500. Parts are even interechangable with Mossberg.
I'm selling it because every few rounds, the spent shell gets stuck in the barrel and has to be popped out with a flathead screw driver. Not sure if it's an extractor issue or a barrel issue, but I'm not a gunsmith. Also, the stock has a small crack in it and the barrel has had the choke cut off.
This guns has it's usual wear and tear and scatches for its age.
First $100 bill takes it home

Firearms' owner, Fred Hastings to be turned into a competition pistol.  Fred then turned it into the competition pistol that it is today, but it never saw competition.  In fact, Fred never shot it and I ended up with it about a year ago.  The pistol has exactly 300 rounds through it and it's amazing.  Here's the specs of the pistol and what you'll get, if you want it...Here are the pistol details:-Chambered in .45 ACP-5 inch barrel-Full length guide rod-Polymer trigger with adjustable reset-Nighthawk Custom magwell-Slim VZ Alien grips-Slim VZ grip screws-Wilson Combat plunger, slide release and safety-Green fiber optic front sight and adjustable rear target sight-3.04 lb trigger pull-300 rounds through it-OEM wood grips, box, accessories, lock, etc.-One 8 round STI magazine"

Legs and grip are made of tough, injection-molded polymer; steel cross-bolt with easy-grip thumbscrew locks directly to any MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail to ensure a rock-solid fit.

It is about 2 years old and has seen very little use. As a matter of fact it hasn't even left my safe in over a year. Details on rifle are as follows:Stainless RH Model Gunsite Scout .308Redfield Revolution 2-7x33 Scout Scope (USA MADE)(1) AIC Steel 10 round magazine(1) Ruger Polymer 10 round magazine (1) Holfield Adjustable SlingNow onto the package I was referring to. I had a 700 SPS in 308 and a pair of AR10's I use to shoot a lot. As a result, the two semi auto guns used to use a lot of ammo, so I bought a pretty fancy setup to speed the process. This has been setup in my gun room, but just like the scout I haven't even plugged any of it in for over a year.Reloading Setup as follows:RCBS Rock Chucker Single Stage PressRCBS Power Case TrimmerRCBS Chargemaster PRO Powder DispenserRCBS Rapid Prime Universal Hand Priming ToolRCBS .308 Die Set (2)Lee Premium 300 Blackout Die SetLee .45ACP Die Set(3) Shell HoldersDial CalipersReloading ManualsEntire tub of powders for 308/300/45Media Tumbler300-400 FED GMM once fired brass2500 primers for 308Bullet Hammer(300) 165grn SP 308 Projectiles.........the list goes on and on. Basically everything you could ever possibly need to reload. Set this up at your house and go. Ammo Included: 168grn Winchester Ballistic Silvertips, 175grn SMK's, 168grn SMK's, 168 Barnes TTSX AND TSX, 168grn Hornady TAP, 168grn Hornady AMAX, 168 Berger Match VLD, 210grn Hornady AMAX.I am not sure of the exact amount of each type listed above, but all said and done it's about 1000 rounds. Now I'll answer these questions in advance:1. NO, I will not split it up. Again, NO I will not split it up. Again for the third time, I am not splitting it up. The reasoning is simple. I don't use any of it and haven't for over a year. No point in having one and not the other.2. NO, I don't need to sell it. Or trade it. It's not costing me anything to sit around my house. Please keep that in mind when making offers. 3. NO, I will not ship it.Any other questions just ask. I figure the rifle is worth around $1000 the way it sits. And yes I have done the research on them. They are 900 brand new with no glass and no extra parts. The reloading setup is hard to price. I know each one of the 3 main RCBS items were 300, and the powder dispenser was nearly 400 when I bought it. Not to mention all of the dies, tools, chemicals, brass, powder, projectiles, on and on and on.I would say the entire reloading setup is worth $1500 or so. Not to mention all of the premium ammunition that is already finished sitting in my safe.So basically, I am looking at $2500in cash/trade/partial value.I'm easy to deal with, just don't make stupid offers for your Hi-Point or other garbage and we can deal.Someone might as well use it because I am not. Or, it if prices to be too much of a pain, I'll just keep it."
