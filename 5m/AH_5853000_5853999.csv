The Model 110 was designed by Nicholas L. Brewer in 1958 and was patented posthumously in 1963. It has been in continuous production since that time, and with the closing of Winchester's New Haven, Connecticut, plant in 2007, the Model 110 has passed the Winchester Model 70 as the oldest continuously manufactured bolt-action rifle in America. The Model 110 was developed in order to provide the hunting market with a strong and powerful yet light and economical rifle. Its model number is derived from its initial retail price of $109.95. It was originally produced in .30-06 Springfield and .270 Winchester. In 1959 a short-action version was introduced, chambered in .243 Winchester and .308 Winchester and at that same time, the Model 110 was the first commercial bolt-action rifle to be offered with a left-handed bolt.The Model 110 was significantly altered in 1966 in order to improve the design and reduce production costs. This included a new adjustable trigger and a new bolt including a plunger-type ejector passing through the bolt face rather than the magazine-mounted, spring-loaded ejector that was part of Brewer's original design. This new ejector allowed the use of a detachable box magazine, which was also introduced in 1966, along with a hinged floorplate model.When Savage Arms filed for bankruptcy protection in 1988, the company cut its entire product line down to only the most basic Model 110 rifles. The design has since succeeded in bringing the company back to life as one of the top-selling bolt-action rifle makers in the United States. In 1998, Savage re-engineered the short action Model 110 and adopted a new model numbering scheme to differentiate short action models from the long actions. Thus, the short action Model 110 became the Model 10, while the long action model remained the Model 110. The Model 110 is the basis for the entire line Savage centerfire bolt-action rifles, including the Models 11/111, 12, 14/114, 16/116, and Model 210 bolt-action shotgun as well as the Stevens Model 200. The series is available in a wide array of chamberings, from .204 Ruger to .338 Winchester Magnum, in order to suit the needs of almost any shooter. Addressing concerns about what was considered by many to be a weak point of the design, Savage introduced the AccuTrigger for the 110 series in 2003. Those rifles equipped with an AccuTrigger are totally safe and adjustable by the end user through the turning of a single screw, offering a pull weight from one-and-a-half to six pounds. Target and select Varmint model rifles are adjustable down to six ounces."

Since its introduction in 1948, it has been offered in a number of different calibers and barrel lengths, but is commonly chambered in .30-30 Winchester or .35 Remington, using a 20- or 24-inch barrel. Currently, the model with a 24-inch barrel is only available in .30-30 Winchester. The Model 336 is currently produced by Remington Arms.The Model 336 is a direct development of the Marlin Model 1893 rifle which was produced from 1893 to 1936. Based on the patents of L.L. Hepburn, the Model 1893 incorporated a new locking bolt system and a two-piece firing pin. In 1936, with only minor changes to the stock, forearm, and sights, the Model 1893 was redesignated the Model 1936 (soon renamed the Model 36). All of these firearms featured a solid-top receiver made of forged steel and incorporated side ejection of fired cartridges. Compared to the Winchester 94, then the predominant lever-action hunting rifle, the Model 36 was somewhat heavier with a simpler internal mechanism and a full pistol grip-type buttstock in contrast to the Winchester 94's straight grip stock. In 1948, the Model 36 was replaced by the Model 336, which incorporated the patents of Thomas R. Robinson, Jr., a Marlin employee.[2] Sold under both the Marlin and Glenfield brands, the Model 336 has been in continuous production from 1948 to the present day, and is currently produced by Remington Firearms under the Marlin brand. While most current variants of the Model 336 feature a full pistol-grip walnut stock, 20 inch barrel and full length tube magazine, other versions of the 336 have been frequently offered by Marlin over the years, including barrel lengths of 16.25-inch, 18-inch, 22-inch and 24-inch barrels, half-length magazines, and models with straight grips and/or hardwood (birch) stocks."

It is a 2006 stick shift. Has 194xxx on the transmission and body and 94xxx on the engine. a year a half ago I had the engine replaced after snapping the timing. The engine had 80000 miles on it when it was installed. has about 14000 maybe a little more on it now. AAA did the work and replaced the water pump and timing on it when they put it in. also changed the clutch out then as well. It runs smooth and shifts great. The airbag light is on but has been on for a while. It used to be a red car and had the whole thing painted a few years ago to gray. The tires were changed with cooper cs4 touring tires right before the engine was done. AC doesn't work at the moment. Needs charged probably. It used to work. Gets about 35 miles to the gallon on the highway and almost 30 in the city. Was in a small fender bender the other day. Guy hit me. Can be popped out and taillight put back in. Have the light but the outside plastic is cracked. Runs great good commuter car. Text with questions found a new car so want gone. will trade for guns

Marked ""U.S. M14 DMR"" This  type of mount may NOT work well with Scout rifles with a barrel mounted rail without modifications, or removal of the mid rail. The two types of rail placements are meant for two very different systems. The Brookfield type is meant for mid to long range scopes/large objective scopes. The so called SOCOM rails are meant for close range CQB optics, ACOGS, or even pistol scopes. 
 
 
One piece, 8620 steel mount provides a secure, stable scope base that won’t shift between shots. Rock-solid, three-point mounting system attaches to the factory scope mount screw hole in the receiver and the charger guide dovetail, while the setscrew at the front uses the receiver ring as a stop to prevent forward movement. No drilling or tapping required; mounting hardware included. Machined from the same type of steel as the M14 receiver, so mount and receiver expand at the same rate as the gun heats up to help keep your optic zeroed during prolonged fire. Thirteen MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny cross-slots offer plenty of versatility in setting eye relief. Sight channel allows use of iron sights without removing the scope. Cutout above ejection port helps prevent case hangups.
 
 
*Includes all mounting hardware
I wanting to part with these because I have more mounts than needed. Both mounts are identical. As stated above it is a Brookfield type mount with a Picatinny rail, the original Brookfields have a Weaver rail. These Fulton mounts are as solid as the Brookfield and Sadlak mounts which are all the same base design. I have used all the 3 point mount systems in many environments and find they are they most rugged and stable, and still allow use of the M14/M1A outstanding iron sight system. Both mounts are like new in the box, both with very little use and no field wear.Please give advanced notice when planning to purchase as mounts are stowed.M-14, M14 M1A Springfield Armory, Fulton Armory, Sadlak Scope Mount, Brookfield mount, Leatherwood, XM14, M21, XM21, SDM, DMR"

Choose from 44MAG, 45 Colt and 357MAG. All are SASS approved so Cowboy Action shooters who enjoy stepping back to that bygone era can use them in competition. Don’t let the retro look fool you, these rifles are much more than shootin’ irons for today’s new breed of cowboy.They’re also the unbeatable choice of big-game hunters who prefer the traditional look, feel, reliability and accuracy that comes from an authentic Henry rifle. The traditional 20? octagonal barrel is outfitted with a classic fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear sight with a reversible white diamond insert and a brass beaded front sight. The tubular magazine tops off at 10 rounds.Both the straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted of select American walnut accented with a brass barrel band and Henry’s recognizable brass receiver.

Was listed for 960, but I have to let it go at a loss. This is a DMCustom, LIKE-NEW Savage 111 Trophy Hunter that has never been out on the rocks or in the woods, with only one box of Hornady Polymer-Tipped Boat-Tail ammo run through it at the range. It consistently shot .6 MOA groups at Red Castle from a sandbagged rest. The rifle has the flush 3 round mag for hunting that came with it new, and two custom-built 7-Round mags (worth $190 new). There's a thick butt pad to help make the long-range shots hardly even noticeable. The rifle's metal has 4 baked-on coats of an Olive DuraCoat, which I have found to be even more wear-resistant than Cerakote, and the Free-Float Stock is done in a 3-color Camo-Dot Grip-Kote. Other features include a 24"" Free-Floated Medium-Heavy Barrel with a 1:11 twist, and an adjustable 2-stage Savage Accu-Trigger, the standard for long-range shooting. You will receive all the original Savage Arms paperwork with everything mentioned above, in the custom finishes (over $1100 New). You will have the brand and the caliber that Marine and Ranger Operators drool over (without the Armorer's tan distressed look, of course).A Savage custom lined hard case ($129), 6""-9"" 2.4 oz. Ultra-Lite DuraCoated bipod ($89), padded cheek rest wrap ($42), the DuraCoated Nikon Pro-Staff 3-9x40 Target Scope ($167), a Nylon and Leather Padded Sling ($37), and 60 rounds of Remington and Winchester SP and Polymer-Tipped Hunting ammo ($96+) complete a Total Retail Valued package at $1660, which can be yours for $700 Firm--LESS THAN HALF THE RETAIL VALUE. And this gun will shoot tighter groups than any of the $2000 ""sniper"" rifles listed on Armslist. I will not seperate parts of the deal--I have nothing else the items will go on. You save over half and get a complete package to get you hunting (or operating). I must sell it now to afford Christmas for the kids and grandkids. Face-to-Face Cash sales only in the Chelsea to Tulsa area only.

I have this scope on my target AR, and it has treated me well. I am frequently able to shoot 1/2 MOA groups with this scope, and have even approached 1/4 MOA. It's easy to see my .223 holes in the target at 100 yards, and I often end up spotting for other guys at the range who can't see where they are hitting through their scopes. I always baby my equipment, so it looks and performs as new. The scope comes with original box and receipt, so you could take advantage of the lifetime warranty on Simmons scopes if the need ever arises. It also comes with a 4"" sunshade, and lens covers. I also have a butler creek flip up cover for the rear that I will throw in for free because it wont fit my new scope(I'm keeping the front one because it does fit the new scope).I'm pretty firm on the $90, it's a killer scope at that price  I also have the armalite scope mount in the picture for sale separately for $60. Local pickup only, no shipping. Call or text Jared at 937-694-4I79.
