The Oso Sweet features a classic drop-point blade that gives you maximum workaday utility, at the same time, this knife has plenty of style and features that will get it—and you—noticed. First of all, the Oso Sweet opens one-handed with SpeedSafe assisted opening.
Just pull back on the ambidextrous flipper and the blade moves out of the handle ready for use. Whether you’re a left-hander or right-hander, your blade is easy to access and ready to go when you are. Kershaw heat-treats the 8Cr13MoV blade steel to bring out its high-performance characteristics like good edge retention, strength, hardness, and wear resistance.
The handle is glass-filled nylon for excellent durability and incorporates a textured “scale” pattern that gives the Oso Sweet a unique look. A locking liner secures the blade during use and recloses easily for pocket carry or storage. The pocketclip can be reversed for tip-up or tip-down carry. The Oso Sweet is one of our most popular knives."

Only bad thing is a tiny nick on the rear bumper. I'm guessing some A-hole dinged it with a cart at the grocery store but either way it's there and needs to be mentioned. not going to be talked down in price over something like this so if you plan on trying, don't waste your time or mine. I'm selling a $31,000 car thats practically new for a huge break on price. I have too many vehicles and need to let one go, but not give it away !"

It also features stippled-textured soft rubber grips that further absorb recoil while affording a firm and positive grip. Besides being one of the most photogenic handguns ever made (it appeared in countless movies and TV shows), it is perfect for home or personal defense, as well as concealed carry and recreational shooting.Superior ReliabilityThe 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period.    Match-Grade Accuracy out of the BoxRegardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of  match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only make the 92FS super-accurate, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple to this the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class.Packed with Useful Tactical FeaturesThis pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster or at the range. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its satin stainless finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning. A pistol that is designed to work hard, be easy to maintain and perform flawlessly, the 92FS Inox is a premium-quality handgun that will be the jewel in any shooter’s collection."

197,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5674197,For Sale:  KERSHAW LEEK BLACK POCKETKNIFE,"10623 N MAY AVE, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 67,"Listed On: Saturday, June 3, 2017",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"If you prefer your knife in basic black, this one just might be your perfect EDC. To create this matte-black look, Kershaw engineers ionize metal and deposit it on both blade and handle as a microns-thin coating. This process results in a coating known as DLC, or Diamond-Like Carbon, which is hard and scratch resistant.
With its 3-inch blade, the Leek is a good-sized knife, but not too big. The slim design makes it easy to carry and its razor-sharp blade of high-performance Sandvik 14C28N means it can take care of a full range of cutting tasks. The blade is a modified drop-point, so it’s a good slicing knife, while the slim tip gives it piercing capability and the ability to do detailed work. For a partially serrated blade, choose the 1660CKTST Leek in basic black. The Leek features the SpeedSafe ambidextrous assisted opening system. Whether you’re left-handed or right-handed, just pull back on the blade protrusion or push outward on the thumbstud and the Leek’s blade is ready to go to work.
For confident blade use, a super-secure frame lock keeps the blade locked during use and a Tip-Lock slider locks the blade closed when folded. The pocketclip can be configured for tip-up or tip-down carry and the handle is drilled to accept a lanyard."

335,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5674335,"For Sale:  NIB Silencerco, Spectre II","Wallace, Wilmington, North Carolina",$ 380,"Listed On: Saturday, June 2, 2018",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Out of  Stock but available With its construction of ultra high performance and tough Stainless Steel, the Spectre 22 allows weapon fire to go virtually unnoticed.
It is not only super tough, but also one of the quietest .22 suppressors known to man. With the Spectre 22, users will also enjoy its multi-caliber versatility. The Spectre 22 has a unique CTA baffle design for easy disassembly and is user serviceable, which is very important for any .22 lr silencer. Because the .22 lr round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue .22 silencers must be able to be disassembled for cleaning and regularly maintained. Most .22 silencers on the market can be disassembled for cleaning, however they require cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds or often times they will fuse together and they are unable to come apart. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the silencer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the tube, there is simply too much build up of fouling and lead to remove the tube from most .22 lr silencers on the market. The Spectre 22 has the unique CTA baffle design that keeps the carbon and lead debris from reaching the silencer tube allowing it to be disassembled easily.
