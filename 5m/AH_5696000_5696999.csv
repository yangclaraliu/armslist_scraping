I was told it is a 1969 model, info I found is that if the serial number starts with L5 it's somewhere in the 60's,  L6 or later it's 70's or later. This has sat in a safe for 12 years as a safe queen, it's in fantastic condition, has a ported barrel at 18.5' , a diamond bolt,  original gorgeous walnut wood stock, and functions better than any shotgun I've ever shot. 5+1 capacity,  I have 25 target rounds and 5.Winchester pdx-1 defender rounds for home defense. I know the ones that are 70's and later are much easier to find and value around $350, however I have never seen another 60's model for trade or sale . So I'd value it probably around at least $400. Located in Salem, cannot travel and will list trade options below."

Legal firearms are as follows:• A shotgun may have a smooth or rifled barrel and may be of any gauge.• A muzzleloading rifle or black powder handgun must be loaded with black powder or a commercially manufactured black powder substitute.• A conventional (smokeless powder) handgun must be .35 caliber or larger and loaded with straight-walled cartridges and may be single- or multiple-shot but cannot exceed a maximum capacity of nine rounds in the barrel and magazine combined.• A firearm deer hunter may carry afield a bow and arrow, crossbow and firearm.Exceptions: See Muzzleloading Deer Seasons on pg. 19.• A .35 caliber or larger rifle loaded with straight-walled cartridges with a minimum case length of 1.16 inches and a maximum case length of 1.80 inches.• A .35 caliber or larger air rifle or pistol charged only from an external high-compression power source.Notice the section -- A .35 caliber or larger rifle loaded with straight-walled cartridges with a minimum case length of 1.16 inches and a maximum case length of 1.80 inches.The Beowulf fits that for southern Michigan with a five round magazine you are set as the case length falls below the Max 1.80 and above the 1.16 inches and is well above .35 cal.

This specimen however looks quite nice.

The 6061-T6 aluminum frame and charging handle are black anodized and the hardware is bead blasted. Includes a molded sheath with belt attachment system. The Microtech Halo V knives are big, powerful, and look great. The biggest difference between the Halo V series and the previous models is the size. At almost 11"" the Halo V is a big knife with a big blade. In addition to being long, the blade is extremely thick. To ensure the best blade/handle ratio the tips on these knives come right up to the top of the handle, so don't drag your finger across the blade's exit point! The action on these is fast, they hit hard, and the lock-up is excellent."

You can use this just like a regular NXS scope, and adjust the recticle with the turrets. Model C393. No scratches, marks, dents, ect. I have owned 4 months and bought new at Cabela's for $1883 earlier this year.In box with all the stuff, and I have taken to the range twice, as new in every respect, warranty card not sent it. Battery is as new, very bright. Never hunted with, was on a target 308 and had maybe 300 rounds fired.This is a high precision, high powered rifle scope with a practical magnification range and all the tools necessary to make accurate shots every time, no matter the distance. A low mounting profile on the NightForce NXS 3.5-15x50 means you get greater initial accuracy out of this rifle scope, making sighting faster and easier than with higher profile scopes. The 3.5-15x magnification rate is ideal for everything from medium range skirmishes to long range sniping and also allows for a wide, 27.6 foot field of view at 3x magnification.The Night Force NXS 3.5-15x50 Zero Stop Riflescope is also highly versatile. 110 MOA of internal adjustment means you can shoot from any position, at any elevation and from almost any distance, provided you make the right corrections and calculations. The Night Force NXS 3.5-15x50 .250 MOA Scope features high speed windage and elevation adjustment with a click value of .250 MOA. NightForce has included the high speed Zero Stop feature on this scope. With Zero Stop, you can return to absolute zero without even looking at your turrets.Can ship to you for $20 insured UPS, or can pick up at my office New Albany, Ohio, 9-5 weekdays.Thanks for looking!

The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed. Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability. Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability. Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics. Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired. Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface. Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance. Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting. Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability. Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul PMAG.

If the seller of armor plate does  not mention how its cut, then you can guarantee its not by laser.   Plasma cutting cuts slowly, this puts a lot of heat into the steel. ( Submerged plasma cutting machine is no better) This excess heat can result in excessive chipping and damage near the cut edge during use and easily shattering when shot. Plasma cutting generates large amounts of heat that is deposited into the target, softening it’s edges. The heat-affected zone (HAZ) generated by plasma cutting is the largest out of the most commonly used methods for cutting abrasion resistant steel. Most AR500 is cut with plasma cutters as they are cheap and relatively small compared to other methods.  Our Curved plate is bent on a custom laser cut die set with single radius bend, not bent multiple times on a  press brake.Rated for up to six hits from 7.62 Nato bullets (.308 Winchester) with velocities up to 2780 fps. Will withstand multiple hits from all pistol calibers.Base coated with Super strong hybrid polyurea for the protection of the steel.Tested by HP White laboratory ** This model complies with NIJ Standard-0101.06 for Ballistic Resistance of Body Armor.**NIJ tested Level III Armor will defeat 6 rifles round shots up to 7.62×51/.308 @ 2780 ft/s @ 15 METERSWe only manufacture our plates from certified AR-500 steel with a Brinnell Hardness Rating of505-518BHN"

I've had this revolver for awhile, but haven't carried it or used it much since I've purchased other handguns. I've added a green HIVIZ front sight and a fancy Hogue Extreme grip. The revolver comes with the original box and paperwork, as well as the original grip and sight. I'm asking $400 or to trade for a Springfield XDs in 9mm or a S&W 640. Thanks for looking."
