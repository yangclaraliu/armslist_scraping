As a matter of fact, the XTR-12 is a short-stroke piston-driven gas-operated shotgun and comes with a rotating bolt head and six locking lugs; the XTR-12 bolt is indeed an AR-10 type bolt beefed up in size for the 12-gauge shotshells. Feeding through single-column detachable magazines holding two, five or seven 12-gauge shotshells with a 76mm/3"" (""Magnum"") case, the UTAS XTR-12 semi-automatic shotgun comes with a 18,5"" long 4140 stainless steel machined barrel adapted to use several types of chokes; the bolt is manufactured of the same 4140 stainless steel, while the structure is manufactured out of lightweight aluminum alloy and magnesium, in order to keep the weight under acceptable levels. The UTAS International XTR-12 semi-automatic shotgun comes with an M4-type ergonomic pistol grip and a five-positions collapsing polymer stock, and strips in two receivers just like an AR-15; its total lenght ranges between 96,5cm and more or less 1 metre, depending from the stock extension. The XTR-12 is 3,6 kilograms long and sports fully ambidextrous controls and several MIL-STD-1913 ""Picatinny"" rails for several types of aiming devices or tactical accessories.

The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot.  Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.   Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around.  Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility. In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for more than 60 years.  26"" vent-rib bead-sighted barrel Standard Express finish on barrel and receiver Shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells Receiver milled from a solid billed of steel for maximum strength and reliability Silk-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting for maximum strength and reliability  Also included 18.5"" smoothbore deer barrel with rifle sights"

It has a nice flip up site, and is a very tight build rifle. The scope is a Bushnell AR Optics scope 4.5-18x40 with adjustable turrets. This puppy is VERY clear and well built. There are pretty great reviews on Youtube and they are not cheap. Nor are the rings that came on it. This would be a great all around AR15 but especially for hunting or bench shooting. It comes with a sling and two mags. You can either have two poly-mags, or traditional alumamags. Your choice. Make me an offer or just come and see it."

NP3 is also guaranteed against corrosion, peeling or flaking for the lifetime of the firearm."

It is a non-lethal laser deterrant that is made to go on your rifle and ""dazzle"" a poosible threat without having to shoot them. It's intended to give a rifleman more time to decide to take action or to blind someone and then be able to detain them. Great for LE. This unit works great and was VERY expensive new. I was told that the purchase price on these was more than eight thousand dollars. I'm listing it for a non-tech savy buddy so any offers will take time for me to relay. However all offers will be taken into consideration. He is interested in buying a SCAR and can include some cash for a cost difference. Do your research and see if you can use one of these.
