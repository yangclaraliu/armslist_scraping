If that pistol is the XD-S from Springfield Armory, the answer is yes. The XD-S 3.3"" Single Stack 9mm offers so much that you'll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile. The XD-S Single Stack from Springfield Armory has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol.  Use your XD-S Single Stack with an X-Tension magazine and you'll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you'll forget it’s there. If you're looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S 3.3"" Single Stack  in 9mm. You don't have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S 3.3"" Single Stack today, and you'll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it's Noticeably Unnoticeable.

Put an XD Mod.2 in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand grip relief and High-Hand beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact.

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Very similar to the P-01, the PCR uses the same alloy frame minus the light rail, making it even more concealable.   Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger pull is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

Slide and frame was lapped and trued, new trigger job was  also performed. It has also been professionally laser engraved.  As this is a railed 1911, I will also include a streamlight TLR-VIS weapon light with it. I have both mounting platforms for the light to use in a long gun with switched tail cap or  short tail cap for use on a handgun. Less than one box of ammo through it after modifications. It is a super performer and will shoot competatively in any match platform. IDPA, IPSC or whatever you choose to shoot. Less than one box of ammo through it after the mods were performed. 2000.00 investment at this point. trades are below and reasonable offers considered.Looking for primarily high end varmint rifles. Ar based ok with quality parts. Other things considered but please be reasonable. I don't need to get rid of it."

This is a Just Right Carbine (JRC) chambered in 45 acp. This has been completely gone through and upgraded by the factory with new bolt, feed ramps, extractor and spring, etc. This has all of the newer upgrades to make it shoot more reliably and is something the vast majority of the other of these out there do not have. It is ready to tear up the range. This takes Glock magazines. This has Magpul Flip Sights and a Red/Green/Blue dot sight with cantilever mount, adjustable Buttstock, MFT Buttstock cheek weld enhancement, quad rail, threaded barrel, thread protector, magazine, quad rail cover on Palm area, and box. This is a great little gun and is a blast to shoot.  I would also consider trades. Really only interested in CZ Scorpion, CMR30, towards a 1927-a1 type (Tommy gun), AR10, maybe even a CETME or similar build in 308. May consider other offers. Some trades will need boot on my end, some will on yours. Mainly looking for cash though, so trade will have to be really worth it. Pickup in Norman only. Thanks for looking and happy hunting."

Too many guns and not enough time. It is a full-size polymer frame semi-automatic pistol chambered in the potent .22 Magum round. It comes with (2) 30-round capacity magazine's and factory case and manual. That's a lot of firepower and plinking fun, for such a light weight pistol. This gun is perfect for your “Bug Out Bag.” A careful distribution of polymer and aluminum around key steel components has reduced the pistol's weight to a feathery 13.6 ounces when unloaded. A fully loaded magazine will only add 6 more ounces to the total weight. The pistol has a narrow profile overall. The front-to-back distance in the grip is a bit longer than usual in order to accommodate the .22 Mag. cartridges. The full-length grip also has a subtle pie-wedge shape, narrowing at the front under the trigger guard. The overall effect is a grip that is quite comfortable to work with, even for shooters with smaller hands. The PMR-30 has an ambidextrous safety that is easy to reach and operate. The slide arrives from the factory fitted with bright fiber-optic sites, and it's drilled and tapped to accommodate a scope base. The frame has an integrated Picatinny accessory rail to allow shooters to attach various lights and laser sights. I also have 100 rounds of .22 WMR ammo that I will sell with the gun for an extra $30."

Perfectly sized and balanced, it is equally suited for concealed carry, home- or personal defense as well as recreational shooting. With its full grip, full-capacity magazine, accessory rail and interchangeable backstraps, you will get a further sense of its versatility. But it is at the shooting range that this double/single-action compact handgun will truly wow you: thanks to its rotary barrel system, recoil dissipates radially, resulting in much less thump in your hand and super-fast follow-up shots.  An Ultra-Reliable Professional Choice for Holster Carry  As you read this, the PX4 Storm in its various configurations is being carried by countless law-enforcement and military organizations around the world, in every environment imaginable. This is because it is engineered to be absolutely reliable and ultra-durable, and it is capable of shooting well over 100,000 rounds without any part breakage. And its dimensions that fall right in between the full-size PX4 Storm and its sub-compact counterpart make it perfect for everyday holster carry (concealed or open), offering light weight and smaller proportions while still affording a full grip.  Modular, Easy to Customize and Full of User-Friendly Choices  The Px4 Storm Compact offers a plethora of features that make it easily adaptable to your preferences. Its modular construction allows you to interchange backstraps to perfectly fit your hand and shooting style, while the slide lock and safety are ambidextrous; in addition, the magazine release is reversible, meaning that you can easily train with and use your PX4 with either hand. Other features include a retractable lanyard loop, as well as user-adjustable sights and a number of accessories that make this pistol a true champion in its class.  Safe, Easy to Use and Maintain  This handgun offers intuitive controls and an absolutely safe mechanism. In a holster or purse, an automatic firing-pin block and a manual safety enable you to confidently carry it all day--day after day, without any worries. Furthermore, it is easy to use and take apart for cleaning, and its tough Bruniton finish make it even more trouble-free to maintain. In short, the PX4 Storm Compact will give you years and years--and thousands upon thousands of rounds--of reliable service, accuracy and safety for personal or home defense.
