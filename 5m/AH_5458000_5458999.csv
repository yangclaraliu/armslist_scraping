Traditional side ejection is not ambidextrous and forward ejection, like in the Kel-Tec RFB, is quite complex.The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. The bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower full auto rate (when applicable).The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies. Bolt, bolt carrier, firing mechanism, ejector chute and bolt stop are identical for all variations. The short stroke gas operated piston is fully adjustable for different ammunitions and muzzle attachments.Caliber 5.56mm NATOBarrel Length 17.4""Overall Length 27.4""Weight Empty 7 lbs.Semi Auto THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST 200 MADE BY KELTEC STILL IN ITS ORIGINAL BOX WITH MANUAL, MAG, SLING.

G10 VZ Operator II grips and two 8-round magazines with bump pads included.   We recently had police departments and special units who carry the 1911 approach us to build them a more reliable and durable 1911 to replace their current carry pieces. Since we did not have a model to meet their specific needs, we created the Specialist just for them. Knowing our customers the way we do, we knew we had to offer these to the public as well.The Specialist is a 5” 1911 chambered in .45 ACP that is full of features to satisfy an officer’s special needs.Starting at the top, the slide wears our popular Clark Style serrated rib and like all of our guns with night sights, the Specialist wears dual-colored Tritium night sights. The rear sight is our new tactical ledge rear sight with single amber tritium dot and the front utilizes a green lamp with white target ring.The forged slide is mated to our new forged tactical rail frame. The frame utilizes the standard 1913 picatinny rail and features 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and a recessed slide stop for use with laser grips (not included) and tactical operations. Each Specialist comes standard with our ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and a detachable two-piece magwell. This duty-ready piece comes dressed with a set of awesome G10 VZ Operator II grips and two 8 round magazines with bump pads.The Specialist is available in either a matte stainless finish or our matte black Duty finish.We think this pistol would not only be perfect for duty and tactical purposes but for home defense as well.

Years ago, I bought a new short shotgun with a pistol grip. Only problem, it could sprain one's wrist. From decades ago, I remembered the old home altered short shotguns with cut off stocks. The light went off when I realized that the angle of a stock's pistol grip transferred force away from one's wrist, allowing the bent arm to function as a shock absorber, thus preventing any discomfort or injury. So, I sold the new gun, bought a used one and proceeded to cut it down, to legal length, of course. I used a pipe cutter, then removed the resulting burr. Cut off the stock and stained the cut end. It's no beauty, but is a highly functional, very effective defensive shotgun. And damned affordable. Why am I selling it? I'm not one of those guys who collects guns, I just need enough of the right ones, at home, office and in both vehicles so that one will be at hand, if ever needed. So, when I recently purchased 3 more shotguns, 2 sawn, I decided to let this one go. Add $20 for shipping to your Florida address."

Because the target is gravity reset and doesn’t rely on springs or mechanisms, the Rimfire Dueling Tree gives you reliable results and a fun experience every time.NOTE: The stand and feet are made of mild steel and are not intended to withstand the force of a bullet. Shooting the stand and feet may result in damage.Specifications:- Weight: 35 lbs.- Dimensions: 40” H x 14” W- Base: 3’ x 2’- Paddles: 4” diameter- Steel grade: 1/4"" AR500 armor steel- Rimfire shooting distance: 10+ yardsFAQsCan I shoot my rimfire .17 HMR on this target?: While the .17 HMR is a rimfire round, its velocity is too great for the reactive mechanisms of the target. This target is designed for .22 rimfire ammunition only.Can I shoot centerfire handgun rounds on this target?: While this target is made of 1/4"" AR500 armor steel which can withstand the force of a centerfire handgun round, shooting it with more powerful rounds will cause it to wear out quickly and cause the reactive features of the target to malfunction.Is the entire target made of armor steel?: The target plates are all made of AR500 armor steel. The center stand is made of mild steel, but is designed to effectively shed bullets.Why does the Rimfire Dueling Tree lean forward?: The Rimfire Dueling Tree leans forward for two reasons. The angle is used to deflect splatter toward the ground and also helps prevent the swinging paddles from getting stuck while swinging from one side to the other by utilizing gravity."

Picked her up a few days ago, went to the range today but wasn't really a fan of the sights. Since the sights and the finish are what make the VTAC special, I'd rather sell/trade the gun than try and swap the sights and sell the old ones. Most people like the sights, I guess I'm one of the small percentage that doesn't.Though most M&P pistols have a corrosion-resistant finish applied to the barrel, slide and steel sights, the VTAC’s slide is finished in an enhanced Flat Dark Earth PVD and has specialized sights designed by Kyle Lamb. These sights are the main reason why the VTAC is one of the more expensive guns in the M&P line. The VTAC’s unique sights are made by Trijicon and only offered on the M&P9 VTAC. These sights are intended to be rapidly and highly visible in different lighting conditions. They accomplish that by using three green fiber-optic and three green tritium inserts. Thhe fiber optics are on the top and the tritium inserts directly below. In daylight the fiber-optic dots glow; in low-light conditions, the tritium inserts take precedence.This gun comes with both factory mags, all 4 backstraps (Two black, two FDE), and a BlackDog Concealment, OWB Kydex holster. Both the holster, and the gun are barely used, with not a single scratch. I am MAINLY looking for trades. Specifically a Beretta Pico or Ruger LCP-C + Cash, or other 9mm handguns (Glock, FNS9-C, Steyr, etc) of EQUAL VALUE or PLUS CASH. I can Google what your gun is worth in under 30 seconds, please don't try and rip me off.I don't really want to sell it outright, but if I do, I'm asking $600 for the weapon and the holster. Gun retails for $660 online, + an average of $20 shipping and $25 transfer. So all in, you're looking at $705 minimum plus a weeks wait. The gun and the holster ($65ish) for $600? That's a steal. I'd really hate to let her go, honestly one of the nicest looking handguns I've owned but I don't shoot it that well. You can get ahold of me anytime, day or night by texting me at 248-255-9307Located in Northville, Michigan. Willing to drive a bit. 18+ with PP or CPL, FTF deals only.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"
