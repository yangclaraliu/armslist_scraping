This rifle is in excellent condition and the cold hammer forged barrel is new. It comes complete with the rifle's original log book, military issue leather ammo pouches, cleaning kit that resides in the buttstock and the brass oil decanter w/ leather carrying pouch. Importantly, I had Murray's Gunsmithing install their best SS firing pin which includes reaming the firing pin shaft and re-facing the bolt. This firing pin is much better than the stock Yugo SKS firing pin and it eliminates the potential SKS problem of the firing pin sticking in the strike position which can make the rifle go uncontrollably automatic emptying out your magazine. That cost me $70.00. I also bought a flash hider to replace the grenade launcher nozzle. Lastly, I bought a leather SKS rifle sling Of course I kept the original grenade launcher nozzle as well as the original firing pin and both will be included with the rifle.I have $600 in this rifle not to mention the waiting for a month to get the firing pin installed bolt back from Murray's Gunsmithing and then there is the dirty deed of cleaning all of the cosmoline out of every nook and cranny! That took hours! You can get a Yugo SKS for less than this but you can't get a Yugo SKS with all of the improvements I have on this one for less. Also, I bought this from Classic Firearms back when they first got these in and I ordered it hand-picked with the guarantee of the inclusion original arsenal log. It is truly in near new condition. If you order an SKS from Classic now, it's a crapshoot as to what you will get. With this one you know what you are getting.
 My price is firm and I am not interested in any trades."

It's a very phenominal gun that I've really enjoyed. The bolt is still super clean and shiny chrome. I can produce more pictures of other areas if you'd like to see. Česká Zbrojovka or CZ for short, produces some of the worlds finest firearms. They have timeless designs with tens of millions of units sold and still in use around the world including the 75b, Scorpion, BREN, 455 and 557. Their quality is legendary and it's very apparent in this shotgun. The lines are smooth, the action is quick and flawless and the weight is amazingly low for what this is.It's a very pretty sportsmans gun. I purchased it for my girlfriend to shoot Skeet and Hunt with me. That was maybe 5 years ago and the experiment failed; she still doesn't like shotgun sports or hunting. That said, it wasn't the guns fault. This thing is lightweight and super low recoil. It would be a perfect sporting gun or a youth gun if you desired to cut the stock for better Length of Pull. I'm selling it because I don't have enough room in my gun safe and I firmly believe its dangerous to have guns out of a safe with children around. It has to go. Price is $250. I'm pricing this gun to sell quickly. For sale only, no trades. Cash.And no, my Vizsla is NOT included."
