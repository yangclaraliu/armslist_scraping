All parts are properly proof marked.The wooden stock of this example is in extremely good condition with few scratches/dings.Rifle includes it's proper cleaning/tamping rod. History: Vetterli rifles were a series of Swiss army rifles used from 1869 to around 1890, but were later replaced with Schmidt–Rubin rifles. Modified Vetterli rifles were also used in the Italian Army.  The Swiss Vetterli rifle combined the American Winchester Model 1866's tubular magazine with a regular bolt featuring two opposed rear locking lugs, which was a brand new concept for the time. This different type of bolt system was a huge improvement over the much simpler Dreyse and Chassepot bolt actions. The Vetterli was also the first repeating bolt-action rifle to incorporate self-cocking, along with a small caliber bore. With the Swiss Federal Council's decision in early 1866 to equip the Swiss Army with breechloading repeating rifles, the Vetterli rifles, at the time of their introduction, were the most advanced military rifles in all of Europe. The Vetterli replaced the use of the out dated Amsler-Milbank rifles."

Takedown is as simple as locking the bolt back and verifying that the rifle is unloaded, pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies and pulling them apart. Simple reassembly allows for a secure connection of the barrel and action and returns the firearm to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used, ensuring consistent accuracy, shot after shot. Patented, detachable 10-round rotary magazine features a unique rotor to separate cartridges and provide reliable feeding.
Legendary action, a tried and true Ruger design, ensures consistent, reliable performance. Easy-to-use extended magazine release provides smooth, no-fuss removal of flush-mounted magazine. Positive, push-button, cross-bolt manual safety. Heat-stabilized, glass-filled, polymer trigger housing assembly is precision-made of high-tech material for improved manufacturing tolerances, impact and abrasion-resistance and unmatched ability to withstand the elements. 
Also includes: Convenient carry-case, which provides ample storage with extra pockets and magazine pouches."

I am original owner, purchased from factory. Have original box and all the paperwork. Sale is for the upper only, no sights or accesories other than what came on the upper. Less than 500 rounds, only EVER fired Hornady Match ammo. This upper is very high quality. I'd be happy to answer questions. I am in PA and will ship to 48 CONUS at buyers expense for actual shipping. Some helpful information from LWRC, With a 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle. The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

The price of this is well less than half of wait I paid retail (all at the local Southeastern Outdoors), except for the case which I had to order. This is an extremely light bow at 3.5lbs and it helps!
