Amazing balance and overall lightweight.Daniel Defense M4 V7® LW   The Daniel Defense V7 LW is the first rifle in the DDM4 lineup to feature the M-LOK® attachment technology with the Daniel Defense MFR XS 15.0 rail. Built around a Cold Hammer Forged, 16” lightweight profile barrel, the V7 has a DD improved Flash Suppressor to reduce flash signature.

With the M-LOK attachment points that run along 6 positions and an uninterrupted 1913 Picatinny rail on top, the V7 LW has plenty of room for the sights, optics, and accessories the user may require.  The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

This was taken in on trade along with cash for a classic auto I sold and the owner said his gunsmith acquired it new with a broken front sight. Interestingly the gunsmith added a ring style sight in place of it. Cant comment on how well that style of sight works because I havent fired it. He did say the gun is very reliable and shoots point of aim. Previous owner said it has had less than 100 rds shot thru it. I believe it has a hogue grip on it. 1911's are not my style as I have all my semi-autos in double action only. Has one clip and an Uncle Mike's holster with it. No trades. Price reduced to sell!

The result is the 92A1, a pistol that is as reliable for its intended use as it is safe and user-friendly even for the novice.easy-accessorizationEasy Accessorization and MaintenanceThe most noticeable difference between the classic 92FS and the 92A1 is that this comes with an integral Picatinny rail situated in front of the trigger guard. The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit.Impressive Firepower, Extra-Durable MagazinesBeveled-magazine-wellAnother feature that will impress you about the 92A1 is the type of magazine it comes with. This pistol comes with three 17-round magazines designed to deliver remarkable firepower out of the box while being absolutely durable and corrosion resistant. Furthermore, the magazines on the 92A1 feature a “dirt rail” along their length, which helps collect dust and grit out of the magazine while keeping cartridges clear of the magazine walls. The result: enhanced feeding reliability and super-easy magazine maintenance. Rounded-Trigger-GuardAbsolutely Reliable, Designed to LastThe base design of the 92A1 is the 92FS or M9, the pistol that has served the US military admirably throughout its campaigns in the world’s toughest environments. But even in this respect, Beretta never rests on its laurels. This pistol incorporates an innovative internal frame buffer that greatly reduces component stress under firing (yes, even with hot +P ammo), making it even more durable and smooth-shooting. The best of both worlds, the 92A1 offers discriminating shooters the classic overall look and feel of the 92 (including the more traditional rounded trigger-guard) with today’s most advanced tactical features. This pistol is also available in .40 S&W as the 96A1 and in 9x21mm as the 98A1."

It was purchased as my wife's first gun to get her comfortable shooting and handling handguns before upgrading to a 9mm once she got her conceal carry permit. We originally decided to keep it instead of trading it in, but since she hasn't shot it since she got her 9mm, we decided to sell it to fund an upgrade for me!This gun is easy, fun, and very accurate to shoot with practically no recoil. We fired CCI Mini-Mags and Stingers (Walther manual recommends using Mini-Mags) through it with no issues. Condition of the gun is 99%, with only rub marks on the hammer face giving away its pre-owned status. It was meticulously cleaned and lubricated after each use and stored in its case.It comes with the original case, the original magazine, and 2 extra Walther (no off-brand) 10-rd magazines. The original gun lock can be included for free if needed (but it is kind of a cheap lock, in my opinion). Also, a leather holster designed to be used in purses can be thrown in at no extra charge, if you want it.These retailed for about $400 new, and currently run at least $375 used, if you can find them.

Seriel numbered in the 900K's it is very sought after by collectors. Watch Hickok45 s review on the Springfield 1903 and he will tell you that a 1903 in the 900K range is what HE wanted.Rebarreled in 1929, it certainly saw wartime use.  Overall very good condition. Would make a great addition to any collection.I was told it would fetch between $950 and $1350 in auction if pit up in one.  So, $950 is my cash price, and the higher end of that range is my trade value.Yes, I will ship to anywhere in the US, to your FFL, for an additional $30."

Recoil is very mild and the trigger breaks like a glass rod at a tested 3.75 lbs. Probably one of the best 1911 triggers I’ve pulled with minimum take up and virtually zero over travel. It comes with the factory case and all extras along with an extra factory magazine (3 total). One of the original factory mags had a tab on the follower that was bent, which broke (works but won't slide lock on last round) when I tried to straighten it so Springfield sent me a replacement. The gun is factory with exception to an upgraded Dawson Precision fiber optic front sight (black factory sight comes with package), Wilson Combat magwell, and Magpul grips (includes the factory Cross Cannon Double Diamond Cocobolo wood grips). If you want it setup like factory with black front sight and factory grips less magwell I can work with you on price.  I have 3 extra Wilson Combat 10 round mags that can be added at $25 each…normally around $39 new.  Here is the factory specs along with what the factory grips and black sight look like - http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/1911-range-officer-9mm/  Located in Evansville, IN and FTF only.

Though I've not seen the XCR as much in the U.S., the rifle is very popular in Canada, while distribution in the US, seems to be more limited.  In those areas of the U.S. where consumers have been able to use and learn about the XCR, there seems to be many happy owners.  The XCR's piston driven platform is extremely reliable, easy to clean and maintain, and very accurate.  The XCR has a folding stock, a quick change barrel system with conversion kits for .300 BLK and other calibers available. Unlike the ACR however, the XCR is not made of polymer but rather is made entirely of metal, including the very rugged and tough FAST stock.  The XCR has a monolithic rail system as the upper reciever and the forend/handguard are a continuous single piece.  I have owned this rifle since late 2013 and have put somewhere between 500-750 rounds down range with it.  As mentioned above, this rifle comes equiped with the FAST Stock as shown in the pictures, however I also purchased the ACE Skeleton stock for the XCR and this second stock is also included.  Though the skeleton stock is lighter, I personally prefer the FAST stock, which I find to be superior to the various stocks that are available for the SCAR or ACR.  The FAST stock not only extends to one of six positions, but it also has an adjustable cheek riser.  The r rifle's trigger has also been upgraded with Robinson's 2-stage match trigger which provides a pull weight of 3.5 lbs with a 2 lb. first stage and a 1.5 lb. second stage.  Relative to the 5.5 lb. single stage stock trigger, this upgrade greatly improves accuracy and rate of fire.  The stock single stage trigger is also included.  Another upgrade that I've added is the compensator/muzzle brake, which mitigates muzzle rise.  Finally, the stock pistol grip has been upgraded with a Hogue rubber pistol grip and I have added Magpul ""Pro Gen 3 flip-up backup sights.  The rifle has a quad rail system, (though you'll notice in the pictures that I have rail covers over the rails), and a 16"" chrome lined barrel.  I have plenty of additional pictures so please let me know if you'd like to see them or if you'd like to check this rifle out in person.  Not really interested in trades at this time, but will consider all reasonable offers.If you are interested in having the rifle shipped to your local FFL, please ask and I am happy to accomodate you.For sale is a Gen 3 Glock 19 in 9mm that comes with a customized ported slide that has been coated with Titanium Nitride (TiN-X), which provides an extremely hard and durable coat that improves
