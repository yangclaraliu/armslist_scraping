The Rifle is in overall very good condition, with some minor rust scale located upon the top of the barrel just behind the front barrel band and very light peppering throughout the entire blued finish of the rifle (When properly done, this rifle will clean up very well).History: Vetterli rifles were a series of Swiss army rifles used from 1869 to around 1890, but were later replaced with Schmidt–Rubin rifles. Modified Vetterli rifles were also used in the Italian Army.  The Swiss Vetterli rifle combined the American Winchester Model 1866's tubular magazine with a regular bolt featuring two opposed rear locking lugs, which was a brand new concept for the time. This different type of bolt system was a huge improvement over the much simpler Dreyse and Chassepot bolt actions. The Vetterli was also the first repeating bolt-action rifle to incorporate self-cocking, along with a small caliber bore. With the Swiss Federal Council's decision in early 1866 to equip the Swiss Army with breechloading repeating rifles, the Vetterli rifles, at the time of their introduction, were the most advanced military rifles in all of Europe. The Vetterli replaced the use of the out dated Amsler-Milbank rifles.Feed system: 12-round tubular magazine rifle, was also produced.

It has an engraved slide and pearl grips. May be the perfect purse gun for the lady in your life, or for someone who is a show off (LOL!) For some reason, when taking pics the slide shows as scratched or scuffed. It is not. It is in Like new condition. It is a Sig Sauer P238 ""Pearl"" chambered in .380 ACP. Some of the cool features of this gun you do not see on most 380's. It has a manual safety, so you can carry it ""cocked and locked"", Siglite night sights that REALLY glow at night and the best feature of all is the action is SAO (Single Action Only). Most pocket 380's have a rediculously long double action. Not this baby! If you look up the reviews of this gun, you'll see that Sig basically shrunk a 1911, without making the controls (slide lock, safety, mag release) as tiny as on other 380's. I have the original box and papers. Included is the factory 6 round magazine, a Sig extended 7 round magazine (7+1!) and a new Sticky pocket holster (really dissapears in your pocket). The extended mag allows for a full grip!!!!If you went to buy all of this elsewhere, you would pay for a transfer fee, background check, taxes and shipping. On top of that, you would pay $650 for the gun, $40 for the extended magazine and $25 for the holster. That's $715 before the fees, taxes, etc. I will sell it for $640 FIRM, less than the gun alone would cost you! I am open to partial trades. I need another pocket rocket to replace this one. I like Ruger LCP with Crimson Trace, Taurus TCP or some of the Kahr's out there. Give me a trade value lower than cost as that's what my pricing is set at. I may be open to trade for larger, sub-compacts as well, so just let me know what you have. Why am I getting rid of it? It is too nice. I thought it would be cool to carry such a pretty weapon, but realize that carrying it over time may scratch it and that would be a shame!!!If you want to buy it, have a trade or just have questions, please text me on my cell at Four Oh Svn 914 Ate 3 Nin 1. Thanks for looking!!!!P.S. I will only sell/trade with a Florida Resident, of age, who is not a felon. I will ask to see ID. Thanks!"
