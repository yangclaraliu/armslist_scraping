Listed as AA9626 on the Springfield Armory website with an MSRP of $1965. Of course no one pays msrp. 
Cabelas $1790.  GunsAmerica used $1600 fees and shipping included.  Cheaperthandirt $1656 fees and shipping included. GunBroker $1630 fees and shipping included.

I would like for everyone to consider that Springfield has introduced  a CQB variant of this rifle equipped with an adjustible pistol grip stock and red dot sight. Of course you will pay substantially more for that model, but if you highly value those features you may wish to consider it. 

That being said, I think that you can make this rifle even into an even better CQB variant by installing a Choate 17-01-01 FOLDING pistol grip stock, a CASM MRD base with hood and JPoint red dot.

If a long range rifle is what you are looking for you can install an AMS 3026 Top Extended Rail that will mount onto the existing forward rail and anchor to the stripper clip holder mount which you can then mount your scope to. You will want to install a Tac Pro adjustable cheek rest to get the right cheek height/weld for scope use.

Price is firm. The price as it is right now is non-negotiable unless you wish to pay more than the ad price. If I decide to sell for more or less I will change the ad price.

Please respond courteously beginning with a traditional greeting or salutation, such as ""Good Morning Sir"", followed by your enquiry using complete sentences and then finish with a traditional closing, such as ""Have a nice day"" or ""Regards"".

$380 firm cash or a little better in trade.  Thought this one was sold a couple times now, will only meet from Rockwall to North Mesquite or as far North as Firewheel Mall in Garland.

If you can install a mount and use a high powere scope with it, this is the fun for you beause perfect and new in any other way. Almost no scratches. co,es with a black synthetic stock. Only put 500 roiunds through it and with iron sights was extremely accurate at 100-200yds. If upgrading to national Match and Super match for more money, and still cannot zero with scope I know it is my fault and will have it professionally scope mounted and zeroed. I paid 1$1,500-$1600 for this rifle and wanto get at least $850 for it.
