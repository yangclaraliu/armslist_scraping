Note that the entire rifle is up for sale for $1200 as well but would prefer to just sell the upper. The Upper is Made up as so: The Upper is a JSE Surplus 6.5, with a 20 inch bull barrel, YHM 308 brake, YHM Freefloat rail and gas system. Higher End Chrome Bolt Carrier and Alexander Arms Bolt Head. Anmbidextrous Charging Handle, Single point QD sling mount, Bipod Picatinny to swivel stud adapter, and an AR-PEPR 30mm set of rings (NO scope) Overall This is a pretty Maxed out Grendel Build, have done 1/2 to 3/4 MOA before with a 5 shot group, about 300 rounds through upper, no issues. The gun also comes with 6 15rd ASC 6.5 MAgs, Hornady Reloading DIes and a WFT-2 CAse Trimmer with a 6.5 head (Basically most of what you need to reload Grendel if you already load for other rifle calibers). Including all the ammo i have which is 300rds of brass cased (Some are Handloads in only new Unfired Brass, No Reloaded Cases... Tested to Well within Safe Pressures and under 1MOA Groups), and 257 rounds of Wolf Steel cased (total of 557 rounds). Also 92 pieces of fired BrassOnly Reason I am selling the upper is to put money into a new platform. Note that what you get here would cost you about $1500 New. This rifle is a pretty nice all around platform, recoils only slightly more than a 5.56, and the accuracy is certainly there. I am open to offers and possibly trades depending on what you have. Would most likely be willing to trade for an AR10, a Bullpup or compact tactical rifle, or a Long range bolt Gun. Any questions let me know. ... Also originally listed the entire rifle so the pics will reflect as such. What you get here is everything minus the complete lower. If anybody is interested in the entire rifle Im willing to do 1200. The Lower is pretty high end, Match 2 pound trigger, Magpul Pistol Grip and trigger guard, LUTH-AR MBA-1 buttstock. Dont be afraid to shoot me a cash or trade offer, Thanks"

But the ammo is worth at least $150 and I would prefer to sell it all at once since this is the only 45 I own.This is a stock picture, but would be more than willing to text pictures of mine.  Text is probably the best way to get a hold of me.  REDACTEDAlso open to trades for ARs or AKs."

Stand naturally with your back against the wall. Hold your arms out (palms forward) at shoulder height and make a ""wingspan"". Measure across your body from middle fingertip to middle fingertip and divide by 2.5 (70"" divided by 2.5 = 28"" draw length). This will get you very close to you actual draw length, but it may be a bit longer or shorter due to your body structure."
