Up for sale today is my Marlin 60SB Micro Groove in .22LR. This rifle is light weight, fast shooting, and above all fun! The rifle is finished in stainless steel for all weather perfomance and the wooden stock is of a color to accentuate the stainess. Competitive only to the Ruger 10/22, this rifle has been the better (IMHO) alternative for several decades. The biggest difference stock is this Marlin has a tube fed, 14 round magazine. With the 10/22 having a 10 round rotary magazine from the factory as we all know.As you can see, the rifle has a Simmons 3-9/32 scope attached. "".22 Magnum"" is listed on the front of the scope and has been dead accurate through hundreds of rounds. The rings are not the best as will be see by the screws securing the rings. Sadly the screw heads have stripped, but the scope is still very functional. Included with the rifle is the original .22LR scope that came with the rifle. It is a very inexpensive (cheap) Optronics 4x20 that is just fine for casual plinking. Also, the black glass filled nylon ATI Fiberforce ""Dragunov"" style stock is included. This stock is rock solid polymer and fits the rifle perfectly. Installed, it provides a more ergonic strong hand grip that is great for those ""long"" distance shots.That is not all! On top of everything else, I will include approximately 325-400 rounds of .22LR ammunition. The brands are shown below. I say approximately because I do not know how many rounds are in the value pack, but it is mostly full. The small Thunderbolt boxes are full at 50 rounds per box.Now down to the nitty gritty. No part of this package shall be excluded. If you are interested, you get everything you see! I will only meet in the St. Peters, St. Charles, and O'Fallon area; if you live further, then you will have to meet me out here. This weapon retails for $267.71, with local shops selling them anywhere between $180-250$. The stock alone is valued at $59.99, and the scope new is $48.66. If you were to buy all of this equipment new, you would be spending close to $350-400! I am open to negotiation, but I will not give you my shirt so to speak. I am NOT INTERESTED in ANY TRADES. So for the all caps, I want that to be clear. Good Luck!"
