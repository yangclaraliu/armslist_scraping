For sale, nearly brand new AR 15. Had only had about 300 rds down range, without a single hiccup. Upper is a Palmetto State 16"" midlength, with a Melonited barrel and a military standard 1/7 twist (will shoot a full range of ammunition, from 55 gr to the heavier 77 gr Mk 262 OTM loads). The 7075-T6 forged aluminum upper receiver has a milspec black hard coat anodized finish and is T-marked. The front sight is a standard ""F""-marked sight block, and the front handguards are standard milspec for the midlength gas system. BCG is nitrided Davidson Defense.  Rear sight is a UTG Pro flip up BUIS. Lower is Anderson 7075-T6 forged with the standard milspec hard coat anodized finish as well. A DPMS lower parts kit was used to complete this rifle. If you're not familiar with the melonite (sometimes called nitrided, black nitride or QPQ) treatment, this process is superior to phosphate coating, stainless steel AND/OR chrome lining. Depending on the manufacturer, a chrome lining might have irregularities in thickness that can immediately affect accuracy. Even in time, the chrome lining can wear away, once again affecting accuracy. Phosphate and stainless untreated barrels will wear, over time. Again, accuracy is compromised. Melonite is not a finish, but an actual treatment that increases both the hardness and the life of the barrel. The Melonite process leaves the barrel with a smooth and deep black color. The rifle currently has a OD GREEN buttstock installed, as I did not have a black milspec one present, at the time. Price is the same for either one, but the black one won't be available until 19 or 20, September. Pics will be added soon. Price is $650 firm, and it includes two milspec aluminum 30 rd magazines. (Not interested in trades; cash only.) Feel free to contact me for any questions."

The Aimpoint QRP 2 is part of the latest generation modular Aimpoint mount system that gives you the freedom to choose the type of mount base and the height of the optic by inserting various spacers. Aimpoint’s new modular mount system is extremely flexible and allows you to adapt your optic to various types of weapons.

Each screw has Loctite™ 242 (Blue) thread locker applied for long term maintenance free performance.Why Glock 'subcompact' 26 solutions but not 'compact' 19?One of the easiest ways to tell if someone is Appendix carrying is when they have to bend their knee and stoop down in order to pick something up off the ground.The short barrel length of the Glock 26 allows you to bend over comfortably at the waist without the barrel jabbing you in the leg. This is the cornerstone to the entire Philosophy of Use of this holster system.By adding a magazine pinky extension (not included), the grip can be kept consistent with the compact Glock 19 for maximum control.Ive always struggled with deciding to bring a spare mag or not, and where to stow it. Worry no longer - this holster is optimized to hold a full size Glock 17 magazine with a factory Glock +2 extension.Add it upFor Glock 26 9mm you can hold 10 rounds in the mag and 1 in the chamber.
