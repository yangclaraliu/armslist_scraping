The SDP Compact features a full aluminum lower frame, which gives it unparalleled balance, and can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, fully length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The aluminum pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition.  Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.

That being said this is a shooter and not a safe queen. I did my best to try and take accurate pictures but just know this gun does have a cylinder ring and some surface scratches. There is one large scratch on the cylinder and one small scratch that's a little deeper seen in picture two by the trigger. I explicitly mention this because my phone seems to take pictures which make this gun look flawless and in fact there are some scratches if you hold it in the right light. All and all this is a very pretty and nice gun but I would rather under sell it than over so please take a look below. http://i214.photobucket.com/albums/cc33/weckerm/Mobile%20Uploads/20160626_222837_zps8promu5m.jpgyou can see the small scratch near the trigger guard.

Gun retails for around $1100 when you can find it. Crimson Trace grips are around $350. Gun has MetPro night sights that are still very bright. Comes with one mag, cable lock, takedown tool, hard case, and all original paperwork. All be it used, the gun shows factory new. Also included is a black leather belt slide for carry and a Kimber stamped, plastic paddle holster from Fobus, for the range. I will load the first mag for whomever takes her. This gun is very lightweight for a 1911. It has the BBL, so it has no bushing. Make for a very accurate gun. I can assure you, you can consistently hit quarters at 25 feet via the laser or sights. As stated, I don't carry this gun as it is far too nice for a daily carry.

Bought it for a deep concealment gun which it is excellent for but just don't find myself carrying it too much so I'll let it go for my asking price. Has factory Siglite tritium night sights. Wonderful shooter once you get used to the double action only trigger. Extremely accurate and very soft shooting for a small gun. Trigger feels about 8-9lbs but is very crisp. So far it has 400 flawless rounds through it (I guess that's a break in) Cleaned after every range trip. Frame has slight wear marks from the carrying in the kydex holster but nothing major, just polymer wear (can you see the wear marks in the pic? Me neither :P).
It is small enough to fit in a pocket, yet the thickness and large sights make it feel like handling a 'larger' gun. This gun would be a great carry weapon for women too and people with medium to small hands as they can almost get a full pinky grip even with the 6 round mag.
*Note* This gun is the latest model with restrike capability and was manufactured only back in April of 2016! (Date will be on the box)
Comes with:
ONE standard 6 round magazine
THREE extended 8 round mags
Kydex IWB holster as well as factory Sig OWB paddle holster
Sig Piranha G10 grip plates (pictured) Original grips included as well
Original box and whatever papers came with it.
 
$400 cash only. No trades. Price is FIRM. Lowballers will be ignored as I am in no rush to sell this. First come first serve. Please communicate. I can meet Weekday evenings after 6:30pm around Saint Paul. On Weekends before noon or by appointment if available.

The barrel, receiver, and bolt have matching serial #. I have three 5-rd. clips with military ammo loaded in them and two boxes of pointed soft point hunting rounds. THIS RIFLE IS NOT IN COLLECTOR CONDITION. The rifle is a perfect candidate to ""sporterize"" and this is what the previous owner began to do. The rifle shows the effects of improvision and has had the rifle sights cut off (apparently to add adjustable sights or to mount a scope). The stock has been cut down and refinished. It is in fair/functional condition otherwise. I thought that when I obtained the rifle that I would finish the ""sporterization"" but it has sat in my collection, untouched. There is an extral bolt group that has a custom bolt handle specifically for the use of a scope. It needs a new firing pin, the current one is broken and should be headspaced checked as I never got to work on fiting it to the gun. I am cleaning out un-needed or unused things, so these have been selected to go. A great light project for a hunting rifle conversion. WILL NOT SEPARATE GUN FROM AMMO! CASH ONLY!
