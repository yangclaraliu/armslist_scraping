I have probably put only 1500 rounds through this gun, most being soft shooting lead projectile handloads which are incredibly gentle on the barrel. This gun is clean and like the day I bought it, with the exception of a small bit of missing paint on the Beavertail from where it was lightly dropped. That's all. This gun reliably fires, ejects and chambers all types of ammo, light and heavy loads, hollowpoint and full metal jacket. I carried this gun for years with confidence. I've never shot any steel or aluminum cased ammo out of it, brass only. I have not modified this gun in any way. Out of the box there was difficulty with engaging the safety with the hammer cocked, I sent it back to the factory where their certified armorers replaced some trigger and safety components. The issue was fixed upon return. I have a letter from the factory stating the repairs. I do not have the original plastic case, one of the plastic hasps on it broke and I threw it away. I do have the original manual though. Transfer at FFL in Southeast PA. Buyer pays transfer fee and taxes.Willing to ship longer distance in PA to your FFL. Buyer pays all transfer fees, taxes and background check, seller pays shipping. I'll take personal check or money order, I'll ship after the funds clear.Price dropped to $475.

The Henry Silver Eagle is based on the engraved scroll and silver plated Serial Number 9 Henry Rifle presented to US Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles by The New Haven Arms Company. Welles served under President Lincoln, distinguished himself as a political leader nationally, and was one of the organizers of the Republican Party. Secretary Welles was also instrumental in the creation of the Navy s Medal of Honor.Using original photos and hand drawings of the Gideon Welles Serial Number 9 as reference, the master plate used in the creation of the new Silver Eagle pattern was hand cut for production with full coverage on both sides of the receiver cover. The Silver Eagle pattern, like the Henry Rifle itself, is one piece of American history without rival. This model is built on the award winning Henry Golden Boy platform. The rifle features a traditional 20 octagonal barrel outfitted with buckhorn sights; a gunsmithing masterpiece that closely mirrors its legendary predecessors, the original Henrys when they were patented in 1860. MSRP:  899.95"

This makes follow up shots The pistol has seen 150 rounds of 147gr FMJ and has been extremely accurate for me and friends who've shot it. One time, I jokingly stood up at my buddy's ranch, took aim at a 10"" steel target 100 yards away; We were all amazed when it only took 2 rounds before I put 2 more on targeted.Pistol will include everything as I received it from Walther (case, manual, lock, factory test target, speed loader, 3 sizes of backstraps to adjust the grip to better fit your hand, and 2 15rd magazines), as well as a black Blackhawk Serpa Holster with paddle and belt loop attachments.I'm selling to finance a rifle suppressor.I can meet any evening after 6pm in North Austin, or a little further out on Tuesdays and Sundays."

Caliber .30-06 Springfield. Additional pictures here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/j8r0photbk0crqj/AAAsJxs-kveaE2d6oDYqo7DRa?dl=0It has a smooth action and is in great working condition. Only ~40 rounds have gone through it since I acquired it in a trade several years ago. It's always been a lot of fun to shoot. I can't tell you how many rounds have gone through it in its lifetime. The stock is unfinished and has no recoil pad/buttplate. I believe the wood is walnut. Other than the following blemishes: slight scratch on the barrel, slight wear on the lever action, and corrosion on the front sight, the bluing looks in good order. The markings are very clear and as far as I can tell, all the parts are original. I have taken good care of it while I've owned it (cleaned, oiled etc.). The condition listed is how I received it. I'd be willing to trade for anything interesting, rifle or handgun. I'd accept cash too. My heart's desire is a Sig-Sauer P6 (it was the West German police gun of the 1970's; a single stack 9mm Luger). But I know that is a random request. So message me with an offer and lets made a deal."

$480 obo. in cash.
Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific up front as it makes it a lot easier.  I don't mind questions at all(cash buyers no problem), but please don't string things along with 10-20 messages only to offer a crap trade in the end.  State the details up front if it's a trade, so I can tell you if I am interested or not.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  A few things I might use or use more of:  
Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts(no std. triggers wanted), nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  FosTech Echo trigger.
Quality stamped AK-47 with side rail for optic mount, preferably with a nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock would be a plus.  I really like the RAS47 with the nicer trigger groups and Zhukov furniture, but I've read about too many problems with their cast trunnions an bad/faulty rivets.
Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" model only.
Maybe a quality 9mm or 45ACP pistol with ""arm brace"", Ideally a good deal on a Sig MPX Gen 2 with folding arm brace or similar, so I can change out the trigger easily, I like nice triggers, otherwise, I would consider the CZ Scorpion or others.  Maybe a KRISS in either caliber.  I want something with a good trigger, so thinking a piston AR 9mm pistol will be easiest and best value, again, I want something compact.  
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56, Federal preferred.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech or Vortex magnifier, maybe two Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle and 1-2 with 7.62x39 reticle.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship for $30 more.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

None of the shims were used and there was no filing done to the trigger pack as it dropped right into my lower. Buffer spring was installed and uninstalled at the same time so it has seen minimal use. The trigger functioned as advertised but I preordered the echo which why I am selling this (I do not want to have mod my .22 conversion kit to use with this one with .22 so it goes).

I will consider a trade for a compact 9x19mm handgun or a 16"" 5.56 NATO AR-15 upper, possibly other trades, doesn't hurt to ask."

$800 FIRM for the upper and scope or better in trade.  This upper runs $575 right now before tax or shipping($640+/-).  The scope and rings sold for over $400 before any fees.
I can add a Rock River lower with RRA 2-stage trigger, Magpul PRS stock(can swap with FDE PRS or sell for $180), Hogue grip and Ambi safety for $550.  This lower set-up runs over $600 before any fees.
Spike's complete lower $300.  Again, no hurry to get rif of my lowers right now.
Other items shown are:  DPMS std. black stock, I can swap on the Spike's lower, BCM B5 FDE add $40($60 new), Magpul MOE SL FDE add $40($60 new), Magpul MOE FDE, MOE K2 FDE and Blackhawk black grip add $20 for either.  The RRA OD Green A2 stock kit is for .308, $60.
Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific up front as it makes it a lot easier.  I don't mind questions at all(cash buyers no problem), but please don't string things along with 10-20 messages only to offer a crap trade in the end.  State the details up front if it's a trade, so I can tell you if I am interested or not.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  A few things I might use or use more of:  
Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts(no std. triggers wanted), nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  FosTech Echo trigger.
Quality stamped AK-47 with side rail for optic mount, preferably with a nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock would be a plus.  I really like the RAS47 with the nicer trigger groups and Zhukov furniture, but I've read about too many problems with their cast trunnions an bad/faulty rivets.
A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Maybe a quality 9mm or 45ACP pistol with ""arm brace"", Ideally a good deal on a Sig MPX Gen 2 with folding arm brace or similar, so I can change out the trigger easily, I like nice triggers, otherwise, I would consider the CZ Scorpion or others.  Maybe a KRISS in either caliber.  I want something with a good trigger, so thinking a piston AR 9mm pistol will be easiest and best value, again, I want something compact.  
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56, Federal preferred.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech or Vortex magnifier, maybe two Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle and 1-2 with 7.62x39 reticle.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship for $30 more.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

It is in excellent condition, only 2 mags worth of .40 and 2 mags worth of 9mm ammo have been shot through it. I bought this because I like the Beretta line, and this is an amazing pistol, but I don't need it right now. So, I'm putting it up for sale/trade so I can get something I want/need more. Gun comes with the typical stuff, box, lock, papers etc. as well as (2) 12-round .40SW factory magazines. Gun finish is excellent, it's not been carried, so no holster wear and it's been kept in a rack away from other guns. Action is smooth, trigger is nice. Cleaned and lubed her after the only and only trip to the range and she has sat in the rack in the safe since. A great carry gun, bedside gun, BUG gun or just fun range gun. The size and weight really make .40SW fun to shoot.In addition, I'm including a Beretta OEM 9mm barrel and (3) 18-round 9mm Mecgar magazines. To run 9mm in this pistol, simply swap the barrel and use the 9mm magazines. It shoots both .40SW and 9mm really well. If you like to have some flexibility with your guns, like I do, this is a nice option to have.So, I'm interested in trade or sale. My trade interests are very limited - I'm looking for a decent AR15 at about the same price point, so a mid-range model. I'm not a fan of the A2 style - no fixed stocks, no carry handles. I prefer flat tops and I do like Magpul equipment. Probably don't want a full, weighs a ton quad rail out front. 16-18"" barrel is about where I want to be, nothing too long or too heavy. If you have something to offer, let me know what you have and please be prepared to send photos.If you wish to buy instead, my cash price is $750, buyer pays transfer/BGC. Trade value is the same - if we trade, we'll each pay our transfer/BGC fees. For Washington residents, I'm willing to head up to Vancouver for the transfer. Price includes the stock pistol as well as the 9mm barrel and magazines.I am willing to ship out of state from my FFL to yours. Buyer pays additional transfer/shipping fee. Payment only via PayPal or US Post office issued Postal Money Order. I will not accept checks of any kind. Use the ""Contact Seller"" button to reach me.

Revolver was manufactured around 1996, has the PN serial number prefix. The finish appears to the the sought after bright stainless, I am unsure if it came from Colt this way or was polished later. All emblems and stamping are crisp with no obvious buff marks or smears which would support being a factory finish. This revolver has been fired and has a few very light marks in various places, the satin finish on the top of the barrel has a little discoloration that would suggest the plastic on the case has rubbed the rib. Muzzle shows a few very minor scuffs where the case has rubbed against it. Action is silky smooth as you would expect on a Python. I believe this handgun would be an easy 85-90% condition.

All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory. Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.
