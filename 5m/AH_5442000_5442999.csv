Put an XD® Mod.2™ in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact.

I have shot this firearm approximately 300 times, and it has been cleaned and lubricated after every range trip. Along with the firearm, this sale includes the original sig case, an extra 12 round sig magazine (total of three), and a Galco Triton IWB kydex holster. This weapon is also outfitted from the factory with siglite night sites. I am asking $600.00 which is a steel for this gun, as it is basically new. I am looking for cash only, as I am trying to fund another suppressor. I am located in Flat Rock, MI but am willing to drive within reason to meet. Must have purchase permit or MI-CPL."

$400 firm in cash.I might consider trades, but not in need of anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.
A few things I would not mind having back-ups for or extras would be, Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it.  Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts kits without trigger parts, nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" model only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty now, so not in need of any specific caliber.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics like Eotech and Aimpoints with nice magnifiers, just give me the model and trade details.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship insured for to your FFL for $40(handguns must be Overnight UPS) more and must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

Serious shooters who care about the details welcomed the precision features that made the Range Officer® perform far beyond its price tag. We insisted on the best components and manufacturing techniques, like forged national match frames and slides, both features found on our top end 1911 models. A gun is only as good as its barrel, so we didn’t skimp there either. We added a national match stainless steel barrel and precisely fit bushing for maximum accuracy. Many of those competition gun customers couldn’t help wonder why we didn’t make a self-defense version of the 1911 Range Officer®, so we did – in both 9mm and .45ACP calibers. New for 2016 is the 1911 Range Officer® Operator® model. We’ve kept the same great “under the hood” features that made the original Range Officer® great, but added features to turn this pistol into a formidable self-defense pistol for carry or home use. The five inch barrel with fully supported ramp provides an extended sight radius, making your job of getting fast hits on target even easier. Speaking of sights, the front is a shielded fiber optic tube while the rear is a low profile combat style that won’t snag during the draw. There’s no reason a functional combat gun can’t look good. The 1911 Range Officer® Operator® sports a Parkerized finish that looks sharp and will ward off corrosion and rust. Checkered Cocobolo grips provide a firm hold without shredding carry holsters and clothes. Serious 1911 fighting features are all there too. The classic flat mainspring housing is checkered for positive grip, and the extended beavertail safety includes a memory bump for positive activation. Add a long aluminum match grade trigger, skeletonized hammer, and rail for light or laser and this pistol is good to go. When it’s time to get down to business, place your trust in a gun that’s built for the task. Try the Range Officer® Operator®.

The scope is by AIM with a 4x zoom tri illuminated reticle. The mags are range mags they do just fine going to the range but they aren't something that's gonna just fall out when you press the mag release like a steel mag so keep that in mind if you wind up in combat any time soon for some unfortunate reason you have to actually pull the mag unlike a steel mag. Great rifle though I wouldn't be selling it if there any other way but it has to go. No exact count but it has less than 2000 rounds through it for sure, maybe less than 1500 rounds."

Traditional side ejection is not ambidextrous and forward ejection, like in the Kel-Tec RFB, is quite complex.The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. The bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower full auto rate (when applicable).The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies. Bolt, bolt carrier, firing mechanism, ejector chute and bolt stop are identical for all variations. The short stroke gas operated piston is fully adjustable for different ammunitions and muzzle attachments.Caliber 5.56mm NATOBarrel Length 17.4""Overall Length 27.4""Weight Empty 7 lbs.Semi Auto THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST 200 MADE BY KELTEC STILL IN ITS ORIGINAL BOX WITH MANUAL, MAG, SLING.

I'm not sure Ruger ever actually built on like this which is a shame given how handy it is. It started out as a birdshead 44 mag New Vaquero and I replaced the grip frame with a standard Vaquero plow handle frame. The black grips are genuine black water buffalo horn . This gun shoots to point of aim and is among my most accurate Rugers. The Birdshead grip frame was almost unusable with manum level loads. It's just right now. 3 3/4"" long barrel, Stainess steel with Montado style hammer and even though it is actually built on the ""old"" frame Ruger decided to market it as a ""New Vaquero"" . I am lost as to what Ruger is thinking sometimes. In any case its a great gun that shoots the nastiest of 44 mag loads.. The original grip frame is available with the gun and the Giraffe bone and original grip panels for $750. With both grips and frames its $850."

I put in a new barrel to see if I could get a better group. It's very easy to put the original barrel back in. It does not have the original issue clip. The original clip is two tone in color. You can find them on other auction sites for around $45-$75. There is a small blemish above the trigger. Other than that, the gun has a great overall patina and has no rust or pits. The gun still shoots great. The serial number is 88745 which dates back to 1914. The lower gun is also a Colt .45 from the same era. Sometime over the years, it had been sent to an armorer for reissue. Where it was refurbished and reblued. There is an armorers stamp on the trigger guard. This pistol is considered a ""lunch box special"". It was smuggled from the factory and assembled at home prior to any serial numbers being stamped. It has brass sites. No original holster or clip. There is a functional clip in both guns. Just not the original issue. Asking $2500 for the pair. Or will sell separately. $1500 for the original issue with holster and $1000 for the lunch box special. Both are great shooters and function flawlessly.

It is a refurb, dont let the bolt fool you as I polished it up nice and shiny *GASP* BLASPHEMY I know! This rifle is a joy to shoot, I was hitting steel at 100 yards with the irons off a bench.

Would be a good candidate for a cerakote job.This would work great as a swap on 9mm conversion for a 40 caliber Beretta 96, or as simply an extra complete slide for any full size Beretta 90 series pistol.  This will also work without issue on any ""A1"" model Beretta frame (92A1, 96A1, M9a1), though there will be a gap between the frame and dust cover.  Have run it on my 96A1 without issue.  Only selling because I have picked up a new G slide for my Beretta and no longer need it.Will sell it for $250.  Not really interested in any trades except for maybe a complete AR15 lower (No polymer),  or possibly other AR15 build components (would like a barreled upper assembly with 18-20 inch barrel).If interested feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3, texts will get the fastest response from me. Thanks!"
