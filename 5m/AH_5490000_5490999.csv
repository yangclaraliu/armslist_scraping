Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Very similar to the P-01, the PCR uses the same alloy frame minus the light rail, making it even more concealable. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger pull is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.Product Name  CZ 75 PCR – 9mm   SKU  01194   Firearm Type  Handgun   Purpose  Concealed Carry  Chambering  9mm Luger   Magazine Capacity  10   Magazine Type  Double Stack   Frame  Aluminum (7075 T6)   Grips  Rubber   Trigger Mech  DA/SA   Sights  Snag-Free Fixed 3-Dot   Barrel  Cold Hammer Forged   Barrel Length  3.8   Weight  1.71 lbs   Overall Length  7.24 in   Height  5.03 in   Width  1.38 in We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.
Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.
Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.
Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.
Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.
Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8″ twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2″-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.
Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.
Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.
Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.
Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.
Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul® PMAG®."

This Kimber 45 has a 460 Rowland conversion custom installed and fitted, extra polished feed ramp, custom fit Trijicon adjustable night sights. Complete main spring housing change, Blued and polished. The barrels are easily changed and the main spring is 24 lbs on the 460 Rowland but I have fired the 45 ACP in the 460 with the 24# spring and it functioned well. The 460 has the power of a .44 Magnum on a 1911 frame. With 185 gr, bullets you get 1500+ FPS and with 230 gr, you get 1400+ FPS. Two Magazines come with the gun. This is an excellent hunting handgun. I have over 200, 460 rounds to go with it and a holster if you want it, and a pouch for storage. This gun has been upgraded to a value of about $1700.00
If you are not familiar with the 460 Rowland, it uses 45 ACP brass that is slightly longer than the regular 45ACP brass and will not chamber in the regular 45 ACP  barrel. The 45 will chamber and fire in the 460 Rowland barrel. The same magazines can be used for both 45 & 460 rounds. The bullet lengths are the same, just the 460 brass is longer and more power charge is loaded. This can all be researched on Youtube and that is what I did before undertaking this project.
If a trade is possible you would need to add a bit of cash. I have more pictures if you are interested.
 
The gun comes with two barrels, the 460 is in the gun. extra springs, Custom Grips and a pair of Magpul 1911 grips, custom lug wrench for the 460, about 250 rounds of 460 Rowland and 3 Magazines, and a zipper cover for the gun.

Other than that the knife is in perfect, razor sharp condition.  (The clip on the Halo V is just a stickey-back clip I added) The knife is sold alone, box and accessories went missing in my move to Indiana. The Cold Steel Tai-Pan is one of the nicest Dagger style knives on the market, highly reveared and getting harder to find.

Put an XD® Mod.2™ in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.

Read More   The XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact Model is an amazingly slim and ergonomic pistol that packs even more amazing capacity. Featuring the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry. From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry’s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact offers 9+1 rounds of .45ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension™ magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3” barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal. Like all XD®s, the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol. And of course, GripZone™ ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2™ apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you’ll probably find that you’ve got a new favorite to carry.   Read Less     Share           Specs   Caliber .45ACP Recoil System Captive Recoil Spring with Full Length Guide Rod Sights Fiber Optic Front and Low Profile Combat Rear Weight (with Empty Magazine) 26 ozs. w/ Compact Mag, 27 ozs. w/ X-Tension™   Height 4.75"" w/ Compact Mag, 5.5"" w/ X-Tension™ Slide Forged Steel, Melonite® Finish Barrel 3.3"" Hammer Forged, Steel, Melonite® / 1:16 Twist Length 6.5""   Grip Width 1.20"" Frame Black Polymer Magazines 1 - 9 Round Compact, 1 - 13 Round w/ X-Tension™, Stainless Steel       Options    - See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/xd-mod-2-3-sub-compact-45acp/#sthash.2FJfPnlz.dpuf"
