The FEG was made in Budapest, Hungary. This is an all steel pistol and made in the early 2000’s and imported by KBI. FEG filed for bankruptcy in 2005 so these guns are getting harder to find. Comes with a 6 round magazine and DeSantis IWB leather holster as well as 25 round of 380 FMJ ammo. I found a manual an aftermarket booklet for detailed working on the gun. Very clean with no loss of the nice blueing or holster. Shoots great but just trying to thin my FEG pistols to fund another project.
Must have current CPL and be willing to meet at my local police station. I am not an FFL but will ship thru my FFL for $30.

It opens with the patented SpeedSafe assisted opening system. The blade deploys quickly and easily, even in gloves, using the ambidextrous flipper. The ZT 0350TS’s blade is S30V stainless steel with tiger-stripe Tungsten DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coating. The S30V steel is extremely durable, corrosion resistant, and wear resistant. In addition to providing a camouflaged surface, the DLC coating offers additional blade hardness and reduces friction. 
This high-performance S30V blade is paired with textured black G-10 scales for a secure grip and excellent mechanical strength even under the roughest conditions. The scales are flat rather than 3D machined and contoured like those of the 0300. A locking liner secures the blade during use. The 0350TS also includes ZT’s quad-mount system for complete versatility.
Mount the pocketclip in any of four ways: tip-up, tip-down, on the left side, or the right. There’s a pre-drilled lanyard hole for users who prefer to attach a lanyard."

This particular rifle looks like it was actually issued post refurb, so it's not the super glossy lam stock. This M44 does not have the cleaning rod, kit or sling. Just the rifle. Decent condition. Bore is frosty, like most. I checked the headspace and shot 10 rounds to check it out, cleaned it and put it up. Ran both the surplus and premium ammo through it. The premium brass cased / boxer primed ammo is definitely more accurate and cleaner. Shoots either ammo just fine. If you need the requisite loud report and accompanying  three foot fireball, this is the rifle for you! Always fun to shoot a Mosin! Asking $300. Price is based on current GunBroker prices with a laminated stock, minus the hassle of shipping costs, since this is local. C&R collectors always invited to inquire, but all deals will work with a Missouri resident bill of sale and the signed document that you aren't a bad guy with a record that says you can't have toys that go bang any more. Might work some cash / trade deal, but need at least $200 cash as part of the deal."

The new Flat Faced Forward Set Trigger delivers a feel and performance of a factory 1911 type trigger at an approximate weight of 3.0 to 4.0 lbs.  Designed to work in any Smith & Wesson M&P model pistol in a centerfire caliber(excluding Shield), the Apex Flat Faced Forward Set Trigger Kit reduces trigger pre-travel and over-travel, while allowing the shooter to position their finger at an increased leverage point lower on the trigger face to take advantage of lower trigger pull weights.
Included in the full kit are the Apex Forward Set Sear which shortens the stroke of the trigger by dropping the striker at a point farther forward than the factory sear.  The Ultimate Striker Block produces a smoother trigger pull and eliminates most false reset issues through an improved radius on the striker block face.  The Forward Set Springs kit produces a trigger pull of 3.0 to 4.0 lbs, depending on which trigger return spring is insalled.  Requires the use of the sear housing block designed for the large size sear plunger and spring(current production as of June, 2011)  NOT recommended for duty/carry application"

They first appeared on the market in 1994 as a more compact alternative to the full-sized Beretta 92 service pistol in order to offer a compromise between concealability, ease of carry, accuracy and firepower.
It was originally developed for the .40 S&W cartridge, which was a new cartridge at the time. It was later also manufactured chambered for 9x19mm Parabellum, .357 SIG and .45 ACP. European models were also offered in 9x21mm IMI and .41 AE to comply with local laws prohibiting the use of military cartridges by civilians.
Beretta Cougar 8000 series pistols are recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols. These pistols use a relatively rare rotating barrel locking system, in which the barrel rotates on recoil to unlock itself from the slide. The rotating motion of the barrel is controlled by the stud on its bottom, which follows the cam track in the steel frame insert.
The frame is made from lightweight aluminum alloy. The basic version of the Cougar pistol is the F model, with a double-action/single-action (DA/SA) trigger, exposed hammer, and ambidextrous safety/decocker levers located on the slide. The G configuration is also a DA/SA design, but with a decocker-only lever instead of the combined manual safety/decocker lever. The D configuration is double-action only (DAO) with a spurless hammer and no safety/decocker levers. Cougar pistols use double-stack magazines in the 9x19mm Parabellum, .357 SIG and .40 S&W models, and single-stack magazines in the .45 ACP models.
This gun is Like New and in excellent condition. The only wear on this pistol is on the face of the hammer itself. This gun is definitely worth checking out! We can also e-mail better pictures of the gun if needed.Survival Instinct3346 Mather Field RoadRancho Cordova, CA 95670REDACTED"

World War II manufacturers and inspection stamps[edit] The first weapons produced for the German army were marked with the Walther Arms banner on the left side of the slide. In 1940 the Walther banner was replaced by a secret code to indicate the manufacturer. The Germans feared that markings like the Walther banner would make it quite easy for the Allies to determine the weapon production sites and bomb them. Therefore, at the beginning of 1940 the pistols produced by the Walther plant were marked with the secret code ""480"" to indicate Walther as the manufacturer. This secret code was replaced after two months (and 7,200 pistols manufactured) with the new secret code ""ac"" and several weeks after changing the code, it was decided to include the last two digits of the year of manufacture directly under ""ac"". A handful of ""ac41"" P38s have been found with the death's head (Totenkopf) symbol on the right side of the slide however it is speculation if these markings are wartime applied. In the latter part of 1941, the finish was changed from a high gloss blue to a dull blue, obviously to enhance cost effectiveness, as the pressure of a wartime economy began to affect Germany's industrial potential.[5] During the Nazi period 584,500 P38 pistols were produced by the Carl Walther plant in Zella-Mehlis, Thuringia, Germany. Production was stopped when the American forces captured the plant in April 1945. Weapons produced had to be inspected before they were delivered to the German Army. After approval the weapons were stamped with an inspection stamp (Waffenamt). The Walther Waffenamt inspection stamp consisted of an eagle above the number 359 (E/359). The increasing demand for P38 pistols resulted in two more manufacturers in 1942, Mauser and Spreewerk. The Mauser plant in Oberndorf, Baden-Württemberg, Germany produced 323,000 P38 pistols during the Nazi period and those pistols were stamped with the secret code ""byf"" to indicate Mauser as the manufacturer. At the beginning of 1945 the secret code ""byf"" was replaced by the new secret code ""SVW"" (in upper case letters). The factory was captured in April 1945 by the French military. With the captured machines and stocks of existing Walther P38 parts at this plant kept as war reparations, the French firm Manurhin manufactured these pistols between Jun 1945 and 1946 in contravention of previously agreed upon Allied regulations. The French pistols had steel grips, an overall gray parkerized finish and were marked with the Mauser production stamp ""SVW"" and the addition of a French ""Rounded Star"" stamp on the right side of the slide which indicated a pressure/proof of ""Ordinary Smokeless Proof (Powder ""T"") Pressure"". Ironically, many of these P38s were sent to Indochina and ended up in the hands of members of the French Foreign Legion who had served in the Wehrmacht during the war. These pistols are nicknamed ""Gray Ghost P38s"" due to their appearance.[6] The initial Mauser Waffenamt inspection stamp consisted of an eagle above the number 135 (E/135) and changed at the end of 1943 to (E/WaA135).       ""P.38"" model identification mark and Spreewerk ""cyq"" manufacturer's code on slide of P.38 pistol.         ""Eagle over 88"" Waffenamt inspection mark on frame of Spreewerk produced P.38 pistol.   The Spreewerk administration headquarters was based in Spandau, Berlin, however its production plant; initially a textile mill.;[7] was located in Hradek nad Nisou (formerly Grottau), Bohemia, Czechoslovakia and called Werk Grottau. Spreewerk was tasked as the third manufacturer of P38 pistols at the end of 1942 and assigned the secret code ""cyq"" This stamp was applied by hand after the metal bluing process. There are a number of P38s marked ""cvq"" leading to speculation that they could be damaged Spreewerk stamps with a broken tail off the ""y"", or an additional Spreewerk production sequence series,[7] or perhaps an unknown fourth manufacturing plant. Generally speaking the Spreewerk P38s were of rougher quality than those from Walther or Mauser. An asterisk stamped on any component of a Spreewerk P38 indicates a part designated as a repairable reject. Except for the locking block and sear, all other parts on any Spreewerk P38 were given a dull blue finish by means of a hot salt bluing process. Fabrique Nationale (FN) began providing frames to Spreewerk at the end of 1944 and these frames are marked either with FN's Waffenamt eagle over ""140"" (E/140) or with ""MI"" or ""m"" on the left front trigger guard. Spreewerk produced 283,080 pistols before being captured by the Soviet military in April 1945. Approximately 100 pistols were produced under supervision of the Soviet (00-series) before production was stopped and the factory was disassembled. The Spreewerk Waffenampt inspection stamp consisted of an eagle above the number 88 (E/88).[8] These three factories produced a total of approximately 1.2 million P38 pistols. All wartime military P38's were marked with the Reichsadler Eagle stamp, whereas non-military commercial models were stamped with the commercial eagle proof.[9] During World War II the Heereswaffenamt acquired P38 components from several captured factories. Bohmische Waffenfabrik, AG (Ceska Zbrojovka) in Prague, Czechoslovakia made barrels for both Walther and Spreewerk. Fabrique Nationale (FN) in Liege, Belgium built 4,720 P38 frames and 2,272 slides between August 1943 and September 1944. Spreewerk also had a second factory near Werk Grottau called Werk Kratzau, producing primarily ammunition and magazines. Magazines were also produced in Dolni Poustevna, Czechoslovakia by Erste Nordböhmische Metallwarenfabrik (code jvd). There is absolutely no documentation that Walther, Mauser or Spreewerk ever made even so much as a prototype short-barrel P38, or that pistols of this type were ever fielded by the Gestapo or the Waffen SS. Those offered for sale usually have had the banner applied by a pantograph and are completely counterfeit.[5] During the early and mid 1990s, large quantities of these wartime pistols captured by the Soviets on the Eastern Front were imported to the United States. All of these pistols had been ""dipped,"" which means reblued without first polishing to remove defects. Most of them, in accordance with the Gun Control Act of 1968, have importers' marks prominently displayed on their barrels, although some do not. Further, these pistols can usually be distinguished by a black oxide finish that's suspiciously consistent on every single one of the components. Most were inspected and re-finished at the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant in Izhevsk, Soviet Union. For most of the World War II military P38 pistols, it is fairly easy to determine the production date from the markings on the pistol (manufacturer + serial number + prefix/suffix letter). You can access a guide from the footnote URL where all the production dates for these pistols can be found.[10] [11] Additional Credits given to those who have worked hundreds and thousands of hours researching and compiling this historical data: [7] [11] [12]"
