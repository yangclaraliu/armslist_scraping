The Savage 12 Palma rifle is a beautiful gun and a tremendous tool for long range precision.  The rifle has a 30"" stainless barrel, an overall length of 49.75"", and it is chambered in .308.  The rifle has an adjustable comb, adjustable length of pull (LOP), and an adjustable cheek riser.  It also comes equipped with an adjustable Accutrigger that may be adjusted from 1.5 lbs. to 6 lbs.  This rifle also comes with a Seekins Precision 1 piece rail affixed to the top of the rifle.  I purchased this rifle new from Savage in November of 2015 for just over $2,100, but with few opportunities to shoot, much less do any shooting at a reasonable distance, I've decided to sell the rifle to someone who may have an opportunity to enjoy it.  I have shot the rifle on one occasion at the range and loved it but I do not get enough opportunities to shoot at any distance.  This is the only use the rifle has seen and it is in perfect condition.  The rifle comes in its box with the manual and any items that came with the rifle.  Please contact me if you'd like to take a look in person.I am primarily interested in selling though I will consider select trades.  Glock 19s (Gen 3 or Gen 4) are of particular interest to me while I've listed a few other items that I may also have an interest in trading for below.  The price for any trades or trades plush cash shall be $1,300.  Aside from those items listed below, you are welcome to inquire, but I am likely not interested.

$1,060 in cash or better in trade value.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.

Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.  
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

$580 in cash.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.  I can add??
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

Makes for an amazing long range and close range rig. As you can see the stock has been stained ebony, which I then attached a picatinny rail to the forend and put a folding pistol grip on. This isn't just some funny, cut up POS. This thing shoots. Incredible actually. It went from a 2moa gun at 100yds to about a 1/2"" moa gun at 100yds. The second picture is of a 14 shot group at 100yds(2 full mags) Comes with 2 magazines$150 firm takes it today only!"

There are two units, I will refer to them as Unit 1 and Unit 2. Both units are near identical. Each will come with a fast base jump helmet, Norortos back plate adapter to fit the helmet, a TATM mount, and Norotos Dual dovetail adapator. The helmets will have peltor arc rail adaptors, 2 different hard plastic NVG carriers as well as the cloth military carrier, IR strobe light as well as your standard rhino mount and j arm and rifle mount. Description bellow. I want to sell as a package deal, however I will split it up, one way and that’s someone contacts me about 1 unit and wants it then we wait until the second sells and I will ship both out at the same time. First buyer would get choice of unit, pelican 1400 case, and full mil surplus gear. I will list them as units below for simplicity. I can also include a peltor comtac unit for each helmet to go with the adaptors. They would come with the PTT and will plug into a Motorola unit. If it’s a package deal ill include them for $500. One is a dual comtac and the other is currently a single mic. If bought individually I will include for $300 a piece. There is also a Meopta Galaxy 4 adaptor plate to take pictures through the NVGs or spotting scopes. Please use email for quickest response as I don’t always check my PMs. I will respond as quick as I can. I will not accept paypal on these two items, mainly looking for usps money orders. I have various IR devices I can sell with these units for handguns and rifles that you can ask about if you buy these units. If you buy local Ill even include a bunch of AA batteries for you. Unit 1. It’s a TNVC PVS 14 autogated, manual gain Gen 3, built in October 2012. Data sheet included. It is the crispest NVG I have ever looked through and I don’t even see any blemishes and none are listed on the data sheet. It has the wilcox demist lense, wilcox amber lense, and aimpoint flip up cover installed. It will come with a Flecktarn, its plasti dipper and painted so you can peal it off to the original Coyote base jump helmet with peltor arc rail adaptor, worn some but not dirty or smelly. It will have the Norotos backplate adaptor, TATM with Norotos dual dovetail adaptor.IR strobe, green and black hard plastic carrier, meopta Glaxy 4 adaptor, extra demist shields and the USGI carrier. The USGI carrier will include a skull crusher, compass, rhino mount, j arm, rifle mount, soft plastic lense cover, scope style rear lense cover, PVS 14 manual, and pelican 1400 case. Asking $3100 OBO Unit 2. Its a ITT Gen 3 PVS 14 autogated, with manual gain. It was built the 9th week of 2006 and has a KM power supply. It was sent out and returned last year to TNVC for a couple updates as it had been usedalot since it was bought. As seen in the pic the serial number sticker no longer is on it but the information was gotten through the quality and mfg marking on the inside. When TNVC refreshed it I had them install a new battery housing assembly, eye piece retaining ring, now a modern thread on kind, and a new eye piece lens assembly. This is an older unit so the tube just isn’t as bright as a brand new but it still works great. Just need to run the manual gain a little higher than a new one, I also don’t run the amber filter on it. This unit has blemishes, see pic. It currently has the GI eye cup installed with a wilcox demist shield and flip up aimpoint cover on the front. This kit includes multicam base jump helmet brand new never fitted. Norotos back plate on the TATM, Norotos dual dovetail with extra adjustable mount as well as the USGI Rhino mount and j arm. IR strobe, as well as a black and green plastic hard case for the unit. It also will include a wilcox amber lense, USGI carrier with rifle mount, sacrificial window, and hard plastic lense covers. Asking $2400 OBOThanks for looking and email me your email or number and Ill get you pics out if you want to see them.Tyler"

It comes with the wooden stock holster with cleaning rod and a reproduction leather Berliner No. 39 bandolier style holster. I also have a couple springs, a bolt I believe and firing pin. I wont charge you for those but will throw them in as I m not sure what all extras I haave for it. Also includes 10 stripper clips, one is messed up on the end and only holds 9 rounds. Aswell as just over 200 rounds. $800"

This isn't from one of the recent batches being sold, it bears no import marks and came in this country before 1989 (That I am absolutely sure of). Bore and chamber are in impeccable condition, Deep strong shiny rifling with 0 pitting of any kind. Action is incredibly slick and easy to operate. It also accepts and feeds from stripper clips properly (No need to use the top round as leverage, you just insert and push down on the rounds). Stock is very nice with absolutely no cracks or repairs. This is not an Arsenal refinished rifle. Super accurate, overall I'd rate it at about 90% Condition wise which is being generous. You will never see an imported type 53 in this condition..A Showpiece as well as a strong shooter. Included is a few rounds of ammunition, some loaded on some stripper clips, a Russian ammo pouch, Original chinese military sling. This is not a beater Mosin, any Mosin Nagant collector who knows the slightest about them knows the true worth of this rifle. I am located in NKY and will only meet in NKY. I am not looking for any trades really, but I do like Tip-up Berettas. Cash is king."

The chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of cleaning, and the deeply-recessed combat muzzle crown protects the rifling. The open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows one cartridge at a time to be loaded should the magazine be lost or damaged. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table or door. Beretta's exclusive Bruniton non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear-resistant finish, and the reversible magazine release is positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. The 92 FS pistol is the most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history, and this model is made in Italy."

Well, what I would like is to sell this one, and pursue a single stack pistol- something lighter and easier to conceal. I paid over $500 (more like $550 after all was said and done).
