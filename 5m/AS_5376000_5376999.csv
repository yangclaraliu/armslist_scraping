Born of necessity, raised in the Army's Markmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available.The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible. This, along with being salt bath nitride finished, equates to unprecedented accuracy and durability. The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM. The MK12 gas block is precision Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation.

97,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5376097,For Sale/Trade:  PVS-14 Gen 3 Autogated Night Vision Monocular w/ accessories,"NW, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma","$ 2,500","Listed On: Tuesday, April 12, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a PVS-14 Gen 3 night vision monocular in lightly used condition. As you can see from the picture, it produces an exceptionally clear image with virtually no spots or blemishes, meaning it was probably hand selected for tube quality (it is within specs for even a new $3600 unit to have a few black spots around the edge of the image, which this one doesn't have). For reference, the neighbors' house in the pic is about 60-80 yards away. The dark pic is what the same scene looks like to the naked eye.This unit appears to be autogated -- it dims when pointed at a bright light, which prevents tube damage. This unit comes with a dual battery housing, which gives it a longer battery life than the single battery units (65 hours continual use as opposed to 40 hours). It takes AA batteries.I was told by the previous owner that this unit has only been used for a few hours... the condition of the unit and quality of the image is definitely consistent with that. I have used it less than an hour myself, so it has the vast majority of its service life left, and will provide many good years of service.I was also told by the previous owner that this unit has an Omni tube, meaning it is mil spec and that unlike the ITT/Pinnacle tubes, it is rated for .308 recoil.It comes with the pictured accessories, which include the attached lens cover/pinhole lens (for testing the unit in regular lighting), a J-arm mount (used for mounting to a helmet or ""skull crusher"" headgear), as well as a weapon mount, for mounting the unit on a Picatinny rail either behind or in front of AR-height optics. It works great behind my Aimpoint PRO or Comp M4. It also works great in front of a scope that can adjust down to 1x.Get this very clean Gen 3 night vision unit in great condition for over $1,000 less than a new one would cost, or for the same as you would pay for a Gen 2 unit, if you want to think of it that way. If you have never used Gen 3 night vision, let's just say it blows Gen 1 and Gen 2 out of the water in every possible way... it's not even close. A unit like this gives you a massively unfair advantage in any low light situation.I would take $2500 OBO, and would be willing to take a partial trade for the following items:Good long range precision glass, spotting scope with mil reticle, plates, plate carrier, soft armor.I am willing to ship, with the buyer paying.If you can meet me near the Oklahoma City area, I'd be glad to meet you after dark and let you see what this unit is really capable of. You won't be disappointed.I am listing this on other forums/marketplaces, and expect a quick sale. First one to reply agreeing to buy takes it. Email me through this site or text 4o5 88o o5o6."

The series includes the Walther PP, PPK, PPK/S, and PPK/E. Various PP series are manufactured in either Germany, France or the United States.[4] Since 2002, the PPK variant is solely manufactured by Smith & Wesson in Houlton, Maine, United States, under license from Carl Walther GmbH Sportwaffen. In the past, this particular model has been manufactured by Carl Walther in its own factory in Germany, as well as under licenses by Manurhin in Alsace, France, and by Interarms in Alexandria, Virginia, US. The PP and the PPK were among the world's first successful double action semi-automatic pistols and were widely copied, but are still made by Walther. The design inspired other pistols, among them the Soviet Makarov, the Hungarian FEG PA-63, and the Argentinian Bersa Thunder 380. The PP and PPK were both popular with European police and civilians, for being reliable and concealable. During World War II, they were issued to the German military, including the Luftwaffe, as well as the police."

The new Slim Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight saving as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15"" rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with Daniel Defense mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and Keymod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4 V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16"" Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip. Kryptek patterns utilize a multi-directional design to effectively conceal in a multitude of terrains that have either a lateral or vertical flow. The bi-level laying of the patterns incorporate background transitional shading and sharp random geometrical foregrounds to create a three-dimensional effect that ensures the utmost in concealment at both close and long ranges. These components, combined with colorations selected and matched based on input from testing and observations from Operators in the field, make Kryptek patterns optimal for many different enviroments.Materials and Construction  Lower Receiver: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

Always ready to revolutionize the arms industry, Bushmaster returns with their new Carbon 15 line. The Carbon 15 line of rifles and carbines each feature a lightweight receiver constructed from carbon composite, which provides for a product that is 40 percent lighter than comparable firearms with aluminum receivers. This particular model joins the ORC line, which is their new ""optics-ready carbine,"" a line of carbines that ship with optic riser mounts ready for your preferred optic. In some cases, ORC carbines even ship with included optics. Such is the case with the Bushmaster Carbon 15 ORC, which ships with a Bushnell red dot sight that will offer precision targeting during all styles of shooting.
As noted, the Bushmaster Carbon 15 ORC features a 16-inch barrel alongside an overall length of 32 1/2 inches, which can be reduced by four inches via the telescoping stock. Both the 4150 chrome-moly steel barrel (1:9 inch twist rate) and the chamber feature a hard chrome lining, which serves to protect both components from rust and corrosion as well as give them higher resistance to wear and an extended service life. Also included is the aforementioned synthetic six-position telescoping stock. When combined with the light weight of the upper & carbon composite lower receiver,  you get a carbine that weighs in at just 5 1/2 pounds. Additionally, each carbine boasts a heavy oval M4-type handguard. And though the ORC carbine does not include iron sights, it does include a receiver-length Picatinny rail with two 1 1/4 inch optic riser blocks as well as a Bushnell red dot sight. As noted, the Carbon 15 ORC is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO/.223 Remington and includes a single 30-round magazine."

The older CETMEs that Century put together were pretty hit or miss on quality, these new C308s are much more solid. IIRC they're assembled with surplus CETME bolts and furniture with new production receivers and PTR produced lower and barrel.This one in particular is reliable as hell. I've put around 200 rounds through it, most being low powered steel case wolf and tulammo, and it's fed every single one throwing the cases 20 yards every shot (g3 pattern rifles will chew up brass so don't buy this hoping to reload). This rifle has around 4-5 moa with cheap steel ammo and was able to get around 2.5 moa groups with good brass ammo.Comes with 2 surplus 20 round g3 magazines (you can buy them online for $3 each, yeah that's not a typo), only selling because I need room in the safe and already have a FAL.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding ""return-to-zero"" when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new Slim Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15"" rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with Daniel Defense mid-length gas system, which known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4 V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16"" Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip. This rifle is finished in Daniel Defense Tornado Cerakote.Materials and Construction  Lower Receiver: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

A golden twin set fully decked-out and one hell of a package! This is my favorite and prized set! I have TWO Springfield XDm .40s both in original hard case with all the papers, owners manual, etc.. As well as all the accessories that come with when buying new! All branded with the XDm logo, it has the holsters, the double magazine holsters, speed loaders, small/medium/large backstraps, brushes, and everything you see in the pictures! But these 2 ALSO each have 27round extension mags to go along with BOTH of them! As well as the 2 standard 17round mags that come along with both as well! Also, they each BOTH come equipped with Red Laser-Sights as well that are both sighted in to be precision accurate at up to AT LEAST 30-50yards! They are installed in the rear sights of both XDm's and even have THREE separate laser modes! They can deliver either a constant beam of red laser, a flicker-strobe of red laser, and also even has a 5-minute kill setting that will automatically turn off after 5mins in case you forget to turn it off that way it can conserve battery power! They have a simple single-push on/off switch on the sight that ensures these laser-sights won't interfere with your grip or shooting like most lasers can do! They also EACH come with FOUR extra batteries as well so these will last you a LONG time, to say the least! I also still have instruction manual for laser-sights too as well as all the wrenches and tools that came with them! Also have an extra pair of multi-colored neon competition sights that I had on before the Laser-Sights were installed too! Needless to say, this package is COMPLETELY decked out with anything and everything you'd need! And you would also be one hell of a badass if you incorporated these into a double shoulder holster set under each arm! I hate to have to part with them but I am just interested in either selling or trading for something new that will give me that other spark of interest again like these did when I was decking them out! I could go into detail about how much each and every separate numerous item I have included in this package is worth and its value but it'd take another whole paragraph! Easily to say, I have at least $2K in this entire package I have spent overtime, but I am willing to let this all be yours for only just $1,500even! And no, I am not really interested in selling just only one of them either, they are a twin-set so if you are hell-bent on only wanting to buy just one then I am going to charge at least $800-$900 for just one of them!*PRICE DROP*Will sell for just ONLY $1,300cash even!

This was the sidearm carried by officers in the French army. There were two identical models, the 1873 was not blued, and was made for non commissioned officers and had a total production of around 300,000 total. The 1874, pictured here, was far more rare. It was blued, which quite a good bit of the original bluing remains. The 1874 was given to commissioned officers only. It had a total production of only about 27,000, making it very rare today. This particular one was made in 1879. That's right, 147 years ago. Recently, a 1874 in similar in condition sold on an auction site for $1275.00 One sold a couple months before that for $1320.00.
