The Tanfoglio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling.
The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you''ll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot.
You can easily convert your Witness steel or polymer frame pistol to shoot .22 LR, 9x 19mm, 10 mm, .38 Super, .40 S&W, or .45 ACP. No matter what your need, one gun can do it all. No other platform gives you the choices, versatility, and value found in the Tanfoglio Witness. Whether you''re a competitive shooter, firearms enthusiast, or armed professional, the Witness product line can fill all your needs. Quality, value, comfort, accuracy and dependability. EAA Witness...No Limit ! European American Armory is proud to be the exclusive importer of Tanfoglio products in the USA.

The choke was slightly opened but still with full choke dimensions to perform better with modern shotcup Winchester AA trap loads by the previous owner. I bought this at a little gunshop up in Washington state 30+ years ago and it was described as having been owned by an old and very successful trap shooter. I have owned many of the classic American SBTs including Parker, Fox, Smith, Baker, and other Ithacas both Flues and Knicks and this has been the best shooting of all. The release trigger could be converted easily back to a traditional trigger but honestly it will help improve your scores and should be left as is. This is a thinking man's gun. It is currently in my friend's gun shop and must be tranferred to a FFl holder. A rare opportunity to own a gold embellished 5E for the price of a 4E that can dominate your trap field.

The new Walther Softcoil gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. How Walther Softcoil Technology Makes this Pistol a Must-Have The CCP's Softcoil gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.

Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.  Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy.  The .416 Barrett caliber brings new levels of precision shooting to the Model 99. With the enhanced accuracy and increased velocity of the .416 Barrett cartridge, this rifle offers incredible long-range precision.  The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain. Model 99 in action  The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is virtually maintenance-free and the bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.  Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on."

We then add 7 serrations to the front that mirror the rears in both width and depth, however we angle them slightly giving a sleeker look. We do make the serrations a two tiered level as to not weaken the slide at the interface rail while maintaining a uniform depth. We also soften the serrations at the bottom most section of the rail for a more useful grip surface for our non-gloved shooters. We scallop the nose and incorporate fillets at all scallop edges.

Field shotgun that has been fully customized by Taran Tactical Innovations for use in 3-Gun competitions. The gun comes with a 10 round extension tube and these extras:  12 round extention tube with spring from Nordic ($75 value) All of the included Benelli chokes (Cyl, IC, Mod, IM, and Full) with choke wrench Two extra extended chokes from Pure Gold (Spreader and LM) with choke case ($120 value) Matchsaver Product manual   For a list of all the modifications that Taran did to this gun please click this link: http://tarantacticalinnovations.com/tti-m1-m2-upgrade-package/There are minor scratches on the receiver, barrel, and magazine tube extension from grounding the gun during 3-Gun competitions (see pictures). This is all surface wear that won't effect the operation of the gun in the slightest. As a matter of fact, all springs have been switched out in the past 1000 rounds, and the gun has less than 7,000 rounds through it total so it still has many years of life left. It has run like a top for me, but I'm switching sports so I need to liquidate to support my other habits (You know how that goes).

I will sell just the rifle itself(w/o rings) for $1,500 with rings for $1,600, or the whole setup with the Swaro/rings for $2,400. Local pickup only."

Our patented E2 technology brings a new definition to extraction reliability. The Dictator 9-position adjustable gas block, with straight gas tube, let’s you tune this rifle to be as smooth and flat shooting as possible, no matter the ammo load out. At this price, and even well beyond it, you simply will not find features like this on any other rifle.
The 15” Renegade rail with M-LOK compatibility and 4 integrated QD slots provides maximum comfort, hand placement, and accessory mounting options. Topped off with a 16.5” nitride heat treated barrel, you have a 1 MOA guaranteed rifle suited for any patriot.
 
E2 DUAL-EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY
POF’s patented E2 dual-extraction technology consists of four small channels cut into the walls of the chamber allowing a small amount of gas pressure to push against the neck of the spent case. This pressure assists in extraction by breaking the seal between the chamber and case as well as pushing the spent case to the rear as the extractor is pulling to the rear. This removes a tremendous amount of work that would otherwise be left up to the extractor.
 
DICTATOR ADJUSTABLE GAS BLOCK
The DIctator Adjustable Gas Block lets you tune your rifle to the exact operating speed it should be. When your rifle runs too slow, or too fast, it’s more prone to failures. With the DIctator’s 9 adjustable settings and included straight gas tube, you and your rifle are set for just about any situation. So go ahead and suppress it, run different ammo, or don’t. Experience a smoother shooting rifle than ever before. To adjust, use a flat head screwdriver or the included tool.
 
NITRIDE HEAT TREATED BARREL
Proper gas regulation and lubricated mechanics are nothing without the precision and durability of a quality barrel. Our chrome alloy barrels are machined for absolute accuracy. Our barrels are nitride heat-treated for full corrosion resistance.
 
DI BOLT CARRIER GROUP
 
RENEGADE FOREND
Complete modularity of the Renegade and Renegade Plus is achieved by the 14” Renegade Forend. Sleek and rugged mounting system, lightweight, and QD mounts in all the right places – 2 per side. Add to that M-LOK® compatibility on 3 sides and a cut out to easily adjust the DIctator Adjustable Gas Block and your new Renegade rifle is ready to defend, compete, or hunt.
 
HEAT SINK BARREL NUT
Heat is an enemy to firearms. The patented heat sink barrel nut is one of the most significant innovations in battling overheating. It completely encompasses the chamber and throat area of the barrel where expanding gas temperatures peak. Take into account the radiation properties of aluminum compared to traditional steel and you have 17 times more heat dissipation than a standard AR. This also adds a massive amount of rigidity to the overall platform and is critical when vertical fore grips are being pulled on the upper assembly.
 
ANTI-TILT BUFFER TUBE
Our mil-spec aluminum anti-tilt buffer tube features “carrier cradle” extensions to ensure that the carrier is always supported by the buffer tube even when the bolt carrier is fully forward. This prevents carrier tilt and premature wear of the buffer tube. The buffer detent now doubles as a lock that inhibits the buffer tube from rotating and becoming loose under adverse conditions. The anti-tilt buffer tube also features three drain holes"

NOT A NFA ITEM! No 4473 required and can ship directly to your house with no background check required!THE FIRST AND ONLY: The XM42 is the world’s first fully handheld, grab and go flamethrower on the market. No heavy pressurized tanks, no silly car-wash sprayers.ELEGANT & POWERFUL: Developed with both aesthetics and performance in mind, the XM42 excels in all aspects. We wanted to bring a device to the market that represents what a real flamethrower should be.EASY AND FUN: Simple to use, endless possibilities for entertainment and utility. Start your bonfire from across the yard, or kill the weeds between your cracks in style.EFFECTIVE RANGE: Up to and beyond 25 feet from the nozzleFUEL CONSUMPTION: The current fuel reservoir can allow for up to 38 seconds of constant full-on operation (if you so desired). The trigger switch can be operated momentarily or held on as long as desired until the tank is empty.HOW TO ""RELOAD"": Simply turn off the pilot torch knob, open the fuel tank cap, and pour your fuel in. No worries about pressurization or needing to mix any additives. Officially approved fuels: Gasoline (unleaded), gasoline-diesel mixture, alcohol. Firefighters and controlled burn specialists typically use 30% diesel, 70% gasoline. Diesel won’t burn unless the ambient temperature is extremely high (126°F). The gasoline burning keeps the diesel above its flash point, and the nature of diesel keeps it around long enough to completely incinerate the foliage it is directed at.BATTERY LIFE: Fully charged, the battery will hold around 12.6 volts. In our testing, we’ve been able to use the system for at least 50+ tank refills with the voltage still within safe levels (above 10 volts). It is important for lithium polymer batteries to remain above a particular voltage. In this battery’s case, 10 volts is the level where charging is an absolute must.PRACTICAL USES FOR A FLAMETHROWER:crowd controlclearing snow/iceeliminating weeds between pavement crackscontrolled burns/ground-clearing of foliage/agriculturalinsect controlpyrotechnic event displaysbonfire startingDestroying hordes of zombies efficiently***PLEASE NOTE that before we ship you MUST electronically sign a liability waiver***_____________________________________________________Manufacturer: Ion ProductionsModel: XM42Caliber: SHOOTS FLAMES (not a gun... this is a hand-held FLAMETHROWER and does not require a 4473 background check.)Barrel Length: 15 inchesColor: OD GREENCapacity: 25+ foot flame reach and 30+ seconds of non-stop fire!***PLEASE NOTE that before we ship you MUST electronically sign a liability waiver***_____________________________________________________***PLEASE NOTE that before we ship you MUST electronically sign a liability waiver***BRAND NEW IN BOX!

Centering is a snap. The thin crosshairs obsure little.   Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold® engineers developed Multicoat 4®, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You’ll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold’s Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.

These are supposed to be stronger than Spanish mausers and there are replacement barrels out there if you want to turn this into a custom build. It's also very rare, only 40,000 produced, so great addition to a Mauser collection. I was going to turn this into a sporter, but going to give the collectors out there a shot to save it from the saw and drill.

Centering is a snap. The thing crosshairs obscure little.   MARK AR® MOD 1 P5 Dial Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold® engineers developed Multicoat 4®, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You’ll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold’s Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.

Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You’ll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold’s Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— Description:  Matte Fine Duplex Reticle   Thinner posts and crosshairs allow for less target coverage, making precision shots on small targets easy.   Leupold Rimfire riflescopes are built and tested to the same high standards as all Golden Ring riflescopes. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Quantum Optical System   Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold's newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max design software and evaluation using Leupold's Zygo Interferometer to minimize wave front error and increase resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio 1/4 MOA Finger Click   Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments 1 cm per click).

880,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5754880,For Sale:  Leupold VX-2 3-9x33mm Ultralight EFR Fine Duplex Riflescope,"Coral Springs, Broward, South Florida",$ 399,"Listed On: Monday, September 5, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Price Match! We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.————————Leupold VX-2 3-9x33mm Ultralight EFR Fine Duplex Riflescope  Matte Fine DuplexReticle   Thinner posts and crosshairs allow for less target coverage, making precision shots on small targets easy.   When every ounce counts, Leupold Ultralight riflescopes offer the lightweight, high-performance optical Leupold you need. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, Leupold's own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches Leopold's eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Quantum Optical System   Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold's newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max design software and evaluation using Leupold's Zygo Interferometer to minimize wave front error and increase resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk Leupold's when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.   Index Matched Lens System   A Leupold exclusive, this system has nearly perfected Leupold's already impeccable light management. Leupold engineers specify different coating materials for each lens surface in the riflescope, based on the lens index of refraction, placement and function, layering each coating to eliminate reflections and maximize light transmission. The result is unparalleled brightness and extremely sharp resolution across the entire visual field.   DiamondCoat   This coating on the exterior lenses gives you the ultimate in abrasion resistance and light transmission. The result is a flawless sight picture over a lifetime of hard use. DiamondCoat has made a difference in battle; now it can make a difference where you hunt.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature Leupold's exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside Leopold's scope even more than Leupold's proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set Leupold's.   Lead Free   Leupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction.   GenerousEyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get Leopold's eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Externally Threaded Fast-Focus Eyepiece   The sleek design of the externally threaded fast-focus eyepiece provides for faster focusing of the reticle under any conditions.   Lockable Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece   Leupold's classic/standard fast focus eyepiece with a low profile lock ring makes reticle focus easy to achieve and maintain.   3:1 Zoom Ratio Standard Multicoat Micro-Friction 1/4MOA   Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments 1 cm per click).

It's now standard for all military branches.  Range estimating with the Mil Dot reticle: With practice, the Mil Dot system is simple to sue. Dots are spaced in one mil (milliradian) increments on the crosshair. Using the mil formula, the shooter can create a table based on the known size of the object targeted. Just look through the scope, bracket the object between dots , and refer to the table for an estimated distance to the target.

We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.   Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold® optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4® Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association – men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more – rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.See overview of each product for more detailed information on hunting, shooting, and competition applications.

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.————————VX-R Patrol 3-9x40mm (30mm) FireDot Tactical Milling Reticle Riflescope   Description:   Matte FireDot Tactical Milling Reticle Quantum Optical System   Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold's newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max design software and evaluation using Leupold's Zygo Interferometer to minimize wave front error and increase resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk Leupold's when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.   Index Matched Lens System   A Leupold exclusive, this system has nearly perfected Leupold's already impeccable light management. Leupold engineers specify different coating materials for each lens surface in the riflescope, based on the lens index of refraction, placement and function, layering each coating to eliminate reflections and maximize light transmission. The result is unparalleled brightness and extremely sharp resolution across the entire visual field.   DiamondCoat   This coating on the exterior lenses gives you the ultimate in abrasion resistance and light transmission. The result is a flawless sight picture over a lifetime of hard use. DiamondCoat has made a difference in battle; now it can make a difference where you hunt.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold. Select models feature Leupold's exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside Leopold's scope even more than Leupold's proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set Leupold's.   Lead Free   Leupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get Leopold's eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   FireDot Illumination   Select models are available with Leupold's exclusive FireDot Reticle System in Leopold's choice of FireDot Duplex, FireDot Circle, Ballistic FireDot, FireDot LR Duplex, FireDot 4, FireDot Pig Plex, FireDot TMR and FireDot SPR. Once activated, the dot within the reticle illuminates with bright, sharp definition, while the rest of the reticle is non-illuminated. This combination leads Leopold's eye naturally to the center aiming point and makes target acquisition quick, precise, and simple.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System One Turn, Extended Range Focus   The one-turn, non-locking eyepiece accommodates a wider spectrum of visual acuity, even in diminishing light. Near-sighted, far-sighted, or anywhere in between, adjusting the focus of the reticle is smooth, fast, and precise. An Alumina rubber eyepiece guard is included with select models.   3:1 Zoom Ratio CDS (Custom Dial System)   Leupold CDS models allow you to quickly dial Leopold's elevation to different sight-in ranges with a custom adjustment matched to Leopold's specific ballistics information. The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers. Every CDS dial features ¬-MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-2, VX-3, VX-6 and VX-R even more accurate and rugged. How the CDS System Works The CDS System works by laser-inscribing Leopold's scope's elevation dial to match Leopold's load, velocity and conditions. Leopold's scope will be in perfect synch with the way Leopold's rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads. Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account   MST (Motion Sensor Technology)   An important feature of select Illuminated reticle models is the Leupold-exclusive Motion Sensor Technology (MST). A single touch of the button or twist of the dial activates the illumination, offering several different intensity settings (depending on model) including a high/low indicator (FireDot reticles only). The reticle will automatically switch to stand-by mode after five minutes of inactivity, then reactivate whenever the rifle is moved. This eliminates the need for excess movement reaching for buttons, while extending battery life (weed by a readily available CR-2032 coin cell battery.   1/4 MOA Finger Click   Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments 1 cm per click).

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— Mark AR MOD 1 6-18x40mm    Matte Mil Dot Reticle   Several Leupold riflescopes are available with the Mil Dot reticle, which was designed to help the U.S. Marine Corps estimate distances. It's now standard for all military branches.  Range estimating with the Mil Dot reticle: With practice, the Mil Dot system is simple to sue. Dots are spaced in one mil (milliradian) increments on the crosshair. Using the mil formula, the shooter can create a table based on the known size of the object targeted. Just look through the scope, bracket the object between dots , and refer to the table for an estimated distance to the target. Leupold scopes fitted with the Mil Dot reticle include more specific instructions on its use.  Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold® engineers developed Multicoat 4®, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You’ll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold’s Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Quantum Optical System   Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold’s newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System™ is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout—the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max® design software and evaluation usingLeupold’s Zygo® Interferometer to minimize wave front error andincrease resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt—from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity—all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.

You get virtually every feature you can imagine—legendary ruggedness, stunning optics, and a huge 6x zoom ratio that shortens the distance to your next trophy. With a VX-6 atop your favorite rifle, the advantage is all yours.   Description:  Matte FireDot Duplex Illuminated Reticle   Takes the legendary Leupold designed Duplex reticle and adds an extra-bright centerpoint dot. Ideal for quick target acquisition and the broadest range of game application.   Quantum Optical System   Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold’s newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System™ is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout—the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max® design software and evaluation usingLeupold’s Zygo® Interferometer to minimize wave front error andincrease resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt—from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity—all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold’s index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Lead Free   Leupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction.   6:1 Zoom Ratio   A powerful 6:1 zoom ratio delivers crystal clear images from edge-to-edge throughout the entire magnification range. Many higher power scopes provide the best picture at each end of the zoom ratio, leaving the middle ranges weaker on clarity and resolution. The Leupold 6X erector system was engineered from the outset to provide consistently exceptional image quality across the entire visual field throughtout the entire zoom range. Twin Bias Spring Erector System features berylium/copper alloy leaf springs and 30% more holding force to withstand the most intense recoil and abuse.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Pop-Up Rezero Adjustments   Pop-up re-zero finger click windage and elevation adjustments assure maximum adjustment range, precision and insant re-zeroing. The adjustment dials can be repositioned to align with the marked zero indicator of the adjustment without changing the adjustment setting of the scope. This allows the shooter to know the original zero of the rifle in the event that further adjustments are made in the field. To reset the zero simply lift the dial and rotate it until the 0 on the dial is aligned with the zero indicator.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Extreme Fast-Focus Eyepiece   The extreme fast-focus eyepiece ensures a generous eyebox, superior field of view and optimal diopter adjustment in the field. It allows the the user to adjust through the full range of diopter adjustment in one complete turn of the eyepiece.   CDS (Custom Dial System)   Leupold CDS models allow you to quickly dial your elevation to different sight-in ranges with a custom adjustment matched to your specific ballistics information. The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers. Every CDS dial features ¼-MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-2, VX-3, VX-6 and VX-R even more accurate and rugged. How the CDS System Works The CDS System works by laser-inscribing your scope's elevation dial to match your load, velocity and conditions. Your scope will be in perfect synch with the way your rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads. Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account:   MST (Motion Sensor Technology)   An important feature of select Illuminated reticle models is the Leupold-exclusive Motion Sensor Technology (MST). A single touch of the button or twist of the dial activates the illumination, offering several different intensity settings (depending on model) including a high/low indicator (FireDot reticles only). The reticle will automatically switch to “stand-by mode” after five minutes of inactivity, then reactivate whenever the rifle is moved. This eliminates the need for excess movement reaching for buttons, while extending battery life (powered by a readily available CR-2032 coin cell battery.   1/4 MOA Finger Click   Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (¼-MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments – 1 cm per click).

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.————————      FX-II Scout IER 2.5x28mm Duplex  Silver Duplex Reticle   Heavy posts stand out against cover and in twilight conditions, pointing boldly to the intersection. Countering is a snap. The thin crosshairs obscure little.   The ideal choice for scout rifles, lever action rifles, or any time you want to mount your optics in front of the receiver. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Super Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Micro-Friction 1/4 MOA Finger Click   Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (1/4-MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments 1 cm per click).
