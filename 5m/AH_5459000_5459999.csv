It was always competitive with Smith & Wesson’s Chief’s Special Revolvers, but with the Off Duty’s debut in 1986, got even more so. Here is my First Year Production Off Duty, late 1986 from its 860000 range serial number. It was given to me from my grandfather. Manufacturer was Charter Arms of Stratford CT, and clearly marked. Type is traditional double and single action pocket revolver with transfer bar internal safety device. Construction is steel inner barrel, cylinder, yoke, pin, hammer, trigger, main frame and internal parts combined with an alloy barrel shroud and grip frame. Caliber is .38 Smith & Wesson Special, with a 5 shot swingout cylinder. Finish is transitional semi gloss blue; by 1987 the Off Dutys had a matte blue finish. Barrel is one piece 2 inch eight groove 1:18 rifling, with classic early Charter exposed ejection rod. Sights are barrel integral red dot front, with frame integral fixed notch rear. Cylinder capacity is 5 rounds of .38 Smith & Wesson Special or .38 Special +P ammunition interchangeably. Trigger is .312 serrated face, with matching short serrated spur hammer. Grips are factory issue hard rubber, thin finger groove, manufactured by Sile of Italy for Charter Arms. Weight empty is 17 ounces, with center of gravity at the rear cylinder face. Surface detractions on this Off Duty are minimal, principally edge wear to the trigger guard. I have it recently appraised  they said almost mint condition owners quote ""we appraise this Charter as Excellent, 90 percent vicinity by our estimate"". Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. Hammer travels an additional 5 degrees on all five positions on double action after the cylinder times. There is no lateral play to the cylinder with the trigger fully depressed. Double Action trigger pull is smooth 9 to 10 pound vicinity, with a crisp 5 pound original single action trigger pull. Cylinder face to forcing cone gap measures a perfect .006. We estimate this revolver has been fired fewer than 50 times. Bore, cylinder chambers and mechanism are all bright and clean. Similar revolvers from Taurus and Smith & Wesson command prices upwards of $500 apiece. However I'm selling mine for only $ 379.00 OBO.  payment is with USPS Money Order & Not Credit Card or western union. Any ammunition in my photos is Not included."

Picked her up a few days ago, went to the range today but wasn't really a fan of the sights. Since the sights and the finish are what make the VTAC special, I'd rather sell/trade the gun than try and swap the sights and sell the old ones. Most people like the sights, I guess I'm one of the small percentage that doesn't.Though most M&P pistols have a corrosion-resistant finish applied to the barrel, slide and steel sights, the VTAC’s slide is finished in an enhanced Flat Dark Earth PVD and has specialized sights designed by Kyle Lamb. These sights are the main reason why the VTAC is one of the more expensive guns in the M&P line. The VTAC’s unique sights are made by Trijicon and only offered on the M&P9 VTAC. These sights are intended to be rapidly and highly visible in different lighting conditions. They accomplish that by using three green fiber-optic and three green tritium inserts. Thhe fiber optics are on the top and the tritium inserts directly below. In daylight the fiber-optic dots glow; in low-light conditions, the tritium inserts take precedence.This gun comes with both factory mags, all 4 backstraps (Two black, two FDE), and a BlackDog Concealment, OWB Kydex holster. Both the holster, and the gun are barely used, with not a single scratch. I am MAINLY looking for trades. Specifically a Beretta Pico or Ruger LCP-C + Cash, or other 9mm handguns (Glock, FNS9-C, Steyr, etc) of EQUAL VALUE or PLUS CASH. I can Google what your gun is worth in under 30 seconds, please don't try and rip me off.I don't really want to sell it outright, but if I do, I'm asking $600 for the weapon and the holster. Gun retails for $660 online, + an average of $20 shipping and $25 transfer. So all in, you're looking at $705 minimum plus a weeks wait. The gun and the holster ($65ish) for $600? That's a steal. I'd really hate to let her go, honestly one of the nicest looking handguns I've owned but I don't shoot it that well. You can get ahold of me anytime, day or night by texting me at REDACTEDLocated in Northville, Michigan. Willing to drive a bit. 18+ with PP or CPL, FTF deals only.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

Picked her up a few days ago, went to the range today but wasn't really a fan of the sights. Since the sights and the finish are what make the VTAC special, I'd rather sell/trade the gun than try and swap the sights and sell the old ones. Most people like the sights, I guess I'm one of the small percentage that doesn't.Though most M&P pistols have a corrosion-resistant finish applied to the barrel, slide and steel sights, the VTAC’s slide is finished in an enhanced Flat Dark Earth PVD and has specialized sights designed by Kyle Lamb. These sights are the main reason why the VTAC is one of the more expensive guns in the M&P line. The VTAC’s unique sights are made by Trijicon and only offered on the M&P9 VTAC. These sights are intended to be rapidly and highly visible in different lighting conditions. They accomplish that by using three green fiber-optic and three green tritium inserts. Thhe fiber optics are on the top and the tritium inserts directly below. In daylight the fiber-optic dots glow; in low-light conditions, the tritium inserts take precedence.This gun comes with both factory mags, all 4 backstraps (Two black, two FDE), and a BlackDog Concealment, OWB Kydex holster. Both the holster, and the gun are barely used, with not a single scratch. I am MAINLY looking for trades. Specifically a Beretta Pico or Ruger LCP-C + Cash, or other 9mm handguns (Glock, FNS9-C, Steyr, etc) of EQUAL VALUE or PLUS CASH. I can Google what your gun is worth in under 30 seconds, please don't try and rip me off.I don't really want to sell it outright, but if I do, I'm asking $600 for the weapon and the holster. Gun retails for $660 online, + an average of $20 shipping and $25 transfer. So all in, you're looking at $705 minimum plus a weeks wait. The gun and the holster ($65ish) for $600? That's a steal. I'd really hate to let her go, honestly one of the nicest looking handguns I've owned but I don't shoot it that well. You can get ahold of me anytime, day or night by texting me at REDACTEDLocated in Northville, Michigan. Willing to drive a bit. 18+ with PP or CPL, FTF deals only.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"
