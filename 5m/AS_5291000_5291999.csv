I also have a couple of sealed 5 gallon cans of salts. The tanks have been out of use for a few years so they will require a little cleaning.   I cleaned them up and painted the outside last time I had them out so the inside is the only thing that needs attention.   I have four black Iron tanks and two Galvanized. There is a fresh water tank and the rest are standard tanks. Two stands that hold two tanks each. One big burner for the salts and two small burners for the Hot baths that are attached to the stands. Two 5 gallon cans of salts. plus the odds and ends that I have that go with it.  It is just to much of a hassle to get out,set up to use and then break down and put away here in town. My wife is complaining about the room it takes in the shed and so I need to let them go. I believe they are set up for Propane right now but not 100% sure. I used them with propane mostly and can not remember what I did last. All it takes is 20 bucks worth the orifices to change over to one or the other  I will include some pics and if you e-mail me I can send a few more.  If you have inquired about this before and I did not reply , I am sorry.  We had a computer issue and then an internet issue so you can have first at it if your still intrested. I know I need to put a price tag on it so lets say $600 OBO. I would rather trade for a AK, AR, 1911 or M&P's. A couple of hand guns or S&W revolvers. Aways take Silver or silver coins at Spot pice.  Make me an offer. I am easy to deal with and I will just say yea or nea.  I also need to get it all gone. Thank you"

I've put a few hundred rounds through it at the range and it is relatively free of any wear and tear. I've had a larger clip installed on it that is good for concealing in jeans pockets. It comes with the original 6 round mag as well as a 10 round extention magazine that allows for the whole hand to be on the grip. I'm also including a box of Winchester .380 95 grain hollowpoints to go with it. I am the second owner of this little gun. I bought it off a police officer from the Woodburn Police department whose a buddy of mine. It's a great little gun and for $250, it will get the job done in terms of concealment and personal protection. I live in Columbia City but I can meet in Fort Wayne if you are wanting to purchase."
