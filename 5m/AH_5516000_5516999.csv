Based on the CZ design, SA/DA w/ de-cocker. Very short trigger reset. Very low round count, never carried, still looks new. Comes with lots of extras including a total of 5 magazines, a kydex IWB holster & a kydex OWB holsters that were custom made for this pistol. These are not cheap pistols and they are hard to come by. Extra mags alone cost $55. I highly suggest watching Youtube video reviews on it.

Pretty firm on price I will keep it if it doesn't sell. Only had this gun a few months. Shoots 1/2-3-4 MOA, and I think with a skim bedding it will shoot 1/2 or better consistently. I have shot 150 hand loads with Berger Hybrids. The only blemishes are some Duracoat cracking in areas where it probably shouldn't have been applied. This is the base and and rings, rubber butt pad, and scope caps. It just doesn't adhere well to those surfaces I have found out. Nothing major I just believe in shooting you straight. $2000 or will consider trades for high end optics (Vortex Razor Gen ii MOA, night force, etc)Email or text REDACTED"

Equipped with the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.Enter the GripZone™: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone™, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.The GripZone™ doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch larger than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone™ advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact."

I bought this gun used, so I'm not exactly sure of the round count, but I have put maybe 500 rounds through it. It shoots like a dream. There are two little dings on the top of the barrel that have gone through the bluing, but other than that, this gun is good to go. Buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale and have a valid Indiana drivers license. I'm asking $475. I need money for a car so I'm not interested in trades at this point. Text or call, REDACTED. Thanks!"
