This is a rare, long-barreled Model 1890, one of 844 made in 1892, that retains 25-35% of the original flaked nickel finish with speckled, dark freckling on the balance of the metal and scattered areas of pinprick pitting, most noticeably at the muzzle and along the front portion of the frame just ahead of the cylinder. The remainder of the metal has been cleaned to the underlying gray metal and has visible contact marks and streaking. The caliber marking on the frame and the correct Model 1890 maker marking on the barrel are both slightly softened, but are still clear and legible. The smooth period ivory grips have deep brown age-toning with numerous stable, with-the-grain cracks and some small chips at the butt of the right panel. The mechanism is fully functional, however the mainspring is a bit weak and the cylinder pin is slightly bent, which causes the ejector rod to bind about halfway down. These are rare revolvers that were never made in great numbers (only about 2,020 in two barrel lengths), and this example is in good plus-near very good condition."

9mm carbine or pistol with ""arm brace"", Beretta CX4 9mm 92FS model or the PX4 model and I can get the adapter, maybe the .45ACP model.  AR 9mm, CZ Scorpion or other?  Really want a nice trigger, so the AR platform will likely be the best value.
FosTech AR Echo trigger.
AR-15 and AR-10 lowers, stripped or complete, prefer stripped because it's much cheaper and I can build them to my taste.  Nice trigger groups and other lower parts.  
Will consider other firearms etc., in order of preference, semi-autos mostly, then revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.
Again, let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, I will consider and get back to you either way.

In development for more than four years, the VP Series is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP, but the VP Series breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. Heckler & Koch pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP40 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six grip side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP Series has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature found on VP pistols is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. VP40 pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines; either 13-round or reduced, 10-round capacity magazines. VP Series pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces (160 grams). VP pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP40’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. The VP40 is essentially the same dimensions as the 9 mm VP9 model. The overall height of the VP40 is one millimeter (.04 inch) taller. The VP40 also weighs 2.37 ounces (67 grams) more, 28.93 ounces for the VP40 versus 26.56 ounces for the VP9. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the VP Series is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The VP40 has a suggested retail cost of $719. A law enforcement configuration VP40 with tritium night sights and three magazines is also available for $819. Key Features:  Front slide serrations Disassembly lever Slide release lever (ambidextrous) The rear of the striker/firing pin is colored red and is visible by the shooter when the striker is cocked. Large recurved trigger guard allows shooting when wearing gloves Trigger designed for superior performance — short, light take up with single action quality and short, positive reset  Specifications:  Caliber: .40 S&W Length: 7.34"" Height: 5.45"" Width: 1.32"" Barrel Length: 4.09"" Sight Radius: 6.38"" Weight (with Empty Magazine): 28.93 oz Weight (Empty Magazine): 3.28 oz Magazine Capacity: 10 / 13"

The manufacturer, Ligamec, has been building uppers for a very long time. Positive reviews abound for these uppers.The longest barrel they normally use is 29"" but this one has a custom profiled 33"" Lothar Walther barrel. Lothar Walther are the ones who chambered the gun and they are known for producing highly accurate 50 BMG barrels. Most of the accurate 50 BMG rifles use Lothar Walther barrels. This one will also include a muzzle brake. It has less than 25 rounds down the tube. With match ammuntion this should shoot MOA or better. It is unmodified, has been meticulously maintained and always stored inside a climate controlled safe.This is a lightweight upper and the entire gun weighed a little over 20 pounds. No where near as heavy as most of the other 50 BMG uppers on the market. Easily lifted and carried by one person. A stronger person could probably shoot it off hand but I can't. Most other 50 BMG uppers are on back order for a very, very long time regardless of the barrel used and those with Lothar Walther barrels are on perpetual back order. Get this one right now with no wait, no background, no bill of sale and no questions. This is NOT considered a firearm so no need to go through a FFL or do a transfer. You hand me cash and I hand you this upper with 20 rounds of ammunition. I will include 20 rounds of milspec API blaster ammunition. I will break the seal on a brand new can so you know you are getting 100% brand new ammunition."

Chambered in the powerful .40 S&W, it comes with three 12-round magazines to deliver impressive firepower for any tactical use. It is safe, accurate and reliable while offering easy operation, accessorization and disassembly; and its durability is further enhanced by a recoil buffer that greatly diminishes component stress. A pistol that bears the unmistakeable Beretta looks, it is the ultimate choice for shooters wanting a professional-grade personal- or home-defense pistol that can also be easily adapted for concealed carry.  Accurate and Reliable    The cold-hammer forged barrel on the 96A1 is designed to deliver great accuracy out of the box, while the dovetail-mounted front sight is easy to adjust to always keep you on target. The barrel is encased in an open slide typical of Beretta’s 90-series pistols; besides reducing weight and backward-momentum during firing, this design maximizes reliability and virtually eliminates “stove-piping.”  Durable and Made to Last    With the 96A1, the hard-hitting .40 S&W comes back stronger than ever in the 90-series lineup. We have worked in conjunction with law-enforcement experts to make this pistol shrug off tens of thousands of full-power rounds with Beretta-style durability. The brand new recoil buffer that is machined right into the action of the 96A1 essentially acts as a cushon against the stress between moving parts, greatly boosting the service life of this powerful pistol. Also, the Bruniton finish on the metal is designed to be corrosion resistant to give worry-free maintenance even after all-day concealed carry in scorching-hot conditions.    Easy to Accessorize    The 96A1 comes with an integral Picatinny rail on which users can easily mount a variety of tactical accessories--such as tactical lights, aiming devices or even both. Additionally, the front sight is dovetail-mounted, meaning that it is adjustable for windage and can be easily replaced with an accessory front sight of the user’s choice. If you love the unmatched performance of the Beretta 92FS or M9 and want a few extra tactical features as well as the extra power of the .40 S&W, the Beretta 96A1 is your ultimate choice.   Features:  External Hammer: Like the legendary 92FS/M9, the 96 features an external hammer. Ambidextrous Safety: The safety may be easily operated with either hand, to accommodate right- and left-handed shooters as well as different ways to grip and operate the firearm. Frame Integrated Recoil Buffer: This .40 S&W pistol is designed to last, regardless of the hotness of the round or the intensity and frequency of training sessions. The built-in recoil buffer absorbs stress and recoil and ensures that the frame does not bear the full brunt of the powerful .40 S&W. Disassembly Latch: This tactical handgun is as easy to field-strip and disassemble without tools as it is safe and intuitive to operate. Recoil Spring Assembly: The recoil spring assembly is captive, meaning that you have fewer parts to keep track of during cleaning and maintenance. Dovetail Front Sight: The front sight is user-removable and can be replaced with an accessory sight of your choosing. Picatinny Rail: The built-in accessory rail enables easy attachment of a variety of tactical accessories without any modification to the handgun. Rounded Trigger Guard: The 96 A1 features a classic rounded trigger guard which easily accommodates today's most common shooting stances. It is also particularly snag-free, lending itself to smooth holstering and unholstering. Reversible Magazine Release: The mag-release can be easily reversed by the user, without any gunsmithing.

It is a new in box (NIB) BLUE LABEL rifle with the Owner's Manual, Sling, and two Colt 20 round factory magazines. It has the sear block, bayonet lug and fixed stock. I was going to clean it but found that it still had the factory heavy grease on the bolt and firing group so I decided to let the new owner have the option of cleaning it or leaving it as it is. I don't have the complete history of this weapon so I can't say that it is unfired but based on it's condition and the presence of the heavy grease on the bolt I think it is very probably an unfired rifle. I was told by the previous owner that it was the property of a retired Marine Corps Colonel. CLICK HERE TO SEE MORE PICTURES: http://www.bugoutguns.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=SL-023123"
