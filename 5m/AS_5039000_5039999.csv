Overall length is only 5 3/8 inches from the muzzle to the back of the grip frame; 4 1/8 inches from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the butt; and thinness of only .945 inches not counting the slide release lever. Barrel is 2.9 inch flared muzzle, 6 groove right hand 1:9.84 rifling. Weight is only 20.5 ounces empty. The P290’s .350 smooth faced trigger pulls at a steady 9 pounds, with 1 inch of travel.
