As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot.Rifle includes a leupold mark 4 4x16-44 optic and bipod"

This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a lightweight package with an overall length of just 45 inches. The Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power while allowing the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds, reload with a fresh magazine and get back on target in seconds.
Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. The steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. All Barrett rifles are designed for easy field stripping, so the two receivers can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools.
The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation designed for speed, reliability and safety. It slides effortlessly on machined-smooth rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. This bolt carrier assembly is a simplistic design with a quick release lever for fast disassembly. The firing pin is driven by dual springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time.
Adopted by militaries all over the world, the Model 95 is not just proven in battle, it's also fun to shoot."

Comes with Custom Walnut Grips, factory grips, 2 hi-cap mags, hard case, child proof lock and original shipping box. This gun is very concealable but not too small to shoot accurately.The CZ 83's combination of small size and moderate weight easily handles the new generation of high-performance defensive ammo that has become available for 'pocket' pistol calibers from leading ammo manufacturers. The DA/SA trigger mechanism operates in the same manner as the CZ 75. The 83 can be carried 'cocked and locked' with the hammer back and the safety on for single action operation, or it may be manually decocked for hammer-down carry. When carried in the decocked position, the safety lever does not need to be de-activated, but instead the first shot is double action and subsequent shots are single action. The CZ 83 features an ambidextrous manual safety and magazine catch.Legal sale only. Prefer to complete sale at a local FLL for transfer. However, if FTF is agreed upon you must show me a valid CCW AND NCDL, or if you do not have a CCW you must give me an original purchase permit and a bill of sale both parties will sign and retain for records"
