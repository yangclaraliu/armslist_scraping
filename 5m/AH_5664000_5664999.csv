All parts are made in USA except for scope and mount (Shame on you Bushnell). I originally planned for this to be a coyote killer, but went ahead and added the gas piston kit for extra reliability. I just added the scope and mount, they are not sighted in. The rifle has exactly 30 rounds through it, except the bolt, which i took off another build for this one. I would estimate it at aroun 200 rounds. Feel free to ask me any questions. This is a great deal for a gas piston gun. Shoots great, not even broke in. Sale will require a bill of sale.
Will trade for higher end pistol(s)   (Kimber, Sig Sauer, Glock+, Smith, etc.)$1100 cash with scope and mount or $1000 for just the gun. Look up the parts they are worth more than my asking price.

There are few not obvious scratch marks on the wooden stock( if you want to use it, you get it anyway, soon or later), but other than that, this is a remarkable air gun to play with. It comes with a 3-9x scope, which is cool and clear. By law, however, this is still considered a firearm. you need a valid FOID to purchase this.text me at REDACTED, or email me with zhaokuo 1225 @gmail.com, the name is Kevin"

464,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5664464,For Sale/Trade:  H&K HK4 .32 ACP,"Vestavia, Birmingham, Alabama",$ 350,"Listed On: Saturday, July 16, 2016",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,32 ACP                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Selling an H&K HK4 pistol in .32 ACP.This is something of an odd duck: it's H&K's first of many pistols ever produced and totally unique among them in that it's a wierd, esoteric little pocket gun and not an amazingly popular, groundbreaking combat pistol -- and it probably isn't that desirable except to H&K collectors, perhaps. I don't think it's their first firearm altogether, but I do believe it is their first ever handgun. Its design is similar to a lot of Eastern European pistols from its era in that it seems to be derivative of the extremely influential Walther PP design, whose direct influence can also be found in such pistols as the Makarov, CZ-70 and later 82, and countless others (-- nearly all the communist pistols of the era, which I have read is a result of the original Walther factory ending up on the less desirable side of the Berlin Wall after WW2). I've read it also owes a lot of its DNA to the lesser known Mauser HSc, with both of them sharing the same designer. It differs from both in that the barrel isn't integral to the frame and in that same way, it can be a pretty interesting design in that as originally sold in some cases, it could be bought as a set with 4 barrels and 4 magazines each in one of 4 different calibers (.22, .25, .32, and .380), and the only thing needed to convert the pistol easily between them was a barrel and mag swap (and an adjustment of the firing pin when switching to rimfire). I believe this is what the ""4"" in HK4 is meant to stand for. Sadly, this is not a part of a four barrel set. It has one barrel, the one in it, and three magazines and they're all in .32 ACP, or 7.65mm as H&K prefers to call it.As to the pistol itself, despite the ingenuity that must have gone into making the four barrel set concept work, I have to be honest that I can't call this one of H&K's better designs at least in terms of what shooters are most likely to look for in a weapon system today. It's a bit on the large size for a .32 (though this may be a plus for someone who also wants it to double as a target shooter). It's a typical DA/SA type arrangement for the most part, but the hammer is sort of strange in that it clicks back more like a switch you'd find in your basement fuse box than you'd expect on a pistol, and while it wears the Walther PP style frame mounted safety, unlike with the Walther the safety doesn't also function as a decocker, so you can carry it cocked and locked. Pulling the trigger with the safety on will still, however, drop the hammer -- sort of like a safety on a Marlin lever-gun: the hammer will still drop, but the firing pin is blocked so it can't actually fire. I leave it up to you to determine how you feel about that, but I don't think I'll be able to hide my opinion of the last, most curious ""feature"" of this pistol, which is related to the fact that it lacks a traditional slide release lever. Instead, once you lock the slide back, there are just two very unique ways to lower it again -- A: you can insert a loaded magazine, in which case the slide automatically snaps forward chambering the first round, or B: should you want to drop the slide on an empty chamber, the only way is to actually pull the trigger. (And no, you can't simply ""slingshot"" it like any other auto.) And while the gun is technically empty when you do this, and you can also do it with the safety on to block the firing pin, still...it doesn't feel entirely right to me. I mean, folks have criticized the Glock for the fact you have to pull the trigger to dissassemble it, and you got to do it just to drop the slide on this thing. I'm also not sure I like a pistol that drops the slide for me when I'm loading it with live ammunition, and it has caused a few skipped heartbeats for me at least the first few times I took this thing to the range. But this may just be because every other pistol I've ever owned has trained me not to expect it. Perhaps for someone who finds they have trouble hitting a slide lock quickly and smoothly, or doesn't trust their motor skills to be able to do so under stress, this could actually be a desirable feature?And aside from those dubious features, I don't know there's much more about this thing for one to complain about, especially at this price point. It is a German made H&K pistol and despite that not meaning what it usually does in this case, it still implies a certain level of quality and this pistol is not an exception at least to that rule. Among modern-built .32 caliber pistols, it's certainly on the better end of what that generally implies in terms of quality. I'd put the trigger weight in DA on the heavier side of tolerable and the SA just fine for a gun of its size and purpose, and its sights are smallish, but again, typical of a gun its size and purpose. The bluing is fairly deep, more of a dark black, and the whole thing has the feel of something well built and aesthetics that are actually quite pleasing at least to my eye -- with sleek, contoured lines giving it just the look and character of something out of a Cold War spy novel. It is about as *European* looking and feeling as a pistol can get, combining elements of the Walther PP, Mauser HSc, and early Sauer pistols. Being a part of a multicaliber system is an especially European concept (like the three-barreled drilling, for example), as a lot of Euro counties back then would limit the number of firearms a man could own. You also have to consider the level of typically Teutonic engineering and ingenuity it must have taken back then to make a pistol readily fire 4 calibers including both centerfire and rimfire with equal reliability and with only a barrel swap, and the level of quality in general that must imply. If this were actually a part of a four barrel set, I could see this actually being a ""holy grail"" to a certain kind of shooter, and worth thousands of dollars. But again, without those bonuses and that novelty, this obviously isn't that. If it were a car, I figure it'd be a 70s Saab or a Volvo -- I'm sure there's not many who would dream of owning one of those, but for a certain kind of person that might just sound like heaven.I guess that's not much of a sales pitch, but I do want to be sure my buyers know what they're getting. I expect most of the interest I'll recieve, if any, to probably be from budget minded collectors of otherwise interesting and European curios and relics, or perhaps H&K fanatics that are simply interested in anything with those wonderful bastards' names on it. After all, I think you could argue that no H&K collection could ever be complete without an example of their very first sidearm. As I said, it comes with three mags or two ""extra"" mags, and I do not have the original box (which might hurt my chances of enticing a collector). This pistol wears the date stamp 09/70, which I believe to mean October of 1970, it being one of the earlier guns that came before H&K switched to its current double letter system of date codes. It is also something of an HK rarity in that it is not proofed in Ulm but some other part of Germany and therefore doesn't wear the classic stag horn proofmark on the barrel. It is not in mint or true collector condition with a number of scratches visible in the right light, but all in all I'd say it's in pretty good shape for something its age and value.I think I'd be more interested in trades at the moment. Not really looking for money right now but more just to see if I can swap it for something I'd appreciate more with someone who'd appeciate it more than me. The $300 in the price box is more of what I'd consider a fair trade value. On second thought I'm going to up it to 350, as according to ebay magazines for this thing are damned expensive and this comes with three of them. Still, it's just a general guideline and any offer is welcome."

This gun has been fired less than 50 times, and cleaned very thoroughly after both times, being taken to the range. I have 2 clips, and a good bit of ammo. I will count it later, but rough guess, 150-250 rounds. The two clips are filled with top notch Inceptor ARX rounds. I have the chamber flag, if you want it. I even have the case."

Rifle comes new in the factory box with (2) 30 round magazines. From Kel-Tec: The Kel-Tec CMR-30 Rifle is chambered for the .22WMR cartridge (22 Magnum). The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16” barrel is threaded 1/2”-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7” with the stock collapsed, and 30.6” when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides. The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. Magpul® flip-up sights included. The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle."
