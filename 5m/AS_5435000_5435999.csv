It s built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity.

The most prominent feautres of the M44 include the shorter barrel legnth, retractable bayonet, and the large Tula star on the receiver. Supposedly it is military marked making it slighlty more uncommon than other Tula M44s. I've kept it well taken care of and was hoping to trade because I just got a CO residency and have wanted a handgun for a while. I picked this rifle up in Colorado Springs a couple of years ago and it is undoubtedly the best quality Mosin I've ever held. While others felt loose, greasy, and simply old (such as many T58s), this M44 always feels as if it was just made by the factory or refinished by a professional gunsmith."

Just let me know what you have.  Can meet near Johnson City Medical Center up until about May 4th.  After that I may be in Knoxville."

$600 firm in cash.  I've seen these EXO models on National sites from $600 to over $900(not saying they are selling for $900), so very firm on price.  Add $60 if you want the Raven Phantom holster, it was $95 new and can be used IWB or OWB.  Let me know if you want the holster or just the Glock when you contact me, please.I might consider trades, but not in need of anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.
A few things I would not mind having back-ups for right now would be, Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it.  Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts kits without trigger parts, nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  Kel-Tec SU-16C plus $100 or $160 with holster, the ""C"" model only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty now, so not in need of any specific caliber.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics like Eotech and Aimpoints with nice magnifiers, just give me the model and trade details.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship insured for to your FFL for $40(handguns must be Overnight UPS) more and must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"
