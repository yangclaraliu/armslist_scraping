H&K USP 9mm Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. The modular design of the USP’s internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type oaf trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes. The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.           Features:  Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories Ambidextrous magazine release lever Extended slide release Patented Lock-Out Safety device   CONTACT RED RIFLE 1-REDACTED / CARSON CA 90746BY APPOINTMENT ONLY MON-FRI 10AM-7PM, SAT 2PM-7PM, CLOSED SUNDAYS"

Styled in the familiar AR configuration it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything including your life. This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance enhanced reliability carbine. The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance. The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel the carrier features an integral piston strike face. REC7 Lifestyle The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7 not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance. At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided two-position forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance. The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 Class 2 hardcoat anodized and Cerakote finished. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated hammer-forged chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle.

Basically gave the old gun a facelift. Brand new parts include: Slide, barrel, spring, trigger, SRT sear and safety lever, decocking spring, trigger mechanism spring, hammer spring, grips, grip screws, and magazine. All new parts ordered directly from Sig. Also have all old parts, including the old slide, barrel, spring, ect for it to be switched over to 40 cal. All new parts have had 50 rounds through them to make sure everything works properly. Functions perfectly, most bullets punched through the same hole at 10 yards.

I am leaving this open to offers at this time because my coolness value in it is far more than what I actually have in it.  There was a lot of machining done on this to configure the barrel to the AR15 platform and a few hours of labor to correctly adjust gas system (DI).  Here is a list of components: M249 Barrel FN manufacturing (Will last forever), FN reverse thread hider (original M249 hider would not work with .750 gas block), Custom gas system (somewhere between mid and rifle length. Gas tube was cut to 13.75""), Standard free float aluminum tube for rail, Colt SP1 upper, Colt SP1 BCG, Colt Competition lower, CMMG LPK, Mil-spec buffer tube, light buffer spring, light buffer (customized in order to cycle correctly), M4 adjustable stock. The machining was very expensive and correctly done.  If you need details on what was all done, I can send an email explaining. But, here is a chance to own a very unique Colt/FN hybrid that does not require a NFA stamp.  The gun was intentionally built to replicate an original COLT SP1.  Obviously not everything was accomplished but it does have a very reliable M249 barrel that is 16.5"" long and Colt components.  I have no idea what the twist rate is but I am assuming it will shoot the NATO 62gr very well. HAHA! Search FN manufacturing and read on the M249.  Text James at 316-seven06-58two1 for any questions/additional pics or offers."

The venting at the tip of the RPK style barrel acts as a built-in muzzle break and also created a look unique to the Vepr Super rifle. The furniture for this firearm is a solid piece of precision shaped walnut that runs the entire length of the body, ending at the foregrip. A unique feature to this particular firearm is the ambidextrous magazine catch release for ease of use for any gun enthusiast. Unlike an AK or the standard Vepr rifle, there is no scope rail attached to the side of the receiver. Instead, there is a rail system built into the receiver directly, just above the fire control group and below the top cover. A scope mount (not included) can be attached to this rail system. here is your chance to buy a very limited editon rifle as these will never be imported to the USA as long as Russia remains in Crimea"
