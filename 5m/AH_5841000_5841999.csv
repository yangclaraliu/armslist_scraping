I am the original purchaser of this firearm. It was purchased in 2010. This pistol has been carried about 10 times in the last 6 years and has had approximately 800 rounds fired through it. It wears the factory grips and original Mepro night sights. The original plastic case and all papers are included. Both holsters pictured will be included along with all the magazines shown, 2 of which are Chip McCormick magazines (Federal HST's visible in the pictures will not be included). I removed the factory full-length guide rod assembly after about 300 rounds in replaced it with a traditional GI style assembly, but both will be included. For the person looking for a full-sized, steel framed, 1911 with a rail, this is an excellent option. I have not had any issues with this firearm. There is slight finish wear on the rail from having Surefire X300 mounted on it (X300 not included). There is not a defect on the right side of the frame... I covered the serial number with a small piece of electrical tape.Purchaser must have, and present, a valid NC Concealed Handgun Permit or Pistol Purchase Permit. Must also be willing to complete a bill of sale. Face-to-face transfers only. I will travel no more than 1 hour outside of Watauga County."

$1,080 in cash or a little better in trade value.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"
