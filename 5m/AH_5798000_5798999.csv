The SP5K is designed and manufactured to meet the definition of a civilian pistol and marks the return of the roller delayed blowback system to an HK commercial product. This operating system is legendary in its accuracy and reliability. Originally developed on the Heckler & Koch G3 rifle, it has been used on several HK firearms. The SP5K retains many of the critical features of the MP5, including its precision machined components and attention-to-detail quality. The SP5K is manufactured completely in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The SP5K is a safe, robust, ergonomic large frame handgun. For more comfortable shooting, the SP5K is equipped with an elastic “bungee” sling. The sling is easily installed by snapping it onto the sling swivel hardware located on the rear of the receiver. Using the sling makes firing the SP5K more stable and reduces fatigue. The overall length of the SP5K is approximately 14 inches — slightly longer than an MP5K — due to its unique handguard. The SP5K hand guard is designed with special ergonomic and safety features to protect the shooter’s hand and provide a comfortable and stable grip. Despite its size, the SP5K is well suited for sporting use. Using the proven roller delayed blowback system; the SP5K’s inherent accuracy makes it an excellent choice for target shooting and an ideal home security arm."

The assembly houses the trigger group and contains the firearm’s serial number. Legally speaking, the internal assembly is the firearm. The frame assembly drops into one of three grip modules. The polymer grip modules (what we would normally call the ‘frame’ if they were serialized) vary in grip circumference (a small, medium and large). The grip module contains a cut out so the assembly serial number can be seen externally. The unique modular design of the P320 offers the user the ultimate in flexibility to completely change calibers and grip configurations for different size hands make this ideal for duty or home defense. Features a five point safety system. Slide takedown is prohibited without removal of the magazine, and takedown is accomplished without tools or manipulation of trigger for enhanced safety. Comes with two 10RD magazines, holster, lock and case. NOTE: Trijicon Night Sights available for an additional $50 – would need to be installed Unlike any other pistol in its class, the P320 features a unique 5-point safety system, standard on all models: - Striker Safety - Disconnect Safety - 3-point Take Down Safety System - Takedown is prohibited without removal of magazine - System prohibits takedown without slide locked to the rear - Rotation of takedown lever allows disassembly without tools or trigger manipulation.

The SP5K is designed and manufactured to meet the definition of a civilian pistol and marks the return of the roller delayed blowback system to an HK commercial product. This operating system is legendary in its accuracy and reliability. Originally developed on the Heckler & Koch G3 rifle, it has been used on several HK firearms. The SP5K retains many of the critical features of the MP5, including its precision machined components and attention-to-detail quality. The SP5K is manufactured completely in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The SP5K is a safe, robust, ergonomic large frame handgun. For more comfortable shooting, the SP5K is equipped with an elastic “bungee” sling. The sling is easily installed by snapping it onto the sling swivel hardware located on the rear of the receiver. Using the sling makes firing the SP5K more stable and reduces fatigue. The overall length of the SP5K is approximately 14 inches — slightly longer than an MP5K — due to its unique handguard. The SP5K hand guard is designed with special ergonomic and safety features to protect the shooter’s hand and provide a comfortable and stable grip. Despite its size, the SP5K is well suited for sporting use. Using the proven roller delayed blowback system; the SP5K’s inherent accuracy makes it an excellent choice for target shooting and an ideal home security arm."

The 941 has evolved over the last 25 years under multiple names, the UZI Eagle, the Baby Eagle and the Baby Eagle II to name a few. Known for its innovative design that allows the slide to ride inside the rails, therefore providing a much preferred lower bore axis.  Another distinguishing design element was that IWI also wisely placed the slide lock/release and the manual safety controls for the 941 on the frame rather than the slide.
It can be carried either cocked & locked single action function, or hammer down double action function. It also includes an integral Picatinny rail, and adjustable dovetailed sights. This particular all steel model has been upgraded with Hogue rubber grips. The standard factory black synthetic grips are also included.
This all steel 9mm 941 comes with a total of two factory 16 round steel magazines and two holsters, one IWI factory Jericho polymer holster with adjustable cant and one felt lined nylon/kydex Front Line belt holster.
This like new 941 is flawless and comes with the factory IWI US shipping/range case, with all original materials, including owners manual, original factory grips, cleaning brushes and an extra 16 round factory magazine.
Prefer local sale and purchaser must be willing to provide a photo ID. If not picked up locally, purchaser responsible for all shipping and receiving FFL fees.
Very reasonably priced at $450.

I will be starting a job soon and they will require me to use the weapon they issue me. Therefor as soon as the job is confirmed I will be selling my Sig p229. It came with a kit that includes lockbox, level 2 holster, laser/light attachment, night sights and two spare mags. I have only fired the weapon when I qualified so there hasn't been over 150 rounds fired with it. It has a great weight to the weapon and grip is very comfortable. Haven't had any problems since I bought it. There are very light scratches on the slide but not very noticeable. If there is anything you need to know go ahead and ask. I will only be selling this weapon with someone that has passed background check or can pass one, and all the required paperwork obviously. (In the picture there is the level 2 hoslter I bought off of amazon but I also have the holster the kit came with. That holster needs the light attachment on the weapon to fit correctly. I have both holsters, I just couldnt find where I left it in time to post ad but I do have the complete kit).  The holster that only the weapon fits into, and not the light attachment, is an additional $15 if you want that too."
