The Ruger® Precision MSR stock is adjustable for length of pull and comb height, offering a proper fit over a wide range of shooter sizes, outerwear, and shooting positions. While easily adjusted, the length of pull and comb height changes lock solidly in place and will not move while firing. The stock also features multiple QD sling attachment points, a bottom Picatinny rail for monopod attachment, and a soft rubber buttpad. The left-folding stock hinge (which provides access to the bolt) is attached to an AR-style buffer tube and accepts AR-style stocks. The Ruger Precision Rifle features a Multi-Magazine Interface, a patent-pending system that functions interchangeably with side-latching M110/SR25/DPMS/Magpul® magazines and front-latching AI-style magazines. Two, 10-round Magpul PMAG® magazines are shipped with each rifle. The highly accurate, free-floated barrel is cold hammer-forged from 4140 chrome-moly steel, and features 5R rifling for minimum bullet upset. The rifle is specified with minimum bore and groove dimensions, minimum headspace, and a centralized chamber. The medium contour (.75"" at the muzzle) barrel features a thread protector over the 5/8""-24 threads, which allow for the fitment of muzzle accessories such as sound suppressors. Barrels can be replaced easily by a competent gunsmith using AR-style wrenches and headspace gauges."

My loss is your gain at $1300 firm no trades no travel. You need to come to Fort Wayne to get this deal. PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONPresenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern.If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed"

NIGHT SIGHTS......Reliability and simplicity have made GLOCK® semi-automatic pistols a favored sidearm for law enforcement, military, and civilian use all over the world. The GLOCK 22 is a full-size service pistol, shooting the .40 S&W pistol cartridge, a standard defense round with proven knock down power. The Gen4 Semi-Auto Pistol utilizes a dual recoil spring assembly that substantially increases service life of the pistol, and helps take the snap out of recoil, reducing muzzle flip for faster follow up shots. A modular back strap allows shooters to instantly customize the grip to an individual shooter's hand size, or to cold weather gloves. Rough grip texturing on the Gen4's polymer frame provides a sure hold on the pistol when hands are wet or sweaty, and the enlarged magazine catch is reversible, accommodating left- or right-handed shooters. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of a plethora of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The dovetailed rear sight is drift adjustable and has a white outline around its notch; the fixed front blade has a white dot. Sight acquisition is quick in any light. The GLOCK 22 Gen4 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable handgun that is easy to learn how to operate and maintain, making it an ideal choice for self-defense, whether it be for field carry, at home, or in a vehicle. The model 22 Gen4 comes with three standard 15-round magazines, or three 10-round magazines that comply with various city or state restrictions on magazine capacity."

Because the factory recoil pad on the Tactical 870 is so-so and the length of pull is short for most users, I just installed a Remington Cellular Polyurethane SuperCell Recoil Pad and a Remington Length of Pull Spacer Kit. Together these are a $50, and make this shotgun very comfortable to shoot. I also did a trigger job which included micropolishing the trigger and sear contact surfaces and replacing the factory sear spring with a lighter one (I have the original spring too, it takes about 2 minutes to change it). This makes the trigger much smoother and lighter without sacrificing reliability. Most gunsmiths would charge about $100 for this. Now to round out the deal, I also recently installed a Cheek-Eez pad for the comb, and recently purchased a 30"" aftermarket ribbed barrel with Modified, X-Full and Skeet chokes so you can use this shotgun for self-defense, tactical, skeet, trap, bird and deer hunting. This shotgun has been used little, about 100 rounds through the original barrel and 200 through the 30"" barrel and has been well cared for.A good used 870 Tactical typically sells for about $350 or so, this one has over $350 of add-ons and a first class trigger job to boot and am asking $550.Face to face transactions at a mutually agreeable location or FFL only."

As far as I know the recall was done on it before I purchased it and I've never had a reason to doubt the guy. *Update- It was brought to my attention that if (if memory serves) the recall was completed, there would be a visible roll pin in the grip safety. That pin is present and visible. Im selling to buy a Glock 42. I purchased a 43 recently and I want its baby brother. I have a crossbreed IWB, and (not pictured) a Blackhawk OWB holster similar to the one provided by Springfield. It will also come with most of a box of Horniday +p hollow point and a full box of ball. I was thinking maybe a Glock 42 and some cash depending on what comes with the Glock. I might be interested in a Holosun optic for the AR for half the price... I'm flexible."

As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge
North American Arms' .22 Magnum can be used with all popular .22 Magnum ammunition, including .22 Magnum shot shells (called Snake Shot by some manufacturers).
This only one gun with 3 sets of grips, pics show each installed on the same gun.  They are the factory black rubber grips, custom machined pewter grips which make it feel weighted a little better, and a holster grip which also has a belt clip. I’ll even throw in a box of .22 mag ammo.
Gun is in great condition, shot very little. Great little pocket pistol.
