I clean it with frog lube and have not shot any corrosive ammunition through it. There's very little scratches and a small knick or two on it mostly from the previous owner moving in and out of the safe and mounting a scope to it. I'm selling it because I'm wanting to fund other projects I have in the works. It's a sweet shooting rifle and would be perfect for iron sight only long range shooting. I don't have the time for that and don't have the room to be able to ""stretch its legs out"" per say. I'm asking $1,000obo. Text preferred to get ahold of me.

I tried my hand at the rattle can dipping and then sealed it with high heat engine clear coat with ceramic. Holds up to a fingernail really well... but I dinged it with my tinkers hammer and the paint chipped. Anywhere there was lots of friction (take down pin/pivot pin, selector, and where the ejection port impacts the receiver when opening) there are small flakes. I took pictures of it.If one was so inclined to strip the paint off with some brake cleaner you would find all the factory anodizing in tact and in perfect condition (it was scrubbed clean and wiped down while wearing gloves prior to painting, curing, painting, curing, painting, curing.... you get the idea. I had a good time building it and it shot well but I had built it as a hunting AR and never got the chance to shoot anything with it. So when the season comes around again I'll probably build another for myself. The close up shot of the pivot pin is what the other areas I mentioned look like. It got me through a hunting season and will need some touch ups."

It might have a little holster wear but otherwise great shape, looks really nice and kept clean.

Price is firm - though if you have lots of 5.56 and/or .40S&W ammo, I might be willing to work something out. As of 2013, this model is no longer listed by FNH USA, and the standard model is what is commonly sold. This platform features the low profile triple rail on the upper reciever, with the sides the small metal rails (milspec) rather than the polymer ones. This is a beautiful and fun rifle to use - because it is bullpup, the overall length is short, and the platform itself is built as a PDW / SMG, which makes it a phenominal platform for home defense and/or close quarters. Plus the 50rd magazines of the 5.7x28mm round, which flies straight and true under 200m due to it's high velocity, and is designed to sail right through body armor. This is a true all purpose firearm - whether for fun at the range or a SHTF weapon for your home. It can be disassembled into the small pieces shown through a 5-second process, that can slide right into a normal backpack to have in the outdoors or to stuff somewhere you don't expect to find a rifle. Everything you see in the pictures is what you get: - Complete PS90 TR, used - estimated 8000 rounds fired, no issues or damage, great condition - AMP Engineering PS90 Tactical Aluminum Trigger installed, much better than the original plastic thing, which is included - Moerse Lekker Vented PS90 Barrel Shroud, easy to remove, placed over standard barrel - Urban ERT stock sling harness in Black - FM Optics tinted 1x red dot sight with covers - HiLight pistol flashlight with standard and strobe functionality - Three total magazine ""parts kits"", Two 50 rounds, One 30 rounds - Dual PS90 magazine pouch - Pelican 1450 Hard Case, brand new, comes with shoulder strap and a customizable lock - 9 total 50 round Boxes of FNH 5.7x28mm 40gr. SS197SR ammunition, 450 rounds total. Per Colorado law, if you are interested, message me through the email option (contact seller at top of page) and we can arrange to meet at an FFL anywhere from Denver to Colorado Springs for a private transfer, though I would prefer the trusty DCF guns in Castle Rock ($52 total). Price is firm, cash only, please._________________________Tags: FN, PS90, P90, Large magazine, polymer, compact, PDW, SMG, close quarters, home defense, 50rd, short, small, tactical"
