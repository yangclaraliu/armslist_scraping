I am more of a gun collector then a gun user. I thought this would be my carry gun but I have found I like another gun for the fit in my hand and this one just doesn't get taken along. This Ruger LCP has had four magazines of 380 ammo fired through it so it is in like new condition and I can tell you it works correctly. I added the Hogue grip and I can assure you if you don't buy my gun but buy someone else's LCP- add the Hogue Grip it allows you to grip this gun about 80% better. All Ruger LCP's have a lot of snap and kick back without the Hogue Grip because these guns are so light 9.75 ounces light. I have the original 6 round Ruger magazine and I bought a Ruger name brand 7 round magazine also. So with one bullet in chambered you can have 7 or 8 shots respectively. Each magazine has been emptied twice. The magazines work correctly. This handgun comes with the soft case, the card board box, a gun lock, and all the paper work. In like new condition and I cleaned this pistol after the 4 mags I ran through the gun. Great gun I just have dozens of guns and I realize I can part with a few. Sorry I couldn't get this listing to add another picture showing the original box, gun lock, paperwork etc. But you will get everything this pistil came with.This gun is about 9.75 ounces unloaded and is a great size and weight for carrying and concealing this pistol. Loaded you can come in around a pound. Its a very comfortable gun for weight and size if you carry.Must have permit to purchase or permit to carry. I will take pictures of your driver's license, your permit to carry or permit to purchase, and you can photograph my info. A permit to purchase is free from your city.  $450 with a box of 50 practice bullets of 380 ammo and one box of 380 home defensive hollow point ammo. Text me at REDACTED Kevin"
