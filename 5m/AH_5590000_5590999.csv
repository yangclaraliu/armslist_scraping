Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have. Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application. If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series.         SPECS   CALIBER.45ACP RECOIL SYSTEM2 Piece N.M.

The brace has a set screw on it to adjust in 1/4"" intervals or so. It is rock solid. I love the gun, but I want to buy the new carbine version that came out, earlier this year, with the long barrel and folding stock. Rather than upgrade this one, I would rather sell and buy complete guns. I am the original owner and the gun has fewer than 300 rounds shot through it. It has been kept very clean with Hoppe's and well lubricated with TW-25B grease. Only the best for this princess! Comes with the original 2 20rd mags that came with the gun as well as 4 CZ 30rd magazines. Also included are the factory iron sights, which are amazing. They have 4 apertures on the rear sight that can be changed quickly with a fingertip, giving you options for more accurate or quicker aiming. I fitted this gun with a Bushnell TRS and it cowitnessed perfectly in the center. Lastly, there is the finger stop on the front, which is a must, at least until you get used to shooting it. With a gun this short, you need to take precautions to not blow your support hand fingers off!This gun is amazing. It is short, light, and snappy to swing around. It is most at home... AT HOME and in buildings, where you need to go around corners without giving someone the opportunity to grab your barrel and wrestle your gun away. Since this gun is classified as a pistol, concealed carry permit holders can keep it *LOADED*, anywhere in a car. That, and the ability to avoid the $200 tax stamp for an SBR, are the two main advantages of buying the pistol version instead of the rifle version.*NEW* prices for the pistol, the four 30 rd magazines, and the shockwave brace are $800 + $80 + $125 = $1005 before tax and shipping. I think $900 is fair for a gun that is effectively still brand new. Please message me if you are interested! I have taken excellent care of this excellent gun."

Has an S&S Carb, straight pipes, original style hydraulic lifters, points plugs and condenser. Old school and a blast to ride. ~ She's a unique machine that begs attention everywhere she goes. - This bike has a lot of time put into her, lots of TLC has gone into making this bike a solid reliable and very fun machine to ride and show. It's a rustic bike with some patina and flavor, but very healthy and turns lots of heads. Starts up conversations everywhere. Title is in my name, registered until July. ~ No Test Rides unless you put cash in my hand, sorry, not debatable. - All new wiring, done by hand with solder and shrink wrap. - Runs good, kicks over easy, good compression, shifts etc. All tuned up and ready to ride. Newer clutch, basket, some seals and bearings. I've been spinning a wrench since I was a kid, and have enjoyed working on this machine. If you want simple, a Shovelhead is an easy machine to work on. It comes with some extras, like the primary cover, and misc this-n-that's. Bike was a wiring nightmare when I got it. It's now fully rewired, changed the tank to make it skinny, look down and there's an engine head between your legs. She rides low and loud, an era correct 70's feel to it. Definitely one of the coolest bikes I've ever owned. Great for weekend rides and local adventures.  - It is Kick Start Only. Could be made electric with a ring gear clutch basket and the primary cover back on.  I will consider partial (maybe full depending) trades for *arms. Looking for a Russian/Chinese SVD. Will consider other offers as well. Cash is always good too ;) No Bikes or Cars - I am reducing my vehicles currently. Please email me with offers and inquiries. Text if your serious. Thank You Shannon. https://youtu.be/UuWE9Xv56es SVD (not PSL) CAi Tiger NDM-86 * Legal transfer through local shop per state/fed laws, non negotiable. - Note: I don't ""need"" to sell this machine other than I am on a bit of a quest to procure an item that I've always wanted. The price is o.b.o, but realize I am not in a rush to do this. The cash is to facilitate the search, not because I am in a bind, or even really ""want"" to sell this beautiful and unique machine. I love this machine, but my quest outweighs that currently, thus she's for sale, at least until I change my mind."

However I'm working on some other projects I'm anxious to finish so the cash would be helpful. The upper receiver, barrel, barrel comp, and lower receiver I duracoated in Magpul FDE. The furniture I paid to have hydro dipped in multi cam. I built this rifle to see how far I could push a heavy grain 5.56 roud accurately. It does that WELL!The barrel is a premium chrome lined 20"" 1x9 twist from DTI. The Upper is also from DTI. The BCG and charging handle are NATO production for the M16. The lower is an Anderson I purchased from the same shop that did the hydro dipp; it mates up really tight to the DTI no wobble at all. The comp on the barrel is a Yankee Hill Aggressive Phantom comp. The butt stock, pistol grip, mbus sights and trigger guard are from Magpul. The 15"" fore grip is from Troy. The Sling is Viking Tactics. The QD single piece scope mount is a Burris (also duracoated). The Scope is an Nikon M223 4-16X42 BDC. There is also a hard case, bipod, and three gen 2 pmags in FDE. If you need more details shoot me an email.I have way more in this set up than my asking price and DON'T NEED to sell, it would just be nice to have the funds for my next project.

I bought this from Sportsmans Warehouse a few months ago and decked it out with FDE Magpul handguard, grip, trigger guard, stock, and 2 additional mags. The stock is the nice one that locks down so it doesn't rattle and the grip is the soft rubber grip not plastic. Since the gun came stock, you still get all the original stuff too plus 500 rounds of range ammo and a box nice DRT home defense rounds. Also, a rifle sock to keep it in and Magpul dummy rounds to practice loading and charging. Please email me for more pictures. I have pictures of everything plus a lot of different angles of the rifle. This gun is brand new - I haven't taken it out of my house. I went from Sportsmans to Diamondback for the Magpul stuff, which they professionally installed, and then home where it has remained in my closet. I have to move and need deposit money so I'm selling everything together... rifle, upgrades, spare parts, and ammo for $800, which is $400 less then I paid so it's a great deal. I can take credit card through PayPal or cash. My only requirement is that you text me a picture of your Arizona drivers license prior to meeting. Arizona laws are awesome but only for transactions between Arizona residents. I live in Rita Ranch and work downtown. I can meet in those areas, Rita Ranch on the weekend, downtown during the week.

I am the original owner and can Honestly say I have never had a Malfunction - failure or jam. This rifle Shoots FLAT - Extremely accurate - reliable and Always goes Bang! It will come as originally purchased with POF Hard-Case manual - Black Magpul stock & Grip- Factory Charging Handle & POF Renegade M-Rail - POF Match grade 4# single-stage trigger (VERY nice trigger very crisp & short reset) The buffer tube - stock & grip are all brand new as I changed them prior to firing the rifle & used a different stock set-Up.

 The finish coating is POFs NP3 which is similar to Nickel-Boron but after researching it, In my opinion the NP3 is chemically superior as it contains a teflon element which is self-lubricating on the wearing internals as well as slows degrading on the wearing parts and is corrosion resistant. The NP3 is not a paint job or anything like Cerakote - it is electrically applied into the metal.  This rifle is a breeze to clean. For the most part wipe it off. The NP3 has a slick feel to it and is Super Durable. Essentially nothing sticks to it. It's still a little dirty in the pics as I'm in the process of detailing it. There are a couple minor scuffs but nothing to the metal or below the finish.
NP3® metal finish offers many benefits. NP3® permits firing for longer periods of time between cleaning, dirt and powder residue have no wet or oily surface to cling to. When cleaning is required, the effort needed is minimal – usually requiring only a soft cloth. NP3® is very corrosion resistant. It provides a high lubricity and low friction co-efficient, greatly increasing the life expectancy of a firearm due to reduced friction wear. NP3® is a satin gray, non-reflective color ideal for all firearms.

Old G.I. rucksack requires patch and sow work on the upper back where the straps are and has very negligible holes at the bottom. Molle ii assault pack needs strap buttons replaced. Large bugout bag is missing a zipper strand but can easily be replaced by a metal one. Sleeping pad has scratches. Pick up only with cash in hand or paypal and I will not sell any items individually. I am open to trade for an AR-15A2 or A4 and a 92fs pistol instead of purchasing (no magazines or ammunition please)"

The only problem is one of the magazines has trouble feeding sometimes, particularly when it gets dirty. It's not too bad, maybe one or two times out of 10, but it's annoying. I've taken the magazine apart and cleaned it with little success. You might have better luck if you know what you're doing, but I'd think about getting a replacement magazine at some point.The holster I purchased separately from Amazon but is designed for this firearm. Armslist won't let me paste a link, but you can find it by searching Amazon for ""Classic Old West Styles Ruger MK III""The little piece of dowel is something I cut to assist in taking down the gun as suggested by the instruction manual."
