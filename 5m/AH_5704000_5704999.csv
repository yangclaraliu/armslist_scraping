Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest!    In addition to the features on the main handguns page, the Classic Custom features the following:  5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy. Weight: approximately 40 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted. 25 LPI checkering on forestrap and mainspring housing.

Traditional ""square cut"" cocking serrations on rear of slide only. Adjustable rear sight buried deep into slide, cross dovetail front sight. Two-piece guide rod for smoother cycling and easier disassembly. Mag catch with Oversize 40 LPI checkered button."

This gun has a tremendous amount of recoil, and the UTG mount is one of the few that will stand up to it.  I shot about 80 of the pellets with the scope mounted, and it hasn't budged.   I only plinked with it, and didn't try to shoot any tight groups or anything, but I can tell you I hit everthing I aimed at.  Guns this powerful can be a challenge to print, but this is also part of the appeal for some (like me). You have to practice and know your rilfe to shoot tight groups with a powerful springer like this.On weekends we could meet in Indianola, during the week we could meet in Des Moines.   At this time I WILL NOT SHIP.  I am firm on price.   I will throw in some free pellets as well.  Thanks for looking."

Also, Zeiss Conquest Riflescopes have MC Multi-Coated optics providing maximum light, color fidelity, and the contrast needed to spot animals in thick cover.

This rifle has it all. It has a 15 inch free floated keymod handguard. It has a fail zero BCG. It has a Bravo Company foregrip. Ergo rail covers, Flip up sights. A Magpul BAD lever. A mission first tactical minimalist stock. It has an integrated single point sling mount with a mission first tactical hybrid sling. It has a rubberized Magpul pistol grip. It has pictogram fire and safe selectors. The rifle has less than 120 rounds through it. I am letting this rifle go with 300 rounds approximately, of federal 5.56 mm brass. This rifle has never had a jam or problem. The barrel is a 1/7 twist QPQ barrel. Low profile gas block. I am letting the rifle go with three magazines and a Magpul magazine Coupler. The magazines are PMAGs. I do not want to separate the the parts, or take the rifle apart to suit your customization needs at this time. If you don't want the ammunition, I'll knock 100 bucks off.I am interested in trades. But the trades have to work more in my favor, because cash is always preferred. I am interested in Glocks in 9mm or 45. HKs, Beretta, Sig, basically any pistol manufacturer that is high end and not junk. I prefer 9 mm or 45. I am also interested in concealed carry pistols. These things must go with cash to even out the price if need be. This rifle is truly a piece of art. No wobble, just perfection. Call or text or email with trade offers, or to make it yours.  REDACTED"
