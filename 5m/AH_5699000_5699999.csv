Rifle has spent most of it's life in a gun safe but has had ~600-800 rounds put through it. It's a mutt assembled from parts from many different companies, but it works reliably and well. Optic works fine but needs a fresh battery. Rifle is complete and ready to fire. May need sighting in. 
* It's hard to tell from the photo, but the bear logo on the lower is painted red, as is the ""fire"" position on the fire select. Manufacturer info and serial number as well as ""safe"" fire select position are painted white. Both fire select markings are painted on opposite side as well. 
I will consider reasonable offers. Not interested in trades for other firearms/accessories, I am moving out of country and cannot take them with me. I may consider trades for *specific items only* that I want or need, such as but not limited to:

Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific up front as it makes it a lot easier.  I don't mind questions at all(cash buyers no problem), but please don't string things along with 10-20 messages only to offer a crap trade in the end.  State the details up front if it's a trade, so I can tell you if I am interested or not.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  A few things I might use or use more of:  
Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts(no std. triggers wanted), nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  FosTech Echo trigger.

Maybe a good 9mm carbine or pistol with ""arm brace"", Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it.  AR 9mm, CZ Scorpion or others??  Want something with a good trigger, so thinking AR 9mm will be easiest and best value.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56, Federal preferred.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech or Vortex magnifier, maybe two Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle and 1-2 with 7.62x39 reticle.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship to TX resident for $30 more.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

They're awesome but it's time to move onto something else. The large blue one is very powerful. Can be seen in broad daylight, and beam is visible for miles. Can even burn at distances under 20ft or so. You can feel the heat even farther, but it doesnt burn well. WickedLasers.com sells a lens expansion that will burn even better, but i never bought it. The green one is a little more compact, and has a belt clip attachment. Doesnt burn without the proper lenses, but is still very powerful. Beam is still visible for a very long range. Last is a 1000 Lumen LED flashlight. Turn night to day with this bad boy. Has a strobe setting, as well as an S.O.S. pattern.Everything runs off the same 18650 batteries, or the two smaller 16340 ones for more power. Comes with 2 UltraFire 18650 batteries, 2 16340s, and any more I can find while I wait for a sale. Also included is a locking case, as these are not toys for children, and can cause a lot of damage if pointed at peoples eyes or skin too long. Original price of all the items is nearly $500, but I'm open to offers.

The 9000HN has all the innovative features found on the 8567N Grabber, plus automatic indexing and finished-shell ejection for quicker and easier reloading. Our revolutionary Auto-DexÖ automatically moves the shells through each reloading stage by simply returning the handle to the top of its stroke. Accurately resized shells are achieved with each stroke. Finished shells are automatically ejected from the shell carrier after final crimping. This time-saving feature makes one-more-hand operation obsolete.With the hydraulic model, the 9000HN, the operator inserts the empty shells and wads, and the reloader does the rest. With each complete downstroke of the foot pedal, all reloading operations are performed at all six stations. The fastest, smoothest indexing system ever made. Our factory-set speed provides uniform movement through every reloading stage regardless of operator action. This 9000HN is available in 12 gauge and is in lightly used condition.  Comes with MEC cover, shot & power bottle support, Powder baffle, New style primer tray, 8' Cabellas un assembled reloading bench, and 2000 mixed Red & Gray AA Hulls.All MEC reloaders include one charge bar and three powder bushings.The 12 gauge reloader includes a 1 oz and 1 1/8 oz charge bar and powder bushings 29, 30, and 32."

ABOUT THE GUN:  Zinc allow is dense and heavy, and to stand up to firearms use, you have to use a lot of it, so the P-32 is heavy - 22 ounces - to the point of being clunky.  But it's a GOOD KIND OF CLUNKY.  There is a satisying feel and heft to it when you handle the weapon. The mag hold six .32 ACP rounds and is secured by a rather robust European style heel release. A strong mainspring coupled with a dense slide make chambering a round a breeze, and the oversized extractor will fling even a loaded round nearly 2 ft.  The trigger is stiff, but breaks cleanly. while the rotary safety is a bit stiff to set, but easy enough to disengage, and blocks the trigger and sear from moving, as well as locks the slide, but still allows for the slide to be retracted ust enough for a visual inspection of the chamber. The grips are laminated walnut, and the gun is finished with a corrosion resistant black Teflon coating.  Performance -- Shooting the gun is a pure joy.  The felt recoil is minimal, and the spent rounds eject from the top of the gun, and cycles flawlessly with all types of ammo in general. This particular gun is a bit cosmetically rough, but its meant to be in your pocket, not on display."

I sent this personal gun to Turnbull a leading Manufacturer of refurbishing firearms in the US specializing in Colt SAAs. The instruction was to strip the Nickel from the entire gun, re-cut the engraving then re-Nickel the gun and do any other work that needed be done. The finished job is spectacular and outstanding. The gun looks new. If I don't mention the work on the gun you would not be able to tell that this is not a new gun. I have proof of all the work done on this gun and its cost, no it was not cheap. A great investment firearm that you don't find very often. I could take a partial trade for General officer pistols Colt 1903-08, Colt M15 or Beretta M9.

We will ship to your local dealer for $15. If paying by credit card, add 3%. VA residents must add sales tax.Put an XD® Mod.2™ in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact.SPECIFICATIONS  UPC Code: REDACTED55 Manufacturer: Springfield Model: XD-Mod.2 Action: Semi-automatic Type: Striker Fired Size: Sub Compact Caliber: 9MM Barrel Length: 3"" Frame/Material: Polymer Finish/Color: Black Grips/Stock: GripZone Capacity: 16Rd Accessories: 1-16Rd,1-13Rd Magazine Sights: Fiber Optic Front, Low-Profile Combat Rear Manufacturer Part #: XDG9801HC"
