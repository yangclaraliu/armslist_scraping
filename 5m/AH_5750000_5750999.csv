Contact us today!*  Matte Mil Dot Reticle   Several Leupold riflescopes are available with the Mil Dot reticle, which was designed to help the U.S. Marine Corps estimate distances. It's now standard for all military branches.  Range estimating with the Mil Dot reticle: With practice, the Mil Dot system is simple to sue. Dots are spaced in one mil (milliradian) increments on the crosshair. Using the mil formula, the shooter can create a table based on the known size of the object targeted. Just look through the scope, bracket the object between dots , and refer to the table for an estimated distance to the target. Leupold scopes fitted with the Mil Dot reticle include more specific instructions on its use.  Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold® engineers developed Multicoat 4®, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You’ll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold’s Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Quantum Optical System   Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold’s newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System™ is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout—the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max® design software and evaluation usingLeupold’s Zygo® Interferometer to minimize wave front error andincrease resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt—from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity—all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.   Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold® optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4® Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association – men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more – rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.See overview of each product for more detailed information on hunting, shooting, and competition applications.

Every CDS dial features ¬-MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-2, VX-3, VX-6 and VX-R even more accurate and rugged. How the CDS System Works The CDS System works by laser-inscribing Leopold's scope's elevation dial to match Leopold's load, velocity and conditions. Leopold's scope will be in perfect synch with the way Leopold's rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads. Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account   MST (Motion Sensor Technology)   An important feature of select Illuminated reticle models is the Leupold-exclusive Motion Sensor Technology (MST). A single touch of the button or twist of the dial activates the illumination, offering several different intensity settings (depending on model) including a high/low indicator (FireDot reticles only). The reticle will automatically switch to stand-by mode after five minutes of inactivity, then reactivate whenever the rifle is moved. This eliminates the need for excess movement reaching for buttons, while extending battery life (weed by a readily available CR-2032 coin cell battery.   1/4 MOA Finger Click   Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments 1 cm per click).

Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You’ll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold’s Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Quantum Optical System   Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold’s newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System™ is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout—the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max® design software and evaluation usingLeupold’s Zygo® Interferometer to minimize wave front error andincrease resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt—from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity—all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.

The slide has been reduced to the minimum possible (4.25"") without significantly impairing the legendary reliability of the 5"" slide. The frame has been modified with the innovative Ed Brown Bobtail® housing which reduces the projecting butt of the mainspring housing without sacrificing the full size frame and magazine capacity. The Bobtail® minimizes the print under your jacket when carrying and reduces weight. Officer's frames reduce magazine capacity and limit grip, while keeping the projecting, sharp butt. Slides shorter than 4.25"" are notorious for reduced reliability. These problems are eliminated with the Ed Brown Commander Bobtail® configuration, which reflects the genius of John Browning with an innovative modern flair. The functional simplicity has yet to be matched. Unique with the Kobra series pistols is the innovative snakeskin treatment. It is a directional pattern, meaning it is smooth to slide your hand up, but bites in for a snug grip the other way where you need it. It's easier on the hands than checkering, and our female customers in particular can't stop bragging about it. Not to mention it just looks cool! The Kobra Carry is an innovative masterpiece, and a serious tool for those who want something a little different. We are sure you'll be charmed by the Kobra Carry!"

This ingenious throw away Rocket and Launcher was one of Hitler's last ditch weapons adopted by the Nazis to try and repel the invading Allies on both the Eastern and Western fronts. ""Most authors agree that production of the Panzerfaust Klein was halted somewhere in early 1944, due to its insufficient penetration of armor and replaced by the larger model."" This inert display reproduction faithfully replicates this classic weapon but none of the internal working parts are included. Each Rocket comes in full size steel construction and is externally accurate including the flexible stabilizing fins. It even has the stuck on replicated instruction label, as issued on the originals. Includes all steel launcher based on an original sample, correct Panzerfaust Klein trigger assembly (which is different than the 60M Trigger Assembly). This trigger assembly has the correct leaf sight and pull pin. For added authenticity, both Rocket and Launcher are now offered in the correct German WW2 Ordinance Tan or ""Gelbbraun"" color with red stencil on launcher which reads ""Vorsicht! Starker Feuerstrahl!"". They have purposely painted this set to resemble a genuine Panzerfaust, meaning the paint is not and should not provide 100% smooth coverage, these are intended to look like the REAL THING based on the original sample.Shipping is extra."

Helmet comes with significant accessories and upgrades, including First Spear Helmet Hut for storage of helmet and all accessories. The Ops-Core FAST Ballistic High Cut Helmet sets the standard by which all other special mission ballistic helmets are measured. The designers at Ops-Core have out-done themselves in the creation of this innovative tactical helmet. The shell is constructed of carbon + UHMWPE which equates to a 20% weight reduction. As anyone who has ever worn a combat helmet for long periods of time knows, this is a huge benefit. Every ounce matters, especially when you are running NVG’s cantilevered off your head. Even with the reduced weight, the FAST Ballistic Helmet offers the same head coverage and size as a TC2002 MICH Gunfighter helmet.The FAST Ballistic High Cut Helmet offers a full compliment of standard accessories and innovative features. It is available in three different internal liner configurations.OCC Dial Liner: The legacy OCC Dial Liner was a truly revolutionary concept in helmet stabilization. The rear-mounted dial allows the user to adjust tension of the fitband around the circumference of the head. Coupled with the excellent Ops Core Chin Strap, the OCC Dial System provides unparalleled stability when wearing night vision goggles. The system is finished off with repositionable EPP Impact Pads and LDV Closed Cell Comfort Foam. These pads are not affected by temperature, altitude, or moisture like the legacy MICH/ACH pads.The sides of the helmet sport proprietary FAST-ARC 4-position Rail Connectors for securing accessories like lights. These brand new ARC’s act as the hub for an entire suite of modular accessories.Works in conjunction with locking and rotating adapters that utilize emergency break-away features for airborne operations.Upper ARC dovetail for devices like low-profile lights, video camera, visor, mandible and up-armor side covers.Corner ARC buckle receiver for gas and O2 mask strap kit attachments that eliminate the bulk and clutter of traditional bayonet style mounts.Lower ARC dovetail for devices like flip-out COM headset, battery pack, goggle strap keeper, mandible and up-armor side covers.Over-the-center side hook attachment for devices like illuminator, strobe light and battery pack.The FAST Ballistic High Cut Helmet incorporates the BISS-NVD lanyard/ elastic tensioner which eliminates night vision mount rattle and vibration by keeping your devices taut against the helmet shell. The Shell is drilled for the standard MARSOC/ WARCOM three-hole pattern. The OPS-Core VAS or Skeleton Shrouds can be mounted to the helmet, providing a platform for securing almost any type of night vision mount.The OPS-Core FAST Ballistic Helmet is one of the most comprehensive helmet platforms available. But, some people are put off by the price tag. This is understandable when you look at the price as a whole. But, if you break down the cost for what you are getting, it is surprising how affordable it really is.Accessories and upgrades include NOROTOS NVG shroud with retention retractor, 1 coyote helmet cover, 1 Multicam helmet cover, ARC rail adapter picked for goggle attachments, plus picatinny rail prices for arc rail. Surefire HL1-A tan helmet light with White/IR/IR BLINKING light for navigation. Princeton Tech white/red light for map reading. 2 sets (EOG small pouch and EOG Low profile) NVG weight ballasts in Velcro pouches. Goggle swivel clips for arc rail. Chin strap cover.

The debut of the full-size P-09 brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. The P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.Product Name  CZ P-07 Urban Grey Suppressor-Ready   SKU  91288   Firearm Type  Handgun  Chambering  9mm Luger   Magazine Capacity  17   Magazine Type  Double Stack   Frame  Urban Grey Polymer   Grips  Stippled   Trigger Mech  DA/SA   Sights  High Tritium Three-Dot   Barrel  Cold Hammer Forged   Barrel Length  4.36 in   Weight  28.7 oz   Overall Length  7.9 in   Height  5.8 in   Width  1.46   Safety  Interchangeable Ambidextrous, Decocker/Manual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety  We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

Below is a description from the manufacturer. The TNV/PVS-14 is a U.S.-made Generation 3 night vision monocular based on the standard issue AN/PVS-14. Our professionally-trained and experienced technicians assemble the TNV/PVS-14 according to U.S. Military guide lines, using factory-new parts and hand-selected image intensifier tubes. We offer all TNV/PVS-14’s in several kit configurations to make sure end users get everything they want, while not paying for accessories they do not need.This version of the TNV/PVS-14 is built with a new-production ITT Gen3 PINNACLE image intensifier tube. These tubes are hand-selected to meet current U.S. Military OMNI VIII contract specs and provide some of the cleanest images available. ITT is one of two factory manufacturers of image intensifier tubes in the United States and the largest producer of night vision in the world. They provide build the standard issue AN/PVS-14 for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force. ITT PINNACLE tubes are feature a thinner thin –film than their L3 counterparts. This makes allows them to capture and process more light, providing the user with a brighter image. But, the thin-film means they do not hold up as well to weapon recoil. These tubes are weapons rated for 5.56x45mm NATO. Please note that while the ITT PINNACLE tube is an OMNI VIII Gen3 equivalent tube, the entire TNV/PVS-14 system cannot be classified as MILSPEC because it is assembled by TNVC at our facility. Only fully factory-assembled L3 and ITT systems, built for a U.S. Military contract can be called MILSPEC. However, the TNV/PVS-14 provides the same performance.Accessories in the kit include a Norotos INVG mount in FDE ($550) with dual dovetail adapter ($150), PRI M69 QR weapon mount ($275), Flip up Focus ring for map reading ($100), Wilcox demist shield ($20), Wilcox Amber filter ($60), Wilcox sacrificial window ($30), shuttered eye guard ($25), USGI SCREW ON 3x magnifier ($500), PVS-14 Magnetic Compass ($125) , TNVC TORCH PRO MKii 810nm focusing IR illuinator with VTAC weapon mount and remote tape switch ($300), BDS tactical NVG padded Molle pouch in Coyote ($40).
