Will come with its original wood grips with an added Tyler T grip, as well as a pachmayr grip and speedloader.  Has also been drilled and tapped for a scope mount, and I have a Leupold scope mount and Centerpoint red dot sight for the right trade or price.I have another revolver and I just don't use it, so I'd be open to trades.  Would consider most handguns in 9mm, 40, or 45 (No Taurus or Kel Tec please).  Not interested in shotguns, but I'd be interested in an 8mm Mauser or a Swiss Schmidt-Rubin style rifle (K31, K11, etc).  Might also look at a basic AR15 (No dpms), or possibly just a complete upper, maybe a bolt gun in 223.If you'd rather buy I'll sell it for $400 for just the revolver, 550 for the revolver, scope mount, and red dot. I have considerably more in it so cash prices are fairly firm. If interested feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested, texts will get the fastest response from me.Thanks!"

The SPHINX SDP Compact Alpha is a duty-sized pistol that can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Alpha is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The polymer pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Alpha. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box."

Should I find the second mag, that'll be included as well. This pistol shoots great - the weight of the SS frame really helps with the recoil. SA/DA trigger feels great and has a decocking lever. Important to note: This version of the P220ST has the newer frame with the rail which will accept standard attachments - the older versions had some sort of proprietary ""accessory rail"" and you needed an adapter. This version is much more desirable.Also note: Asking price is based on other P220STs listed on Armslist. I prefer cash offers, but will consider trades which are in my favor. Price is negotiable.
