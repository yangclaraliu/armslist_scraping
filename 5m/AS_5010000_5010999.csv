It is black (aka Ninja), 27.5"" draw, 65#, smooth cams with Sword 5 pin target sight, ripcord rest and limbsaver limb silencers. I also have the speed cams that will give you another 10fps. The string is two years old and still holds groups but it needs a string this year for best performance. I hunted with this bow three years (probably 15-20 days max) and shot two 3D tournaments with it. I shot it a lot during the spring and summer and it never disappointed me. It was never left in a vehicle or outside in extreme conditions (only hunted with it in October). This bow has a super smooth draw and solid wall (has the draw stops, can't get much more solid than that). It feels like you can hold it forever. To let it let down has to be felt to be understood. This bow is amazing and the only reason I am selling is that for right now I am giving up tree stand hunting and I am not good enough at stalking to hunt with a compound bow. I may change my mind and keep it for 3D so hesitation will get you nowhere. I have arrows for you to try the bow out with but I won't sell them since they are used and several years old. Price may seem high but this is a quality bow and worth it, even with a new string you are several hundred dollars lower than buying a similar new Elite. The sight and rest are worth $200. I will get pictures up soon but I assure you it is in very good shape.

You can see from the photos that this gun is in excellent shape.  It has exactly 168 rounds through it, enough to verify that it functions properly and, as expected of a Glock, it has performed flawlessly.

When I bought this gun I really wanted it to work for me but my hand doesn’t fit the gun the way I want it to (I blame my arthritic hand, not the gun).  That’s a shame because it’s an outstanding design and every inch a Glock.  Its slim profile makes it perfect for either concealed or open carry, for a man or a woman.

The full package comes just the way it came from Glock, including factory box, factory lock with keys, cleaning rod and brush, and all paperwork that came from the factory.

I’m adding five extra Glock factory magazines to the two mags originally supplied by Glock (all 7 mags have Glock pinky extension floor-plates installed; the original two flat floor-plates are included as well).  The gun and the mags are all bone stock.

I just noticed the Pearce grip package in one of the photos.  I was using it to store the Glock flat floor plates. Lol...should have taken it out of the picture.

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas (College Station/Houston area) without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TX driver’s license or permit.

I’ll certainly take cash (firm price considering the number of factory mags), but eventually I’d like to replace this with a Gen 4 Glock 19 to round out my collection (I’d add a little cash for the right Gen4 G19).  That’s about the only trade I’m interested in.

the LE901-16S is the perfect choice for medium to large sized game animals. Exceptional accuracy is assured by its full floated, 16.1” chrome lined barrel and one-piece monolithic upper receiver, suitable for mounting your optic of choice. Keeping the varmint hunter in mind, the .308 Winchester upper receiver group can be easily swapped out for any Mil-Spec Colt upper receiver chambered in 5.56x45 NATO. The fact that all operating controls are ambidextrous, including the magazine release, bolt catch and safety selector, makes for versatility and ease of use. You can depend on the new Colt LE901-16S to take the shot of your lifetime!
