This Kit costed me 126.90 for the fixed stock and the bull barrel with ventilated barrel shroud. To go with the kit is the imporved Henry manufactured magazine. This kit improves functionality by eliminating the jamming problems these rifles were notable for having. The barrel has a small feed ramp machined into the chamber to facillitate feeding. This feature is not offered on factory barrels. The magazine also has a metal spring that engages the nose of the bullet to obtain a better angle for feeding. Henry magazines are the only ones to incorporate this feature. The handle grip has a removeable plastic storage device for fishing line or a fire starter. The barrel finish is about 95% with a nice 100% bore. The stock needs to be refinished at the portion to which it mates with the rifle. This area is bare metal due to the fact that the manufature used a cheap tack weld and the stock fell apart. I took it to a machinist and had it corectly welded. Unfortunately, the heat took the finish off in this area. You can easily paint it black if you want. The eight round magazine has had fifty rounds put through it. Shipping to the lower 48 will be 16.95. Listing is for parts only! Rifle not included! View my Ebay and Gunbroker feedback by searching Loaded_Weapon in the username search.

The M1's safety catch is located at the front of the trigger guard. It is engaged when it is pressed rearward into the trigger guard, and disengaged when it is pushed forward and is protruding outside of the trigger guard. The M1 Garand was designed for simple assembly and disassembly to facilitate field maintenance. It can be field stripped (broken down) without tools in just a few seconds. The rifle had an iron sight line consisting of rear receiver aperture sight protected by sturdy ""ears"" calibrated for 100–1,200 yd (91–1,097 m) in 100 yd (91 m) increments. The bullet drop compensation was set by turning the range knob to the appropriate range setting. The bullet drop compensation/range knob can be fine adjusted by setting the rear sight elevation pinion. The elevation pinion can be fine adjusted in approximately 1 MOA increments. The aperture sight was also able to correct for wind drift operated by turning a windage knob that moved the sight in approximately 1 MOA increments. The windage lines on the receiver to indicate the windage setting were 4 MOA apart. The front sighting element consisted of a wing guards protected front post. During World War II the M1 rifle's semiautomatic operation gave United States infantrymen a significant advantage in firepower and shot-to-shot recovery time over enemy infantrymen armed primarily with bolt-action rifles. The semi-automatic operation and reduced recoil allowed soldiers to fire 8 rounds as quickly as they could pull the trigger, without having to move their hands on the rifle and therefore disrupt their firing position and point of aim. The Garand's fire rate, in the hands of a trained soldier, averaged 40–50 accurate shots per minute at a range of 300 yards (270 m). ""At ranges over 500 yards (460 m), a battlefield target is hard for the average rifleman to hit. Therefore, 500 yards (460 m) is considered the maximum effective range, even though the rifle is accurate at much greater ranges"

The 'Two Tone' P238 model features an anodized alloy beavertail style frame, fluted grips for comfort, and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights are removable and adjustable for windage. If you aren't familiar with the P238, this is a very small pistol that still handles and shoots like a tack driver. It operates as a single action, external hammer, ambidextrous thumb safety pistol that is similar to a 1911 or Colt Mustang in design. The magazines are single stack as well. This gun IS remarkably small, excellent for concealed carry, but still fills in the hand nicely and instills confidence in the shooter.This gun has seen virtually no use, although I'm including a BladeTech Holster, it has never been carrried.I am including 1 holster, 2 magazines, 1 Sig laser sight, lock, lube and owners manualCash only, no trades, buyer pays transfer fees."

This is a superb sporting or hunting rifle. Rebuilt in 1944 with a mint Remington barrel - which is still mirror bright. Trigger pull is light and crisp. Action is smooth as you would expect a Springfield to be. It has a fully adjustable Williams aperture sight with two discs - or use it without a disc as a ghost ring sight. I have taken a dozen or so jackrabbits with it out to 150 yards or a little bit more. It will come with two stocks - both free floated. One is an oil finish converted WWI stock, and the other is a polyurethane finished WWII ""scant""  stock with a rubber butt plad. Both stocks are free floated and the zero holds for both of them. I installed the oil finish one since I just happen to like the looks and feel of an oiled straight stock. This is about the same price as a plastic stocked cheapo modern rifle and will outshoot most of those - while looking ""Classic"". Receiver hasn't been drilled for a scope, and frankly it's accurate enough that it probably doesn't need a scope. You will be happy with this one.

These binoculars are equipped with the Zeiss stabilizing feature.  A superlative set of binoculars: for 20 x magnification observation without a tripod. The 20x60 T* S makes this possible due to its technically unique image stabilization. The unavoidable tremble that makes freehand observation at this extreme magnification impossible is ""switched off"" at the touch of a button. As a result you experience the same high degree of detail resolution that you would expect from a tripod. Ideal for secure aiming at long-range game. The 20 x magnification provides an outstanding level of detail resolution. You can make out the finest of details when aiming at game and can be secure in your decision to take a shot. Extreme brightness is supplied by the 60 mm lens and Porro prism system. The purely mechanical image stabilization system with its gimbal-mounted spring joint and magnetic damping action works immediately at the touch of a button, noiselessly and without battery power. This results in a unique visual experience, such as you have never seen before - totally free of unavoidable hand tremor. The image stabilizer is a mechanical masterpiece and naturally needs protection during harsh use, when idle or during transport. Secure, automatic locking of the moving parts when not in use and the solid, rubber armor of the metal casing serve to protect the internal optics and mechanics.These Binoculars sell new for over $6,000.00. They come with paperwork and factory aluminum case."

995,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5829995,For Sale:  Zeiss Victory NV 5.6X62 LT Night Vision,"Webb City, Joplin, Missouri","$ 3,900","Listed On: Thursday, August 25, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Like new set of Zeiss Victory NV 5.6X62 LT Night Vision.
This night vision device is based around a high-performance Generation 2+ intensifier tube with approx. 20,000 x light amplification capacity. It contains a microchannel plate (MCP), which creates detailed, high-contrast images. In terms of distortion and vignetting it is far superior to earlier generations of night vision devices. An integrated protective function ensures that strong light radiation (e.g. through the sudden appearance of car headlamps) will not cause any damage to the system. You can benefit from having the very latest technology at your side – outstanding expertise from Zeiss. The manually focused, low light 62 mm lens collects all available light and bundles it onto the highly sensitive photocathode. Both the lens and the eyepiece use the cutting-edge Carl Zeiss T* multi-layer coating for maximum light efficiency. The waterproof and dirt-repellent LotuTec® coating gives you clear, unclouded vision. The perfect interplay of optics and electronics offers exceptional stand hunting at night.
Both optics and mechanics are well protected in their rubber armor housing, which is waterproof and filled with nitrogen. A secure grip and individual, ergonomic operation is guaranteed by the fact that the leather wrist strap can be attached on either the left or the right, depending on whether you are left or right-handed.
If there is absolutely no light and no residual light either, the integrated IR LED can be activated at the touch of a button to provide bright images. The LED generates an infrared light that the eye cannot see, but which allows observation with the NV device to a distance of around 50 m. By using an adapter, you can fit an additional torch with an IR filter, which illuminates distances of up to several hundred yards.They are like new except for the price! New, if you can find them, they will sell for $6000.00 and up!"
