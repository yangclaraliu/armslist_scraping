I fired a few from the bench; the full power loads were almost startling. When you are bracing on the bench rest there is less give. I began with the affordable American Eagle .44 Magnum 240-grain JSP. This is a load with a clean burn and good accuracy. The best group for five shots at 25 yards was 2.5 inches.The Hornady 240-grain XTP in the full power Magnum load settled into 2.2 inches. I also fired 20 of the powerful Hornady 300-grain XTP loads. I have to admit, felt like a sledgehammer load but just the same, I managed a 2.0-inch 25-yard group with this Thunder load being that all said you can carry with ease back packing for that just in case run in with a bear."

Youve always wanted one of these so dont let it slip by;) This m1 carbine was reproduced in the early 90's by IAI in texas. This rifle is 100% made in the USA!=) very compact and lightweight firearm would make a great brush gun/ youth rifle. As you can see in the pics it is in good shape, just some minor bluing wear on the bolt and a little scratch here and there. The wood stock is beautiful and has very little wear. This gun comes with standard peep/post iron sights as well a sling and the repro pouch to hold extra mags. This gun will come with two possibly three (15 round) magazines and one (4) round magazine. I also might be able to dig up some ammo for it. Aftermarket 5,10,15 and 30 round magazines can be had for fairly cheap online and commercial ammunition is getting much easier to obtain now.It is a very good shooter and 2"" groups at 50 yards is not uncommon. It can be picky with ammo sometimes if it's real light loaded stuff but the majority of fmj or sp runs fine. Has the flip saftey located next to trigger and magazine release is right there as well. This is a slick gun and I'm not really  sure I want to get rid of it lol. Listening to all offers so please offer up. I can send more pics or info on request. I'm asking $650 cash or 750ish trade value."

Also included is an OD green Lancer tactical helmet and Norotos mount as well as the pictured case. Helmet is Large and never worn.$1400.00 complete $1300.00 without the helmet and mountGoggles are like new. The image intensifier is used but has very few hours and very clear. I did notice a very light line and a little bit of honeycomb pattern. This won't affect your viewing but wanted to mention them. Intensifier tube is a 3rd gneration MX 10130C/UV. Green pic was taken with no moonlight or illuminator, you cannot see much of anything without the goggles . Sorry for the crappy pic as they are much clearer than what the camera shows.
All parts new except tube. Has sacrificial eye lenses. Build in I/R illuminator with an attached lens which gives the ability to focus the beam. 2 new eyecups.
Very nice goggles, only selling for daughters tuition costs
What is pictured is what is included including the helemt and case.
Really prefer to sell but I would consider a few trades such as interesting battle type rifles, CZ or Sig PDW style weapons, Gold, Silver, good quality single phase mill, relaible car or ? Really don't need any AR's or shotguns.
Willing to and prefer to meet public place. Can meet at dusk/night to show them. I am Northeast of Dallas but work in Dallas. Can meet in Mckinney, Frisco, Plano, Richardson down to Dallas
Please do not ask to ship out of the country. ITAR rules dictate this and no I will not break the law. Sorry that also means no APO/FPO's."

The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.
Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.
The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. At just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck."

Our pursuit of perfection didn’t stop with springs though and led ultimately to the creation of the patented Silent Captured Spring in 2012. Maintaining all the benefits of our polished buffer springs and proprietary LMOS™ buffer, this combination buffer-spring assembly eliminates the friction of standard buffer components resulting in outstanding smoothness and sound abatement. What’s more, the spring is removable from the assembly for custom tuning, and both the AR-15 and AR-10 versions of the JP Silent Captured Springs are functional in rifle- and carbine-length operating systems. The AR-15 version fits and functions in any gas-operated AR-15 variant, regardless of caliber and the AR-10 version should fit and function in any large-frame AR-10-type platform. The JPSCS is not compatible with any 9mm AR variant or any blowback system using a solid (weighted) carrier."
