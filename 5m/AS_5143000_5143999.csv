Unfortunately the 4 year university route isn't for me and I'm now getting welding certification meaning that I no longer have a need for the iPad. Before I try to sell it, I'd love to trade it for a handgun. Preferably something full sized, my hands are too big for a compact pistol. I'm open to both autoloaders and revolvers and I'm open to different calibers. Although I would absolutely love a .45acp or a 9mm. The iPad has 32 gigabytes of memory and the keyboard is really nice, it essentially allows you type into the iPad as you would with a traditional computer.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of various accessories. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.  The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

And equally well with 1 or both clips attached. Don't wait 8 weeks on back order. Get this and avoid sales tax as well. Willing to make arrangements to ship CONUS.See description below:The G Code / Haley Strategic INCOG inside the waistband (IWB) concealment holster is a joint development project between Travis Haley of Haley Strategic Partners and G Code Holsters. The G Code INCOG is a minimum bulk, multi-positional, deep concealment, high quality Kydex holster. Its distinctive features enable the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while facilitating the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw from the concealed carry. Inherent to the G Code INCOG are adjustments in the depth of concealed carry, angle of carry, the position of carry and security of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting points on the INCOG holster and the use of variable mounting components. Combined they maximize function respective to the users body type, concealed carry deployment tactics and personal preferences. The G Code INCOG holster is adaptive to varying operational environments and mission requirements. The mounting clip incorporates a negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the concealability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the positional security of the holster during use. This higher position facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. The mounting clips also have multiple mounting points further increasing the range of carry options and adjustments. The mounting clips open and slide down over the belt and lock in place. The clip is actuated via a finger tab, and is flexed to open allowing quick installation or removal from the belt. All INCOG holsters come with Black FUZZ coating except for the Kryptek Typhon color option. Kryptek is a laminated fabric covering. At this time, PatriotTAC is ONLY selling the INCOG's with black FUZZ coating on our website. If you'd like to special order another coating/color, or ANY G-Code product, please contact us by phone, text, or e-mail."

And is quickly put on or removed in seconds yet always secure. The draw from it feels smooth as glass.  Works great for appendix, or strong side carry. And equally well with 1 or both clips attached. Don't wait 8 weeks on back order. Get this and avoid sales tax as well. Willing to make arrangements to ship CONUS.See description below:The G Code / Haley Strategic INCOG inside the waistband (IWB) concealment holster is a joint development project between Travis Haley of Haley Strategic Partners and G Code Holsters. The G Code INCOG is a minimum bulk, multi-positional, deep concealment, high quality Kydex holster. Its distinctive features enable the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while facilitating the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw from the concealed carry. Inherent to the G Code INCOG are adjustments in the depth of concealed carry, angle of carry, the position of carry and security of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting points on the INCOG holster and the use of variable mounting components. Combined they maximize function respective to the users body type, concealed carry deployment tactics and personal preferences. The G Code INCOG holster is adaptive to varying operational environments and mission requirements. The mounting clip incorporates a negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the concealability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the positional security of the holster during use. This higher position facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. The mounting clips also have multiple mounting points further increasing the range of carry options and adjustments. The mounting clips open and slide down over the belt and lock in place. The clip is actuated via a finger tab, and is flexed to open allowing quick installation or removal from the belt. All INCOG holsters come with Black FUZZ coating except for the Kryptek Typhon color option. Kryptek is a laminated fabric covering. At this time, PatriotTAC is ONLY selling the INCOG's with black FUZZ coating on our website. If you'd like to special order another coating/color, or ANY G-Code product, please contact us by phone, text, or e-mail."

Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.  Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability."
