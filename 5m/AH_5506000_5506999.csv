It definitely hasn't been shot more than two times in its entire life, and is in almost mint condition. These guns are fairly rare and you won't find much info on them, but they are made in the Czech Republic, and the BRNO action is world renowned for their use in African/safari type hunting rifles. I read somewhere that the .222 rem holds the 5 shot group record @ 100 yards @.009'  I don't personally have much experience with the round, but it sounds damn accurate. If you are looking for something to shoot Zika flys at 100 yards with, or (probably a better use) would like to teach someone how to really shoot, this is your weapon. asking 275 obo"

Comes with 2 chokes, sling, and all the other goodies in the pictures (not the cleaning stand). Perfect for sporting and home defense. I'll be honest, this has been my most favorite shotgun ever. It's been reliable through the 100+/- rounds I've put through it, and the kick is seemingly lighter than other 12g semi's I've fired. I think it has to do with the angle of the stock plus the pistol grip. A real joy to shoot, a fast handler and great ergonomics - even the wife enjoys shooting it! We're selling only because we have to thin out the gun safe a bit and a Benilli is on my birthday list.3” gas operated, semi-automatic tactical shotgun that allows you to shoot light to heavy loads. Removable choke system that uses Beretta® Mobile / Benilli threads includes two choke tubes (one Extended, one IC), and choke wrench. Highly durable injection molded stock w/ fixed pistol grip and forearm. The Raptor ATAC features a picatinny rail and ghost ring sight mounted, plus a fiber optic bridge front sight, fixed pistol grip stock with soft rubber gripping and swivel studs. Backed with a five-year mechanical warranty.Features:Magazine Cut-OffBridge Front Sight with Fiber Optic BeadPicatinny Rail with Ghost Ring Sight Mounted5 Round MagazineChrome-lined Chamber and BarrelSwivel StudsExtended Beretta® Mobile Choke and IC ChokeAction: Gas operated semi-automatic. Bolt remains open after last round is fired. If magazine and chamber are both loaded, opening action will result in ejecting shell from chamber but will not cycling new shell from magazine into the chamber. Magazine cut-off is located near trigger guard and must be pushed to eject shell from magazine. This allows shooter to clear chamber but keep magazine loaded.Safety: The primary safety is located on the backside of the trigger guard. When engaged, the safety is designed to block the trigger, hammer lever and the hammer which makes the firing mechanism immobile.Magazine: Tubular magazine; bottom loading.There is a magazine tube mod that can be done if you choose - Google it. I'd also encourage anyone unfamiliar with this to Google reviews of it - they're overwhelmingly positive!As of this posting, GunBroker shows two ATACs listed, 1 for $359, another for $419. Add in your shipping and transfer fees, and you're looking at $400-450. This one is for sale for $350."
