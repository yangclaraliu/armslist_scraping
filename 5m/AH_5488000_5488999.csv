Up for sale is a beauty of a Beretta 92A1 that has been heavily customized. Also comes with a bunch of extra parts.This is not just a pistol that's had some new grips on and been called custom. Some of the modifications include:    Trijicon tritium night sighs ($125)    Captured guide rod ($50)    Wilson Combat Short Reach Trigger ($30)    Wilson Combat Ultimate Action tuning kit  ($80)    Wilson Combat Extended Magazine Release ($40)    Wilson Combat Low Profile Safety ($40)    Wilson Combat Trigger Return Spring Conversion Kit ($20)    Wilson Combat Slim G10 Grips ($75)    Wilson Combat  ""D"" Spring Conversion Kit ($25)     Some professional work has been done on the pistol including polishing of metal to metal contacts, and the installation and tuning of the WC ultimate action kit.Included but not currently on the pistol are the original Beretta plastic grips as well as a set of Beretta factory wood grips valued at around $75. There are 6 factory 17 round magazines, an Uncle Mike's inside the pants holster, and a Beretta zip up soft pistol case. Also included is a box full of miscellaneous parts, including but not limited to a Wilson Combat steel guide rod, original trigger, action bar, polymer guide rod, and many, many factory and aftermarket springs. This is a deal at any price under $1200 with all the time and money that's been put into it. Keep in mind that brand new 92A1s are selling for $675 now at Gander Mountain.After the initial gunsmith work, I spent about 6 months buidling this thing up, going to the range and shooting to see what worked and what didn't and what I could do to make it better. I've probably put about 800 rounds through it. Most of the springs were replaced recently so it should be good to eat up ammo for thousands more rounds before needing any works.I'm very happy with house this one turned out, but it's time for me to part with it and start on the next project to keep me busy.     If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I'll answer them. I can supply more photos on request.
I am negotiable on the price but don't insult yourself or me with lowball offers. Possible trade for a Remington 700 SPS Tactical + cash, and/or Remington 700 VLS stock.As always, all FOID laws apply."

Patton referred to as: "" the greatest battlefield implement ever devised."" She was originally purchased through the Civilian Marksmanship Program years ago. The rifle is chambered in the venerable 30-06 cartridge. The SA barrel dates to 4-55. The SA rifle serial number dates to 1955 as well. That, along with like condition and Patina, suggests the barrel is original to the gun. The serial number will be given upon phone conversation only. There are no visible import marks. The stainless gas seal is the only area exhibiting any significant wear. Rust is non-existent, nor are there any signs of major battle scars. Normal wear is minimal for the time frame. There is evidence of a faint ordnance cartouche stamp on the stock just below the left side of receiver.  The barrel is shiny and remains accurate. The rifle functions wonderfully and is accompanied by 5 en bloc clips.  The rifle wears an OD nylon sling, befitting of the time period in both use and appearance. The weapon has the normal matching of the major US manufacturers parts of that time:Receiver- SABarrel- 4-1955Trigger Group- International Harvester Op Rod- SA Bolt- Harrington and RichardsonSights (SA). The sights are in excellent mechanical condition and show minimal wear. They remain audible, tactile and precise on the firing line.This Garand is an excellent example of American Ingenuity. It retains the history of "" the greatest generation"", and will continue to be a legacy for generations to admire.*Numerous additional photos upon request."

These Revolvers are Historically Significant as they represent Colts first Metallic Cartridge Revolver and their move away from percussion revolvers. These were manufactured from leftover percussion parts with a new cylinder and barrel. These revolvers are not often seen and when they are they usually command $1500 and up with no finish. Barrel length is 3 1/2"" hence the model name 3 1/2. This one isn't the prettiest as it has some deep pitting on the barrel and cylinder but it functions like new and has a great bore. I have shot it with black powder .38 Rimfire and it functioned flawlessly. The wedge screw is broken and frozen in place and the wedge is frozen as well but I'm sure it could be removed with a good soak and some elbow grease as I only tapped in it slightly to try and remove it and it wouldn't budge. The grips also have a crack running the length of them but it is solid and not going anywhere. Cylinder scene is visable in place and barrel address is readable. So here is your chance to get Colts first single action made in 1872 before the first single action armies were produced in 1873. As an antique manufactured in 1872 I can ship this directly to your home with no restrictions. If shipping is required I would prefer payment by PayPal gift or send money to family and friends option with no mention of anything gun related aspaypal is very anti gun. I would also accept cashiers checks or money orders. Email, call, or text REDACTED."

These were only made in 1986 by Miroku for Browning. Unlike the modern Winchester 1886's this model has the a trigger and hammer designed by John Browning not a team of lawyers.   It is in very good shape but is not a safe queen either.   I shoot it  and the original owner shoot it so it has handling marks.   I added a skinner aperture signt to it and I still have the original rear sight too.   Shooting a slow 405 gr lead cast at 100 yds with the iron sights I get 3.5 inch groups.  These guns shoot jacketed bullets better but I dont have any. It feeds smoothly which is crazy when you watch the big old cartridge worked through the action. I do not have the box or paperwork. If you are looking for a classic you can appreciate, hunt and hit  the range with this is it.All sales final.  Payment in cash. I cannot sell to a felon. You must have 2 matching forms of ID.

Keep it as a range toy or slip it into a pocket, purse, or belt holster. The 9mm Mararov round is powerful for it's size but the P64 feels great and shoots better. Put it in a pocket holster and it just dissappears in your pocket.     This was a hand-select and doesn't look carried or issued. Made in 1968 with care and class. Deep factory bluing without wear. These are great shooters and extremely accurate. I have a couple and just moving one to fund other projects.     Installed a 20# Wolff spring to ease the stiff DA trigger pull notorious in these babies. Does make a good extra safety step, tho, and after a double-action pull the single action shots are lighter and crisp.     Supply on these ComBloc pistols has pretty much dried up and prices are on the rise. Grab one while you can. Really, after this week, grab one while you can.Comes with one magazine numbered to the gun. And the import wrapping paper.     $300, Melbourne / Space Coast area.

We have a 1977 2.5” Colt Diamondback with all original papers and box making this one a complete set. It was obtained from the original owner family who stated that their father never fired this Colt. After careful inspection, we believe he may have fired one cylinder through it. The condition of this Diamondback is near perfect except for a slight turnline and very faint burn marks on the face of the cylinder and that is why we suspect it has been fired. When we received the Colt, it was covered in oil and after it was cleaned, we determined it was fired but very little. If you look real close, you will also see a very small scratch under the cylinder latch but it is very small. If you have been looking for a near perfect mint condition 2.5” complete set Colt Diamondback, this is your Colt. The box is original and missing the one flap but the one with the end label is attached with some tape. Colts that come direct from the original owner have that WOW factor and this one is no exception. Own a Colt Diamondback that has not been sold over and over again. Shipping is $25 and free for all military, veterans and law enforcement. Please visit and like our FB page at: DSF FB Page"
