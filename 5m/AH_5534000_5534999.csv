I have a lakeside machine razorback belt fed LR 22 up for sale with all the goodies! this upper fits tightly on your mill spec lower. this listing is for the upper and all its accessories only, no lower is included. armslist only gave me three pic downloads and my camera isnt that great but if you message me i can supply more images. she comes with 2 belt magazines, 2 brass catchers, 1, 50 round belt, 1, 150 round belt. and one 550 round belt, adapters for standard length buffer tube and compact buffer tube. no optics, i used to have an eotech on it but that darn thing busted. comes with the ammo case seen in last pick. i store all her parts in it.  Yes she will fit on your M4 platform. just pin her on and go! Yes she comes with a F.A. style bolt, i dont belive lakeside machine ever made anything but F.A. bolts.all paperwork with user manuals. two speed loaders origianal 45 degree hammer spring. i bought this years ago but never got around to using it. she has just been sitting in the safe. it has been cleaned and oiled twice a year however as i do this with all my rifles used or not to ward off rust.  california and wa state compliant as it is listed as a semi auto long rifle. there is a grey area when it comes to capacity so i recomend leaving every 12th round out of the belt. i put a few rounds in the 150 round belt for pics. this is the first time the belt had ever been loaded. and lastly the belts are reusable. with propper care they will last for years and years. i have been told disintegrating links will also work on this platform. the buyer will be responsible for all shipping fees for some reason armslist has marked this as shipping unavailable im not sure why but i will look into it. i am open to shipping This is a $2500.00-$5000.00 weapon! i am posting it cheap for a quick sale, I am not one of those that belives i should get retail for a non retail piece. do not contact me and try to trade me your $500.00 bushmaster for this weapon. ARs are great but they are not worth near what you paid for them. A last added note, I have had this listed for a couple weeks now, i have had several people contact me about it, i have had five folks try to buy it but not one that has completed the payment yet. i understand that armslist is a free listing tool and is in reality a lot like CL for guns but this is just silly folks! i am listing this cheaply, normaly this sells for between $2500-$4000 Depending on your location. YOU WILL NOT FIND THIS IN FIVE YEARS! please please please do not offer me your rifle in trade if it retails for what im selling this for. Im not retailing mine,  i am wholesaling it. in other words if i can buy you handgun new from cabelas for $1000.00 then its realy worth as a used weapon about $400-600. what will a pawn shop will give you for it then ad 20 percent.      PAY PAL IS NOT A PAYMENT OPTION AND YOU KNOW WHY. Please dont ask Pay pall is supper militant against all guns and gun parts, they will freaze a sellers account for the smallest precievd violation and the seller has ZERO protection from fraud. Pay pal is not a payment option. U.S. Postal order is the only secure trackable payment method i know of for out of state transactions. if you have anther let me know but be sure to understand pay pall is not an option no matter how many times you have successfully used it. i will not take that risk again."

It was made just before they started the one caliber a year Classic series. At first they were making them in common calibers. This was originally a 30'06 and was rebored to 35 caliber and the barrel was restamped (barrel was rotated so the '06 markings are covered up by the stock. When I got it the extractor was chipped. I had a gunsmith at metro shooting supplies change it out for a brownells heavy duty extractor and change out the ejection spring. Lastly, I installed a drop in adjustable Timney trigger because of the recall. I've only fired a few rounds through it and as much as I like the idea of it, I need something with less recoil. Rifle looks brand new. Blueing is like glass. Comes with Nikon prostaff 3-9x40. I specifically chose this scope because it was the only 40mm I could find at cabelas that will fit in low rings which makes for a great cheek purchase."

Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard utilizes a modular rail system. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems.Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy.A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance.The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.I purchased this rifle new from the original owner. It has very low round count.  The rifle has the following accessories and/or add-ons:MR556 Rifle MSRP $3,400Trijicon ACOG4x32 with RMO red Dot and iron sites MSRP $2,600PWS Muzzle Break MSRP $100Geissele HK MR556 Trigger group MSRP $500Raptor Charging Handle MSRP $100Magpul UBR Battle Stock MSRP $285Magpul AFG angled foregrip MSRP $35Hogue SureGrip tactical paistol grip MSRP $35Picatiny Extendable Bipod MSRP $100Total Package Value $7,155Asking $5,250 OBO.  Will sell rifle and scope separately for the right offer.  (Case in photo not included) No trades please, I would not sell this rig, ever, if I didn't need to raise the cash for other priorities.Thanks for looking"

The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case. Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology 1. It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round. 2. Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols. 3. Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot. Size & Features With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. The CCP comes in stylish stainless or Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation. This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface. Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide."
