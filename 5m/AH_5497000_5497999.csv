Built for 3-gun, this is easily the softest shooting rile i've ever shot, thanks to the low mass bcg, rifle length gas system, adj gas and brake. Shooting it side by side with a standard carbine is comical. Little to no muzzle rise, and with an unloaded weight of just under 6 pounds, this is an easy turn-key solution to rifle competition. Rifle comes pre-tuned to run on off the shelf 55gr American Eagle ammo, and the gas block's 15 position detent system makes adjustments incredibly easy.

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one ( 30 Round )magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail.  The TAVOR SAR B16 Flattop incorporates a full-length MIL-STD Picatinny top rail in addition to the standard short rail mounted at a 45° angle opposite the charging handle. --Caliber: 5.56 NATO (.223) --Action: Semi-auto --Operating System: Closed rotating bolt, long gas stroke on piston head --Magazine Type: Polymer NATO STANAG type (Typical AR mags, such as PMAG, etc...) --Magazine Capacity: 30 rounds --Barrel Material: Cold hammer forged, CrMoV, chrome lined --Barrel Length: 16 1/2"" --Overall Length: 26 1/8"" --Weight: 7.9 lbs. --Rifling: Right hand, 6 grooves, 1:7 inch twist --Stock Color: FDE --Stock Type: Reinforced polymer bullpup configuration --Sights: Folding front sight (blade) and rear sight (aperture)"

This is a top of the line rifle that is honestly one of the most accurate rifles to 100 yds I have ever shot.  It is truly incredble in every way and an absolute blast to shoot.  I have put very few rounds through it, maybe 200 or so but it has proven to be a dream in every way.  I hate to part with it but other interest force the sale and in this case my loss is your gain.  It includes the rifle, one mag and a Simmons, Whitetail II, 3 x 9 Scope.  This firearm is in perfect shape in every way and looks like it is unfired. Here is what Volquartsen has to say about it: ""Like our other magnum rifles, the TF Rifle features a blowback design. However, in order to help handle the increased pressure of the 17 HMR and 22 WMR rounds, the TF Rifle also utilizes a precision engineered and machined counterweight system attached to our CNC-machined steel bolt. This eliminates the need to use more expensive alloys in the bolt. The weight is located in front of the receiver and concealed in the stock. Our TF Rifle also includes the same TG2000 trigger unit – a Volquartsen exclusive – tuned to a crisp, clean 2.25lb trigger pull. The rifle sports a black matte coated stainless steel bull barrel. The barrel is 18 inches."

The inside holster compartment is almost 15"" long and 7"" tall, with several other additional smaller pockets. The inside of the holster portion is velco, and there is strap system that you can configure to hold smaller guns, or you can just set the long barreled revolver in with no holster. There are many combinations available to you; please see the photo with the inside parts laid out.The 1.5"" wide heavy nylon strap will adjust out to about 53"".This fanny pack is made of rip-stop tactical nylon by Q-Veev in Seattle, Washington.
