Barrel is good, finish is worn in a good looking way as shown. Asking $520, will come with one magazine and the wood grips (if you want the surplus wrap-around grips just toss me a box of .45ACP ammo and they're yours). No trades (unless it's for something like a Sig STX  or Springfield TRP, loaded, or range officer plus cash on my end), no mags over 15rds, will require a transfer at an FFL around Denver."

It was officially replaced as the standard infantry rifle by the faster-firing semi-automatic eight-round M1 Garand starting in 1937. However, the M1903 Springfield remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during World War II, since the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm all troops. It also remained in service as a sniper rifle during World War II, the Korean War, and even in the early stages of the Vietnam War. It remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector's piece, and as a military drill rifle."

Tested to Well within Safe Pressures and under 1MOA Groups), and 257 rounds of Wolf Steel cased (total of 557 rounds). Also 92 pieces of fired BrassOnly Reason I am selling the upper is to put money into a new platform. Note that what you get here would cost you about $1500 New. This rifle is a pretty nice all around platform, recoils only slightly more than a 5.56, and the accuracy is certainly there. I am open to offers and possibly trades depending on what you have. Would most likely be willing to trade for an AR10, a Bullpup or compact tactical rifle, or a Long range bolt Gun. Any questions let me know. ... Also originally listed the entire rifle so the pics will reflect as such. What you get here is everything minus the complete lower. If anybody is interested in the entire rifle Im willing to do 1300. The Lower is pretty high end, Match 2 pound trigger, Magpul Pistol Grip and trigger guard, LUTH-AR MBA-1 buttstock. Dont be afraid to shoot me a cash or trade offer, Thanks"

Back when the West was still wild and the rifle was the tool of choice for survival and frontier justice, the venerable .44-caliber put more meat on the table and outlaws in the ground than any other bullet. The West may have been tamed and fenced long ago, but its unbridled spirit lives on in this line of traditional big-bore Henry rifles. Choose from .44 Magnum, .45 Colt and .357 Magnum. All are SASS approved so Cowboy Action shooters who enjoy stepping back to that bygone era can use them in competition. Don’t let the retro look fool you, these rifles are much more than shootin’ irons for today’s new breed of cowboy. They’re also the unbeatable choice of big-game hunters who prefer the traditional look, feel, reliability and accuracy that comes from an authentic Henry rifle. Each Big Boy receiver comes drilled and tapped for easy scope mounting, and the barrels are fitted with fully adjustable sights The traditional 20"" octagonal barrel is outfitted with a classic fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear sight with a reversible white diamond insert and a brass beaded front sight. The tubular magazine tops off at 10 rounds. Both the straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted of select American walnut accented with a brass barrel band and Henry’s recognizable brass receiver."

Back when the West was still wild and the rifle was the tool of choice for survival and frontier justice, the venerable .44-caliber put more meat on the table and outlaws in the ground than any other bullet. The West may have been tamed and fenced long ago, but its unbridled spirit lives on in this line of traditional big-bore Henry rifles. Choose from .44 Magnum, .45 Colt and .357 Magnum. All are SASS approved so Cowboy Action shooters who enjoy stepping back to that bygone era can use them in competition. Don’t let the retro look fool you, these rifles are much more than shootin’ irons for today’s new breed of cowboy. They’re also the unbeatable choice of big-game hunters who prefer the traditional look, feel, reliability and accuracy that comes from an authentic Henry rifle. Each Big Boy receiver comes drilled and tapped for easy scope mounting, and the barrels are fitted with fully adjustable sights The traditional 20"" octagonal barrel is outfitted with a classic fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear sight with a reversible white diamond insert and a brass beaded front sight. The tubular magazine tops off at 10 rounds. Both the straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted of select American walnut accented with a brass barrel band and Henry’s recognizable brass receiver. All have that crisp, smooth action that sets an authentic American-made Henry apart from other lever action rifles on the range and in the woods today. Displayed images are stock photos.

So, up for sale is ONE of my FN PS90's.  If you're just looking for the gun alone, I guess it doesn't matter which one, as they are identical.  I've had them both about 5 months, have shot them both twice, and have put about 400 rounds downrange in each.  One of them has a Seekins Precision low-mounted Leupold VX-3 1.5-5 x 20mm CQB style illuminated  duplex scope, where the crosshairs illuminate with a small red cross just at the intersection of the crosshairs. It's an awesome scope, and in my opinion is superior to a traditional red dot for this reason.  You have the best of both worlds: You have some legit magnification power (up to 5x) for precision shot placement, but unlike some red dots where the dot itself is large enough to cover and obscure part of your target, these illuminated crosshairs draw your eye to your bullseye just like a red dot, but they are thin enough to not obscure your bullseye.  For some (stupid ? unknown? ) reason, Leupold just recently discontinued this reticle in favor of their firedot style, and this scope was apparently the last one in stock that Optics Planet or anybody else had.  I'm VERY happy to have it, and VERY reluctant to part with it, even if I'm selling the gun underneath it.  But if somebody wants it with the gun I totally understand, but I'd only sell it for what I paid for it. These apparently can't be found new anymore, which is truly a damned shame, bc they are superb scopes. The Leupold Custom Shop designates them as ""Past Product,"" and Optics Planet and other resellers don't have them anymore.  The comparable Vortex PST 1-4 x 24 is a good scope too, but in my opinion the TMCQ MRAD/MOA reticles they come with, are very cluttered at the bullseye compared to the much ""cleaner"" look and useable bullseye of this Leupold. They just don't allow for the same hit precision as this Leupold.  Leupold does have their newer Vx-3i line, but for whatever reason, those models are not illuminated. Sometimes newer isn't better...    
The second PS90 is outfitted with a Seekins Precision medium- mounted Bushnell Tactical Elite 2.5-16x42 mm mil dot scope.  Some people might legitimately opine that this is ""over-scoped"" for a CQB weapon (and certainly I'd agree that the mil dots are totally unnecessary for CQB distances). But with 2.5 x at the minimum setting, it is still very practical at that setting for a CQB configuration. And that's why this particular Bushnell Elite scope is awesome in its own right too, as it has the same 6x mag range that the top end Leupold VX-6's  have now, and yet at its lowest setting, it is perfectly good for CQB work.  And yet at 50-75 yards on anywhere from 10x-16x power, it is ridiculously precise.   I can put 25 shots into a silver dollar when I just steady the buttstock off of a rabbit eared rear bag, and rest my forward hand on either a flat bag, or just the bench itself.  For a CQB PDW, that is amazing accuracy, which is why I got all giddy and wound up getting a second one of these.  As a benchrest rifle guy, I'm always curious to see exactly how accurate a system can be even if it wasn't built for accuracy per se, and these PS90's are surprisingly very, very, very accurate for what they are.  I'd sell one of these for 1,175 w/o the mount or scope. Typically these sell for anywhere from 1275-1395 new, plus FFL transfer fees ($50), taxes, and shipping.  If you want the Seekins Precision mount that's already installed (was purchased brand new for each gun), those sell new at 120-135 plus shipping and taxes, but I'd let mine go for $75.  If you want the one with the Bushnell Elite Tactical Scope , I'd give you a deal on that one, as that scope thankfully is still available, so I could always pick up another in the future.  If you want the one with discontinued Leupold, I'd only sell that at my cost, as those are no longer available, and Im sure I'll regret selling it the minute I do."
