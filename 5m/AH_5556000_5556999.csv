It is probably the most reliable and trusted muzzleloading gun that exists. I Another great benefit of the T/C Hawken if you aren't already familiar, is it's double trigger design. The rear trigger is a more full pull, which engages the front trigger in such a way that the front trigger needs only a slight touch to set off the hammer and launch the ball. This makes for greater accuracy. The trigger also has a half back setting allowing you to load a cap before finding your animal.

You are looking at a Smith & Wesson Performance Center 1911 - Commander. I hate to have to let this one go, but as with my other listings, life happens. I purchased this pistol from Vandalia Armory not long ago. This pistol has an amazing trigger and really turns heads. The grips really set this pistol off in my opinion. I paid over $1400 plus tax, ammo, extra mag, holster and mag holster. This pistol comes with an OWB Stoner leather holster and matching mag pouch. I am also including a full box of the infamous R.I.P. ammo and a wilson combat 8 round mag along with the two mags from the factory. I think this is a very fair deal. I am the only owner. The pistol is in great shape with the exception of the barell coating from slide racking and test fires. I have many more pictures available if needed. Please feel free to ask if you have any questions!Thanks!"

The Mk47 was designed to harness the power and reliability of the 7.62x39mm cartridge utilizing a robust bolt also based off our Mk3.

The rifle was manufactured somewhere between 1937 and 1948. The US Great Depression lasted from 1929 to 1939 so it is possible this very rifle was manufactured during the Great Depression. This rifle is a perfect representation of gun manufacturing during the Great Depression. It's simple design was cheap to produce making it affordable to the common man at the time who had to find affordable ways to put food on the table. The rifle only allows one shot to be fired at a time. Meaning every shot had to count while hunting to feed the family. This kept people from firing multiple shots enable to kill their game. Every shot cost money, money that most Americans didn't have. This rifle is a great affordable historical firearm that any collector should have in their collection. Because of the way it represents the design and function of a rifle, produced to fit the needs of the people during the Great Depression.There is no serial number in this rifle.

Has always been properly cleaned and oiled although these rifles were made for heavy abuse. I bought an ATI Fiberforce Dragunov stock for it about a year ago and modified it for functionality. This means I cut open the trigger guard for easier disassembly, (nearly impossible to reach the button before) removed a large piece behind the dust cover, (made field stripping physically impossible) and dremled a bayonet cut so the bayonet could be used again. Gun would make a great SHTF gun or just a good fun rifle for a day in the woods. Only reason I'm selling it is because I need the money to fund my AK project. Will come with everything pictured including the original wood stock and one 30 round detachable magazine. Buyer pays background check and transfer fee.

This CZ75 P-01 features the omega trigger, threaded barrel, tall night sights, and the urban grey finish. Included with the gun is a hard carry case, two 16rd magazines, lock, and all factory literature. Below is much more detailed information about the gun pulled from the CZ-USA website.  Part of the 2016 Urban Grey Suppressor-Ready Series, this pistol is clad in urban grey (a mix of grey and FDE). With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options.
A further evolution of our offerings with the Omega trigger system, the new P-01 Ω Convertible allows users to swap from decocker to safety operation in the same manner as the popular P-07/P-09 pistols. Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials to enhance durability, operation life and reliability.
The CZ P-01 is a compact, aluminum-framed 9mm designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame make it ideal for discrete carry as well.
With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use.
After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.
Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN."

A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action.

From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

These suppressors are the result of extensive R&D and are optimized to give you an affordable, lightweight suppressor packed with features typically found in more expensive models.  The Sidewinder utilizes an all new high efficiency mono-core baffle made from 7075-T6 aluminum that is class 3 hardcoat anodized. The outer tube is made from 6061-T6 aircraft quality aluminum which is also finished with class 3 hardcoat anodize. These materials offer high strength and longevity in a lightweight package. Our Adapter, Nielsen Sleeve, Blast Baffle, and Rear Cap are constructed from heat treated 17-4ph stainless steel. This type of stainless steel is extremely resistant to corrosion and wear, and will not degrade when exposed to extreme temperatures.  The Sidewinder is user serviceable which allows both the baffle and Nielsen device to be removed for cleaning and maintenance using the provided disassembly tool. Our Nielsen device enables flawless semi-automatic operation on all relevant host pistols. The Sidewinder has 12 index points that allow you to adjust point of impact while remaining attached to the host firearm. Each Sidewinder comes with a heat resistant tactical pouch (YHM-TSP-10) that allows for easy storage, even if the suppressor is still hot to the touch.  The average dry sound signature of the Sidewinder .45 when testing to Mil-Std 1474D is 130.5dB on a Glock G21 using Armscor 230gr. ammo. Shooting the suppressor ""wet"" will net even quieter results.  LINK TO SUPPRESSOR WARRANTY"

WAAAY lighter than the standard models, 1911's etcThe pistol has been equipped with tritium night sights, and the magazine safety has been removed for a better trigger pull. It is a very nice trigger.The grips are wood hogue grips and are in perfect condition.Gun comes with one 13 round mag and one 20 round extended mag.I honestly am not 100% sure how to price this one, they are so rare it is hard to pin down a current market value.

Normally when you find these guns the grips are fake, its a New York style you can't exactly pinpoint to Nimschke, Not only is this 100% correct Nimschke engraved, but in his rarest style, also with Tiffany grips, just to find a Colt with Tiffany grips that are correct is just so uncommon, but when you can find them in their rarest style which is the ""Missionary and Child"" its just almost unheard of.This is a Deluxe Engraved by Nimschke Colt Model 1862 Police Revolver with the 6 1/2"" barrel. This is Nimschkes rarest pattern of engraving that you normally don't find on his pieces with this being the arabesque style. This piece is phenomenal regarding the Tiffany grips, The grips are gold plated cast in bronze. The gun like you normally see they were put away and kept pretty, this one to me is far more beautiful then one of those, this is one that someone actually shot some. (Probably to show off to his friends that he had something nicer then theirs).Payment inform of Bank weird, Paypal.serious buyer, email me and we can talk some about it.Shipping on this pistol because of insurance.Every serial number matches it is 100% correct.

It has 30"" twist-steel (aka Damascus) barrels and should only be used with black powder loaded shells or black powder substitute loaded shells. Also the shotgun needs some repairs. The right lock (hammerless locks) will cock on opening and will function when the front trigger is pulled, but the left lock will not cock or fire and it looks like the left firing pin is broken off too. The gun is very nice cosmetically and would make a great wall-hanger. The external surfaces do show some wear, dings and scratches as would be expected on a gun of this vintage but none of the external wear is significant. The bores do have some light pitting but it is minimal. This is a private sale of a privately owned firearm. I will sell itperson to person within Indiana to an Indiana resident or from my FFL dealer to your FFL dealer out-of-state."

Service and support is their number one priority and concern. POF-USA is an American owned and operated small business. Their manufacturing and R&D facilities are headquartered in Glendale, Arizona. POF-USA specializes in the design, manufacturing and marketing of AR style rifles, uppers, lowers and miscellaneous gun accessories. Modular Railed Receivers™ (M.R.R.™) POF’s latest generation of Modular Railed Receivers™ (M.R.R.™) does away with the consequent choice between the fully-railed “Tactical” design or the minimal, large-scope-friendly “Hunter/Sniper” model and, instead, introduces interchangeable aluminum Picatinny sections. This allows you to attach all your essential rifle accessories along the top, bottom, and sides with an appropriate rail count while keeping your unused areas smooth and lightweight. POF’s new rifles come standard with one medium-length “12-slot” and two smaller “5-slot” interchangeable rail sections (referring to the available accessory slits found on each piece). These stock pieces are perfect for essential accessories such as bi-pods, flashlights, and forward grips.

The SSAR-15 SBS allows the shooter to safely bump fire their AR-15 from the shoulder, effectively and legally simulating fully automatic fire, and allowing for an unprecedented measure of control that is severely lacking when attempting to bump fire a rifle in the traditional, ""from-the-hip"" manner.   The SSAR-15 features a shelf that positions the shooter's index finger in a fixed position in front of the rifle's trigger. To fire, the upper receiver is moved forward with the support hand pushing on the forend, thereby bringing the trigger to the shooter's finger and discharging a round. The rifle's recoil causes the upper receiver to move rearward, allowing the trigger mechanism to reset. When the right amount of constant forward pressure is applied, the rifle will continue to fire as the trigger is brought forward and depressed by the shooter's stationary index finger, causing the gun to Bump Fire. With a little practice, the shooter will be capable of delivering accurate single shots, bursts, or even full magazine dumps on demand using the SSAR-15.   The SSAR-15 is designed for installation onto any Mil-Spec Diameter AR-15 Collapsible Stock Receiver Extension Buffer Tube. Installation involves removing the factory pistol grip, replacing it with the included Interface Block, and sliding the SSAR-15 onto the buffer tube. No permanent modifications or gunsmithing required! Each SSAR-15 assembly includes the SBS Buttstock, an Interface Block, Hex Key, Instructions, BATFE Approval Letter and Lifetime Factory Warranty. Made in the USA.   Technical Information:  • Model: SSAR-15 SBS • Stock Material: Reinforced High Strength Polymer  • Length of Pull: 13""  • Compatibility: AR-15 with Mil-Spec Diameter Collapsible Stock Buffer Tube  • Includes: SSAR-15 SBS Stock, Interface Block, Hex Key, Instructions, BATFE Approval Letter  • Some aftermarket sling adapter receiver end plates are NOT compatible with this stock  • SSAR-15 Stocks are compatible with most enlarged winter trigger guards"
