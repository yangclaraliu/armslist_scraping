It has been oiled and cleaned regularly and well kept in the original case. It comes with on magazine. I bought this for my father who is getting older and feels unsafe in a house all alone. He wanted a concealed carry safety tool and i thought this would be perfect. Since he is getting older the pistol has become a little more kick then he can deal with. I also own a older Bersa 380 before the Thunder was made and after taking him to the range to see if that would work better he loves it. I am thinking the Thunder cant have more recoil then the older model that i have so I am looking for a trade for an older Bersa model or a Bersa Thunder for this to give him as he will have his Concealed Carry by the end of march. He iscurrently using the Bersa I own but that is the only pistol I have found my wife enjoys so it is realistically her pistol so Im working on making all parties happy.
