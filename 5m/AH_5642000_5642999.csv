There is even some data for lead projectiles included at the end of the data for each caliber. One issue I have with the data is that Lyman often switches from PSI to CUP when listing pressures.

I built this rifle back in 2013/14 to satiate my desire for a SPR. Seeing as I havent shot it in nearly 2 years and am getting married in October, I've decided to let it go to a new home were it'll be well loved. Here's whats on the rifle:* E3 Arms Omega15 base rifle. 5.56mm 16in 1-8 twist chrome lined barrel * SWFA 10x42 mil-quad scope with Burris P.E.P.R scope mount and Butler Creek scope cap* POF monolithic rail with LaRue clips on bottom* Magpul PRS stock black/tan* Harris 13"" bipod* DeuckDefense RTS iron sights* ergo grip* PWS flash hider/compensator* Quake Industries CLAW sling* 2 20rd PMags and 4 30rd PMags
It is zeroed at 200 yards with Hornady .223 55gr V-MAX Varmint Express and I've hit 8"" steel plates out to 700 yards. Seriously solid rifle and I'd love to keep it but I dont shoot it enought to justify keeping it in my safe. If you want more pics or have specific questions, please feel free to email and ask! Price is OBO and trades are negeotiable. I'm looking for a CC piece so I'll consider something high quality and easy to conceal. I594 applies and you pay tax/transfer fee."
