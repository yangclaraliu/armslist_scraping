In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719.

This allows range estimation for silhouette targets.Tritium Activity: 100 milliCuries in one sourceACOG (Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights) - Hit fast in any lightThe ACOGs are internally adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC)* models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. The ACOGs combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Although the ACOGs have many features which are very advantageous for military use, they were developed by Trijicon without government funding.Designed for use with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions -- without failure-prone batteries.Standard Features: - Eye-friendly advantage. Conventional riflescopes offer only a tiny exit pupil, requiring careful eye positioning directly behind the eyepiece. ACOG provides maximum eye latitude behind the scope, for easier target acquisition. This greater aiming freedom is especially important in stressful field situations requiring quick aiming. - Multi-coated lenses provide maximum optical performance- Forged 7075-T6 aircraft aluminum alloy housing, precision machined to exacting tolerances, and hard-anodized to match the upper and lower receiver of the M16 rifle. - Internally adjustable because only the prism housing moves, the ACOG is much more rugged than conventional designs. - Aerospace seals make the ACOG waterproof to Navy Seal depths. Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC): The highly advanced Bindon Aiming Concept is an optical breakthrough that combines traditional long-stand-off marksmanship capability with the ultimate in close-combat transitional aiming. Using the two-eye aiming method, when the weapon is being moved, the perceived image is unmagnified, permitting extremely rapid target acquisition. As soon as the weapon movement is stopped and the shooter is close to the proper aim on target, the targeted image ""zooms"" into magnification, permitting greater shooting accuracy with higher hit ratios. This is especially useful for moving targets or for targets in dense cover."

It comes with a Galco holster,three magazine pouches, 2-10 round magazines, 6-16 round magazines and the original case with cleaning brush, trigger lock and all origninal documentation.It is in great shape and lovingly cared for. I am selling this handgun as I am aging and have no heirs that are intersted in my collection. It is for sale at a very reasonable price."

This year the Micro 9 Two-Tone joins its ranks, offering the same highly sought-after small-scale 1911 ergonomics, a single action trigger, superior safety features and all-metal construction. The Micro 9 barrel and slide is machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture, while the frame is shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. One of the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with a short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 in design. Other standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel —not plastic— and mounted in machined dovetails for additional durability.

You will read and hear about how nice the trigger is and it is phenominal I can assue you! The pistol comes with 2 MecGar 18 round steel magazines. These some of the best Italian made magazines on the planet if you know anything about firearms! It comes with a nice solid case, cleaning brush, 2 adjustable backstraps, a great retention holster IWB or OTW, a mag loader and lock. Very accurate pistol with great sights and super clean!! This is the decocder with visible loaded chamber indicator model which makes it nice for novice as well as seasoned shooters. VERY SAFE CARRY GUN. I bought two of these. The one I got for my girlfriend is a little too big for her concealment purse. Of cousre the purple purse has to stay(lol) At $300.00 this thing a darn steal. It is pretty much brand new.

The unique magazine-cutoff is still present on the right side, though it was disabled at the time of conversion. I purchased this a few months ago with the intention of having the receiver drilled and tapped for a scope, but have since decided that I don't want to commit the sin of drilling holes through the beautiful crest on the top, or ruining the Ottoman-Turkish markings in Arabic script with a side mount. Wood is in good shape, though a crack is faintly visible in the right-side wrist area behind the trigger guard. I apologize for the poor quality of my photography, and have included some of the high-quality pictures taken by the original seller (close-ups of receiver and bore). This is an antique, so no FFL or even CR is required, only proof of at least 18 years of age. Can ship UPS ground for $25, or arrange local pickup in Tri-Cities.

Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finishes are either super-hard black Melonite® or classic bead-blasted stainless steel. The Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.Loaded-chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature.The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition.Local face-to-face cash sale only.
