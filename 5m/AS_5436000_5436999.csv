FrogLube's new EXTREME is pourable in freezing climates and stays intact during high heat operations.   Additional Benefits to standard FrogLube CLP:  * Remains viscous in sub-zero temperatures and does not evaporate or burn off during high heat. * Reduced fouling on tactical rifles used in high volume round counts. * Functions extremely well on ""tight action"" or precision built firearms.  * Can be mixed with standard FrogLube CLP™.  * Convenient applicator squeeze tube packaging. * Complies with U.S. Army Field Manual/Tech Manual specifications for small arms operations and maintenance.

(not to be confused with MIM parts that are very common in the commercial market). 156/157 holes are honed to assist in perfect alignment and a smooth trigger pull. After that, the BCM PNT™ Trigger and PNT™ Hammer then goes through a 3 step heat treat and case hardening process for optimal grain structure alignment, yielding a stronger and more wear resistance product.     Polished The sear engagement surfaces are ground, but then hand polished for an increased smoothness and reduction in friction up to 300% beyond the Mil-Spec.     Nickel An electroless nickel finish is applied for a smoother trigger pull with less ‘grit’ and reduced felt ‘creep’. Nickel also provides a long lasting finish that will not corrode, rust, or discolor due to oxidation.     Teflon Teflon particles are embedded in the nickel, further reducing the friction of the interface and ensuring a long lasting coating. This is done on both the BCM PNT Trigger and Hammer in order to provide the maximum benefit allowed by the nickel coating, by augmenting the low friction and corrosion resistance.       This assembly includes our impact resistant trigger and hammer pins. They are centerless ground to a fine finish and superior tolerances to ensure compatibility with all MIL SPEC lower receivers built per the USGI TDP. The BCM Disconnector is stamped from a 1070 material and fine blanked for cleaner edges, double disc ground to precise size. All hammer engagement surfaces are also ground for a super clean reset.   The processes and tolerances are matched in the BCM PNT™ Trigger Assembly to create a system better than the sum of its parts.   As with all BCM products, Made in the USA."

The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use. The new WITNESS PAVONA is beautifully designed, elegantly packaged and sparkles when you hold it; a sophisticated pistol for the woman that desires everything.

Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.
