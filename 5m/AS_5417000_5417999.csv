This listing includes everything you need to upgrade your AR-15 rifle/carbine from the mil-spec plastic handguards to having a lightweight mid-length aluminum free float forearm, including tube and aluminum barrel nut (black type 3 hard coat anodized), a set of glass filled nylon upper and lower vise blocks (to hold your upper or lower in a vise - without the risk of scratching or bending it) while doing maintenance or installing parts etc) and an ADJUSTABLE low-profile aluminum gas block (can adjust the amount of gas pressure to compensate for cheap ammo, reduce carbon buildup, reduce recoil, and enhance reliability) and a heavy duty AR-15 Armorers wrench (for changing barrels, muzzle attachments, installing castle nuts, etc.).These parts and tools will make your ar-15 lighter, more accurate And more reliable. And even if you didn't want to install the gas block or free float tube on your own, the armorers tools will eventually come in handy! Nordic Components makes rail sections that can be added if you want to add A flip up front sight or bipod etc. Everything is BRAND NEW. Make me an offer (worst case scenario is that I say no). If you bought these things from Brownells you'd be spending around $200-$250, but since I no longer have any use for them, it's your chance to upgrade your AR at a reduced cost."

This rifle started out as a brand new off the shelf 700. I took it to Lee Baker for some work. He blueprinted the action, added an oversize recoil lug, and fitted the Krieger barrel. Its a 1:14 twist for lightweight projectiles, with the standard Remington varmint profile and Krieger's signature fluting. The stock is an aluminum bedded HS Precision, and the trigger is a Rifle Basix. Lee initially chambered the rifle for 5.7x28 (it was a crazy idea on my part, but fun). It was shot very little in that configuration, less than 200 rounds. Then, I sold the 5.7x28 bolt, and brought Lee a new .223 bolt with a Badger Ordnance bolt knob, and he rechambered the rifle to .223. Its only been shot to confirm function and grouping since then. The rings and base are Leupold, brake is an AAC 51T QD, and the scope is a Vortex Viper PST 4-16 first focal plane with illumination. I also have an ammo can with 200 rounds of Fiocchi 40 grain v-max, a load that has proven to work very well in this rifle. $1700"

AWS ""Live Free or Die"" matched upper/lower with CCMG parts kit. Trigger is crisp and clean with the upper sporting a Seekins Precision red billet aluminum AR10 charging handle. With a Blitzkreig Tactical LR308 BCG dual serration which can be used with most uppers on the market as it has the serrations for a 3 o'clock style forward assist and a pronounced shoulder for the DPMS style forward assist.
DUAL EJECTOR: ""Two is one, one is none"", a motto to live by. This BCG has a second ejector in the bolt. Building this redundancy allows the BCG to eject and extract efficiently and consistently. This is truly a remarkable and uncommon feature offered in bolt carrier groups.
Carrier: Case hardened 8620 steel, with dual forward assist serrations.
 Finish: Black Nitride - QPQ Treated
 Gas Key: 4130 steel, attached with grade 8 hardware and properly staked
 Cam Pin: Hardened 4340 Steel
 Firing Pin: Made from 8740 steel, center-less ground and hard chrome coated
 Bolt: Case hardened 9310 steel, all bolt parts are case hardened and shot peened with two ejectors and two crane O-rings and dual extractor springs installed.
 Black Nitride/QPQ: This is an extreme case hardening process which turns the steel black and hardens the surface of the steel and extends the life of the product. QPQ stands for Quench Polish Quench. This process is now commonly used in the industry. The Black Nitride is coated by H&M who own the trademark, ""Black Nitride"". Only the best here.
The Barrel is a Green Mountain Barrel which was machined by KAK industries. It is 12.5"" 416 stainless with a 1/10 twist. Chambered in 308 winwhich also will accept 7.62 nato. It is medium contour with a DPMS LR308 extension, matte blasted grey finish topped off with a pinned and welded5.5"" muzzlebrake which reduces muzzleflash by 95%. This is not a pistol, it is a legal rifle with the pinned and welded barrel measuring out to a cool 16.08 inches.
Lets not forget the 12"" freefloating keymod Omega rail either. It is light and sturdy and will accept a wide range of keymod rail sections. Included are 1 3"" and 3 2"" rail sections.
The stock is Troy industries PDW style stock. Lightweight and compact making this rifle a battleax for our time. It shortens overall length by 2"" compared to an M4 stock. The impact-resistant, polymer cheek-piece with QD swivel mount provides stability and comfort; the aluminum thumb-latch and guide rails offer superior strength and five positions of adjustment.

Building on the lauded submachinegun platform that first hit the US civilian market in pistol form in 2015, the Carbine has a 16.2? barrel fitted with either a compensating muzzle brake or a faux suppressor built specifically for CZ-USA by SilencerCo. Fit with the factory’s folding adjustable stock, the Carbine features a number of US-made parts to make it fully 922(r) compliant. One of the nicest features of the firearm is the newly-designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor. Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable 9MMWe accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.
