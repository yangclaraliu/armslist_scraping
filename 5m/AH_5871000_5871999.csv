A Smith & Wesson MP15 .223 semi-automatic rifle with sling and 3 pocket gun bag. I bought this gun brand new and I never got the chance to shoot it. Four 30 round Magpul PMAGs. 1,120 rounds of loose .223 ammunition. 1,000 rounds of the ammo was purchased in five separate boxes of the 200 count Remington UMC. Each box was dumped into a metal ammo can I bought from an army surplus store. I no longer have the boxes the ammo came in. You will get this ammo loose in the ammo can. These are not reloads nor are they factory reloads. Attached is a picture of an example of the box the ammo came in. 120 rounds are separate from the can and I'm really not sure what kind it is. I do know that I bought these in a store as well and threw away the boxes. If you've never owned an AR-15 before this is one hell of a starter kit. Nothing is to be sold separately so please don't ask. It's all one package. Get a hold of me if you are interested. Cash only."

No scratches on the glass and it's as clear as any scope you'll look through that's $500 or less. This is an upper end Nikon that has a one piece tube and built in Japan. Notice on the lower end Nikon scopes that the turret housing in the middle of the scope has one side that is threaded into that housing, these are two piece tubes which aren't quiet as durable and allow another point for the nitrogen or argon purge gases to escape which leads to a cloudy scope. Notice also that the lower end Nikons like the Prostaff and Buckmasters are made in the Philippines.  This scope has a fine duplex cross hair reticle and is a 1"" tube. I have some leupold STD mounting bases and rings available for sell as well if interested. The bases are two piece windage adjustable mounts that work on Remington 700.

When I say like new in box, I really mean it. I purchased this rifle as a gift for my nephew, but unfortunaely my rabidly anti-gun moonbat sister will not let him have it. I took it out of the box loaded one pellet and test fired it before I found out she wasn't going to let him have it. It was rewrapped in its origional packaging and placed back in the box. The scope hasn't even been mounted. The only reason I am selling it is because I have no use for another pellet gun. It comes with everything from the factory including all of the paperwork. I will also include a 500 round package (well 499 rounds now) of crossman primier .22 Caliber pellets. It doesn't come with any pelets from the factory so this is an added bonus. I am selling the rifle and the pellets for $100. This is far far cheaper than anywhere else. Please feel free to look online. I am in the Leesburg area and would like to stay close. Some Features of this air rifle:-Shoots .22 Caliber Pellets-Velocity: 950 FPS-Sound suppressing shrouded and rifled steel barrel-Two-stage adjustable trigger-CenterPoint 4x32 rifle scope"
