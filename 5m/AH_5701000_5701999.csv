Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.   Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.   Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.   The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. Starting at just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck.   Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4″ sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants.   The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.   Must be 21+ years of age to purchase.   Price: $769.99 each - ON SALE for $759.99 each"

Chambered in 9mm, this a very fun little gun to shoot. I have 2 of the extended 7 shot mags. I bought the gun new from Powderhorn Outdoor Sports in Williston for right around 700 in late January of this year and bought the extra mag directly from Sig shortly after. After shooting the gun a few times, I found that I really disliked the trigger so I had a friend of mine who is a gunsmith take a look at it. Turns out it was nearly 11 lbs! So, after purchasing an aluminum trigger from IDP Tactical, I had the trigger swapped and lightened and the fireing assembly polished to round out the trigger pull to a much more managable 5.5-6lbs. As most Sigs do, the gun came with nite sights and this particular gun, being the SAS edition came with the very nice wooden grips and rounded edges. To go with it I also have an IWB Alien gear holster that fits the gun perfectly. It also came with a pretty decent hip holster from SIG and obviously a lock. I have all of the original manuals and receipts.As for price, I have over 900 into the gun including the holster and trigger work, so i think $750 cash is fair. To be clear, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the gun, I just need the money for something else at the moment. Feel free to email me if you are interested. Thank you."

Here's one for the Winchester collectors - very popular these days, very collectible and who knows what the future holds. Got money in the stock market? Time to bail and invest in something that you can hold in your hand. I'm listing two Winchester 1890's (Model 90 on this late one) in rare to find condition. This is one of the last to be built, in the always popular 22LR caliber. Serial number 825XXX, and they only built an estimated 849,000. I'd guess 1940 or 1941, but no records exist to verify. Completely original finish in my opinion. and the pictures will show it, but you be the judge. Lots of blue remaining, showing little use. Some flaking on the bolt and lower tang, common in rifles of this time period. Features a standard rear sight but in addition there are two very rare sights. The upper tang has a Lyman #52 Windguage tang sight and the barrel has a King Patent Triple Bead Front Sight. Both are uncommon and I would venture to say they came on the rifle from the factory. They should add a few hundred to the price by themselves. The bore appears to be very good and the rifle is very clean, matching the outstanding original exterior. There are a few scratches through the clear coat on the bottom of the stock, keep in mind that most of these guns were well used and they are scarce in this kind of shape. If you are a collector, don't pass this one by. You'll be very pleased or you can return it and get your money back. Please take the time to read my feedback. I'm sorry I'm not a better photographer because I can't do it justice. Any imperfections in the pictures are actually reflections that I couldn't avoid. All in all, this is a fantastic quality Winchester that isn't often seen and you'll have the best looking one in town! Add it to your collection or take it out and shoot it! See my feedback - my descriptions are honest. If you don't like it, you're welcome to send it back for a refund - but you'll be pleased. Feel free to ask questions and I'll respond as soon as I can. Add $49 for careful packaging and shipping. Payment by postal money order is preferred and ships the quickest, but I will accept a wire transfer or major bank cashiers check - allow a couple of days for it to clear my bank. Cash price listed - credit cards accepted but you will lose the 3% discount shown here. SORRY - NO LAYAWAY AND NO PAYPAL. NO PERSONAL CHECKS - if you send one, it will be returned and your rights to the auction forfeited. Please pay within 5 days. FFL is required. It's your responsibility to have your transfer dealer arranged and to make sure the FFL gets to me. I can accept a faxed or emailed FFL copy or one included with the payment. If I have to make repeated phone calls to obtain the FFL copy, it will delay shipment of your gun. The Gunbroker auction number and your name must accompany the FFL copy. All of my contact info is available on the Gunbroker auction page at the end of the auction. Three day non-firing non-disassembly inspection from the time it's delivered to your FFL to insure my honest description - you won't be disappointed!

They are the rubbery kind, not the sandpaper kind.  I've only put 50-60 rounds through it with the talon grips, so they have a lot of life left before they need to be changed- no peeling whatsoever.  I also did the white color fill which is in great condition, I didn't notice any flaws.  The original case is included, but no manual.  The only sign of wear I really see on the gun is on the slide release.  The case is dirty from the first owner, but I'll attempt to clean it well before shipping.ASKING $495 O.B.O., PLUS $15 S&H to your FFL    ******SALE PENDING******    ********SALE PENDING********           ******SALE PENDING*******I also have a 3 speed deep concealment holster.  I wore this holster in my house exactly 3 times on top of clothing to get a feel for how it would carry.  I ordered the upgraded version that has extra pockets for ID, cash ,CC, etc.  The holster was made to fit the Glock 27 with a spare mag for a Glock 22.  The nice part is it fits my Glock 22 as well.  It you wanted to carry a shorter mag in the spare slot for the G27, just fill the empty space with something to keep the shorter mag accessible.   This holster has a generous amount of velcro and can fit a waist up to mid 40s, cut it down if you're smaller.  3 speed holsters are very well made and this one is like new.  The owner Joe Roger out of Ft. Lauderdale is excellent to work with should you ever have an issue.I can't fault the holster in any way, it's just not for me.  I'm chunky and I don't wear baggy clothes and didn't want to invest in a new wardrobe to accomodate everything.ASKING $85 O.B.O, NO EXTRA S&H if it's bought with the G27          Purchased separately, SAME ASKING Price, plus $5 S&HSerious inquiries only, FFL and Bill of Sale required for shipping.  Local pickup is cash and carry.  For shipped orders, money order or cashier's check is preferable.  Order will be shipped within 24 hours of cleared funds.  No credit cards or paypal.I have sold here before on an old account.

This is a perfect upgrade for someone who has purchased an M&P 9c and is looking to use the pistol in either a CCW, duty, or combat configuration. Specifcally, the kit includes 4 M&P 9 17 round magazines with X-Grip adapters, 1 M&P 9c 12 round magazine, an OWB and IWB holster. This kit levels up your stock M&P 9c by including the correct number of magazines and holster types required relative to the task at hand. The M&P 9c accepts full sized 17 round M&P 9 magazines. The X-Grip adapter provides a full sized grip to the M&P 9c pistol. It gives you the feeling of a full sized pistol at the size of a compact one. Given the grip surface, you can then carry the M&P 9c as a legitimate weapon system in the included OWB holster either for carbine or pistol training. For concelaed carry, you can then use the standard 12 round M&P 9c magazine and the included IWB holster. Here is what I have invested:2 Factory S&W M&P 9 17 round magazines - $70 (currently $35 a piece on Cheaper than Dirt)2 Promag S&W M&P 9 17 round magazines - $30 (currently $15 a piece on Cheaper than Dirt)1 Factory S&W M&P 9c 12 round magazine - $34 (currently $34 a piece on Cheaper than Dirt)4 X-Grip S&W M&P 9 Adapters - $44 (currently $11 a piece on Cheaper than Dirt)1 Uncle Mike's M&P 9c Kydex Pancake and Belt holster - $18 on Cheaper than Dirt1 Rawhide M&P 9c IWB holster - $25All magazines function flawlessly. The Kydex and Rawide holster are broken in and extemely comfortable to carry. I have done multiple defensive pistol trainings with these magazines and actually find that the Promags perform extremely well, almost better than the factory magazines. As for why I am selling, I switched from M&P 9c to Glock 19 configuration and as such, no longer have a need for any of these. So, all in I have paid $221 plus probably $30 in shipping to collect all of this. My price is firm and fair.  It represents a 40% discount over buying all of this stuff new before shipping. That is unheard of on Armslist. I accept cash only. No trades. No cash and trade. I do all transactions in Apex, NC at Young Guns."
