Manufactured in 1956 serial # begins with N. I had several of these 39A's and Goldens and this was my favorite but now due to illness I am down to my last couple of guns which I have listed here on Armslist. Wood is excellent and the bluing is beautiful except when I pulled off the scope mount today there was a little lock-tite stuck on the top of the receiver and when I scraped it of with my fingernail it marked the bluing a little, not bad just had to mention. The blueing has been re-done by Ahlmonds Gunshop here in southern Mn. and they did a beautiful job. The gun really did not need to be reblued but seeing that it was my favorite gun I just wanted it perfect. If you are going to mount a scope on it, you can have the weaver scope base I just took off with it. $650.00 Cash only. You must have a CC permit or Permit to purchase and some type of picture ID so I can prove where this gun went and to who. If you don't have CC permit or permit to buy we can go thru an FFL. if you want. Email with any questions and I will get back to you asap. Thanks for looking."

A number of years ago the legendary company released their XD line of pistols. They come in all the popular calibers. I will showcase the 9mm version, but my talking points will hit on all the models.
Although the XD9 platform is a little aged there is still a lot of life in the system. This underrated pistol is a great buy for the price and has some extra features that appeal to first time shooters.
First, this pistol comes with a lot of extras right out the box. There is more stuff that comes with the firearm than a lot of premium tier products. You get a durable plastic case that is lined with nice, soft foam, a starting range holster, a two-magazine pouch, load assist and a spare magazine. There is nothing spectacular about the spare holster, but it will get you started until you can buy a better holster. You can find this collection reasonably priced at Cabelas
This pistol is relatively lightweight with its carbon composite body construction. You get the choices of 3.8-inch, 4.5-inch and 5-inch barrel lengths to suite your shooting or carrying needs. However, the slide is heavier than expected, which decreases felt recoil and improves follow-up shot placement. With a full magazine, the weight is balanced well.
There are a ton of safety features on this firearm. First is the blackstrap safety. There is a large, paddle-style button that sticks out of the back of the pistol’s grip, much like a 1911. This prevents the trigger from being depressed or even the slide to be racked without a proper grip on the pistol.
Second, is the trigger safety. There is an extended button that must be deliberately pressed to get the trigger to fall. This is a great feature to protect against accidental drop, since the trigger can’t be depressed without pressure on the spring-loaded button.
Combined, these are great precautions for the new shooter. The firearm cannot fire unless the operator has a firm grip and applies deliberate pressure on the trigger. Two more great features for new shooters would be the striker and loaded chamber indicators.
On the slide plate there is a small hole for the rear of the stainless striker to protrude through. It’s clear if the striker is in the rear or forward position. The loaded chamber indicator is a clearly visible protruding over the slide when there is a round in the chamber. New or experienced shooters will appreciate the easy-to-navigate features that tell them what condition their firearm is in.
All these features, combined with Springfield Armory’s quality control, make a great firearm for new or experienced shooters. The fact that it will not operate without a strong, positive grip on the frame teaches people to focus on properly holding the gun and can eliminate bad habits.
My only critiques for the firearm would be the firing pin. The retaining pin is in a weak spot. I have heard of them breaking after ongoing dry firing, but I have never witnessed it personally. If you are one to practice trigger drills, go and buy some snap caps or a SERP practice pistol to eliminate this issue.
There are better guns out there, but the bottom line here is the value that you get with the Springfield XD9. The case and the extras in it create a great starter package for any new shooter. The pistol is comfortable to shoot and carry, comes with a great warranty and is backed by one of the industry’s greatest giants.
This pistol is one of the better buys for the price and will probably end up like your grandma: aged, but still kicking butt."

UPGRADES:  
1) A Volquartsen competition target sear which make the trigger much more crisp and predictable with a lighter trigger pull so it's a MUCH better shooting gun than the original.  
2) The ""slingshot"" modification has been done so when you put in a new magazine you simply pull back on the slide and let it go forward (like all ""normal"" guns) instead of having to press down on the slide release at the same time you pull back on the slide.
3) The magazine disconnect was removed at some point too so it's easier to clean.
This is an excellent trapping and camping gun with all the right improvements already made for you!  It is very light to carry and very reliable and of course it's a fun all around plinking and small game gun."

Mil dot reticle, QD picatinny mount, 1/2"" windage and elevation adjustments, quick focus eye piece and a built in left side red dot.  A bit more on the red dot is the independent ability to set it apart from your reticle zero. A neat abilty to sight it in at say 25 yards for CQB applications and then have the reticle zeroed at 200.  Neat scope that will be more than you even need if paper punching, but if you want to put meat in the freezer it will do that too.  In short:  if you need your scope to be pretty this one probably isn't for you, but if you want a scope that does what it's designed to do this might be an inexpensive way to get into a 3-9x platform.  I am convinced the reason this scope is so durable and continues to perform is due to the metal frame encased in rubber including all turrets.  CASH only and for PICK UP only in South Tampa pleaseI really do thank you for any offers, but 40 bucks is my utility price where I'll just keep it in my truck in case any of us have optics issues when hunting we will have a back up."

422,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5966422,For Sale:  Leupold VX-2 2-7x33mm CDS Duplex Riflescope,"Miami, Miami-Dade, South Florida",$ 345,"Listed On: Monday, October 3, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Leupold VX-2 2-7x33mm CDS Duplex RiflescopeMatteDuplexReticleHeavy posts stand out against cover and in twilight conditions, pointing boldly to the intersection. Countering is a snap. The thin crosshairs obscure little.The VX-2 is one of the most popular lines of riflescopes, for reasons that become clear to anyone who picks one up. It's packed full of useful features, including precise MOA finger click adjustments; the Quantum Optical System with Index Matched lens coatings for exceptional image brightness and clarity; externally threaded fast-focus eyepiece; tactile Leupold indicator; and for the first time, the option of Custom Dial System in select models. The VX-2 is built to meet the demands of today's serious hunters and shooters.Trusted by hunters and shooters worldwide. The VX-2 delivers the performance and features that serious hunters demand. Tactile Leupold indictors; finger-adjustable click windage and elevation dials; the brightness, clarity, and contrast needed to hunt even in low-light conditions. Of Leupold's, the ruggedness, absolute waterproof integrity, and famous Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee only add to the VX-2's popularity.3:1 Zoom Ratio1/4MOA Finger ClickFinger click adjustments for windage and elevation (MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments 1 cm per click).Durable Lens CoverKeep the lenses of Leopold's Leupold riflescope looking like new. Protect it from dirt and damage with the durable bikini style lens cover included with Leopold's riflescope. Protects Leopold's scope while in storage or in the field.Quantum Optical SystemLeupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold's newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max design software and evaluation using Leupold's Zygo Interferometer to minimize wave front error and increase resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk Leupold's when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.Index Matched Lens SystemA Leupold exclusive, this system has nearly perfected Leupold's already impeccable light management. Leupold engineers specify different coating materials for each lens surface in the riflescope, based on the lens index of refraction, placement and function, layering each coating to eliminate reflections and maximize light transmission. The result is unparalleled brightness and extremely sharp resolution across the entire visual field.DiamondCoatThis coating on the exterior lenses gives you the ultimate in abrasion resistance and light transmission. The result is a flawless sight picture over a lifetime of hard use. DiamondCoat has made a difference in battle; now it can make a difference where you hunt.2nd Generation Argon/Krypton WaterproofingWhile Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature Leupold's exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside Leopold's scope even more than Leupold's proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set Leupold's.Lead FreeLeupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction.GenerousEyeboxThe generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get Leopold's eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.Blackened Lens EdgesBlackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.Externally Threaded Fast-Focus EyepieceThe sleek design of the externally threaded fast-focus eyepiece provides for faster focusing of the reticle under any conditions.CDS (Custom Dial System)Leupold CDS models allow you to quickly dial Leopold's elevation to different sight-in ranges with a custom adjustment matched to Leopold's specific ballistics information. The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers. Every CDS dial features MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-2, VX-3, VX-6 and VX-R even more accurate and rugged. How the CDS System Works The CDS System works by laser-inscribing Leopold's scope's elevation dial to match Leopold's load, velocity and conditions. Leopold's scope will be in perfect synch with the way Leopold's rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads. Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into accountCustom Shop serviceableTactile Leupold SelectorRimfire ParallaxOne inch Maintube6061-T6 Aircraft Quality Aluminum3:1 Zoom RatioSpecsLinear Field of View(ft/100 yd): Low 44.6 ft., High 17.8 ft.Eye Relief(in): Low 4.2 inches, High 3.7 inchesweight(oz): 10.4 oz.Objective Clear Aperture(mm): 1.3 mmElevation Adjustment Range: 65 MOAWindage Adjustment Range: 65 MOA"

After a few hours in the Lyman Turbo Tumbler your cases will be clean, polished, and ready for reloading.

It's Savage part number 19056, a limited edition build from them. It comes with a 24"" fluted and threaded barrel with special 5R rifling. It currently has. Griffin Armament taper mount muzzle brake that will fit the taper mount Griffin Armament suppressors or works great as just a brake, extremely efficient. It also has a billet one piece Seekins Precision 20moa base that will gain you elevation for long range shooting or hunting. The stock is also part of the rifle being a special edition from Savage. It is a very comfortable HS Precision fiberglass stock that has a built in aluminum bedding block that pulls the action in centered and tight. You can glass bed it as well to even further enhance accuracy but it works amazing as it is. The price will include the brake and scope base, and it will not be split up. The rifle currently sells for around $1100, the base is $100, and the brake is $100. The rifle is basically brand new, as it has only had maybe 3 boxes of FGMM put through it then came our first child. I'm only selling it to fund an 6.5 Creedmoor AR-10 build. This rifle also has the Savage Accutrigger which is adjustable down to 1.5lbs I believe. I am the original owner of the rifle, and it's never been, nor needed any repairs. It's only been shot suppressed with the exception of the first 20 round box before my brake came in. I still have a can that fits the brake but the brake is staying on to sweeten the deal for the new owner. The base was correctly bedded to the receiver, and the Torx screws were correctly torqued to recommended specs with a firearms specific torque wrench I own. I take pride in my firearms, and this rifle was no exception. It was cleaned with the well regarded Kroil after every session (although there were few) and never put up dirty, and always lightly oiled. Between the nice long barrel, the brake, and weight of the rifle it would shoot half minute groups when I did my part and would make a great target/long range hunting rifle for someone and the caliber is perfect for beginner shooters.  More pictures of different angles, bolt removed, etc are available. I am also selling ALL my reloading supplies, look under reloading in the Huntsville section it is title ""Complete 308 Sell Off! NOW priced to move!"". If interested I will gladly sell the rifle and all reloading equipment  (tumbler, media, dies, special high end neck turning kit and other specialty tools, primers, and all powder that I have left) for $1300. Again, only selling to build a specific rifle, so I'm not interested in trades with the exception of AR10 parts for my new lower fitting the LR308 pattern, thank you. No low ball offers will be considered, and price is firm. Thank you, and God Bless!"

Only reason I’m selling is because this is not the rifle I wanted, I wanted the Lwrc M6A1 and of course I left the store without inspecting the rifle.LWRC M6SL Stretch Lightweight 5.56 14.7"" RifleThe SL, which stands for, 'stretch-lightweight', incorporates everything a shooters needs in a quality lightweight base model rifle. With the M6-SL, LWRC has brought to the market the lightest factory piston driven rifle to date. The SL comes standard with Magpul MOE furniture. A MOE mid-length handguard, MOE stock, and MOE pistol grip provide excellent handling characteristics, while minimizing added weight. The SL utilizes the 'stretch' or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots. The most distinct feature of the SL is the light contour barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRC's NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight. The SL is a great addition to the LWRC family of rifles. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifle that incorporates LWRC's patented short-stroke piston operating system, has all of the advanced coatings that make LWRC rifles the best in the world. Rifle features permanently attached muzzle break. Overall barrel length with muzzle break is 16""."

it is a UNFIRED Savage 12 LRP in 6.5 Creedmoor which is their target repeater action Right Bolt/Right Port (RBRP) that accepts large shank barrels and currently has the factory 26"" fluted bull barrel, Target accu-trigger and comes with a night force 20moa base.

Built in 1996 this 1911 was the 555th gun made. It has had nothing to do with any of the guns built in yonkers that were shipped to Clackamas for fitting. It was 100% built in Oregon. I am the second owner. First was an older gentleman who bought it new, and had it as his daily carry gun for many years, as evident by the beautiful wear marks on the edges. I carried it far less, and shot it a dozen or so times over the last year or two. The gun comes with the original box, one blued 8 round mag, two stainless Wilson Combat mags, factory night sights (new two years ago), and a Galco concealable leather holster. It will NOT, however, come with the smooth rosewood grips as shown. They were a gift, and I'm returning them to their owner, so the gun will come with some more standard grips. I have a few places around town we can do a transfer at, and I will cover the cost. The BGC through OSP will be on the buyer. Handgun is being listed for $1200. Please feel free to send offers that you would consider reasonable for such a gun. Remember that there were only 3000 guns like this made in Oregon, and it was 20 years ago when they started, and about 17-18 years since they stopped."
