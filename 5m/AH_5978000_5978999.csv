Great training pistol for ladies and kids. Pistol has mixed reviews on the internet but I found it to be 100% and a fun / neat little shooter - It runs CCI MiniMag flawlessly but fair warning ( and probobaly why people have issues with it ) it doesnt like cheap ammo!

Steel floor plate for quick emptying of your rounds is a great feature found on the model 70! Comes with very nice and durable leather strap, as well as a Simmons Deerfield scope 3-9x50. Good overall condition. There are some spots with small blemishes on the stock from use over the years and small sections where some of the bluing has faded over the years. All in all, in fantastic shape given that it was manufactured 48 years ago!In 1968 further revisions were made to the Model 70 in part to address consumer concerns.[10] An ""anti-bind"" feature was introduced to make operation of the action smoother, which comprised a groove in an extended right locking lug operating on a rib on the right side of the receiver. This made the action noticeably smoother to operate and has been retained to the present day. A steel floorplate and stainless magazine follower were introduced, partially revoking changes introduced in the 1964 model.

A new rough texture on the grip guarantees that you have a solid grip even if your hands are wet or worse yet, bloody. With the update of the GLOCK 27, they improved the ergonomics with interchangeable backstraps and a reversible magazine catch for the left handed shooters. It wasn't long after GLOCK's acceptance by American shooters that the need for a smaller model geared towards concealed carriers was identified. To produce a handgun that was the right size to appeal to shooters that plan on hiding it in plain sight, GLOCK redesigned the popular GLOCK 23 into a new pistol they called the GLOCK 27. With a redesigned locking block, reworked frame and an all new dual recoil spring, the GLOCK 27, also known as the ""baby GLOCK"" was a fresh take on the now proven design. Shooters all over the world turn to the Glock 27 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments. With a 9 round capacity magazine, the GLOCK 27 is a perfect choice for a police officer's looking for a backup gun to their GLOCK 22 or 23, as well as off duty or plain clothes work and concealed carriers.

Gaston Glock's masterpiece would go on to gain worldwide acceptance with shooters in both professional and civilian circles, the GLOCK 17 has gained universal respect. The latest GLOCK 17, the Gen4, is chambered in 9mm Luger features a modular backstrap system that allows a shooter to tailor the rough textured grip of the pistol to their hand size for optimal ergonomics. Making the pistol even more user-friendly, GLOCK has introduced a reversible magazine catch on the Gen4 pistols, now right and left-hand shooters can enjoy the pistol as Gaston Glock envisioned. To tame the recoil of the 9mm cartridge, GLOCK has introduced a dual recoil spring system that not only makes the GLOCK 17 a soft shooting pistol but also significantly increases the service life of the pistol. Police, military, competition shooters and those looking for a means of defense turn to the Glock 17 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments. Featuring a large 17 round magazine capacity that offers more than enough firepower when it is needed most.

Making the pistol even more user friendly, GLOCK has introduced a reversible magazine catch on the Gen4 pistols, now right and left-hand shooters can enjoy the pistol as Gaston Glock envisioned. To tame the recoil of the 9mm cartridge, GLOCK has introduced a dual recoil spring system that not only makes the GLOCK 19 a soft shooting pistol but also significantly increases the service life of the pistol. The GLOCK 19 has changed the semi-auto pistol market as we know it thanks to innovative design, space-age materials and reliability that has defined the GLOCK name. Embraced worldwide by shooters in both professional and civilian circles, the GLOCK 19 has gained worldwide acceptance. Police and military turn to the Glock 19 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments. This pistol is offered with a 10 round magazine for compliance but a 15 round magazine may be fitted where legal. Thanks to the large magazine capacity, the GLOCK 19 has more than enough firepower to be used as a standard sidearm while retaining a compact and concealable form factor for plain clothes officers. Civilian shooters embrace the GLOCK 19 for many of the same reasons as militaries all over the world, but the customizability of the pistol also helps find a home for the compact Austrian pistol in competition circles as well as in the hands of concealed carriers and homeowners looking for a cost effective firearm to defend their families.
