Needed only for protection. I am a single mother, and I am disabled, so I am really trying to find someone out there that maybe has collected handguns over the years and wouldn't mind selling one dirt cheap, knowing that it is going toward the safety of My 8 year old daughter and myself. I had a .32 cal revolver for years that gave me peace of mind at home, but I was very nervous about totting it around with no safety features. I have been raised from a young age the proper way to handle any firearm, and how to be a responsible gun owner. My only dilemma is monetary really. I have a very tight budget, and do not have the ability to save enough to afford a $300-400 gun. I fear for my daughters safety more and more everyday. In my opinion.. You are crazy if you DON'T have protection this day and age. Anyways, I just wanted to be honest and upfront. Not a pity party. Just looking for that someone that has something they could get rid of really cheap. Tell me what'cha got and I'll let you know if it's fiesable or not. Thank you for your time,Natalie Contact me by phone -or- text, anytime @ REDACTED"

Would prefer you have an Indiana LTCH permit and Indiana DL that's not expired!"

A solid, no-nonsense two-point bungee sling adjustable with a quick pull. Built to SOE's standards of bombproof quality and reputation for durability using the highest quality components and raw materials. Sizing: the sling is built with enough extra webbing to attach to virtually any firearm, and will fit around the palmswells on shotguns, around buttstocks on AK-pattern rifles, or thread through loops on collapsible AR/M4 buttstocks. It will also fit aftermarket hardware like mash hooks, HK-style clips, or QD swivels and is additionally compatible with SOE's other sling adapters. This sling spent most of its time in my ownership attached to a rifle that largely stayed inside a safe, so use is light so as to make it indistinguishable from brand new. Will ship to customer if desired. These slings sell for $55 new. NOTE: this is NOT SOE's two-to-one-point convertible bungee sling and CANNOT be used as a one point sling without aftermarket hardware."

Using the hard-hitting 8mm Mauser caliber, the M24/47 is made of steel and wood, no plastic, aluminium or cheap metal parts here. The trench warfare of WWI had taught the factory what works and what doesn’t. Skillful peace-time production gives you a Superior Mauser with benefits like a smoother action, a tighter lockup, neatly fitted sling swivels and a full wood upper. Designed in ‘24 and factory remade in ’47 after WWII.
An Exciting Rifle to Own, the M24/47 is an excellent variation of the venerable German Mauser K98k that followed 10 years later. Strong, reliable, accurate. An efficient bolt-action rifle you’ll be proud to own.

(FN, Fabrique Nationale of Belgium)
Using the hard-hitting 8mm Mauser caliber, the M24/47 is made of steel and wood, no plastic, aluminium or cheap metal parts here. The trench warfare of WWI had taught the factory what works and what doesn’t. Skillful peace-time production gives you a Superior Mauser with benefits like a smoother action, a tighter lockup, neatly fitted sling swivels and a full wood upper. Designed in ‘24 and factory remade in ’47 after WWII.
An Exciting Rifle to Own, the M24/47 is an excellent variation of the venerable German Mauser K98k that followed 10 years later. Strong, reliable, accurate. An efficient bolt-action rifle you’ll be proud to own.
Ideal for Shooting or Collecting!"

It has approximately 300 rounds through it, mostly 147gr Speer lawman. The long COL and flat nose of the Lawmans would make one hang up on the feedramp once every couple magazines, but it seems to cycle 124 gr every time. 

I'd prefer to meet at a local indoor range/gun shop combo like bullseye or bullet stop. This way, I can buy you a box of your choice of ammo to run through it to see if it cycles your preferred round before you buy. Also this allows the chance to officially transfer it if need be. If you have a CCW license I would be happy just doing a bill of sale but transferring it through an FFL could give us both peace of mind. As for me, I have a current CCW license and secret clearance."

Details & Application Click HereSpikes ST Compressor SBR - 5.56 (NFA) With MRS Suppressor! Introduction The Spike's Tactical Compressor is the long awaited culmination of SBR and suppressor technology. Developed in conjunction with active law enforcement, the ST Compressor has been brutally overbuilt without losing the finer points that make it Sub MOA accurate at extended ranges. The ST Compressor is the first factory produced SBR with an integrated sound suppressor that requires no maintenance.

Buying & Registering A suppressor/silencer & Short Barrel Rifle This page will guide you through the process for legally buying a Suppressor / Silencer Buying a suppressor is much easier than you may think. Just follow the steps below or give us a call and we will be happy to walk you through the entire process. What paperwork will I need to legally register a suppressor? There are two main methods for registering your suppressor:   Registration using a “Trust” (easiest method)   Registration in your name   Option 1 Registration using a “Trust”   Set up your trust   Purchase your suppressor online at grabagun.com   Fill out your Form 4 and Mail in your $200 payment to ATF   Sit back and relax because you are done!   It will cost approximately $100 more to buy using the trust method, but it will save a ton of time and provide a great deal more flexibility than an individually registered suppressor. There are many advantages to using a trust for registering a suppressor.  Some of these advantages include:   more than one person (family or friends) can legally use the suppressor if they are listed on the trust   one trust can be used for multiple suppressors   trusts can be modified to add or remove people without approval from the ATF   most importantly you DO NOT have to get fingerprint cards or your county's Chief Law Enforcement Officer to sign off on the purchase.  These benefits will save a lot of time and hassle down the road.   There are many places you can go online or locally to download a Trust to be used for registering your suppressor. Here are a few examples which range in price from $99 - $129:   http://199trust.com/   http://www.thefirearmlawyers.com/   http://www.guntrust.com/   Option 2 Registration to an individual   Purchase your suppressor online at grabagun.com   Fill out Form 4 and $200 payment for ATF   Obtain 2 Passport Photos   Obtain Chief Law Enforcement Officer Sign Off (Must be in the county you are a resident in)   Two copies of fingerprint cards (FBI form FD-258)   Complete Certificate of Compliance – ATF Form 5330.20   This is a less expensive method for registering your suppressor since you will not have to pay the $100 for a trust to be set up. However, you will be the sole owner of the suppressor and will have to be present any time the suppressor is being used (this includes your spouse and kids). In addition you will have to complete several additional steps (Steps 3 – 6 above) that you do not have to complete if you opt to register your suppressor using a trust. FAQ’s Am I eligible to own a suppressor? If you are 21 years old or older AND able to legally possess a firearm then you should be eligible to purchase a suppressor. This also assumes you have verified it is legal to own in your State and County. Is it legal to own a suppressor in my State? Suppressor ownership and hunting with a suppressor is legal in most States. Please reference the map, provided by the American Suppressor Association, below to see if suppressors are legal in your State. This map is for reference and you should be sure to check your State and County laws before making any suppressor purchase.    * Minnesota hunting law to take effect August 1, 2015.* Maine Hunting and Shall Sign laws to take effect mid October.   How long is the wait? Wait times will vary throughout the year but can be anywhere from 3-6 months. Once you submit your paperwork you will be able to contact the ATF to inquire about the status of your paperwork. Just keep in mind this is a government process that is out of all of our control and you will need to be patient. As they have told us in the past, “It will be ready when it is ready”. 7 Step Process To Order A Suppressor From Gun Pro:   Use the Gun Pro FFL Locator for Class III dealers to find a dealer in your area.

My thought process is to either continue the build and never purchase a firing pin or just get rid of it now.  I'm unclear as to whether or not I would need to do an FA-10 (since it's not a gun in MA) and need to look into that.  At the very least, I've got ~$225 into this, so would like to at least recoup that amount.  Currently installed:Spike's Tactical Lower Zombie edition

Now that is out of the way about the gun:Its a Glock 19. The upper is a Factory Threaded Barrel Glock 19 with AmeriGlo Suppressor Sights , aka G19TB. It was purchased from Omaha Outdoors.  The threading is European (Glock is an Austrian Company) = 13.5×1. The upper is factory original, I ran 100 rounds of ammo to function check, it gobbled everything up from low power 115 gr, to 9mm Nato. The Lower is a Glock 19 Frame that was purchased seperately, so the serial numbers do not match. The frame has a grip reduction and recontouring(including a magwell), not stippling, profesionally completed by Frank Duren, whom was Lonewolf's goto gunsmith for Frame Reduction, prior to the Lonewolf Frame being developed. He is still reccomended on Lonewolf's website. The Frame has the factory glock magazine release.  The trigger and contact points were polished, to the point were it mimics Travis Haley's skimmer Trigger. The minus (-) connector and trigger springs are Lonewolf. The Ejector housing is lonewolf's UAT, the trigger is aprx 4.5 lbs and has very little travel compared to a factory Glock."
