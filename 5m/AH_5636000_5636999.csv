This weapon is intended for civilian and security use, and mimics the famous M16 rifle in its layout and placement of most controls. It is remarkably light for its caliber and size, because of extensive use of modern, high strength plastics.Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight."

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01. The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

Save a bit of cash and have a great everyday carry gun. *Buyer pays transfer feesFrom the Glock site:The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.Might be willing to trade for a 30-06 with a good scope."

Like new, came out of a brand new DPMS SASS I bought and put a two-stage trigger into instead. You won't find a better trigger for the price! An upgraded trigger and upgraded barrel are the two most important things you can do to your AR to increase accuracy. Once you feel a high-end trigger, I guarantee you'll never be able to deal with firing an AR with a stock gritty stiff trigger again! Retails for $120, my loss is your gain. Willing to accept cash for local sale or can mail them and accept USPS money order, check, or credit card payment thru discreet Paypal transaction with buyer to cover any PP fees. Features: *A refined, custom trigger kit for the AR-15/AR-10 that will reduce the weight of pull to as low as 3 to 3.5 lbs with no take-up or creep and a great reset time. *They are single-stage triggers but can be used for DCM by using the stock spring. *Trigger set requires installation, but no permanent modification and only simple tools like punches and mallets. *Instructions are included. Notes: Customers with older Colt rifles, or rifles from Bushmaster, DPMS, or almost any other source have a hammer and sear pin diameter of .154"" and should purchase ""small pin"" parts."

Bottom AR has an Aero Precision upper with 16” stainless steel, match grade .223 Wylde 1:8 twist barrel, nickel boron Aim BCG and slim design forearm. Lower receiver is an Anderson with Palmetto State enhanced LPK and JP Enterprises Enhanced Reliability springs. Trigger is very crisp and breaks at 5 lbs. Magpul MOE+ soft rubber grip and Magpul ACS-L 6 position stock. Asking $800.
If you are not familiar with the 223 Wylde, google to read up on it, but the .223 Wylde chamber throat tolerances are tighter than the 5.56 allowing the shooter to fire SAMI .223 match grade ammo for enhanced accuracy OR the standard 5.56 round giving the shooter the best of both worlds: accuracy or cheaper ammo.
Both ARs have had 3 rounds through them to check functionality.
Both rifles would retail over a $1000+ each if bought on the market and you will have the benefit of these not being registered.
Asking $800 each. Please text 614-four two zero -0309 if interested. Thanks for looking."

The only thing keepin this rifle from being Level 10 is the Bolt not matching the rest of the rifle, it is 10 numbers off and one can assume Boris or Dmitry, while training, Either were marched to the Gulag for losing it, or more likely when they cleaned the rifles during training Boris grabbed Dmitry's Bolt by accident, but as I stated the rest of the rifle matches on the Magazine Floorplate, Buttplate, and RecieverI like to believe that when we defeated Germany, an Allied Soldier traded his M1903 or M1 Garand for Boris's rifle, for posterity :D That is the full knowledge I have on this rifle."
