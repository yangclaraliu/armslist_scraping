Buy It Now!! The Beretta 87 Target is a practical-shooting competition pistol that is ready to go out of the box. All a competitor would have to do (if desired) is to mount the optics of his choice, which can be done quickly and easily thanks to the built-in Weaver-style rail. The 87 Target can be also used as a great training pistol, since its controls are quite similar in locatio and feel to those of Beretta’s famed 92 Series. As Beretta’s flagship target pistol, the 87 Target has to satisfy some very stringent accuracy requirements. It is capable of producing cloverleafs at distances of 30 yards and more, while the trigger, breaking at a crisp 3lbs, greatly helps minimize muscular interference while shooting it. The grips are ergonomically sized for the hand of the average shooter, but they are easily replaceable with something beefier or slimmer to fit other sizes. The 6” (150 mm) gives you a long, 7.5” sight radius to optimize alignment and therefore accuracy when shooting without optics. Also, the sights are user-adjustable for both windage and elevation, so that different target loads may be confidently tried while always staying on target. The front sight may be easily replaced with a thinner blade. Magazine change is designed to be quick and intuitive and to cut down on time. The magazine well is beveled for easy no-see insertion, while magazines have a sturdy rubber pad so that they can be safely dropped during competition without any damage. At 41 ounces, the 87 Target is designed to feel steady in your hand while shooting. Also, the bottom corners of the pistol are squared; it remains upright when when set down on a flat surface, ready to be quickly gripped, magazine loaded an raised to the target (.22LR Practical Shooting). Overall, the Beretta 87 Target is an ideal rimfire competition pistol giving shooters serious about their improvement a great value out of the box."

Just tossing them in...If you look at the FDE frame, you'll see that I added my own touch to the gun. I added a manual slide stop. Nano's don't come with manual controls, so I modded the slide stop to be able to manually lock the slide back instead of having to use an empty mag (because that's really the only way a Nano's slide will lock back is on an empty mag). The included extra factory slide stop would be used if you wanted to use the black or pink frame. Or if you choose to, you can easily modify the black and/or pink frames to work with the modded slide stop. Also, the internal components have been polished for a smoother trigger pull.I do want to mention that this was my daily carry handgun so it does have some holster wear but is a great shooter and the laser is dead on! About 400 rounds or less through it.I am selling this complete package for $500. I paid about $700 for everything, so I'm taking a huge loss.Trades I'm looking for are Gen 4 Glock 19, Gen 4 Glock 26, entry AR15 or AR15 pistol. What else do you have?

It has a 16"" 5.56/223 barrel and comes with a few upgrades over standard Stretch models. First we shed the heavy and bulky quad rail that comes standard M6A2 models for the new LWRC 12"" SPR rail. Saves a ton of weight and is far more ergonomic than the quad rail. Second we put in a LWRC ambi safety. And third we upgraded the furniture to Magpul CTR stock and Magpul MOE Plus grip. And lastly we upgraded the trigger to a Geissele SSA trigger (Geiselle trigger was installed after pictures were taken. I'm aware that the pictures show factory Nickel trigger). It also comes with LWRC front and rear pop up sights. It truly is a one of a kind and you definitely won't see another one like this on gunbroker. Everything is brand new and is sure to please. Any questions please don't hesitate to call me 813-924-4773. FFL to FFL transfer. California buyers I will put in a bullet button free of charge. I accept Cashiers check, Money Order, and Credit Cards (add 3% for CC fees) Here is a little more info on the LWRC M6A2 Stretch courtesy of LWRC: The M6A2™ Stretch differs from the standard M6A2™ in that it combines the groundbreaking features of the M6A2™ with the qualities of a mid-length gas system. This is the next evolution of the beloved AR15/M16 rifle series... The M6A2™ Stretch sets a new industry standard in 5.56mm NATO gas piston uppers. The M6A2™ Stretch is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ Stretch upper also features a longer mid-length free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories. The 16"" M6A2™ Stretch is an excellent general purpose carbine and can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle. Rifling is 1/7"" right hand. The M6A2 Stretch's edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature their short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles and uppers feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all LWRC rifles and uppers, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ Stretch is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. The M6A2™ Stretch defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and LWRC's M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."
