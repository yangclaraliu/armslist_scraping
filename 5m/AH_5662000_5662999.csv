With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the propriety HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 7.5 - 8.5 pounds because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Or a smooth 4.5- 5.5 pounds if the operator opts for the lighter trigger pull configuration.text REDACTED or email through site.

(fight like a man or die like a dog) I had originally intended to accurize this gun with an aftermarket trigger and spring kit, but it doesn't need it. The machining and fitting of this gun is on par with the Kimbers that my father in law has. I hate to get rid of it but the money is needed and I can't part with my custom Glock. The gun comes in the box with all of the included papers and lock. I also have a Kimber Pro Tac Mag with 3 baseplates, 50 rounds of generic FMJ and 20 rounds of Winchester PDX1 230 grain bonded jacketed low flash hollow points. I do also have a brown leather Bianchi holster. It's for a S&W but it does fit and hold the 1911 well. It fit and it was on sale so...This gun is excellent and you could easily spend a grand on the same level of quality. I was the first private owner of it and supposedly it was a SHOT show demo prior to my purchase but I have no way to verify that. Thank you for looking"

The grips are Magpul Calico Jack's in flat dark earth. (fight like a man or die like a dog) I had originally intended to accurize this gun with an aftermarket trigger and spring kit, but it doesn't need it. The machining and fitting of this gun is on par with the Kimbers that my father in law has. I hate to get rid of it but the money is needed and I can't part with my custom Glock. The gun comes in the box with all of the included papers and lock. I also have a Kimber Pro Tac Mag with 3 baseplates, 50 rounds of generic FMJ and 20 rounds of Winchester PDX1 230 grain bonded jacketed low flash hollow points. I do also have a brown leather Bianchi holster. It's for a S&W but it does fit and hold the 1911 well. It fit and it was on sale so...This gun is excellent and you could easily spend a grand on the same level of quality. I was the first private owner of it and supposedly it was a SHOT show demo prior to my purchase but I have no way to verify that. Thank you for looking"

I am selling because I bought a newer unit. $600 firm or trade for firearms/optics/surefire/etc. Please see description below, then call or text 8O8-779-2IO9The Steiner CQBL-1 (Close Quarters Battle Laser) was originally designed for the Heckler & Koch MP-7A1 submachine gun at the request of the U.S. Secret Service. It is a small, lightweight, dual-output laser aiming device that produces both a visible red and infrared laser pointer. Its low-profile design makes it popular for use on other submachine guns and short barrel PDW’s. Now, Laser Devices, Inc. brings the same compact functionality to the civilian market in the CQBL-1 Class1 Laser. It features all the same benefits of its full power sister, but uses a 0.7mW Class1 IR laser instead. The CQBL-1 Class1 IR laser is perfect for SBR’s and other handy weapon platforms.The CQBL-1 is extremely low profile and features an integral rail grabber that requires an Allen Key to install. The lack of a QD mount allows the CQBL-1 to sit closer to the bore. The CQBL-1 Class1 is a great, handy little laser for the commercial market. It reaches out to 450 yards and is perfect for SBR’s. The two lasers are slaved, so zeroing one, automatically zeros the other. Overall, the CQBL-1 makes a great addition to the Class1 line from Laser Devices, Inc.This Item is ITAR controlled and cannot be shipped or carried outside the United States without express written permission from the United States Department of State.Manufacturer:SteinerDimensions:4.0”(L) x 1.5”(D) x 1.1”(H)Weight:6.0 oz.

The 3-1/2"" chamber cycles any shotshell, enhancing the gun's versatility for any waterfowl hunting, from pass shooting geese, to shooting teal over decoys. The 835's overbored and ported barrel reduces recoil and minimizes muzzle jump from magnum loads to help you stay on target for rapid follow up shots. The overbored barrel also serves to cushion the shot charge, reducing pellet deformation for dense shot patterns. The Mossberg 835 Ulti-Mag Waterfowl comes with a black synthetic stock, and matte black finish on all the metal parts to help you stay concealed in the shadows. The basic design of the Model 835 is modeled after the Mossberg 500, renowned for reliable function and durability. The Model 835 pump shotgun uses dual action bars, dual extractors, an anti-jam shell elevator, and a large locking lug for a solid steel-to-steel connection between the bolt and barrel. An aluminum alloy receiver resists corrosion and keeps the overall weight of the gun down and well balanced. Hunters can reach the top-mounted safety quickly with the thumb of either hand, making the 835 naturally ambidextrous. The Model 835's simplistic design makes fieldstripping the action easy by tapping out a single pin. The 835 Ulti-Mag Pump-Action Shotgun comes with a a stout recoil pad, dual bead sight, modified choke tube, and sling swivel studs."
