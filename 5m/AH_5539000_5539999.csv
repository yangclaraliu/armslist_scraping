The SA rifle serial number dates to 1955 as well. That, along with like condition and Patina, suggests the barrel is original to the gun. The serial number will be given upon phone conversation only. There are no visible import marks. The stainless gas seal is the only area exhibiting any significant wear. Rust is non-existent, nor are there any signs of major battle scars. Normal wear is minimal for the time frame. There is evidence of a faint ordnance cartouche stamp on the stock just below the left side of receiver.  The barrel is shiny and remains accurate. The rifle functions wonderfully and is accompanied by 5 en bloc clips.  The rifle wears an OD nylon sling, befitting of the time period in both use and appearance. The weapon has the normal matching of the major US manufacturers parts of that time:Receiver- SABarrel- 4-1955Trigger Group- International Harvester Op Rod- SA Bolt- Harrington and RichardsonSights (SA). The sights are in excellent mechanical condition and show minimal wear. They remain audible, tactile and precise on the firing line.This Garand is an excellent example of American Ingenuity. It retains the history of "" the greatest generation"", and will continue to be a legacy for generations to admire.  The pkg. will come with 5 En Bloc Clips & a Hard Carry Case.*Numerous additional photos upon request."

I have contacted Glock in regard to dating the pistol and was told that (based on the serial number) it is an early import indicating the probability of it being a 1st gen is very high. If interested, I will forward the email conversation I had with Austin (from Glock, Inc) for your reference. I acquired this pistol as a restoration project (the slide and barrel show significant wear) however I do not have the time or means to accomplish the task. In respect to performance, this pistol is what you would expect from Glock. I put about 100 rounds through it at the time of acquisition (to test for reliability) and it performed famously. No issues whatsoever and it is a tack driver! If interested, I will send pics, via email, of the firearm (I can't upload on ArmsList because apparently ""the file size"" is too large, I don't know). This would be a great (cosmetic) project for the Glock enthusiast and once complete would make a great collectors item. Depending on in the trade, I would consider adding $60.00 cash to the deal. For those of you who don't know, Glock will refinish the slide and barrel for $60.00. They may even replace the sights although I would confirm that with Glock. Thank you in advance for your interest."
