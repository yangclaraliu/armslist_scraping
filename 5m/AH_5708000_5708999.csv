Some people have told me that he was full of shit, but I believe him. If you saw the look in his eye when he told me this rifle was a bad memory that he was trying to get rid of, you'd believe him too. Regardless, the rifle is not in pristine condition. It has dents, scratches, the blueing is thin on some places and even has a little rust on it. Worse yet, there is a crack in the stock where you grip the rifle with your firing hand. The crack has been epoxied but it is clearly visible upon close inspection. Rifle comes with scope mounts but no scope.Despite all of the cosmetic issues, this is still a valuable rifle.

That is what some avid shooters consider the Coyote Light. Most crossover varmint/long range guns are easily recognized by their heavy barrels, bipod mounting studs and long range scopes, but they are far from being equal. The Winchester® Coyote Light is the rifle to take along for varmint, long range big game hunting and target shooting fun. It has been carefully trimmed of any unnecessary bulk but is no lightweight when it comes to performance.  This rifle easily shoots less than MOA groups with a variety of factory ammo.This rifle is excellent for those long hikes up and down mountains, canyons, and into stands that are a ways off.  It carries light, is well-balanced, and the stock is a pleasure to hold.  It's got 2 sling studs up front, one for your bipod, and the other for your sling.  I can't say enough kind words about this rifle.  You won't be disappointed.Would prefer local sale, but will consider shipping to the right buyer.(more images available upon request)"
