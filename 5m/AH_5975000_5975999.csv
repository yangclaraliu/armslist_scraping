The only difference is the box that they are packaged in and these that I have come 14/case and the Military cases only have 12. So you gain 2 extra meals in each cases and these and the Military sealed meals both weigh 8 ounces. The main entrée comes with its own heater all you do is add 4 ounces of water to the heater bag and you have a hot entrée. The best by date is 09/16 which means that you still have a 5 plus year shelf life as long as they are stored in a controlled environment. Each case has 7 different meals with 2 of each meal totaling 14 meals per case. I am selling 3 cases for $90 and 5 cases for $140. These are great for hunting, camping, emergency or just in case!

It has a very smooth single/double action, 8+1 capacity, and comes with two factory magazines and leather case. Less than 100rds fired. Extremely clean and beautiful gun. Price is $1500 2. -Russian Military Makarov 9mm Mak Pistol- If you know Maks then you know the only ones of these that made it into the country were either war bring backs or what they call ""Russian Sneaks"". This one happens to be a Russian Sneak that was imported in with a batch of East German Maks. Single/double action, 8+1 capacity, and comes with the original ""Russian Star"" bakelite grips and two original magazines. This gun is unissued/unfired. Price is $1200 May entertain trades of other highend firearms. AK-74's, AR's, Etc.. Let me know what ya got. Thanks"

These are very accurate well built handguns. If you don't know about CZ handguns, read a few reviews. The 85 Combat is a little different from the 75 in that it has ambi saftey and slide stop, nice adjustable sights, and no firing pin block which gives it a better trigger pull. This gun has a nice crisp pull and comes with 2-16rd magazines. It's a double action handgun that has a saftey that allows it to be carried cocked and locked. It has a grip that really fits your hand well that a lot of people compare to a Hi Power. For sale only to Ky. residents that are 21 or over that can legally own a firearm."

It has since been retired because of a major crack in the wrist of the stock behind the tang.  There is also only about 20% of the bluing remaining throughout the rifle.  With a repaired/replaced stock, this rifle would return to being an excellent shooter.  The stock appears to be missing the insert to which the cleaning rod securely fastens.  The bolt has difficulty extracting in the first few shots usually. It does not have matching numbers and is discreetly import marked on the end of the barrel (nothing on the receiver).  While this rifle needs work to be a well-functioning piece again, it is a good looking example for your collection as an entry-level or project piece.  Further pictures are available upon request.  Best reached by text at REDACTED or by email response.  I am not willing to travel outside of Columbia."

The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.   Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.   Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.   Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul PMAG.  We will ship to your FFL for actual shipping charges."

No this not the V2. However this is still the all American made milled AKM with a chrome lined barrel.Let's start with a few things...1. Yes it's painted. I bought it painted with the intent to give it my own rattle can job. 2. I'll throw in one loaded Tapco mag. No the TRS25 and extra mags are not included. 3.The front hand guard was replaced with a destructive industries rail system. Super solid place to mount lights, optics etc.4. I also added a Texas Weapon Systems dust cover mount. It has a hinge that replaces the rear sight and the rail goes over top of the dust cover and screws into the butt stock. This is also a nice rigid mounting platform that I used for my TRS25. I never had any return to zero issues with it. Cool thing is that it has a peep sight on the back to replace the removed rear sight.5. A nice add on is the Magpul grip which is a super nice fit. Also with it is a double sling attachment point I added with the grip. I also will include the Magpul angled for grip. I didn't think I would like it but it actually is pretty nice.I bought this with the idea in my head to turn it into a tacticool AK. After adding on some pieces parts I decided to stick with a traditional styled AK, hence the reason I'm selling this. I mounted a TRS25 and this thing shoots lights out. At 30 yards, all the space I have, it's nothing to dump rounds into the same hole. I'm not looking to make a million bucks on it but I'd at least like to make back most of what I put into it. I'm asking $800 obo. I'm also open to some trades/partial trades. I'd be interested in a SKS, mosin with ammo, a single action .45 LC, maybe a glock 26, or whatever might be interesting. Feel free to email or text 33zero68seven341three. I work a strange schedule so I might not get back to you till the afternoon. I'm more than happy to meet as well. I'm in the norton/wadsworth/Akron area. Depending on if all the pics load or not I can email or text additional pics.Again asking $800 obo"

Building on the lauded submachinegun platform that first hit the US civilian market in pistol form in 2015, the Carbine has a 16.2″ barrel fitted with either a compensating muzzle brake or a faux suppressor built specifically for CZ-USA by SilencerCo. Fit with the factory’s folding adjustable stock, the Carbine features a number of US-made parts to make it fully 922(r) compliant. One of the nicest features of the firearm is the newly-designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor. Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Carrying on the Scorpion’s reputation as a reliable pistol-caliber plinker without breaking the bank, the Carbine starts at just $999.

I have not experienced any issues with it. It has very light scratching near the muzzle that is only seen if the light hits the right angle. It is from holster wear. I experimented with blacking out the rear sight with a marker and nearly all of it is wiped off. What I couldn't get I tried to cut out from the polymer as I was going to scrap the sights for metal sights anyway. Most people replace them as they can easily break during a draw from holster or other actions. I think you can buy a new set for very cheap if that is what you want on there. It comes with everything from factory including 3 magazines that are 17 rounders. I have 2 holsters available also. One is a Inside the waisteband NSR Tactical for $40 and the other is a reversible for OWB or IWB Bravo Concealment for $40 and a matching mag carrier for $10.Must have permit to purchase and sign a bill of sale.You can contact me at REDACTED

Floyd stays in tune without a hitch. Fretboard and neck is unfinished so it will wear over time like Eddie's old Frankenstein!As you can see in the photos there is one nick on the front of the body, and also there is a hex screw missing on the back of the neck for the Floyd nut. It was like that when I bought it and I think a worker at Fender forgot to put it in. Those screws cost pennies on the dollar and can be found anywhere. It has never affected tuning stability or anything else, so I just never worried about it.This thing screams and if you're an Eddie fan.. You'll love the simplicity of design just as Eddie intended it. It didn't come with a case when I bought it and I am not selling it with a case either. Will trade for Glocks and Berettas chambered in 9mm, Smith and Wesson revolvers, Ruger revolvers, AK47 type rifles, +/- cash if needed.Serious inquiries only.

Never used. Message me and comment so I know you've messaged me. Thanks.ZT 300BW BLACKWASH THE CLASSIC BEAST, NOW IN BLACKWASH Our flagship knife looks great in our new blackwashed finish. The 0300BW looks like it's been serving you for years—like a battle-tested tool or a favorite pair of well-worn jeans. Blackwashing gives it an already-broken-in look. To make a blackwashed knife, knife components are Tungsten DLC (Diamond-like Carbon) coated, then tumbled to produce the distinctive ZT blackwash finish. The 0300BW has all the features you expect from your ZT: extremely solid construction, premium materials, and sophisticated ergonomics. The blade is built of tough S30V stainless steel blade designed to provide the perfect combination of durability, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. The blackwashed finish provides a non-reflective surface and helps emphasize the lines of the blade. The 0300BW is equipped with SpeedSafe assisted opening making it easy to deploy its big, beefy blade—just pull back on the flipper. Believe us, with a blade this massive, SpeedSafe supplies an assist you’ll appreciate. The 0300BW’s handle is 3-D machined G-10 in the front with a blackwashed 3D-machined titanium back. The titanium frame lock provides a secure blade lock up during use. With or without duty gloves, this enables a very firm grip. The solid grip enables a quick transition from forward to reverse grip time and again. Heavy jimping on the thumb ramp further enhances the grip. A 3/8-inch hex head pivot shaft nut makes field adjustments possible with minimal tools. ZT's Quad-mount pocketclip enables for tip-up, tip-down, left- or right-handed carry.

It is a 2015 model and has the new hammer and night sights. It has had approximately 600 rounds through it. Never carried in a holster, though it comes with a paddle holster from SIG. Has all four of the original 8 round factory magazines, along with a Chip Power-10 and a Wilson 10 round magazine. Comes with some other things like a pack of Wilson Shock-Buffs and a Wilson 1911 wrench. Comes with the original hard case, original paperwork, and the packages for everything else. Functions flawlessly and it is wicked accurate. Note: It does NOT come with the Surefire X300.The only trades I would look at would be something in a similar price bracket in 9mm. Something a Kriss Sphinx, Sig P229 or P226 Legion (I'd add cash), Beretta M9A3 (I'd add cash), CZ SP01, or others. I would also consider a Glock 34 with something else from your end. Otherwise, $850 takes it."
