These were produced before Glock went to a full metal lining and are sometimes called non-drop free mags.  Unfortunately I don't have the original 'tupperware' case.I love the 17 and many of my friends who shoot Glock s have never actually shot a Gen 1 but I also have a later 19 that I shoot most often, so perhaps it is time for my Gen 1 to go to someone who can appreciate it.  I would prefer to trade but would accept a cash offer of $550.Buyer must meet in a public place, present ID and fill out a Bill of Sale."

The Inertia Driven system allows the M2 to digest nearly any 12-gauge cartridge, from 2.75in target loads to the heaviest 3in magnums. Benelli engineers have also adapted the ComforTech recoil system for the M2. This revolutionary system reduces felt recoil by up to 48%, and cuts muzzle climb by 15%. When combined, this puts the you back on target up to 69% faster than any other comparable semi-automatic shotgun. The M2 is not only faster, but with the new ComforTech system, it may be the most comfortable shotgun you ever will shoot. The M2 is a workhorse with the speed of a thoroughbred.

It may need a new hand or other parts to correct that issue. Gun will cock and the trigger works, loading gate works fine. Number do not match and finish is probably not original.

This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case."

Rifle is in awesome shape with a good bore (practically new) and functions super well. Some of these like to jam I've read, but this one is NOT a jammer. Has been treated well and is reliable and faithful. Rapid fire is a breeze and operation is fast and accurate. Can be outfitted with tactical additions for red-dot, aimpoint, flashlight, et cetera, but I have left it in its WWII configuration. Great urban warfare option for the field, the home, or the range. This rifle was $799 before tax new from Palmetto State Armory. They still sell for around that on Gunbroker, not including shipping and FFL fees. Other than these Auto Ordnance rifles, you CANNOT buy an M1A1 Carbine that is made to Milspec without spending thousands for a well-worn original ($2,000-$4,000 depending). Comes with WWII repro sling, jump bag, 1 canvas rigger pouch for the mags, and around 5 mags (some original WWII or Korea, some new). I'm looking to trade for an AR-15 with 16 inch barrel in the traditional 5.56/.233 caliber. Might consider other trades, but I'd have to really dig it. Thanks very much for looking and please email with any questions!-Note, please email now if interested to set up a deal, but I will be away until the 28th of this month (I'm up North for a couple weeks). Once I get back at that time I can drive to meet depending on distance and deal."

Rifle is in awesome shape with a good bore (practically new) and functions super well. Some of these like to jam I've read, but this one is NOT a jammer. Has been treated well and is reliable and faithful. Rapid fire is a breeze and operation is fast and accurate. Can be outfitted with tactical additions for red-dot, aimpoint, flashlight, et cetera, but I have left it in its WWII configuration. Great urban warfare option for the field, the home, or the range. This rifle was $799 before tax new from Palmetto State Armory. They still sell for around that on Gunbroker, not including shipping and FFL fees. Other than these Auto Ordnance rifles, you CANNOT buy an M1A1 Carbine that is made to Milspec without spending thousands for a well-worn original ($2,000-$4,000 depending). Comes with WWII repro sling, jump bag, 1 canvas rigger pouch for the mags, and around 5 mags (some original WWII or Korea, some new). I'm looking to trade for an AR-15 with 16 inch barrel in the traditional 5.56/.233 caliber. Might consider other trades, but I'd have to really dig it. Thanks very much for looking and please email with any questions!-Note, please email now if interested to set up a deal, but I will be away until the 28th of this month (I'm up North for a couple weeks). Once I get back at that time I can drive to meet depending on distance and deal."
