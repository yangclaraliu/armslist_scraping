Overall the pistol is in perfect working order and in perfect shape internally. To purchase this pistol used without the laser grips averages on armslist around $650, the crimson laser grips cost me around $250, and I am selling thsi pistol with the grips for $575. To purchaae this pistol new, it would cost somewhere around $1000. However, because this pistol has some holster wear I am offering for much less than its worth. I looked at fixing it with duracoat, which cost $30, its easy enough to do, but I decided to that its not worth it to me, I will just take the hit, and sell it for a little cheaper. Or if I can't sell it at this price, I will just keep it and let it sit in the safe. Also, I am not able to travel more then 30 minutes from the Raleigh, but I will ship to a FFL, if you're willing to pay shipping and FFL charges.  The pistol comes with - Crimson Trace Laser Grips - 3 magazines, - Original box and paperwork- Kimber zip case- Original GripsThis is the perfect concealed carry gun and it is price to sell.

It was designed by Jim Sullivan during his three years with Ruger. The rifle features a traditional Mauser-style two-lugged bolt with a claw extractor.  The M77 was retooled almost entirely and reintroduced in 1991 as the Mark II. The safety, bolt, and trigger were completely redesigned. The claw extractor was retained, but the bolt face was opened up to allow controlled-round feeding. The plunger ejector was replaced with a Mauser style blade ejector. Finally, a three-position safety allowed the bolt to be operated while the gun was still on safe, making unloading of the rifle less hazardous. Ruger also eliminated the adjustable trigger that came stock on the original M77.  Perhaps the most novel feature of the M77 is the only one that has not been redesigned, the angled action screw. The front action screw of traditional bolt-action rifles draws the receiver directly down against the stock. The M77 uses an angled screw that draws the action down and to the rear, tightly bedding it against the stock.This is an outstanding and unique rifle.  It is used but in excellent condition.CONDITIONS OF SALE:Buyer arranges and pays all FFL transfer fees IN ADDITION to the sale price.Face-to-face deals ONLY.

$600 firm in cash.  Looking for a folding brace for a Sig P556 and nice replacement trigger.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18""
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.

The model number is 27488, and it was manufactured in 1995, when Remington was still at the top of its game. It is similar to the current Model 700 VLS, but I think the build quality is better. It has one range session on it, and less than two boxes of ammo through it. The gun is in perfect condition. I cannot find a mark on it, and the bore and mechanicals are perfect. The jeweled bolt is numbered to the gun. The barrel and receiver have a nice deep-blue satin finish, with no scratches, rust, or loss of bluing. It comes in the original box with matching end label, and with all papers still in the sealed envelope. Also included is a Simmons ProHunter fully-coated 6-18x40 Adjustable Objective scope in perfect condition. (The scope is made in the Philippines, not in China.) The scope is mounted in a Leupold windage-adjustable base and rings, which are also included. This gun is not subject to the Remington 700 recall, so it's ready to shoot. Great coyote, varmint, or bench rest gun. I am rating it 99% instead of 100% only because it has been fired a few times. Asking $825 shipped to your FFL. Willing to sell at a lower price without the scope. Sorry, no international or CA sales. No trades. I have additional photos, and will provide them if you respond with your email address. Any questions, let me know. Thanks for looking."

Steyr Arms S9-A1 (SteyrArms.com)
“The Steyr S-A1 striker-fired pistol is a sub-compact, semi-automatic, double-action handgun available as the S9-A1 chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum or the S40-A1 chambered in .40 Smith & Wesson. The smallest of Steyr’s pistol line, the S-A1 has a 3.6” (91mm) barrel and the same short overall length as the C-A1 but features a short grip for ultra-concealment.
As with each model in the Steyr A1 line of products, the pistol features a low bore-axis which minimizes recoil and improves control while the ergonomic grip offers optimal control for a variety of hand sizes. The lower frame of the gun offers a standard slide-lock thumb tab, right-handed magazine ejection button and pivoting break-down lever. A key-operated manual safety feature is located next to the break-down lever and 2 keys are provided with each pistol. An integrated Picatinny rail allows for simple mounting of a laser or light and slide-racking grooves on the back of the slide allow for a firm grip when manually operating the action.”

$600 in cash.  Looking for a folding brace for a Sig P556 and a nicer replacement trigger.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18""
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

The saddle is changeable for left or right handed shooters, and the stock is meant for 12g Remington 870 other 870 clones  or Mossberg shotguns like the 590. It does fit 20g shotguns of the same brands, but it fits awkwardly and leaves a lip where the stock and receiver meet. It's a great stock, great for the tactical shooter who likes the home security pistol grip style shotgun. I'm asking 65 for it, since these sorts of stocks range from about 80 to 100.

Chambered in the very powerful 44 special. Bore, timing and lockup are all perfect. A great shooter. This particular bulldog originally had a 3"" barrel. It's been cut down to 1.75"" and recrowned. It's now about the size of a S&W J frame, but in a much larger caliber. It also has a factory bobbed hammer, but there's enough left there to still grab with the thumb and fire in single action if you want. Perfect carry size. These older charter arms are a much nicer quality than the newer one in my opinion. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a truly unique carry piece. Will also include about 60 rounds of ammo including some hollow points. Also includes a custom leather wrist band that holds extra rounds. Located in St Charles.All laws apply. Foid, ISP check and wait period required. Text me REDACTED"

I have done the conversion myself including adding a Canis AR buffer tube adapter and a bullet guide so this rifle will accept traditional AK47 magazines.  This rifle has about 20 rounds fired through it from when I tested the function of the bullet guide and I had zero malfunctions. This rifle will also come with a single point QD sling and 5.11 sling plus a picatinny mount on the barrel to add a light if you desire (this can be removed by unscrewing it).  This is a dream rifle but I do have to sell the rifle to pay for another. If you are on Armslist I am sure you know what I mean.  This rifle chambered in this caliber is difficult to find and with the conversion the price I am asking is a fair one.  Buyer would need to meet me in Santa Clarita.  Please email me if you have any questions.  Thanks
