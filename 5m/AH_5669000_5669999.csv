The 715 is as it was before — designed and built to be the most accurate, rugged and versatile revolver on the market. Shipped with a 6″ barrel, the new shroud is designated the HV6, a heavy vent shroud profile that tames the .357’s recoil very well.The double action trigger is short and relatively light, while the single action is light and crisp. The target-like SA trigger pull made the Dan Wesson revolver a favorite among competitors and hunters, and the tradition continues in the 715.Barrel assemblies and grips are easily swapped by the shooter, and the 715 accepts grips and barrel/shroud assemblies from 15-2 model and newer revolvers.The original Dan Wesson revolver improved on the accuracy and service life of the traditional double action revolver design in a few ways. The tensioned barrel of the DW interchangeable barrel system enhances accuracy, pulling the barrel tight like a guitar string, enabling it to vibrate at the same frequency every time. The forward crane latch, located in front of the cylinder and paired with a rear ball detent helps to ensure proper cylinder/barrel alignment during firing. Superior to the rear locking designs of other revolvers, it adds to the accuracy of the 715.While the tensioned barrel definitely improves accuracy above other revolvers, it’s the consistent cylinder/barrel alignment that contributes most to the accuracy of the design.Additionally, the clockwise-rotating cylinder reduces stress on the crane, since it turns in the same direction the crane locks, prolonging service life and keeping everything tight. The 715’s frame is robust, built to handle the heaviest of factory loads.Each revolver is shipped in a custom Dan Wesson hard case. Patterned after the ever-popular Pistol Pack, each case has compartments for three additional barrel assemblies and factory-supplied barrel wrench kit.Manufacturer: CZ Dan WessonModel #: Dan Wesson 715Type: RevolverFinish: Stainless SteelStock: Finger Grooved Hogue Rubber GripSights: Adjustable Target Rear SightBarrel: 6 inch Heavy Barrel with Vent RibOverall Length: 8.75Weight: 38 ozCaliber: 357Capacity: 6Action: Double ActionPackaging: Includes Barrel Wrench KitReceiver: Stainless SteelFeatures: Dan Wesson Interchangeable Barrel System, Front Crane Latch and Rear Ball Detent

Carry with ease, draw with confidence, fire with precision. The SPHINX SDP Subcompact Alpha is the smallest and lightest of the SDP line up of pistols. The Subcompact Alpha is the perfect choice for concealed carry, or professional duty use, with an overall weight just under 25oz and an overall height and width at 4.9” and 1.2” respectively. Though the SDP Subcompact Alpha is small in stature it does not sacrifice in quality or performance. Through precision machining and hand fitting by a master gunsmith, the SDP Subcompact Alpha can achieve similar groupings to that of its larger counterpart, the Compact Alpha.The Subcompact Alpha shares more than just high performance figures with the larger pistols in the Alpha line.It also features a steel slide machined from billet.The upper frame, machined from billet aluminum, features full length internal guide rails which provide very smooth slide operation as well as solid barrel lock up.The pistol grip is polymer and textured for maximum ergonomics and grip.The pistol grip is also contoured to offer high hand placement to compliment the low bore axis, which assist the shooter with managing recoil. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side.The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Subcompact Alpha.The white dot front sight is easy to see in contrast to the black rear sight.The competition inspired trigger is very smooth, in both double and single action mode, with a clean break and short, crisp, reset.Every component of the SDP Subcompact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight.Defined by precision, the Subcompact Alpha is the only choice for discerning shooters that demand the utmost in build quality and performance.

The SDP Compact features a full aluminum lower frame, which gives it unparalleled balance, and can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The aluminum pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.   Technical Specifications:  Caliber: 9mm Overall Length: 7.4"" / 188 mm Overall Height: 5.5"" / 144 mm Overall Width: 1.37"" / 35mm Weight: 29.06 oz / 824g Barrel Length: 3.7"" / 95 mm Sight Radius: 5.7"" / 148 mm Action: Double Action / Single Action with Ambidextrous Decocking Lever Slide Material: Steel Slide Finish: Cerakote Frame Material: Milled Aluminum Frame Finish: Cerakote Magazine Catch: Left / Right - Reversible Magazine Capacity: 17+1"

The SDP Compact features a full aluminum lower frame, which gives it unparalleled balance, and can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The aluminum pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.

FROM WHAT I'VE GATHERED, this is something that can be fixed by either smoothing some internal parts and cleaning, or getting a new bolt. A new bolt will run you about $50. A bolt disassembly tool will run you about $12. These rifles typically run you around $350. I don't have the time or patience to mess with it, I'm having car troubles, and I need cash quick, so no trades unless I can make a profit greater than $230 from it.

The SPHINX SDP Compact is a duty-sized pistol for the most discerning of shooters. The SDP Compact features a full aluminum lower frame, which gives it unparalleled balance, and can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The aluminum pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.

The SPHINX SDP Compact is a duty-sized pistol for the most discerning of shooters. The SDP Compact features a full aluminum lower frame, which gives it unparalleled balance, and can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The aluminum pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.

Absolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use.   Ultra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home Defense  Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.  Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with Features  The lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.  Reliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to Maintain  This pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame. Whether it is for official military and law-enforcement use, for home defense and concealed carry or as an accurate and high-quality pistol for recreational shooting, the PX4 Storm is one piece of gear that will never let you down. It is also available in stainless steel, compact, and sub-compact versions--making this line even more versatile for a variety of uses.  Features:  Commander-Style Hammer: Besides being a custom-looking touch, the Commander-style hammer is lighter; hammer-fall during firing is therefore crisper and will not disrupt your aim. Ambidextrous Safety: Easily train or shoot with either hand. Automatic Firing Pin Block: The PX4 gives you an extra level of safety while in the holster or not in use--the firing pin is blocked automatically to prevent any type of accidental firing. 3-Dot Sight System: The 3-dot sight system is adjustable for windage, and makes target acquisition easy under most light conditions. Picatinny Rail: The built-in Picatinny rail makes it easy to complement the PX4 with a variety of tactical accessories such as lighting devices, with no gunsmithing required. Reversible Magazine Release: Most controls on the PX4 are reversible or ambidextrous, making it possible to train or shoot right- or left-handed. Interchangeable Backstraps: The interchangeable backstraps will make the PX4 grip fit ergonomically most hand-sizes and shooting styles. Drop-Free Magazine: Tactical magazine-exchange on the PX4 is easy and lightning-fast. When you operate the magazine-release, the magazine falls free and does not require the use of the off-hand.

These woukd be great for an inexperienced shooting enthusiast or for a lady first time buyer. The mechanism is fool proof and with 3 inch barrel the recoil is truly minimal. Also the full size grips with soft finger grooves really help. I test fired one with ten rounds of 130 gr and felt just like a 9mm.  The three inch barrel gives it a pretty decent sight radious and the action is very light in single action mode and respectful in double action mode. This is a great little gun made by brazztech which makes both taurus and rossi."

This rare and unique little revolver bearing serial number 3731 was manufactured about 1905 according to published Smith & Wesson production information. The example shown here in our auction photographs is in exceptinal factory original condition still retaining a majority of the factory applied blued metal finish throughout, with most of the finish loss being to the cylinder as with a lot of these early Ladysmith revolvers, it is more common than not, for the finish on the cylinders to disappear early on. The .22 cal. bore in the 3 1/2 inch round barrel, along with all 7 cylinder chambers, all have nice bright bores, with no pitting, the revolver still functions perfectly in both double & single action, still cycles excellent, has a nice firm lock up, and the forcing cone is also excellent, showing no evidence of damage. Even the case colors are still evident on the hammer and trigger. Most collectors will find this 111 year old Ladysmith very difficult to upgrade. This revolver has a 7 shot cylinder that was designed to fire .22 Long (Black Powder Only) cartridges. However we never suggest firing any Black Powder Era firearms, and this nice clean little Ladysmith revolver is absolutely no exception. Truth is, firing this little beauty could actually damage it... These petite little revolvers are very small, and the intricate parts are very delicate. It is our opinion that firing any 100+ year old gun, be it an antique, or any early vintage firearm of any kind is risky. However to fire one of these tiny little revolvers, no matter which design, or model type is never advisable without the proper ammo, and instruction given by a competent, certified, professional gunsmith. But again, we want to be perfectly clear,,, the revolver shown here in our auction photographs is still fully functional in every way. The simple fact that the gun is still fully functional after 100+ years is ""exceedingly rare"", and makes it a very neat historic collectable."
