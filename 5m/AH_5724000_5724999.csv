It also comes with 10 Speer gold dot hollow point defense rounds in 45 gap, not 20 as pictured***. I bought this as a police trade in basically because it was in such good condition I could not pass it up. They had a brand new one and I compared it with this one and I could hardly tell the difference (field stripped this one and the new one and could hardly tell the difference). What the dealer said is it was likely bought by the department and they over ordered so it was not used but is still considered used because it had left the dealer. This thing has never been holstered, and I put 50 rounds through it (more than likely the first time it was ever shot) gave it a good cleaning and put it away in its factory case where it has remained for a few months. I am selling it because I shoot 9mm all the time and just don't like the bigger calibers as much. It is chambered in 45 gap. Many professional reviews of this gun say it is one of the best balanced glocks available (I agree with that assessment). I usually don't like how glocks feel but this thing is very comfortable and is a great shooter. The gun, finish (really beautiful finish on the gen 3s), chamber, barrel, mags, box, manual (still sealed), are all like new in box and pretty much indistinguishable from a brand new package. With the night sights and caliber this is ideal for home defense. I misplaced the ""factory lock"" it came with so I threw in one from an h&k vp9 I had laying around so it says h&k unsteady of glock on the side of the lock. This gun will need to be transferred at a gun shop with transfer fee on the buyer. I will do the transfer at any shop within 45 minutes of Pittsburgh, preferably at guns priced right in Dravosburg. The transfer will need to be done either on a week night after five or on the weekend (I work full time). NO TRADES, cash only. Thanks"

Only visible wear is a LIGHT tool scoring on the zip spindle collet where I used pliers instead of a wrench one day. Not a critical area and hardly worth mentioning honestly.  I have only ever used RCBS case sizing lubes and extremely clean cases.  There has never been dirt/grit to contaminate or score the walls.    I treated these dies like I was going to keep them forever.These dies are an upgrade from their American series. The crimp is roll crimp but of course you can set it not to crimp. It comes with everything that it did when I bought them new last year.   - Storage case (excellent condition, no scratches) - All manuals/instructions and paperwork - Replacement zip spindle - Replacement elliptical expander ball - Replacement decapping pin - Replacement bullet seater retaining clip  The rifle I used these for is actually chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO and I've had great results and zero issues- Safety, performance or cosmetic. All rounds chambered and cycled perfectly and fired extremely accurately. No malfunctions- jams, failure to feed, failure to extract, etc. Reload and shoot with confidence using these dies. Use them with the Lock-N-Load bushing for zero-fuss setup.  I am selling because I want to try the Redding dies."

The trigger is a bit over 5 pounds in single action (and very crisp) and the double action pull is a touch over 12 pounds. NOT typical for these of copurse. I have used it to take a jackrabbit at over 50 yards and if you like, I can send you the link to the video of that on YouTube.Condition is absolutely superb, with nice dark grips and no scratches or dings or pitting on it. It looks to have been in unissued condition since its postwar refurbishment. There are shiny spots in the photos, but those are just the sunlight shining on it..Action is tight, bore is mint, and it will surprise you at the way it is fitted. I frankly don't think it was ever issued. It is pictured in a Colt SAA holster that fits perfectly, but that can't be sold since it was made by a dear but deceased friend. I have taken about a dozen jackrabbits with it. Included in the price is a full box of 50 PPU brass rounds for it. This handgun not only likes its original 7.62 Nagant load, but is also very accurate with .32 H&R Magnum. Hornady Critical Defense in particular. I also have a couple of videos of me shooting it at rocks at the range by the way. You can see how and where it hits. It seems to be zeroed right on at 35 yards. Feel free to contact me through Armslist or on my cell phone at REDACTED. Thanks for looking. You'll like this one. Doby Pilgrim Santa Fe"

It is in perfect condition and works flawlessly, round count sits at 120.  I had intended on buying a suppressor and making the gun a SBR but plans have changed and im deciding to sell/trade. If you don't know the difference between an AR rifle and pistol, this is technically a ""pistol"" because it has a buffer tube that will not accept a standard AR stock, and has been fitted with a special ""stabilizing brace"" instead. The ATF does not consider this brace to be a stock, the brace even came with a letter that the manufacturers received from the ATF verifying this. The letter will be including with the gun.  To put a standard buffer tube & stock on this gun you will have to fill out a form 1 online with the ATF to change this gun from a pistol into a short barreled rifle. Also i will throw in a standard PMAG that i have not written on, these pictures are just what was on my phone.Cash is king but i would really like to trade the gun for a Gibson Les Paul Studio model. Obviously i will also consider trades on other firearms. Below is a full parts list of the gun, please ignore the lack of a charging handle in one picture and the sight setup in the other, these are older pics,  what i have listed below is EXACTLY how the gun is currently set upPalmetto state armory - lower receiver, lower parts kit, standard buffer w/pistol tube. KAK industries - Shockwave blade adjustable stabilizing brace.

The Huldra 5.56 Midlength Evo-Slank 14.5 Upper (Ultra Lite Piston Upper) is a .625"" lite profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. With the combination of the .625 ultra lite pencil barrel, the Samson Evolution hand guard, and the new reduced radius permanently affixed flash hider, we now have the lightest dedicated piston upper on the market. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler and longer than any other AR upper you own."

Genuine Crye Multicam. Black Kydex inserts for positive magazine retention. Will work on any chest rig/plate carrier with the corresponding female ITW GhillieTex (GT) Quick-Attach Surface Mount (QASM) buckles. If your rig doesn't already have the buckles, these are .75 cents each from SKD (you would need 2) and can easily be added to vertical molle (non-permanent upgrade).
 
From the Esstac website:
 
“Add on front panels.
 
Front panels are removable via velcro(they act as the cumberbun flap) and two ITW QASM Buckles at the top. Simply pop the two buckles and swap panels. They are built the same as our normal Kywi pouches, but instead of Webbing on the back for mounting they have Hook velcro and two buckles to integrate into the PC.
 
Front panels remove some excess typical of Plate carriers, no longer do you need a mounting system and front flap. So you remove some weight and streamline/thin the front of your PC.”
 
Purchased for $70.95 shipped directly from Stu at Esstac. Decided to forego my plate carrier setup and get another gun. Will sell for $55 face-to-face OBO. Call/text Scott REDACTED."

We took a 1950 model 70 winchester 375 H&H Magnum action and machined it to use the 257 Weatherby magnum. Next we built a target balanced stock using American walnut with maple caps. The barrel is a 26"" stainless steel 1 in 10 twist target grade manufactured by Lilja. The barrel is 100% glass bedded from the front of the action to the end of the stock. For optics we used the 4-14x40 Nikon, for its BDC reticle. The rifle has been fired only to dial it in so we could report on its performance, this platform will produce 3 shot groups of 1/2 inch or better at 100 yards respectively.
