Though smaller, Jeff's Outfitters has painstakingly designed it to be the finest value on the market today. Covered with top grain leather and trimmed with harness leather. The inside is lined in traditional green wool felt with no exposed hardware or screws to damage your firearm. Hardware is solid, heavy brass (not plated). The truly remarkable feature of this case is that it is NOT a one case fits all type. It's offered in a 20 gauge and barrel length. A 12ga will not fit into a 20ga case. The barrel compartments are size specific so you don't have to fill them up with spacer blocks to make your gun fit. A fabulous fit for any of the European imports as it was designed for a splinter or semi beavertail forearm. There are similar cases on the market and I feel this case is the best quality and value in the industry, hard to find.No scammers or text.  Please call between 9:00 AM & 8:00?"

Comes with 1 Kim-Pro Tac Mag, 1 Wilson Combat mag, Kimber case and whatever case candy I can find. Will also throw in the NZD takedown tool which is invaluable for these 3"" 1911 styles. Pistol is in great shape, and does show typical Kimber finish wear on the black contact surfaces (under slide lock, rails) but functions 100% and you only see that finish wear when it's broken down for cleaning. Will sell with blued grip screws. $700 cash in hand, local meetup at my FFL. Will ship for an extra $50 to your FFL. Transfer fees are buyer's responsibility. Would rather cash out, no trades.
