The rifle is in excellent condition with a super faint scratch on the barrel, it has been stored in a sock, with lots of lube and in a dehumidified safe whenever I am not shooting it (which was only once).  I also have 140rds of Federal ammunition (I will add a picture of the box which has specs). I would like to sell this rifle and ammunition as a package, it is easier for me to move the stuff out in one swift move, and good for you so you don't have to buy $100+ dollars of ammunition.  I WILL TAKE TRADES of quality handguns (1911s, beretta 92fs, etc) and I would be extremely interested in trading for a quality revolver (Smith and Wesson, Ruger Blackhawk, etc). I will only consider stainless steel handguns, unless something really catches my eye. Doesn't hurt to ask."

This will work in either Gen3 or Gen4 models and lets you shoot 9mm from your .40. Will also work in a Glock 22 but will extend past the end of the slide a little less than an inch.  I bought it brand new a few months back and it's only had about 20-25rds shot through it. I've played with these in the past and I've never had a problem with them, reliability has been perfect but the reason I get an extractor is because with the standard .40 extractor it seems to throw brass everywhere. The 9mm extractor solves that, so it's not necessary for the barrel to work, but it does help.  You can use a .40 magazine but I personally prefer to use a G17 magazine.  I'm asking $85 (and will ship anywhere in the CONUS for the same price).  Brand new with shipping this stuff would cost over $125.I'm willing to meet up as long as it's reasonable.  Thanks for looking."

This one has been refurbished as shown with the electropencil on the bolt. It appears to have a modern magazine as well but, unlike other modern magazines I've encountered, this one slides easily in and out of the magazine well. From research, this appears to be a 1980's Numrich magazine. The action is fantastic!
If you'll notice, the later style muzzle brake is on this one. No worries though, with purchase, the older style muzzle brake is included!
The stock has the dual indents on either side of the safety showing that this stock was actually used with the full auto SVT40's.
There is a carving on the side that says IVAN. I don't know enough about trench art to date it so I won't even try.
Overall, this is an amazing example of an SVT40 though and one I wish I could keep!:::::::::NOTE:::::::::::: More pictures availabel upon requestI Will consider trades on this one.  Trade firearms I would consider would have to be from WWI/WWII and multiple firearm package trades will be considered as well!"

The first generation model used the AK-47 gas system and the recoil spring is located within the Upper barrel gas system as compared to the AR-15 / M16, where the recoil spring is located within the butt stock. Originally marketed for police and the military, Bushmaster later changed its unique hybrid version AR-15 / M16 to the standard Colt/Armalite design. It was a rifle built by the early Bushmaster company using M16 Parts which I hear is illegal to do now. It has a gas piston rotating bolt system, and utilizes a M16 bolt. It is chambered in 5.56 mm and has a standard 16-inch M16 Barrel as well as lower parts kit. It accepts standard M16 / AR-15 magazines. This originally designed rifle was built full auto for the military but was never picked up. This rifle is semi automatic. It is stamped assault unlike modern ar-15. It also has a factory bayonet lug on the barrel, which could be removed. These guys are really hard to find especially in the folding stock paratrooper lower. This would be great personal defense / field weapon or a great addition to the Discerning Bushmaster collector.I have shot this gun at the range, it shoots very tight groups."
