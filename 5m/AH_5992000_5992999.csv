The original gun was built in 1885, chambered in .450/577. Then, after England adopted the Lee Metford (and then Lee Enfield) in .303, large numbers of these Marini Henrys were sent out the colonies for their colonial troops to carry. This particular gun was sent to Egypt, along with conversion parts, and was converted in 1904 in their Citadel Armory. This is an actual Martini Enfield, converted from a real Martini Henry, using English made parts, under supervision of English armorers in Egypt. This isn't a Khyber Pass copy. The gun shows it's age (all 131 years of it), but still shoots just fine. The action works smoothly. It is missing the cleaning rod. The only real issue is that there is a crack in the forearm around a pin, just ahead of the receiver. This can be repaired if you know what you are doing (I don't, for the record), or you can actually buy new made stocks for these old warhorses and put the originals away somewhere. I would recommend shooting lower power commercial or reloads on this gun. The Martini actions are strong, but some of the military surplus, made for machineguns in World Ward II is probably a little too hot for a girl this old. Matching bayonets can found pretty readily online (typically around $100 to $150), also made by Citadel."

It is a copy of a Webley RIC revolver and appears to be in .44 S&W Russian (at least it says 44 on the side and those rounds chamber just fine in the cylinder, so that's my guess on the caliber). The cylinder has a bit of a wobble when the hammer is cocked, but locks fairly tight when the hammer drops. Otherwise, like a lot of other revolvers of the time, it spins freely. The safety works when the hammer is down, preventing the gun from being cocked. Like the Webley it is copied from, while it is a double action revolver, it has a loading gate and rounds are loaded and empty shells are ejected one at a time (if you have shot a Nagant revolver, it's the same loading procedure). The top of the gun says Genredes Revolvers Americaine, but whether that's the model, I don't know. I haven't been able to find much information about this gun, which really isn't unusual for Belgian revolvers of the era.I might be interested in some trades, mostly pocket pistols from the early 20th century (mostly in .25 auto or .380, like Berettas, Astras, Colts, etc... no modern junk please) and possibly some older revolvers in .38 S&W, .38 Special, or .32 S&W or S&W Long (like a Colt Police Positive or S&W 1903 to fill some holes in my collection)"

This gun is a 10 shot revolver chambered in .32 S&W Long. It is double action only, with a shrouded hammer. It also has an external safety, which works. The gun is a top break with an ejector similar to top break S&Ws or Webleys. The gun was nickel plated, but that finish is a bit rough. It was likely made sometime between World War I and World War II (possibly for the Spanish Civil War, which consumed a lot of Spains weapons output). As you can see, someone has crudely scratched what I assume their initials in it, RL. Whether this was done in 1936 or the week before I picked it up earlier this year, I have no idea. I'd like to think some Republican soldado did it while he was bored in between fights with Franco's fascists, but I don't think we'll ever know for sure. The gun's inner works seem to function, though it is loose. However, the firing pin has the tip worn down or broken off, so it won't actually ignite a primer. This could be fixed if you wanted to, if you can find a gunsmith able to work on odd guns and maybe fabricate some of their own parts."

Pickup only.  It's extremly accurate, powerful and more economical than a .22 firearm. (From a retailer's website) Get into precharged guns at an unheard-of price and also get the accuracy of an expensive European rifle!Benjamin has bridged the gap and taken the pain out of PCP guns. Not only is this as low a price as you'll ever find on a PCP rifle, but it's so easy to pump up that a wispy teenager could do it!The Discovery has raised the bar for PCP guns because it uses only 2000 psi of air. While the European companies race toward higher and higher air pressures, Benjamin is going the opposite direction and making it easier than ever to use a hand pump. If you want to use a scuba tank or carbon fiber tank, you can do that, too, and get the benefit of many more fills than you would from a gun that operates with 3000 psi. The Discovery gives you a choice! The air reservoir is 135cc. The air tank has a male Foster fitting.The gun comes with a hardwood stock, Williams fiber optic front and rear sights, and a built-in air pressure gauge.When you open your box, you'll see easy-to-follow and easy-to-understand instructions that'll lead you step-by-step. If you're an experienced PCP user, you'll soon see that the Discovery is the easiest PCP you've ever used. If you're new to PCPs, you'll become a pro in just a few short steps.If you want to switch to CO2, that's easy to do, but you'll need a degasser tool to quickly exhaust all the air before filling with CO2. Attach the optional CO2 adapter, connect it to a standard paintball CO2 tank and fill 'er up! Now, commence to shootin'!With high-pressure air, you'll get up to 25 powerful shots before you need to pump up again. On CO2, you'll get a lot more shots per fill."

Just do an internet search for Moultrie D-333 for more information.The camera case has a strap that allows it to be strapped to any vertical object like a tree or post. If you are worried about leaving it out in the woods use the integrated attachment points that allow you to chain and padlock the camera for security. In addition, you can program the camera so that even if it does get ripped off it will be useless to the thief without your password to start the camera or reprogram it.Most recently we used the camera here at our house to discover that the scat left in our flower beds is from the nightly visit by a family of racoons. I've got a short video of the racoons that I captured instead of still shots once we figured out who our visitors were. This camera retails for over $100 on the clearance shelf at Cabela's. But you'd have to pay $74.99 extra for the auxiliary power Camera Battery Box that provices a long-lasting, rechargeable external power source that will extend the field life of the camera while standing up to the elements. That's a value of over $175 after sales tax and I'll include a $15 SD card with 16GB memory. The battery box does not come with a charger, but can easily be charged with any 2 amp or less 12v car/atv/tractor charger. The battery holds a charge well and I've had the camera record a full 10 days of night, motion activated shots between charges. If you don't want to use the auxiliary battery, the internal battery has lasted 3 nights for motion activated shots. Cash sale. We'll meet somewhere neutral here in Wichita."

Due to the large number of requests, I mounted my rifle from its current stock into the McMillan stock with magazine inserted, to take pictures of what it looks like fully assembled, but the A-5 stock has never been used. It is brand new & being sold as such. (Rifle was previously in an H-S Precision stock).
This rifle build started with a Remington .308 Win, 700 Police rifle. The rifle was shipped to G.A Precision where the barrel was professionally cut down to 20” (per Remington Military Division, Dillon Precision, & Mike @ Tac-Ops Rifles) to maximize accuracy. It was then threaded 5/8x24 for suppressor use. G.A Precision then mounted a Badger Ordnance custom bolt handle, a Badger 20 MOA cant rail, Badger 30mm Maximized steel rings, & Badger M5 DBM bottom metal for Accuracy International magazines (the finest available). They also performed a custom Remington trigger job & the barrel was professionally hand-lapped. The rifle has less than 100 rounds downrange & shoots 1/4 to 1/2 MOA all day long.
I have $3100.00 into the rifle, background check, taxes, and shipping the rifle back & to G.A precision & am selling for $2500.00 firm. This precision rifle has an extremely low round count, is essentially brand new and not even broke in yet. Includes (1) brand new, professionally Duracoated 5-round Accuracy International magazine. SCOPE & SLING SWIVELS NOT INCLUDED.
The McMILLAN A-5 Tactical Stock is FULLY loaded w/ the following options:
McMillan A-5 with Full Inlet
Machined-In Pillars
CNC machined by McMillan to fit any Remington 700 Right Hand, Short Action
Badger Ordnance M5 DBM Detachable Magazine Triggerguard Installed to accept Accuracy International 5 & 10 Round Magazines
Accepts Remington Tapered Barrels up to Varmint Barrel Contours
Molded-in OD Green, Light Gray, & Black Color Pattern
Two Front Studs, One Rear Stud
Two Quick Detach Flush Cups on Left Side of Stock
Adjustable Length of Pull
Integral Thumbwheel Adjustable Cheekpiece
Sniper Fill: This fill is mainly used on McMillan tactical stocks. It is the same as “magnum fill” except there is fiberglass in the butt stock, not foam. This is so hardware for adjustability can be installed onto the butt stock if so desired. With fiberglass in the butt stock, it also helps to balance out rifles with large barrel contours. It adds about 8-10 ounces to the stock

I have put about 150 flawless rounds through this and would not hesitate having my wife carry this if she was so inclined (she is not). It's my only .380, and I'm consolidating ammo. That's why all my .380 ammo is included. I have some more in my range bag and will include it. Probably another 20-30 rounds. I can't find the original Kimber box, and don't normally throw those away. Still looking for it, but currently is not included.All laws followed. Face to face only, preferably in my home. Near Route 53 & NW Highway. I'm open to safe alternatives in the area (police dept parking lot?). The 3 day wait period starts when we agree to a price & you send me a copy of your FOID. Don't bother asking to get around it. I've had 2 flash a badge at me (one of them would not let me look at it closely, and said he was going to report me, totally legit I'm sure) saying the 3 day does not apply to them. Um, yup it does.  If you are looking for a brand new one in the box, I highly reccomend Ernie who has one listed on this site for $525. If you are ok with a slightly used, well cared for weapon with all the extras listed above... No rush to sell, I'm not hurting for cash.Trades considered, full size 1911's in .45. Kimber, Colt, Springfield. I prefer stainless. No ruger or rock island. Cash from my end as needed."

A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G19 Gen4 9x19mm retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments (Glock, 2016).
Comparing this Gen 4 versus a Gen 3, the Gen 4 wins it hands-down.  The Gen 4 is centered on ergonomics and the recoil spring assembly.  This pistol is truly the Honda Civic of guns.  The pistol becomes better with each round fired.

$1,000 firm in cash or a little better in trade.  At a couple places I found this one still in stock it was selling for $1,050 before any other fees.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and the folding brace or Sig P556xi 5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding brace.  Lots of trade offers so far, but nothing I'd rather have over this one. 
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? this makes it a lot easier when considering.Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others, trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles, depending on value as I can build nice ones pretty cheap right now.
Folding brace and nice trigger/parts to fit a Sig P556.
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18"".
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus, AR15 and AR10's, AK type with 10"" barrel and folding brace, Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" model only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal, depending on value.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308, other similar 1-6x and 1-4x with nice clear glass, true 1x magnification, QD mounts are a plus, not interested in retail prices, I can buy online any time.Must be legal to own a firearm in TX."
