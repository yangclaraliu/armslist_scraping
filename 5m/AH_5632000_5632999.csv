I have fired 200 flawless rounds. It is factory complete with all three mags (never been used) and the box and paperwork. I used the 18 round mecgar mags so that is why the factory mags are new. The gun has the SRT trigger installed and is a sweet shooter. Gun is shown with the threaded barrel and surefire and aren't included in the thread title price but they are detailed below as a package option. The white smudge on the grip min the pictures is from a topical solution I had on my hand while cleaning and should come off with alcohol. I will try to get that wiped off. It is just dried residue and didn't mark the finish. I forgot to wipe that off.   I have a number of extras to go with the gun available to the buyer if interested but I will NOT sell them unless the gun sells separately. The Surefire X300 is NOT for sale and is for display purposes only  5-6 Mecgar mags (all new except two which are like new) I know at least 5 maybe more I'll check  Factory threaded barrel (factory standard barrel has never been used)  G Code holster (took like 10 weeks and was $100 something)    I will do the gun alone as it came from the factory (with the addition of the SRT) for $850   I will do everything mentioned above for $1100   I am NOT in a hurry to sell so I won't be taking offers.

Condition is immaculate.This one is very accurate and I have taken several jackrabbits with it, expecially using the ,22 Magnum cylinder which is included. In .22 Mag, it is more powerful than a .22 LR when fired from a rifle. It is zeroed at about 30 yards and is plenty accurate enough to hit soda cans, spent shotgun shells, and of course jackrabbits! This will come with its original plain cardboard box, the .22 LR cylinder, and the .22 Magnum cylinder. Even the cleaning brush is still in the box. It is a much nicer revolver than the modern American Western guns you see out there, and it is in the same level of quality as something Uberti would make. I am only listing this until Friday night or Saturday and then it will go to auction or back into my gun safe. Or back out in the desert to shoot more jackrabbits, lol! I am available at any time here in Santa Fe, or I wil also be in ABQ for most of Friday morning. I am only selling because i am looking at a couple of other guns to buy, and have other .22s and .22 Magum firearms. This fits in a standard Colt size holster, by the way. i am showing it in a holster, but the holster isn't for sale since it was made for me by a friend who has since passed away.

These were used a couple times, but I am now going a different direction. These are in great shape and saw very little use. This does not include the mounting brackets pictured but does include all original mounting hardware as well as the instructions to get you going.Just like the Deulin Deuces we started with the proven clip design of the QUALOADS  and then we jammed the shells together and tilted them out  so you can grab and pull shells out at an angle. With this design you don't have to rock out elbows, contort you hips or hinder your movement. Additionally, we added some space between rows 2 and 3 to make QUALOADS even faster.What does this all mean? You will be able to grab 2 or 4 shells ergonomically correct while on the move and not have to worry about the grab or the pull. You will have more force available to snap the shells out and be in a more comfortable position. The more comfortable that you are at loading; the more confident you will be shooting a stage.We allow a generous amount of room under the shells so that you can get your fingers under the shells before you lift them out of the holder. We also have the greatest distance between our clips so that HUGE hands will have no problem getting at the shells.You can use these holders for 2up or 4up loading (or both!!) depending on your style of shooting."

This is a Glock 21SF (Slim Frame) pistol hammered in 45 acp. This is a great gun and we all know the Glock dependability. This comes with a case, 49 rounds of winchester personal protection jacketed defense ammo, Bladetech/Looper Leather Carry holster, 3 13rd Glock magazines, extended slide release, polished/mirrored feed ramp, stippled frame (feels great), AmeriGlow fiber optic front and rear sights, and the pistol itself. This is everything you need to be ready to carry and hit the range.  I would also consider trades on this. No bows, 40s, blackpowders, 22s, etc. Easiest bet is to make me an offer at REDACTED (text only), worst i can say is no. i also have a very large amount of additional defense ammo available at less than retail if you would like to purchase some on top of what is included.  Need to meet in Norman on this.Thanks for looking and happy hunting."
