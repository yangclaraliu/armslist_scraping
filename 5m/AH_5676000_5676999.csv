At time of purchase I will be armed as well as being observed from a undisclosed distance by armed backup.

The CQC-6K is a manual opener using either the thumb disk or the patented Emerson ""wave shaped feature."" This opening feature enables the knife to be opened as it is removed from the pocket. By the time the knife has been fully withdrawn from the pocket, the blade is deployed and ready for use. A small wave-shaped tab on the top of the blade is built to catch on the pocket seam, opening the knife as it comes out of the pocket. This instant-open feature is a favorite among military, rescue, and law enforcement knife users.
The pocketclip is reversible for left- or right-handed carry. ALL SALES FINAL."

Then look into Kershaw's new Launch 1. This automatic knife features CPM154 blade steel, a strong opening kick, and is made-in-the-USA at Kershaw’s Tualatin, Oregon manufacturing facility. The CPM154 powdered metallurgy blade steel has more uniform distribution of carbides—so it takes and holds an excellent edge. It also provides good corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and toughness. The blade is finished with our BlackWash finish for rough-and-tumble good looks and an additional measure of blade protection. To lighten the Launch 1's weight, the handles are durable anodized aluminum and are contoured to fit snugly in the hand. The Launch 1 opens with a push button, which is recessed so that it is level with the flat of the handle. This is a safety feature and makes it harder for the knives to accidentally deploy.Nevertheless, automatic knives are dangerous and should be handled with extreme caution in all circumstances. The Launch 1's pocketclip is left/right reversible. For left-handed use, use your index finger instead of your thumb to press the blade-release/lock button. Comply with all local, State, and Federal regulations regarding the purchase, owning, carrying, and transportation of automatic knives."

Then look into Kershaw's new Launch 3. This automatic knife features CPM154 blade steel, a strong opening kick, and is made-in-the-USA at Kershaw’s Tualatin, Oregon manufacturing facility. The CPM154 powdered metallurgy blade steel has more uniform distribution of carbides—so it takes and holds an excellent edge. It also provides good corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and toughness. The blade is DLC coated for an additional measure of blade protection and dark good looks. Then to lighten the Launch 3's weight, we made the handle of durable anodized aluminum and slimmed it toward the back end to neatly fit your hand. Carry left- or right-handed with the Launch 3's reversible pocketclip. For left-handed use, use your index finger instead of your thumb to press the blade-release/lock button. The Launch 3 opens with a push button, which is recessed so that it is level with the flat of the handle. This is a safety feature and makes it harder for the knives to accidentally deploy. Nevertheless, automatic knives are dangerous and should be handled with extreme caution in all circumstances. Comply with all local, State, and Federal regulations regarding the purchase, owning, carrying, and transportation of automatic knives."

Smith and Wesson sent this brand new gun to me after my model 37 was deemed irreparable. It seems to be a great little revolver, but it lacks the long grips of my old 37, and I already have a model 36, which is very similar to this. This particular model has an alloy frame with stainless steel barrel and cylinder. It is chambered in .38 SPL +P. It also features S&W's rubber monogrip, which is surprisingly comfortable. I was surprised to see it come from the factory with a turn line on the cylinder, but that kind of thing never bothered me much. This would make a great carry piece due to its light weight, but, if it shoots anything like my model 37 did, it should be fun to take to the range, too. S&W lists the MSRP at 469.00, but come on, nobody pays that.A local gun shop had an excellent used one in for 430.00, but I have seen well-worn examples on GunBroker for 360.00."

Sorry, no trades.Make - Springfield Armory; Model - XDM-9, 5.25"" Competition Model; Operation - Semi-Automatic Pistol; Caliber - 9 mm; Barrel - 5.25"" Match grade, with fully-supported chamber; Finish - Black; Extras - This model has the vented slide of the Competition models. Pelican hard case, tactical rail, two extra 19-round magazines (total of 3 mags!), mag loader, double mag carrier, holster. Fiber-optic front sight, grip and trigger safeties, loaded chamber and striker indicators, up-graded trigger system for shorter and smoother pull. ""The XDM 5.25-inch Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XDM which maximizes accuracy, controllability, and sight radius. The fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for very fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass, which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XDM features like a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and ""mega-lock"" frame texture, and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to go. ""In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XDM polymer pistol, they did just that: ""Loaded Chamber Indicator: The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. ""Striker Status Indicator: The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or by touch to verify that the striker is in the cocked position. ""The 'Ultra Safety Assurance' trigger system guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDM's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, allowing it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. ""The XDM pistol from Springfield Armory re-defines what a polymer pistol can be. The XDM has everything you want and need in a pistol -- superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XDM 5.25"" Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition."" (From Springfield-Armory.com) Grips - Integrated polymer; three inter-changeable back-strap pieces to adjust fit."

It has the amazing pivoting trigger as well as adjustable sights and 3-8 round magazines. It is Stainless Steel which has had a Black, Duracoat coating placed at the factory for extra protection for the firearm. This weapon easily handles the most powerful .357 Magnum loads and by changing to the lighter power, included recoil spring, will fire virtually recoil-less .38 Special ammunition. Its weight lessens the feel of the recoil impulse and allows a quick return to the target for follow up shots. As the logo states....it leaves ""Nothing Left to Envy"".This firearm has had one box of factory ammo fired through it, because I HAD to fire it. It is AMAZING. It comes in its original Coonan Arms Zippered Compartmentalized case with lock, oil, instructions and all the other amenities that accompany a new Coonan Classic Firearm.
