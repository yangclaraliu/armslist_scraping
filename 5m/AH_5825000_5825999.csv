This rifle comes with a Redfield 6-18 x44 (two years old), base and scope rings, standard SPS stock with camo paint job, Knox Industries BlackHawk tactical free floating aluminum pillar bedded stock, bi pod, and hard case.    This rifle was used for hunting and only has about 500 rounds down the tube.  It has recently been cleaned for copper fouling.  
 
 Remington Model 700 SPS
.308 Winchester (7.62x51 NATO)
Bolt action
24 inch barrel
1-10 twist rate (stabilizes the heaviest .30 cal bullets)
Standard Adjustable Remington X-mark pro trigger (updated version)
 
Specific to this weapon:
 This rifle loves the 165 gr – 168 gr bullet range, and it has no problem stabilizing bullets up to the 200 gr range(that’s the heaviest I’ve personally shot out of this .308).  Prior to my hand loads, I exclusively shot Hornady 165gr SST Superformance ammo.  The Hornady SST bullets have taken multiple elk, deer, and varmints over the last few years.
 
This rifle has been cleaned and well maintained over the years.  Attached are photos of the rifle and a recent test on some ammo.  On a regular basis, this weapon shoots a ragged hole at 100 yards and is highly effective out to 600 yards. 
 
About the .308 and the Remington Model 700:
If you’re new to the .30 cal range of bullets, the .308 is an awesome rifle to start with.  If you’re new to the Remington Model 700, again, this is an awesome rifle (I have two of them).  Straight out of the box, all of my Model 700s have shot 1 MOA or better.  Ammo for the .308 WIN is readily available and basically can be found in every store that sells ammo.  This caliber rifle has more than enough power to hunt anything in SC, and a vast majority of game across the USA.  If you’re a reloader, the .308 is forgiving on your pocket and allows you to shoot on a regular basis for a fraction of the cost (of factory ammo).  I shoot on a regular basis at 600 yards with the .308 Winchester (another rifle that I have) and I’ve had nothing but success with sub MOA accuracy. 
 
Price / Location / Contact Info:
I’m asking for $600, cash only.  I am open for negotiations.

$700 cash or a little better on trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax and I'm sure it's a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price.

$1,400 cash or might trade.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with several extra mags, folding brace and ammo.  Lots of interest and some nice trade offers so far, but holding out a bit longer for an MPX package.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $30 more.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

The date code on the barrel indicates that the rifle was manufactured in October 1974. This rifle has been outfitted with a Burris Fullfield 4X scope, Redfield scope mount and rings, Burris lens caps, a Pachmayr recoil pad, and a military-style adjustable leather sling with quick-detach swivels. The original iron sights have been removed.
The monte carlo walnut stock has good grain and is nicely finished. The bluing is in decent condition with the usual wear areas here and there. There is no rust or pitting anywhere. This rifle is a real shooter. The action has been glas-bedded, the barrel free-floated, and the trigger adjusted to a light, crisp pull. I have developed a couple of hand loads for this rifle that will consistently group 5 shots at or near 1"" at 100 yards. (I still have the targets to prove it.)
I have not hunted with this rifle in over 25 years. It has always been very well maintained. I simply have no practical use for it anymore, so it's time to let go of it. I am asking $475 for everything described above.
If you're into hand loading, I have a set of Hornady 30-06 dies, a full box (100 ea) of Sierra 150 gr spitzer bullets, about a pound of IMR-4064 powder, about a pound of Hodgdon H-414 powder, a custom-made bullet-seating depth gauge, a couple of 50-round plastic ammo boxes, 155 pieces of brass that have been fully prepped (cleaned, full-length sized, trimmed, chamfered, primer pockets uniformed, etc) and are ready for priming and loading. Add an additional $100 for all this reloading stuff. Or, it can be pieced out as desired.
