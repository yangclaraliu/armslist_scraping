$1,050 in cash or better in trade value.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, but I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18""
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.  
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX."

Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18""
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.

Springfield SOCOM 16 or Scout 18""
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $30 more.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

$550 firm in cash.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.  I can add??
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Springfield SOCOM 16 or Scout 18""
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

It is a 1943 SAKO manufacture on a hex receiver with a wartime production stock (This is not a Civil Guard rifle). It is a formerly issued rifle but in good condition. Stock has dings all over but no wood chunks missing or anything. Bluing is worn but no rust and the bore is still pretty good. Very smooth bolt action. Cosmoline has been cleaned. I actually have not personally shot the rifle yet as I acquired it recently but don't have the convenience to find a place to shoot surplus ammo (steel core). I believe I am the second owner of this rifle since it was imported. This rifle is not from the recent Classic Firearms imports. Parts have non matching numbers, as common with the vast majority of M39's (They were assembled from mixed parts that were force matched).
I really like the rifle but will part with it since I can't shoot it as often as I originally hoped to...at least before I get to take it out shooting and decide to keep it :) If you see it here, it's still available.
 
Also comes with:
Original military sling
Around 200 rounds of various surplus ammo (Appears to be a mix of Bulgarian varieties)
10 stripper clips (New production Chinese, but they work fine)
5 dummy rounds for training/dry firing.
I will also throw in a free 52"" shotgun soft case.
 
$320 cash only. No trades. I cannot ship. Price is firm. Lower offers will be ignored as I am in no rush to sell this rifle.
 
I can meet weekday evenings around Saint Paul after 6pm. Weekends anytime before noon or by appointment. Serious buyers only. Please communicate.

I put in a 20 pound steel guide rod to replace the 17 pound plastic guide rod Greatly reducing the recoil allowing quicker follow up shots. I also replaced the dreadful stock trigger with an apex tactical trigger reducing the trigger pull distance by 50%. I also replaced all the stock springs with the apex tactical enhanced spring kit that reduces the trigger pull from 8 pounds to 4.5 pounds . I also replaced the take down slide with an extended stainless steel take down slide. Ill include 3 mags and a holster. As far as ammo I have 350 rounds of fmj and 17 rounds of R.I.P ammo (pretty expensive stuff a little over 2 dollars a round) and 25 rounds of random hollow points. with the upgrades and accessories and ammo I'm asking 400.

$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, probably a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price.  Lots of trade offers so far, but nothing yet I would rather have over the Henry, sorry if I'm picky.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.  Looking for several AR stripped lowers or would trade for 2,500rds. of Federal 5.56.

The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag.

All laws will be followed, please text 508413zero229.  Additional Pictures available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-NxHMW-p3Z6M2Fnc0RYWFktUjg Little history of the RGUN snipers:     Tuco (C0-Gun Boards Owner) heard of the rifles for sale in the Ukraine 2 to 3 years before they went on sale with RGUNS. He understood no one wanted to import them at that time as they felt there was not enough demand for them at the $800 level. When he went to find them he discovered RGUNS had bought them and imported them. He knows the rifles and knows they are real.     They were originally WWII used sniper rifles and later used by the police. After service with the police they were returned to the military and refurbished and stored until RGUNS bought them. Some will say that the story that they were police rifles is just a story made up by those trying to sell them, but as it adds no value to the rifle to have been used by the police, it it generally believed to be true.     Many of the PU snipers on the market (not RGUN snipers) are put together rifles . Century did some of that by buying original PU parts and rifles without scopes on them and putting them together. They carry the Century import mark.     SAMCO sold Yugo PU snipers without the mounts and scopes. Many people bought these and added original PU scopes and mounts. The problem with them is, they were PU snipers sent to Yugoslavia by the Soviets with many M44's and other Mosins. Yugoslavia never used Mosins post war as they were using 8mm. They removed the optics and used them on their rifles until they started producing their own optics. That is why the SAMCO PU snipers have no optics on them. So they are a ""put together by someone here in the US"" sniper. Not an arsenal rifle. They carry the SAMCO import marks.     RGUNS are the only ""known"" PU snipers for sale that can be confirmed where they came from. That comfirmation also came from someone other than RGUNS. Yes they are all in a different state of re-refurbishment. Some are rifles that obviously had damage during the war and parts were replaced, and other are almost entirely original. But all the work was done by the arsenals, not a ""civilian"". They carry the RGUNS stamp on the top of the receiver in a very small font, and RGUNS has never done that with their other imports. They have used a slightly larger font or a very large font and always on the side of the receivers of the other M91/30's (non snipers) that they imported. This is how you can tell if someone took a RGUNS imported M91/30 and turned it into a fake PU sniper. The import marks (which you are not allowed to alter) will be under the mount on on the side of a fake. So the stamp on the top is the ""seal of approval"" that these rifles are the ""real deal"". ;)    RGUNS Sniper rifles are ""WWII examples of PU sniper rifles that were arsenal refurbished post-war""  Some had parts interchanged with other PU snipers at the time of refurbishment. Others did not. Depended on the amount of repair the rifle needed at the time of refurbishment. Most if not all had swapped bolts and butt plates (from other PU snipers) during refurbishment. The bolt and butt plate was re-stamped after refurbishment so it is impossible to know if they are original to the rifle or not. (probably not).     They went to some trouble to make sure the barrel/receiver, stock, scope mount /base, and scope all stayed together on the same rifle if possible. To do this they electro penciled the scope mounts with 1. Scope number and 2. Rifle serial number. This allowed them to put the barrel/receiver back with the same mount and same scope.     They marked the serial number in the barrel channel on the stock. This would allow them to put the stock back with the barrel and receiver. Some have penciled in serial numbers partly shellacked over which shows the pencil marks were on “before” the shellac process.     All this makes sense as they would not have to ""re fit"" all these parts once everything was re-blued. It would all then fit with no adjustments. This is why they think they were electro penciled on the mount and marked in the barrel channel of the stock. If not, the stocks would show large gaps in some area as they were refitted. They eliminated this problem buy numbering the parts to keep everything together.     However, probably some had to have new scopes, some new stocks and so on. Those rifles that needed new stock and had them put on will not show serial numbers in the barrel channel.

$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, probably a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so firm on price.  Lots of trade offers so far, but none I would rather have yet over the Henry, so sorry if I'm picky, I don't really need anything right now.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.  Could use several stripped AR lowers and would trade for 2,500rds. of Federal 5.56.

I have the optics rail included plus 8 magazines! These magazines are $25.00 Each so you are looking at another $150 Value in extra magazines.
This is truly an amazing gun to shoot, but I haven’t shot this gun in almost a year and there are other pending projects out there.  For the record, this gun has about a 3 lb. trigger pull.  It's so clean and crisp you will love it! 
This gun was purchased at Bass Pro Shops in 2015 for right at $660.00 plus tax. I am asking $700 for the gun with the upgraded trigger and 6 additional magazines. I don’t have to sell this so I will likely sit on it for a while if I don’t get my asking price."
