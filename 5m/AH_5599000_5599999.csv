I purchased this pistol new from Arzen Arms back in December.Hoping to make a trade for a S&W M&P 9mm (full-size or longslide ""Pro"") possibly with cash on my end. Would also consider a CZ P-09 or Canik TP9SF. Maybe an SKS or Mossberg MVP in .223. Just looking for another range toy!Bloomington area. Thanks!"

These pistols are extremely hard to find because no one is making them anymore. Specials Weapons hasn’t been in business for years. The Mags are modified grease gun mags. The Pistol comes with 7 mags, the mags are marked HK so you can keep track of them and remember they match this weapon. Each mag has been modified and tuned individually to match this specific weapon. Most of these pistols are great weapons but have feeding/chambering problems due to the mags. This weapon is not the case. All the Mags work and work well.
You are more than welcome to check anything you want upon meeting.
The Weapon does has some light marks on the upper rail section where a claw mount was installed. If you were to install a claw mount it would cover these marks."

This one is all steel in inexpensive to shoot 9mm caliber pistol along with a conversion kit for the hard hitting 40S&W. These unique high quality guns accept factory conversion kits from .22 to .45 caliber. (Consult EAA Corp for for all the details.)This is one of the EAA Witness models made by Tanfoglio in Italy. Some newer EAA models are made in Turkey and are sometimes thought to be less desirable.SIGHTS: Both slides have been reworked with the exceptionally bright LPA adjustable fiber optic sights in the rear. Front sights are Trijicon tritium #8 front sight for Sig pistols (AmeriGlo P/N SG-212-220-GR). The front sight was custom installed, as these guns normally have fixed sights. This sight combination gives exceptional low light performance and is completely adjustable to give you the sight picture you desire. Note: Street value of these sights alone is close to $300, not to mention the cost of machining and installation. If you’re into Tanfoglio pistols and ever cursed at the performance of your sights, then you really need to take close look at this gun! CALIBER:40S&W and 9mm. Just switch slides to go with either caliber — with practice this takes about 10 seconds!INCLUDES:2x40 S&W magazines, complete 40S&W conversion kit (slide, barrel, and a second guide rod & spring), and 2x9mm magazines.CONDITION:Very Good++ to excellent condition: Bore on both barrels are clean and shiny.

The Prvi Partizan 75 grain match ammunition uses an open-tip-match bullet very similar in configuration to Hornady’s 75 grain BTHP bullet used in Hornady’s TAP line of ammunition and in Black Hills’ 75 grain MHP line of ammunition. The Prvi Partizan (PPU) bullet has a nominal length that runs approximately 0.010” – 0.015” shorter than the Hornady bullet. The PPU 75 grain bullet does not have a cannelure, but the case mouth on this load does have a slight collet crimp on it which puts a slight crease in the bullet.The PPU 75 grain match load uses Boxer primed brass cases and is charged with “ball” powder. Neither the primer nor the case mouth have sealant and the primer is not crimped. Previous chronographing of this load through multiple barrel lengths shows it to run an average of 127 fps slower than the Black Hills 75 grain MHP load. Its a cheaper almost equivalent, works great in 1:7.7” or 1:7 barrels. It averaged 0.66” groupings fresh cold barrel, 0.92”warm barrel, and 1.14” hot barrel at 2547fps at 100 yards.

This is, in my humble opinion, the best full sized 9mm striker pistol on the market. For years FNH, of Belgium, has supplied our military, as well as many others with Superior Firearms. Made in USA, this pistol has factory night sights, 3x17 rd mags, two back straps, hard case, cable lock and all original paperwork. This pistol was purchased new, by me...in 2014. She has gobbled 1,000 RDS with ONE ""malfunction"" on the first round of the last magazine, she did not return to full battery. Upon inspection, it was simply a poor reload that was responsible. Immaculately kept. FNH recently had lowered their prices on the all black models by $100. Most dealers, however, were already selling for below the older MSRP of around $679 so their prices did not reflect the change. Needless to say, because the two-tone version had not sold quite as many, its price has held-up. Currently, one BIG retailer, offers the all black model, with trijicon factory niht sights , with or without MS, for $629.00. The two tone models are going for around $50 more, if you can find someone that has them in stock and not just on their website. I am aware that these pistols are available online elsewhere, and I have a fair price in mind, however, low ball offers will be respectfully set aside for a VERY RAINY DAY.  Please, serious inquiries only!!! Face to face transactions only. Must have current NM DL or ID.  WILL CONSIDER ALL OFFERS...Trades are possible for other quality 9mm or .40 caliber pistols, Mossberg 500 or 590 marine models, or Rem 870 marine setups. Throw me an offer! Thank you in advance. Pictures available upon request."

The only other manufacturer that may have been better with Nickel or Blue finishes on their revolvers was Colt, with their Royal Blue or Nickel on their snake revolvers. This vintage S&W has the desired “3T’s (Target Hammer, Target Grips, and Target Hammer), a “Pinned” barrel, and a “Recessed” Counterbored Cylinder (S&W stopped the “Pinned” barrels and “Recessed” Cylinders for their revolvers in 1982). Just as important, this is a #’s matching revolver (same production codes on the frame and the yoke/crane) and NO refinishing codes. Also, this was made without MIM’d Parts and without the internal lock that S&W aficionados can’t stand. Imagine a time with manufacturers could make handguns/revolvers without politicians looking over their shoulders and demanding things that most consumers don’t want!

It will come with a nice Simmons pistol scope that is a 2x20 I believe, I've never had it zeroed as I'm not a huge fan of pistol scopes but it's a nice quality scope for someone who digs them, just not for me lol. Also it will come with a few boxes of ammo, there is roughly 150 rounds maybee 200, I will have to check for the exact count. Also will come with once fired brass as well, probably a little over 50 pieces. Only selling because I'm looking to free up funds to purchase a Steyr AUG, otherwise I would be keeping it, it's a really nice piece and one of the nicest revolvers I've owned. Even with 300 grain full power loads it's not a complete killer on the hands, sure you know it's a 44 mag lol but it's bearable. Probably would help getting a nice hogue grip but I like the classy looks of the wood grips. Gun is mint no scratches or gouges. All laws will be followed no exceptions!
