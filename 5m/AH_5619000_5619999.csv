This ruggedly built magnifier transforms your EOTech Holographic Weapon Sight into a lethal medium range optic at the flip of a finger. The G33 features a revolutionary Switch to Side mount that keeps the magnifier in place with a rock solid detent and when a sudden CQB situation arises, with the flip of a hand, the detent will disengage and re-engage when the magnifier locks into place out of the line of sight. With an updated appearance and the same top end quality you expect from EOTech, the G33 is the ultimate red dot and holographic sight magnifier. It offers ample eye relief, features finger adjustable windage and elevation adjustments, wider field of view, adjustable diopter for precision focus and is more compact and light weight than the G23 magnifier. The G33 works with all EOTech units and includes a 7mm riser to accommodate raised sights.
