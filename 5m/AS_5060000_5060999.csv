I am not the original owner of the pistol. Like most Baers, the finish was not very good when I got it. I sent it off to Ryan at Aquilla Custom Gun Works for some work. Ryan has extensive experience with 1911s and re-finishing, having worked at Ionbond. Here's what was done: Front cocking serrations taken off, Slide stop nub cut flush and frame countersunk, Spare Ed Brown extractor fit and re-finished as well (which will be included), 10-8 rear sight installed and a Novak front tritium sight with a white ring. Finish is matte Ionbond DLC. The gun is tight, but was never impossible to rack when I received it as you often hear regarding Baers. It's got a very tight slide to frame fit and a very tight bushing that requires a wrench to turn. The gun is very accurate, more accurate than me. The only flaw is there is a very slight scratch on the frame that I have tried to capture in a photo. It's hard to photograph as it is very slight. The round count is unknown, but I have put less than 500 rounds through it, and less than 300 since the refinish work 1.5 years ago. Included will be 2 Baer mags and a Chip Mccormick mag, the spare extractor, the original box and certificate. Asking $1,600, would prefer to meet at a local shop for a transfer.  I will ship, but those costs will be extra."

The Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment! I watched a 22 minute thorough review on this firearm, on YouTube by hickok45, and this is definitely a quality and dependable gun to have, wihtout breaking the bank! It has similar features to the Glock, including the easy and & fast way to field strip it, and has similar weight and dimensions to other Glocks, like the width and weight of the Glock 26, and the overall height that is similar to the Glock 19. ****************There have been a few upgrades made to these guns, which include FULLY POLISHED BARRELS, WHITE LETTERING and ADDITIONAL STIPPLING! Stippling was added to the sides of the frame, at the thumb areas, as well as to pinky extensions on all magazines! These custom touches make the guns look GREAT and the stippling helps substantially with gun control!***************  Asking $350 each (obo) but I will make you a better deal if you buy both, so make me a fair offer!"

This Sig originally came new from their N.H. factory as a ""dehorned"" or “Sig Anti Snag” (SAS) carry firearm, and it has been referred to as The Cadillac of Carry guns.  It has a stainless slide with beautiful “P226 SAS” engraved into the slide. It is a German metal frame. Since acquiring this P226, I have sent it to the Sig Pro Custom Shop and had the stainless slide “bead blasted” to a perfect and like new finish. I then had all internal springs inspected and replaced, then converted from a DAK to a DA/SA action which included adding a de-cocker safety lever, upgraded the standard trigger to a SRT trigger function, put brand new OEM Genuine Sig Rosewood grips with stainless screws, bright Siglite night sights, and also further enhanced the optics with a BRAND NEW Lasermax Guide Rod Red laser kit, which is the only NATO approved guide rod laser out there, MSRP for this laser alone is $399.00. It has NOT been fired since it came back from the Sig Custom Pro shop. Prior to that, it still maintains a low round count. In my personal opinion, this Sig is just an awesome gun, not only with its high accuracy and smooth as silk shooting capabilities, but it is also a real gem to look at. It is truly my choice of Carry. I have included before (B/W) actual picture and after (red/stainless) upgrade pictures of my Sig. 
 I am asking $1150.00, or Best Reasonable Offer. Must present a current government issued ID such as a drivers license, or as preferred a “Canceled/Carry Weapon Permit”.
WTT- Would like to trade preferably for a Sig Sauer Series P228 EQUINOX, chambered in .40 S&W/357 or would consider a Sig Sauer Series P226 EQUINOX, chambered in .40 S7W/ 357.
  Please Support and Respect both our Military Troops and Law Enforcement Personnel.   Thanks for Looking."

This Sig originally came new from their N.H. factory as a ""dehorned"" or “Sig Anti Snag” (SAS) carry firearm, and it has been referred to as The Cadillac of Carry guns.  It has a stainless slide with beautiful “P226 SAS” engraved into the slide. It is a German metal frame. Since acquiring this P226, I have sent it to the Sig Pro Custom Shop and had the stainless slide “bead blasted” to a perfect and like new finish. I then had all internal springs inspected and replaced, then converted from a DAK to a DA/SA action which included adding a de-cocker safety lever, upgraded the standard trigger to a SRT trigger function, put brand new OEM Genuine Sig Rosewood grips with stainless screws, bright Siglite night sights, and also further enhanced the optics with a BRAND NEW Lasermax Guide Rod Red laser kit, which is the only NATO approved guide rod laser out there, MSRP for this laser alone is $399.00. It has NOT been fired since it came back from the Sig Custom Pro shop. Prior to that, it still maintains a low round count. In my personal opinion, this Sig is just an awesome gun, not only with its high accuracy and smooth as silk shooting capabilities, but it is also a real gem to look at. It is truly my choice of Carry. I have included before (B/W) actual picture and after (red/stainless) upgrade pictures of my Sig. 
 I am asking $1150.00, or Best Reasonable Offer. Must present a current government issued ID such as a drivers license, or as preferred a “Canceled/Carry Weapon Permit”.
WTT- Would like to trade preferably for a Sig Sauer Series P228 EQUINOX, chambered in .40 S&W/357 or would consider a Sig Sauer Series P226 EQUINOX, chambered in .40 S7W/ 357.  Proud to be a US Army Veteran. Please Support and Respect both our Military Troops and Law Enforcement Personnel.  
Thanks for Looking."

It features many special features that I chose specifically for this rifle. It features a matched Yankee Hill upper, lower, and 14.7"" diamond fluted barrel with a pinned and welded phantom muzzle break. The barrel has a 1:7"" twist rate and a free-float spectre length handguard with a spectre gas block and black gas tube. The rifle has a Norgon ambidextrous mag release, Seekins Precision bolt release and mag release, Ergo Suregrip Tactical Deluxe, Magpul ASAP plate, and Ace Ltd. adjustable M4 SOCOM stock. It also has a FailZero nickel boron BCG, Rainier Arms Raptor (by AXTS) charging handle, BAD Ambi-Safety Selector, ""Molon Labe"" dust cover (with a black spring) YHM EZ-Pull takedown pins, Spike's Tactical heavy buffer, and an LWRCI single stage combat trigger with a 5.5 lb. pull. The forend features a Magpul rail sling attachment point, Magpul ladder rail covers, and a CQD aluminum vertical grip with a cutout for a pressure switch. The optic is a Burris MTAC 1.5-6x scope with an illuminated reticle on a Burris PEPR QD base. Even the springs on this rifle are quality made in America springs. I did not skimp in any way, shape, or form on this build. I had NEVER planned on selling this rifle, but I found a girl that I love more than this rifle and I need the money to help pay for an engagement ring. The rifle has a couple dings on it, but it still has less than one hundred rounds fired out of it. This rifle is still not even close to being out of its break-in period. I'm including five mags, two hundred rounds of assorted ammo, lock, and a hard case. Price is firm at $3,000. I realize that the asking price is high, but this rifle is worth $3,500. I am not interested in trades at this time. There's apparently a glitch in the Armslist listing section because this rifle is listing as a shotgun, when it is obviously not. Thanks for looking."
