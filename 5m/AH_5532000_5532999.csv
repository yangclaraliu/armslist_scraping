It was an impulse buy that I'm not proud of, but it's better than buying drugs or E-cigs. I've mounted a Vortex 4-16x44mm riflescope in a 30mm Larue SPR-E mount and have had success with it out to ~700 so far. The scope came from a different rifle, hence the paint and you can easily strip it if desired and it won't affect the lifetime Vortex warranty either. The bipod is a Tango Down ACB-4 which is a little shoddy at times staying locked, but it works and has been with it since I got it so it would be wrong to separate them after all they've been through. It'll also come with a matching tan vertical grip that screws into the chassis itself (not pictured). Underneath the tan kydex handguard is a full length picatinny rail if you want to mount your own grip and there are two sections of rail at the 3:00 and 9:00 position as well. Internally, I've put in a Fulton Armory hammer and a Sadlak national match spring guide, everything else is factory to my knowledge. If you just want the rifle without the optics or just want the scope mount without the glass or any other combination, just let me know and we can work something out, thanks for lookin'! Also, I've got a bunch of 147gr reloads from Freedom Munitions if you need some ammunition."

I had used it for training and have since moved on to only using my .223 real Ar-15. This gun is very accurate within 50 yards and can shoot out to 100 yards. i had bought the gun last Fall for around $250 mainly to practice gun manipulation and reloads. the gun has safe, semi-auto, and full-auto. The gun shoots around 16 rounds per second and i have everything needed to get you started training or playing airsoft. The Gun is a Full Metal which nice because it ads a lot of durability to the gun if you were to drop it or rough it up. I use .25-.3 grain bbs and it handles the wind well. The gun does not have the orange tip but instead a silincer to make it look more realistic.  If you have any question or want to see pictures just feel free to message me. You are more than welcome to shoot it as well before you buy."

980,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5532980,"For Sale/Trade:  Mauser 98K (BCD 4 code, Sauer)","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 775,"Listed On: Sunday, June 5, 2016",Rifles,Mauser                                                                                ,8mm Mauser                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"For Sale: BCD 4 code Mauser 98K rifle assembled by JP Sauer & Sohn. I believe the block to be an N or V, but you can judge for yourself based on the photos. I also have an original sling and ASW 42 wood gripped bayonet with scabbard and frog that all match the rifle nicely that I will offer to the buyer at prices below retail. The sling shown in photos is a repro and not is included.Condition: Rifle is not import marked. All serial numbered parts that are on the rifle are matching with the exception of the firing pin which bears a 3443 serial and 280 proof mark. The triggerguard is an unnumbered stamped BYF / 135 proof marked piece with a serial numbered milled floorplate which is correct for this rifle. The rifle had an earlier milled H style upper band installed when I originally purchased it and I have since replaced it with a stamped band. The band matches well, but has an extra hole on the left side as it is likely off of an Israeli rifle. I had planned to locate a more correct replacement stamped and welded band without any markings or serial numbers, but have not done so at this time (there is a seller on eBay that sells unmarked replacement bands for $39 plus shipping). Other noteable items are a missing cleaning rod and bayonet lug pin, a thin delamination crack in the tang area of the stock, and the fact that the handguard has been bedded to the barrel with clear epoxy. The crack is a common issue with the laminated 98K stocks and it does not penetrate down into the wrist. It should be easily repairable if needed. I will just leave that decision up to the next owner. There does not appear to be any setback at the recoil lug so the rifle should be in fireable condition as-is. In regards to the handguard, it's underside has been partially coated with clear epoxy and bedded to the barrel. I am assuming that this was done due to the handguard previously being loose. This issue isn't noticeable until the handguard is removed. Both the stock and the handguard are serial number matching to the rifle and there is a faint Heer stamp on the stock. Buttplate is unmarked and bears a JVD ink stamp on the preservative paint coating the interior. Bore does not exhibit much wear. It is clean and shiney, but does have a couple areas of pitting, mainly in the throat area of the barrel.All matching, non-import marked BCD 4 code Sauer rifles are bringing $1400-$1500+ so I have tried my best to price the rifle accordingly based on condition noted above.For additional photos, please copy and paste the following address into your browser: http://imgur.com/a/179YYCall or text REDACTED for more information."

985,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5532985,For Sale/Trade:  25-45 Sharps AR-15 custom build,"Skiatook, Tulsa, Oklahoma","$ 1,300","Listed On: Tuesday, May 31, 2016",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This is a custom AR15 chambered in 25-45 Sharps. It comes with everything on the list below, plus a soft tactical case with enough pockets to carry it all. The cartridge is the same as a .223 only necked up to fit a 25 cal. round, therefore you can use your existing .223/5.56 magazines, and it makes it legal to hunt with even in those states that don’t allow a .223.
For those not familiar with this cartridge, here you go: The 25-45 SHARPS cartridge was developed by SRC to maximize the performance of the Modern Sporting Rifle (MSR) platform. With a greater muzzle velocity and harder hitting 70 87 and 100 grain bullets, it’s performance surpasses the .223 REM/5.56 NATO. The 25-45 SHARPS is compatible with existing .223/5.56 bolt carrier groups and magazines available for the MSR platform. 
 I have almost $1600 in this whole package, I will take $1300 for it.  Call or text me at REDACTED if interested.  May do a partial trade on a full size XDm 9mm or 45.  Thanks.
