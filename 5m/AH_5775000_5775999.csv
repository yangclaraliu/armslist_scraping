The MK116 is designed for a multitude of uses and retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with varying types of ammunition. The PWS Long Stroke Piston  The PWS long-stroke piston system combines the agility of the AR-15 with the reliability of the AK-47 into a sleek and efficient design.  Adjustable Gas Block  PWS three position adjustable gas block restricts gasses rather than venting them from the side. This allows the unused gas to exit from the front of the gun resulting in a quieter operation.  Position 1 is normal operation with standard and some military ammunition. Position 2 is for suppressed use with hotter loads such as a military ammunition. Position 3 is for suppressed use when running standard ammunition.    Smooth Recoil Impulse  A detachable floating piston head is attached to the operating rod which is securely attached to the carrier. With only one moving assembly, the PWS long-stroke piston system offers a lighter recoil impulse while at the same time providing increased longevity and durability.  FNC Life HD Barrels  Utilizing only the highest quality 416R stainless steel barrel blanks, MK1 barrels are turned in house then lithium embedded salt nitro-carburized treated (FNC Life HD) for hardness and corrosion resistance.  Twist & Chamber  Button rifled barrels feature a 1:8 twist, which accommodates 55 grain through 75 grain bullets with a high degree of accuracy. Chambered in .223 Wylde, MK1 barrels accept both 5.56 Nato and .223 Remington without sacrificing accuracy.  Profile  PWS engineers designed a barrel profile that reduces weight without decreasing accuracy.  Bolt Carrier Group  PWS bolt carrier groups are machined from tool steel at strict tolerances, then FNC Life HD coated for durability and to reduce fricition.  Mass  PWS engineers increased carrier mass to extend dwell time and delay unlock. As a resut the PWS bolt carrier group allows chamber pressure to be greatly reduced for easier extraction.  Minimized Contact Points  Gaps and channels between skid pads allow for fewer points of contact. This results in less fricition and keeps debrise from interfering with function.  Bolt  The PWS bolt system is optimized for the .223 wylde chamber and features a spring assist for ease of assembly.  Free-Floating Handguards  PWS engineers designed a handguard which is ergonomic as well as durable. Featuring the KeyMod interface, the Mod1-P series handguard eliminates unnecessary weight and allows for a wide range of accessory placement.  Picatinny Top Rail  Extruded and then machined from aircraft grade 6061 aluminum, every handguard comes standard with a full-length Picatinny top rail.  QD Attachments  Integral sling swivel attachment points round out the front and back of the handguard.  KeyMod  The KeyMod Interface System was developed for multiple accessory combatibility without the need for Picatinny rails surrounding your handguard. This improved design enhanced the rail's comfort and functionality without sacrificing strength and durability.  Upper & Lower Forgings  Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is as light as possible, mil-spec 7075 aluminum forging s are used for the upper and lower receivers. Each upper and lower are meticulously CNC-machined for perfect fit and function.  Coating  After machining and blasting, all aluminum parts are Hardcoat Annodized at Type III Mil-Spec, for corrosion and wear resistance.  Bravo Company Furniture  All PWS rifles ship with durable Bravo Company furniture.  Buffer  PWS engineers were able to pack a plethora of features into the PWS buffer tube.  Ratchet Locking Castle Nut & End Plate  The unique ratchet lock design requries no staking and integrates a QD sling mount into the end plate.  Carrier Tilt  Features a lip that extends into the receiver to support the back of the carrier to compensate for carrier tilt.  QD Attachments  Unlike aftermarket items, PWS EBT QD attachments are machined directly into the 4140 steel for durability and weight savings.  Debris  This impact extruded 7075 aluminum mil spec buffer tube features a fluted tube and enlarged drain holes for debris cleaning.  H2 Steel Body Buffer  Low contact points on the fluted shaft allow debris to fall into channels, while the low friction FNC Life HD coating keeps carbon from sticking to the 4140 steel body. The staked cross pin allows for durability under suppressed use.  Specifications  Weight: 6 lbs 13 oz Overall Length: 33"" Barrel Length: 16.1"" Muzzle Device: FSC 556"

The holster is new, hand cut, hand stitched. The leather is 8-9oz vegetable tanned quality leather. I've made the holster with a sweat shield to keep the slide away from your skin and help in re-holstering. The leather has been sealed with an acrylic coating to prevent sweat from penetrating through the holster and damaging your gun. The leather is thick and durable and should last a lifetime. This particular holster rides high and tight and has no outward slop like other cheap thin holsters that are mass produced. Keep in mind you should be wearing a quality belt to conceal properly. The belt slots easily allow 1 1/2"" wide belts that are 1/4"" thick. The holster conceals extremely well under an untucked shirt. This holster was made with an ""FBI""15-20 degree cant that's perfect for the 3:00 - 4:00 position. The gun ""clicks"" in to the molding perfectly and will not fall out.

Also have the original uncracked triangular handguards and a standard hammer / trigger set to go with it.
Getting a couple questions answered:1. No it is not full auto, I will not help you make it full auto, I am not interested in NFA firearms2. The grenade launcher is 37MM not a 40MM. It is not a DD and doesn't require a tax stamp. See statement 1.3. The TACCON trigger is NOT full auto it is just a positive reset trigger. Look it up on youtube to see one work.4. You have to be a Montana resident with drivers license and a non-felon for me to deal with you. If you can't legally own it don't contact me.5. I don't have any of the flare/gas/smoke rounds for the 37MM. I didn't want to pay the hazmat shipping to buy any at the moment.6. I do get drivers license number and cell phone number when doing personal gun deals. Saves heartburn all the way around."

If you are an H & K fan you know how these guns perform. This is the decocker model safety system, really nice for locked and loaded, safe and makes your 1st shot in double action with one in the chamber if you like to carry that way. Shoots smooth and soft for a 40 cal. The weight and balance make it very accurate and easy to get back on target. Great range or nightstand gun with the new sights. Maybe a duty gun for LE use. I got this from a guy who had sent it back to HK for a complete overhaul and cleaning. Had the Tritium night sights professionally installed and all springs and internals have been serviced/replaced. The gun will come with 3 mags and the picture is accurate, also the paperwork for the job at HK. Not a new gun, the date code puts it at 1995 manufacture date, but mechanically it is brand new. Comparables go for over $700 used with thousands of rounds through them. This one has less than 200 on the new internals. Three mags included (13 rounds each) and a generic hard case. If you are looking for a reliable great performer, this one won't win any beauty contests, some scratches etc, but it is top notch when it counts. FTF public meet only with Ohio ID. CCW here and prefer the same. Thanks for looking."

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull.
