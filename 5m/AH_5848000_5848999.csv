Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $30 more.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

I also have a decent amount of either FMJ or Defensive carry ammo for sale at an additional cost. This is used and does have carry wear, but is still a beautiful gun.  Mainly looking for cash, so not really looking for trades on this, but may consider some if they interest me. Would consider a 4 or 6 inch 38/357 mag revolvers. Rugers, Smiths, etc. May consider partial trade for NAA mini revolvers. Also would take very partial trade for Stripped Metal Ar lowers. Most trades will need boot on your end, but for the right deal i may consider it on my end. No 40s, BPs, 22s, etc unless heavily in my favor."
