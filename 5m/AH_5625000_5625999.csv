I have since upgraded my carry weapon to a higher caliber, and just sold my rifle that shoots the 308's. I do not need this ammo anymore. Most of the ammo is new or about one year old. Some of the ammo is military surplus. All are in ammo cans, but the ammo cans are not for sale. I repeat the ammo cans are not for sale. My suggestion is to come over and look at what I have for sale. Buy them all or buy what you need. I am listing a price, but that price is not the actual price. You may only want a few boxes or so. I am asking you to offer me a fair price for both parties. I obviously spent more money on the ammunition due to the political climate and demand. You are obviously looking for ammo at a cheap cost. Please just don't low ball for the sake of low balling. I'll just send you out the door. I also have PMAGS for sale that were from my SIG716. These mags have not been used. I'm asking for $20 each mag. Please email me for additional information or set up a meeting."

Defending yourself, your family, and your property. Here's your chance to take care of that with one transaction! I'm offering a package that includes an everyday carry (and concealable) pistol, a home defense weapon and a four day defensive handgun training course at one of America's premier firearms resort. I'm offering all this for $1200 or whatever reasonable offer/trade you present. I'll break down the components to justify my asking price. Glock 23, 3rd Gen: this is a beauty and so easy to shoot! Accurate, upgraded, and dependable. Chambered in a .40 S&W, it comes with two 13 round magazines (loaded with HP rounds) with Taran Tactical base plates. It also has a custom stipple job, which is currently covered with a Pachymr sleeve because my wife didn't care for the stippling. This G23 has fiber optic contrasting sights. Finally, it has a Lone Wolfe match grade stainless steel 4.02"" barrel. Low round count. Mossberg 500A Tactical Shotgun: nothing strikes fear in the heart of a burglar like the sound of a racking shotgun! This home defense weapon comes with a pistol grip and 6 position adjustable stock with shell holders. It also has a reflex sight with four modes- red dot, circle, crosshairs, circle with crosshairs- and various brightness. This shotgun comes equipped with a tactical light. It is chambered for 2 3/4 and 3 inch 12 gauge shells. I'll include about 60 rounds so you can head to range immediately. It'll set perfectly next to your bed and will work better than that baseball bat! Low round count. Four Day Defensive Handgun Course: taught at Front Sight Firearms Resort outside of Las Vegas, Nevada, you will learn everything from the basics of your EDC weapon to clearing your house, room to room. Guaranteed that by the time you're done, you'll draw and fire a controlled pair from a concealed holster in (at least) 1.5 seconds. This course retails for $2000 alone! This certificate has no expiration date. So all that for $1200! To break it down, I'm selling the Glock for $800 because of the upgraded barrel, sights, stippling, and base plates.

The conversion mag well is CNC machined steel, and is permanently installed. It incorporates a last-round bolt hold-open feature that is integral to the mag well, rather than relying on a protrusion on the mag follower, so the bolt remains open after the empty mag is withdrawn.
Additional upgrades to this rifle include: a Bulgarian next generation hinged top cover, which has a two-position flip rear sight (peep and notch) that is further back on the top cover than the factory sight for a longer sight radius; an Ultimak M13 railed optic mount that replaces the factory gas tube; and the 16.25"" hammer forged chrome lined barrel has been threaded 1/2"" x 28 RH and a birdcage flash hider installed. Finally, the feed ramp has been recontoured and polished to insure reliability with virtually any magazine or ammunition type. All work was done by Definitive Arms, and the rifle was tested exhaustively before it was returned to me.
The extension of the gas block / front sight combo is factory threaded 24mm RH, and includes a thread protector, so once you obtain the appropriate $200 tax stamp from ATF, the barrel can be cut and crowned at the front face of the threaded extension, and a 24mm RH muzzle device installed, and you'll have a 5.56 Krinkov that's much easier and better looking than converting a 106UR pistol by bolting an aftermarket folding stock to the rear trunion.
The rifle comes as pictured, other than the safety lever (it will come with the factory safety lever, and not the Krebs Custom lever shown.) It has a Magpul AK MOE pistol grip, and a US made, Arsenal marked polymer folding stock installed, but also comes with the factory triangle side folder. Also included, but not shown, are the factory gas tube with upper handguard, factory pistol grip, one 20 round PMag, and a Manticore Arms 24 mm RH NightBrake compensator, which will fit the threaded front sight base extension once the barrel is cut down (only after acquiring the required tax stamp.)
TERMS: The entire package is priced at $1,650.00, firm, FTF in northwest Hillsborough / west Pasco Counties, or shipped to your FFL. If FTF, buyer must show FL DL and FL CWL, and sign Bill of Sale. NO TRADES."

I acquirred this gun in a trade and the original owner told me he only fired a dozen or so rounds thru it. Looking at the condition that is believable. Since I've owned it I've put probably a dozen rounds thru her and I keep my guns clean. The bbl. is a 99% the bluing about 95% with a few tiny almost indiscernable pit marks. It has zero rust. The cylinder locks up great, the gun is off the shelf tight and the trigger is great, the cylinder release is a little stiff. I just don't see my finances getting me to AK any time soon, and I need the money. I'm asking $850 or best offer, prices for these are all over the place on line, so I'm really not sure what she's worth. Feel free to email me for pictures, but pics don't do it justice it really is a fine example, ecspecially for gun built in the mid 1980's."

Started as a Maverick 88 style receiver from Black Aces Tactical (cross bolt safety is easier to use with a pistol grip then Mossberg OEM style). The kit itself came with a new bolt and firing pin. The rest of the internals are all Mossberg OEM parts and the barrel is of a SPX 18.5"" model with a fiber optic sight that has been converted to function with the new feeding system. Whole gun was inspected and ok'ed by a professional gunsmith. Has only shot less then 100 rounds. This build does not offer the ""SpringBok"" system since it was a parts kit build.  Externally the action tube is a 6 3/4 tube with extended nut with a fitted Magpul M-Lok hand guard. The rail and sight are UTG made, the sight is fully adjustable. The stock is an Ergo adapter with a milspec pistol grip and and commercial tube and butstock with a limbsaver pad. The tube has been bored out to remove the assembly with out complete disassembly of the entire rear unit.  Comes with a converted saiga 5rd magazine with the kits original parts (follower and feed lip clip) and also a used drum mag feed ramp that was pinned to a 10 rounder (not included).  As is the gun fires on every shot chambered, the issue is the current magazine needs more tuning and work. It only works part of the time and malfunctions the rest. Black Aces Tactical Sells there in house own made mags that offer 100% performance and reliability. The action is a tad bit on the heavy side and still needs to be worn in and or lightly polished.  I'm selling this as is with everything you see in the picture plus the feed ramp. I have way too many irons in the fire at the moment and don't feel like investing in the magazines and rounding out the edges. Great working gun just needs the mags to make it run 100%. Asking for $400. Must go through FFL. will ship to your FFL on your dime, buyer is responsible for all fees and I will not part out the gun now or anytime soon.  Not looking for any trades or partial trades."

Comes with 2 ten round factory magazines, case with lock, and backstraps. I have shot about 200-300 rounds through it with no issues (using various factory ammunition). - Cash Only/ No trades please.... unless you have something considerably awesome.- 1,000- FFL dealer ONLY- Buyer pays ALL fees- Meet at Turner's Outdoorsman in Victorville or somewhere else in Victorville/Hesperia area... Ammo Brothers in Ontario is also an option."

I'm selling this because I'm going to move up to a Custom 1911 .45. This is a great pistol for concealed carry. This pistol shoots great. It has a light recoil and takes very little effort to maintain a sight picture while firing. This also has a safety selector switch which i'm a fan of. I have shot 150 rounds through it. I have cleaned it after each use as well as periodic cleaning. Comes w/3 boxes of 9mil home defense rounds. I don't have any more range ammo for this. I've only shot high quality ammo through this. I shoot RAM ammo. I also use Miltech (dry lubricant) instead of CLP when cleaning. It doesn't leave in residue on my clothes when i'm carrying concealed. Let me know if interested.Will not deliver.

With unfailing accuracy, this bolt-action system continues to define a whole new class of long-range precision rifles. The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity. Available in .338 Lapua Magnum, .338 Norma Magnum, .300 Norma Magnum, .300 Winchester Magnum, .308 Winchester, 7mm Remington Magnum, .260 Remington and 6.5 Creedmoor, the precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 20 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended. Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button.
