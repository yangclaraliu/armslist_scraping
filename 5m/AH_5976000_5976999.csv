Legal Manufacturing LLC’s proprietary plating process creates a smooth and uniform surface and increases the hardness of the plated part to over 70 Rockwell hardness.

Also original bolt. I left it like this so it still has smith and Wessons lifetime warranty. Best of both worlds. Because with a fully custom ar there is no warranty. I took off the old rail, flash hider and put a bunch of magpul accessories . In my opinion some of there best parts . Stock , grip , 2 or single point sling. And bigger trigger guard . Also for the comp i put in a Lantac dragon . One of the best for flat shooting. And the rail is BCM BOOTLEG. With a few rail attachments for better grip. This was my 3 gun set up last year . But it's almost time for winter and I need money. So if have any question call me at REDACTED. Please no low balls I've searched on armlist . And this is one he best deals you get everything in the pic and I might negotiate. You pay for your own tranfer I'll meet where u want ."

It is a great rifle, scary accurate. I bought it when I was living in North Dakota for shooting prairie dogs at long range and it consistently shoots .75 MOA with box ammo throughout the bullet weights, the Hornady 140 A-max groups at .5 and I'm sure with hand loads you could cut that in half.    I've shot a prairie dog at 768 yds with it and a badger at 530-ish.  It's only had 124 rounds fired through it and I have the one fired brass to prove it.      The only reason I'm selling it is because I don't shoot long enough ranges up here to justify keeping it and I'm getting into pistol shooting.                   Also have a Nikon laser 1200 rangefinder that I might throw in for a little extra.   Pics available upon request.            I would consider trading for a Glock G34 9mm  or a G40 10mm.Call or text REDACTED for any questions/offers.

This police package came from an estate sale.The revolver is a 1968 model Smith & Wesson Model blued 10-5 that shows ""character"" and wears it with pride! This was the everyday carry weapon for this police officer until his retirement many years ago. Bore and cylinder are clean and everything feels tight. The rear sights and front ramp have white paint lightly dabbed on for the ""old school"" edition of fiber optic sights we have today.The revolver has lots of holster wear and some light freckling in a few spots, but I think it is in better aesthetic condition than I would have expected from a career long everyday use and carry gun. This gun has not been abused, as this is just honest wear from being on the job for many years. There is wear primarily on the inside corners where they rubbed while in the holster, but there is also much evidence externally of it being a true ""on the job"" weapon. Bore and chambers on the cylinder are good and have been well maintained. After all, this officer's life depended on this gun working every time he might have to pull the trigger.The gun came to me with beautiful custom-made dark walnut with target thumb rest grips. I will include them in the sale, but the buyer has their choice of an additional pair of either Smith & Wesson wood grips or rubber Pachmayr Gripper grips. I have attached pics of the gun with the original target grips, as well as pics of both options to help you decide which of the two bonus options you prefer.I had the gun's side plate off and completely cleaned while intact the internals, then oiled them before replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to the accuracy of the gun.The holster is a Jay-Pee Spring Lock Safety Swivel Holster that features a trigger guard click retention button to keep the pistol securely inside the holster until it can easily be removed with a push of the finger as you draw the pistol. It also has space on the belt to hold a dozen .38 Special bullets. The belt is a Bianchi 42 with adjustable sizing and quick connection prongs.This is a really cool police package that will easily take you back in time to when this officer carried his gun with this belt and holster.Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions.Please contact me if you would like to see the belt and holster pic and other pictures I have available."

The add clearly says make CASH or TRADE offer, and that is exactly what I would like, otherwise please do not waste our time. Please do the research and understand the fair market price for a weapon like this. Hello all,I am once again considering the sell of this weapon, simply because I've not used it much due to it's rarity. This is a Definitive Arms AK, orginally produced by Izmash, that was PROFESSIONALY converted to accept any standard AR magazine. This was no slap on conversion, this weapon was redesigned by professional gun smiths, and the work was expensive and high quality. I waited for about a year to get this rifle back. The weapon fires and 5.56/223 catridge and has the following features: MAGPUL Zhokuv foreend and Rifle Dynamics buffer tube, Magpul stock. High Quality DEF ARMS finish (very tough) Last round bolt hold open (You read that right! A feature of the DEF ARMS Upgrade) Battery assist device (part of the DEF ARMS upgrade... you can reload this puppy FAST) High quality steel mag well, along with excellent furnished controls as part of the upgrade18 inch chrome lined barrel (pushes every bit of accuracy out of this platform) Just typing the post makes me realize how much I like this rifle... I am open to trades or cash offers, please let me know what you have or what you will pay! I searched for these and didn't see any in stock, Copper Custom used to have them for 1799. This rifle is unfired short of the Definitive Arms factory testing. This weapon was rare when I lived on the East Coast (where they are made) about a year ago, I can't imagine there are many out here in beautiful Wyoming! Shoot me at email or a text at REDACTED with serious cash or trade offers please!

The switches are built into the vertical grip, so the operator can operate the system without having to break out of position. The LEDs are controlled by a momentary on switch, and the main beam is controlled by both a momentary and a constant on switch.

It has a metal buttplate instead of the plastic found on newrer 1894's. Very nice bore and rifling,very minor bluing wear on the bottom of the receiver and very clean on the inside of the receiver. This is a nice hitting and rarely found round in the model1894's. It uses the 30-30 case and has a bullet that is .321 in diameter. A 165 gr bullet flys at about 2400 fps and a little over 2100 ft lbs of energy.Don't confuse the .32 W.S. (Winchester Special) with the .32-40 they're not the same round.Various vendors carry the ammo, just google 32 Winchester special ammo."
