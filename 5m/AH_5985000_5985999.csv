All are already installed.•Chaos Quad Rail•Chaos H&K Style Sights•JTE Guide rod Kit•JTE Performance Hammer•Bolt Hold Open Lever Kit•Axis Pin Retaining Plate•Extended Bolt On Handle•Gas Piston Performance Puck•Improved Gas Plug Regulator•Magpul AFG-2 Angled Foregrip•Monster Claw Small Break•20 Round Drum•10 Round Magazine (x4)•OEM 5 Round Magazine•Tru Glo Triton Tri Color Red DotThe Carolina Shooter's Supply Conversion Kit #2 has been installed on this gun. This includes the Tapco T6 Collapseable Stock, ATI Scorpion Pistol Grip, Tapco G2 FCG with Pin Retaining Spring, and the Carolina Shooter’s Supply Trigger Guard. You will also get all original take off parts (Butt stock, forend, OEM trigger group, etc) as I do not have any use for them. Also, you will get a barrel shroud (Far right in main pic), an extra JTE Guide Rod, two extra guide rod springs and an extra bolt hold open spring.There is a TON of time and money in this gun by me and the previous owner. The extras alone are close to $900 not including labor. I did the trigger group conversion myself. I researched extensively and took several days doing things so it was done correctly. All holes left over from the conversion have the original pins in them. I took my time drilling/punching them out so they could be reused. I also polished the bottom of the bolt carrier. Since the hammer is a Tapco hammer it is pretty slick and didn’t need any work done to it. This WILL cycle the low brass Walmart stuff.There are less than 500 rounds through this gun total. All mags (Including drum) have been fitted to this gun and run flawlessly BUT some have a thick electrical tape on them in various spots. I *THINK* the previous owner might have taken too much off some of these. The drum, one regular mag and OEM mag do not have anything on them. Even the ProMag Drum has had ZERO feed issues. Which honestly surprises me to tell the truth.There are some minor scratches around gun. There is nothing glaring or ridiculous but definitely not pristine. I am not really sure if any of the Russian AK type guns can ever claim that though. I am open to offers. Cash OR equivalent trade OR trade/cash equivalent.Buyer MUST have a valid MN Handgun Purchase Permit OR Minnesota Conceal Carry Permit AND a valid picture MN ID he/she is willing to allow me to take pictures of. I will also require a generic Firearm Bill of Sale be signed by me and the buyer. I am not an FFL but I believe in CYA. This part is non-negotiable. If you are not comfortable emailing me a pic of your ID and permit to purchase/carry please do not contact me.I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT SHIP THIS. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT ME IF YOU LIVE OUT OF STATE OR ARE TRYING TO RUN THE ""I WILL SEND YOU A CASHIERS CHECK."" SCAM."

Unfortunately my laptop just died and it's something I need for work and school. I have a Kahr CW9 in nice shape but I don't really carry it anymore, comes with the case and a 7rd mag. I'll say right up front though that I'm a bit picky when it comes to electronics, I'm not looking for a high-end gaming PC but I'm not interested in a beat up old netbook either. That being said, I'm looking for something with a Windows OS, windows 7 or newer, and not more than a couple years old. If you would prefer to buy, I will sell for $250, price is firm. FTF in the Winfield/Wellington area preferred but willing to travel as far as the Wichita area for the right deal. Have my CCL and can sign bill of sale if desired. Best way to reach me is by text to REDACTED."

The length of the barrel is only 6"" which could make a nice carry gun. This is a year they still pinned the barrel and recessed the cylinders, so that the rounds are flush. This style of building became to expensive so S&W stopped using this style in 1980. Its in decent shape for its age but does look like it use to be a carry weapon, has some marks on the revolver which can be seen in the pictures but still a beautiful revolver. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YlSfjRN9Hwside note: please don't look up a 2016 27-2 and think the prices should match up, they dont make them like they use too."

I had purchased it to interchange with the heavy 20"" barrel of my coyote gun, but now that I have purchased a complete 16"" carbine, I am selling this unit for a great deal less than I originally paid for it.This is an AR-15 upper receiver assembly with charging handle included, sporting a 16"" barrel and free-floating quad rail. It includes a Yankee Hill Machine Phantom flash hider, plastic flip-up sights with a front fiber optic insert, a charging handle, and a sling swivel adapter. It DOES NOT INCLUDE A BOLT CARRIER GROUP (easily purchaseable online, starting around $80). It also does not include the camouflage rifle case used for a background in the photos. I purchased this upper receiver group off of Gunbroker from a gentleman that was assembling these himself, so I am unsure of the provenance of many of the parts. I can tell you that the flash hider is a YHM Phantom unit, the barrel is marked ""1/7 5.56 NATO"", and the upper receiver has the keyhole forging mark of Cerro Forge, a reputable forging company that also does Colt upper receiver groups. I have fired about 50 rounds through this unit and it performed reliably without stoppages, and the backup sights are zeroed at about 50 yards. Note that this is not a premium upper receiver, but it is fully functional and should make a great building block for a first-time AR-15, a knockaround range gun, or a backup upper receiver for a rifle in a different configuration. I'd like to request serious, in-state buyers only, and will ask to take a look at your driver's license before performing the transaction, just to ensure that you are a well-intentioned buyer from a state that permits these kinds of things."
