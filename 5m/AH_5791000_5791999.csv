Price has been reduced and is bottom dollar, cash only unless the trade is a Smith and Wesson M&P 15-22 or a Glock 19 (Possibly a 17 or a 26) with cash. Not a cheap Bubba build AR, and I'd honestly put it up against anything around for quality and accuracy.
AR alone, no extras - $750.00, AR with extras - $800.00
Extras - 3 brand new Pmags (One out of the package but never fired from or loaded, other 2 are still in the package) and 140 rounds of ammo (All brass cased) for an extra $80.00. That breaks down to $12.00 a magazine, and $0.31 cents per round on the ammo"

I had any repairs needed done and just spent over $600 on a new CV axle, water pump, brakes checked, transmission services, and oil changed, tires rotated and balanced. Long story short it took the auction house three weeks to get my title so I bought another vehicle in the mean time.  Everything works including the electronic 4x4 selector and A/C. All four tires are newer with excellent thread, less than a year old.  Only thing wrong with the truck is the abs light is on and sometimes the electronic speedometer cuts out the display. Other recently replaced parts include  Spark plug wires, plugs, air filter, serpentine belt, battery, alternator, starter, door hinge pins Includes side steps, front and rear tube bumpers, 9k lb badlands winch, roof rack.
