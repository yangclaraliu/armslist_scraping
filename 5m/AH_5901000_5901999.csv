Shoots 2 3/4"", 3"", or 3 1/2"" remington sabot slugs like a dream. I have personally pulled the trigger on 9 deer and all 9 were dead on the spot with a hole bigger than necessary. This gun comes with a nikon slughunter scope with steel rings and its all been blue locktighted because of the heavy recoil of the slugs. Rifled slug guns also have a tendency to ""jump"" and twist to the left when you shoot them - so I had mine ""magnaported"" look it up if you are unfamiliar. Its a process of porting the barrel using a laser ($165) - doing this has completely gotten rid of muzzle jump without damaging the rifling in the barrel - now it recoils straight back as any other rifle would. Also includes an extra heavy duty recoil pad for those days when you want to shoot more comfortably. If you were to buy all of this new, not including the gunsmith time I paid for - even though it has the magnaport ($165), the nikon 3-9 slughunter ($179.99), steel rings from badger ordnance ($110), recoil pad ($35). In all, I have put in $489 worth of upgrades. Check out the pics for closeups of the magnaporting. Will ship to FFL, buyer pays actual ground shipping costs."

I do not need to sell.

The VP9 trigger has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels, accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol's grip also instinctively position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. HK's patented charging supports, simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide, provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. HK's famous cold hammer-forged barrel, made from cannon grade steel, ensures long service life.
