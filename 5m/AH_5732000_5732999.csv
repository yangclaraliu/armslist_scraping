The edges of the slide and trigger guard are rounded and it does not have a rail so that it does not get stuck or hung up on anything while drawing from a pocket or holster. With the SAS you also get the short reset trigger (SRT) and the new E2 grips that is a one piece textured polymer that feels thinner and more streamlined for easier concealment. I would rate it at a 8.5/10 the only reason is slight wear on right side of the slide. I have shot appox 500 flawless rounds without any issues. The only reason I am selling is because I purchase a Legion. Besides special limited editions this is the most expensive P229 that Sig makes. Comes with 2 mags price is $750 firm

Takedown is as simple as locking the bolt back and verifying that the rifle is unloaded, pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies and pulling them apart. Simple reassembly allows for a secure connection of the barrel and action and returns the firearm to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used, ensuring consistent accuracy, shot after shot. Patented, detachable 10-round rotary magazine features a unique rotor to separate cartridges and provide reliable feeding.
Legendary action, a tried and true Ruger design, ensures consistent, reliable performance.
Easy-to-use extended magazine release provides smooth, no-fuss removal of flush-mounted magazine. Positive, push-button, cross-bolt manual safety. Heat-stabilized, glass-filled, polymer trigger housing assembly is precision-made of high-tech material for improved manufacturing tolerances, impact and abrasion-resistance and unmatched ability to withstand the elements. 
Also includes: Convenient carry-case, which provides ample storage with extra pockets and magazine pouches."

Priced to sell it all, I'm not parting anything, so what you see is what you get. You can use it, sell it, throw it, hell, I don't care. It's all yours once the sale is final. 
Here is what you get: 
1. The NORINCO Mak 90. Great condition rifle. See pictures. Runs like a champ. If you know AK's, you know the Mak-90 was the closest you could get to military-spec semi-automatic AK awesomeness, until the government banned their importation in '94. It's thicker receiver sets it above the WASR/ MAADI/ etc. crowd you so often see. The double hook trigger is phenomenal. Chrome-lined barrel to resist corrosion better, no matter what ammo you use. See the pictures. Educate yourself on the MAK here-  http://www.mouseguns.com/mak90web/mak90.htm2. Ironwood Furniture- since this is a STRAIGHT cut reciever, you can add additional ""show"" furniture. I bought it with Ironwood Designs furniture. See their site ironwooddesigns.com3. ORIGINAL MAK-90 furniture with all the trimmings so you can go to the range and shoot it in it's orginal glory. 4. Polish AK magazine pouch kit. Three magazines and a tool with all the eastern european extras in it. Two additional extra mags- one standard, one a hungarian ""tanker"" magazine. Only 20 rounds, but great for bench- shooting, as it's smaller size gives a much better hold and sight picture when used with a rifle rest. 5. A Kalinka Optics/ Russian rubber butt pad. To help mitigate the recoil, and also to add another inch or so to the pull- extra handy for taller guys. 6. A carrying case. I have no idea who made this, but as you see from the pictures, it neatly holds everything together in a sleek, professional range bag. 
Like I said- priced to sell. They don't bring these things into the US anymore, so it's value has only risen the past few years. After a Hillary election? Hell, you could sell this and make quite a PROFIT after a few months if you were an enterprising flipper. So it can be an investment as much as a great endangered 2nd Amendment piece. I just have other obligations, so I'm parting with mr. Mak.

Feed your Mosins, PSLs, Dragunovs, PKMs and VEPRs with this great ammo. You definitely have not seen this any time recently in places like AIMSURPLUS, SG AMMO, or JG SALES, as the situation in Europe made importation of these very scarce lately.
Good luck finding it cheaper on ammoseek, this is priced to quickly sell. Cash on hand only and no trades or opening of the case to part it. You get it all or you get nothing, so make sure you have a case of the good stuff come this election november (It'll probably jump in value as an investment if you sit on it for a bit).
Thumbs up in the picture, just so you know it's not a canned photo, and the seal and everything is 100% intact. Contact at REDACTED"
