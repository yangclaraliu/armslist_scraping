I purchased this firearm last year (11/25), and with not ever having time to use this gun and now working on a down payment for a nice condo, I am looking to sale this gun. This gun comes with a brand new Vortex Strike fire laser, four Magpul magazines, and a box of American Eagle green tip 5.56x45mm ammo (Approximately 120 rounds). This rifle only has 90 - 100 rounds through it. It is practically new and with the gun, laser sight and three magazines, I paid $900 before tax. I am looking for $625 OBO with the laser scope or $500 for Rifle, Mags and ammo. I would prefer to deal with fellow CCW holders but will consider any inquiry. I will also require a bill of sale or a transfer of ownership. I will need to look into the proper steps of transfer before a transaction is made. If a transfer is required, I will ask that the buyer pays the fees. This may be negotiated but will need to be discussed at the time of inquiry. I am mainly looking for cash to help on a down payment for a condo, however, I am really interested in another 9MM Glock + some cash if the value is less than my rifle. Thanks for looking at my post, and please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about my firearm. Ryan,513-4Eight5-Three6Zero8 Call or Text"

This is the 16.25"" version with the 2"" belgian flash hider. Very nice rifle. Packs a punch in .308. It does have the PARA folding stock as well so it can be very compact if needed. I also have the DS Arms scope mount which has a standard picatinny mount ready for any optic and 2 point sling is attached. I am also including ten 20-round mags and one 30-round mag. These are metal mags. The gun is in good condition. Just normal markings from standard use and there is no ejection port cover on these rifles so when the brass comes out it does hit the dust cover which is normal and happens after the first shot pretty much. Other than that, very great rifle.Looking for a fast cash sell at this price or perhaps a Sig MCX in .300 or a .300 AR plus cash on your end. Check the DS Arms site and other sites and these are going for $1800 - $2,000 with just one mag and standard dust cover, if they are even in stock. I am adding almost $400 in accessories on top of that. Cash price is very very low. If you want to trade, please make sure your trade is equal to the value invested in this rifle which is over $2,000. I am interested in other things too such as multiple pistols, rifles, plus cash, sig mpx, things like that. Let me know what you have. Not looking for any bolt-action guns right now. Serious inquiries only. REDACTED"
