Shotgun has Hi-Viz turkey sights. It comes with three factory choke tubes. S,IC,and M. I have also purchased two aftermarket tubes. A Carlsons Dead Coyote buckshot choke and a Tru Glo SSX turkey choke. It also has three shims to adjust pitch and cast. This gun functions flawlessly. I am not interested in any trades please do not ask. I can ship through my FFL to yours. I can also send more pictures if you're interested. Thank you!"

Normally the bead front sight was reserved for target models, but some were equipped based on availability of parts, as these were manufactured during war time. Serial #318xxx Bore looks good, no pitting anywhere and rifling’s are defined. This Smith and Wesson is in excellent condition for a gun that is 100 years old. Just a real treasure to have.  ------------------------ Some History:
Production of the .455 Mark II Hand Ejector Second Model began in 1915 and continued until 1917 with serial numbers following on from the First model starting at serial number 5001 and continuing on up to serial number 74755. Although for various reasons, as stated previously, there are some Mark I's numbered in the early part of this serial number range including those made by the using up of old parts. In total there were 69,754 Mark II .455's produced.
The Canadian Government purchased 14,500 directly from Smith & Wesson and in addition 1,105 were made for the commercial market after completion of the British contract. The rest went to the British Government.
 
When these guns were sold off as War surplus some were converted to more popular calibers due to the unavailability of the .455 ammunition, especially those that went to the United States. The two usual conversions were to .45 long Colt by lengthening the chambers and then either the cylinder was shortened or some metal was removed from the recoil shield to allow for the extra thickness of the rim on the cartridge case. The other conversion was to .45 ACP by shortening the cylinder and using .45 ACP in half moon clips or .45 auto rim ammunition. -------------------------- Just a beautiful, and perfect shooting gun. Very accurate, a must have for any Smith and Wesson collection. All transactions are face to face in the Tulsa area. Prefer text or email. nine18-four02-zero854"

It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other Glock pistols.Caliber / System  9x19 Safe Action  Dimensions  Length   159mm 6.26""  Width  26mm 1.02""  Length Between Sights  132mm  5.20""  Height  108mm 4.25""  Barrel Length   86mm 3.39""  Weights Unloaded  509g 17.95oz  Loaded  634g 22.36oz  Trigger Pull / Travel Trigger Pull  ~2.5kg  ~5.5lbs  Trigger Travel  ~12.5mm ~0.49""  Barrel Rifling / Length of Twist Barrel Rifling  Right Hand Hexagonal  Length of Twist  250mm / 9.84""  Magazine Capacity  Standard: 6"
