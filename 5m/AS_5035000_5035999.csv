Asking $600 obo, will consider trades. Various local stores in CT carry the .22 Tcm ammo including Cabelas, price is around $25 for a box of 50 last time I bought ammo. The .22 TCM round travels over 2200fps (in the 5.7 range) and it has a huge muzzle blast when fired and is a attention getter at the range. Recoil is Minimal in the 1911 frame, less recoil than a full size 9mm. Buyer will pay shipping if out of state. If the buyer is in a state that does not have a 10 round limit mag capacity will also get a third mag that has a 17 round capacity."
