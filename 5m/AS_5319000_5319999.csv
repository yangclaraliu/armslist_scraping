MSR: was $1019 at the time it was released. I paid about $1200 for the pistol because it was a limited run. I am moving to a different country, so I have to let go of some of my prized pieces. This pistol was only fired a handful of times and was never carried. And out of all the Kimber pistols that I have owned, this was definitely the sweetest shooter. I was told everything was hand fitted and that it uses the series 70 platform that does not have the Schwartz safety feature. Shipping is $65 to your FFL and I will only ship domestic via UPS. Insurance is your choice as it costs $2.00 for every $100.00 insured. Please be sure your FFL will accept firearms from a non FFL as my local FFL does not do transfers. All laws apply.

Also included in the package are two Ruger BX-25 25 round magazines, as well as the factory 10 round magazine.  I have only put approximately 275 rounds through it (3 bricks of CCI 36 gr HP Mini Mags & the rest were Winchester white box 36 gr HP). I don't shoot it as much and find myself shooting my Savage 17 HMR and CZ 22 bolt gun more when wanting to plink or hunt with rimfire, this the reason for selling to fund other projects. I am asking $330 (retail is $400 for gun, scope and two mags) and will sell to Alabama residents with a valid/non-expired Alabama drivers license and concealed carry permit. Buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale to complete the transaction. Thank you for looking and please let me know if you are interested."

Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 CZ-USA has had to date."

Glock 23 Gen 4 Semi-automatic Double Action Only Compact 40 S&W 4.02"" Polymer Matte 13Rd 3 Mags Fired Case Right Hand Fixed Sights PG2350203The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.. GEN 4 Features: The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested ""Safe Action"" system, Durable exterior finish, Cold hammer forged barrel, Durability, Reliability, Light weight, ....that make GLOCK firearms famous! The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts. Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps. Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol. THE PEARCE FRAME CAVITY INSERT FITS BOTH ADJUSTABLE BACKSTRAPS. Features: Gen4 G23, (2) 13rd Magazines, Reversible magazine catch, Rough Textured Frame, 2 Back Straps, Revolutionary ""Safe Action"" Design."

It shoots fine and fairly accurate (better than my Mosin) for an old gun. I bought this from a retailer last year that recieved them as surplus. Since then I have only shot 15 rounds of surplus ammo through it. They all shot fine and I did not have any issues feeding them. The bolt is smooth and I make sure to clean it right after shooting every time. With the ammo being corrosive, I made sure to clean the rifle as thoughly as I can and made sure to get the salt from the primmer cleaned out. This Yugo is all matching numbers execpt for the first band closest to the front sight. I will include the remaining few rounds that I do have of ammo (5 or 6). This does have some of the old markings that were not completly scrached out, but nothing amazing; just interresting. Overall, fairly clean for a Yugo, and well kept after since owning it myself."

These look great on a rifle and add that special operations look to your gun.- Troy Medieval muzzle brake (.556) New in box! only took it out to take pictures of it. I have one on my other rifle and I liked it so much I bought another just in case I built out another gun. Makes the gun shoot flat! It also look mean on the gun with the breaching component on the end of the brake. $30 (goes for $40 on amazon plus shipping)- 45 degree back up iron sights (BUIS) these mount on any picatinny rail and allow you to quickly shift between an optic or scope and iron sights without worrying about one getting in the way of another. Really handy piece of kit. I was planning on using these on an SPR application but never did. They are spring loaded and folding as well which is a definite plus. They are built out of metal so they are very solid and can take a beating. $45Feel free to send me offers or possible trades. I would also be willing to sell the lot at a little better price.

I have my other go to watches that I just never seem to get enough time wearing this one. It is a shame because it is a really nice watch. It deserves to be worn and not hiding in my watch box. I just had the battery replaced a couple months back so it should tick for a long time. It has a very stylish look to it with the genuine black leather band with the saddle colored backing. The face of the watch shines like the day I bought it and has virtually no scratches or signs of wear to speak of. It has not been worn very much at all. It comes with the genuine Movado box and watch pillow. I have pictured the watch with the warranty card that is no longer valid but I wanted to prove that it is a genuine Movado. I have the original purchase receipt from Zales as well. With the condition of the watch, you will be getting a great deal.

S# 69XXX (1913) with early Rampant Colt superimposed over the stylized ""C"", grooved hammer top, original barrel cut to 2 1/8” according to information pass on to me from Colt collector this was shipped to California in 1913.
This Fitz conversion was done at some point much later than the gun production date and after Fitz conversions already became known and popular. This was probably done between 1920 and 1925 because of the patina. The workmanship on this old Colt looks like it was done by a Master gunsmith that paid attention to detail.
 
Bore and rifling are in good condition along with the cylinder, its chamber for 38 special you can also use the shorter 38 S&W cartridge.  Pistol has period grips and the nickel finish is about 80% remaining, it shows use which is to be expected for a 103 year old gun included is the period holster.  Because of the rarity of this conversion this Colt would make a nice addition to your Colt collection.
 
Before his death on June 12, 1945 H J Fitzgerald travelled 30,000 miles a year throughout the U.S. visiting different Police Departments offering Pistol shooting instruction. During these trips he also met with many other clients interested in his shooting skills and his unique conversions including troops during WWII.
