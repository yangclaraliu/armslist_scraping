I purchased it new for 325 and added on allot of accessories along the way. The gun brings the original box as well as the manual, pouch, and approximately 60 rounds of ammo.It has a mounted TR1 laser from ArmaLaser that cost me 130. What makes the laser unique is the true touch activation, which means that there is a sensor built in it, so when you go to grab the pistol, the laser is already armed. No fumbling for switches or anything. The laser does have a master kill switch, so you can keep the laser off when needed. The laser is designed and assembled in florida as well.I purchased a grip extension for the standard magazine for about ten dollars.I also installed an ambidextrious belt clip that acts as a holster. It can be installed for lefties or right handed people. The maker is Techna Clip, and it cost me a little over 30 dollars.Also included is the extended magazine that holds ten rounds instead of the standard seven rounds. I paid 25 dollars for it.All together I spent at least 520 on the pistol itself, not to mention the box of ammo and an extra battery for the laser. I've fired maybe 140 rounds on this pistol and its been vey reliable. It has been well maintained.I have 20 pictures, but the site only allows me to upload 3Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have"

OAL: 6.6"" Frame Material: STAINLESS # Magazine: 3  Other: The action of the EMP® is 1/8 inch shorter than that of the original 1911. This translates into several concrete advantages for the shooter. The shorter grip radius produces a shockingly comfortable shooting experience. You have to shoot the EMP® to believe how controllable it is. The shorter dimensions also work to increase reliability – something that’s crucial in a concealed carry pistol. And of course, the overall dimensions are one of the smallest 1911s out there. The good news doesn’t stop with the innovative design. The EMP® comes loaded with all the features you expect in a 1911 of this class – like low profile 3-Dot tritium combat sights and a match grade fully supported and ramped barrel. And with 9+1 rounds of 9mm or 8+1 rounds of .40 SW, the EMP® packs an amazing amount of punch in one of the smallest 1911s ever. Condition: Factory New       We are here to help!

It shoots very well with standard steel case 7.62x39. The sights are on and it already has a conpensator installed as well as a vented handguard. Some mags can be harder to get in then others but it has taken every AK mag I've tried....I have a few accessories going with the rifle. Two 30 round magazines, two 40 round magazines and a 10 round magazine. Also about 120 rounds of ammo. People normally ask much more for these rifles, there won't be more like it buy this one=)"

The EXP-556 utilizes a polymer lower which is mostly standard other than the buffer tube area which is solid and unthreaded compared to a standard lower. Other than the pins and springs the entire lower is comprised of polymer parts. The trigger is marketed as a 5.5lb trigger. In testing, the trigger is very good considering it is polymer. There’s no real takeup or slack and it breaks very crisply. The lower has an integrated winter trigger guard to ease gloved shooting. The pistol is shipped with one 30 round Tapco magazine.BoltAssembly The upper is also polymer and features a proprietary recoil spring system sitting over a somewhat familiar looking bolt assembly. Since it is spring dampened there isn’t a long bolt carrier like a standard AR, it’s carrier has an abbreviated length. The upper is also unique in that it features a reciprocating charging handle on the left side. There is no dust cover or forward assist on the right side of the upper.The front gas block has an integrated front sight post machined into it and the rear sight is a ghost ring fitted into a dovetail in the polymer top rail. Between the upper and gas block is a stabilizing rod which helps keep the upper aligned and supported.The 8.25” barrel features a very effective muzzle brake. The brake pushes the barrel length to 9.25” overall. Its so effective that when shooting, the gun actively pushes down and back against the shooter. This creates a flat shooting pistol with minimal recoil felt to the shooter. The flipside of this effective brake is an engulfing muzzle flash and a deafening concussion. This is definitely not a gun you would ever want to shoot without hearing protection.Features Lightest 5.56/.223 Pistol In The World Made In USA Compact Design With No Buffer Tube Ergonomic Pistol Grip Integrated MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny Rail For Easy Mounting Of Optics And Accessories Extremely Low Recoil – Can Be Held And Shot With One Hand With Virtually No Muzzle Climb Crisp Trigger Pull Of 5.5 Lbs Reversible Safety To Accommodate Left Hand Shooters Why Pay Extra For Parts?

The rear sight is fully adjustable, the front sight is a serrated ramp with red insert. The firing pin is mounted in the hammer and there are none of the modern ""improvements"" like the internal safety lock or cheap MIM parts. Condition is essentially new and the revolver shows no significant wear. There is no rust or any pitting. The book-matched smooth target stocks are in excellent shape, free of cracks or chips. The mechanics are in perfect working order with good timing and solid lock-up. The bore is also excellent, like new, with bright and sharp rifling. It appears this revolver was little more than test fired. It comes in the original box which numbers to the gun and includes the instruction sheet, miscellaneous paperwork, cleaning kit and screw driver. According to the serial number, this Model 68 was manufactured in about 1984. She's a nice one!Buyer pays $20.00 shipping."

A Sig Sauer rotary diopter sight has been added which offers a combat V notch and 3 diopter positions for 100-200-300 meters.  It is a HK type rotary drum and they are extremely easy to use once you get them dialed in. These 556 rifles are no longer in production and are highly sought by collectors and shooters. They are an interesting design and many have referred to them as product improved AK designs. The Magazine is a Sig Factory 30-rd 551 type that was offered by Sig-USA years ago. The 551A1 lower accepts all 550/551 type magazines. It handles extremely well and shoulders comfortably and the folding Swiss Type 556 stock offers a surprisingly comfortable cheek weld.  It is a very tight feeling rifle due to the shorter stock which is almost AK-like in length which makes it very fast to track onto target. This is not a Sig factory combination and is a custom rifle that apporximates the Sig 550 rifle very nicely without the $15,000 price tag of a Swiss SAN 551 rifle.Cash Price $1400Trade Value $1500Interesting Trades considered."
