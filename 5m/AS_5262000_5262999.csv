This is Federal's company policy, and not the result of any law prohibiting the general public from lawfully purchasing, possessing, or shooting this ammunition.This cartridge and a modified version of the Speer G2 have been chosen by the FBI as their duty rounds of the future. The Speer G2 is still in evolution, while this cartridge has already been perfected with the perfect combination of penetration and expansion.Federal LE HST 9mm handgun ammunition is designed to deliver the high performance today's law enforcement officers demand. Each HST bullet is individually engineered to provide shot-to-shot uniformity and ensure optimum performance when fired through a variety of barriers. The result is a cartridge that provides officers the ultimate defense in lethal force confrontations."

Near perfect condition, deep bluing, high gloss walnut stock and forearm with perfect checkering . The rifle has an added steel Williams receiver peep sight and has escaped the addition of sling swivel studs. It is my opinion that the trigger of this rifle has been worked over by a gunsmith who absolutely knew what he was doing. These rifles are known for average triggers, but this one has an exceptionally smooth pull, crisp break and no creep. I don't have a trigger pull guage but it has to be around 3-4 pounds in my estimation.Included is the original .358 4 round magazine. RCBS .358 winchester die set, converted .308 to .358 brass, remaining box of factory ammo and brass (all yet to be counted), and 2 brand new boxes of .358 win projectiles..358 brass is easily made from .308 brass by fire forming or just running them through the .358 dies.

The Service Six revolvers are apart of the “SIX” series (Speed, Security, and Service) manufactured by Ruger from 1972-1988, and they have often been praised as being the best revolvers ever produced by Ruger. They were replaced by the GP100 series revolvers in 89 and have since become extremely coveted firearms for those seeking either an everyday carry gun, or as a collectors piece. This revolver has a beautiful stainless steel finish, with only a few minor scratches from holster wear. It comes with the original rosewood grips which have faded on one side from service in Europe, but are still in fantastic shape and could easily be refinished if desired. This revolver has a 4 inch barrel with fixed sights. This revolver also comes with:-Custom Made Brown Leather OWB Holster-1 Speed-loader -Soft Shell CaseAs previously mentioned this revolver is in Very Good Condition, and would make a fine addition to your arsenal. The trigger pull is even and has a clean break, and functions flawlessly in either DA or SA. And being a 357 Magnum the frame is capable of handling a variety of rounds including .38 SPC, 38 SPC + P, or the Man-Stopping 357 Magnum. These revolvers were trusted by police departments around the world to defend the lives of not only their officers, but the citizens whom the served; and this Service Six Revolver is ready to do the same for you today.I am currently asking $700 firm for this firearm. I currently live in Owenton, KY but am able to meet in surrounding areas with notice. When contacting me through email please leave a phone number as I am not always able to communicate by email. Though I do not wish to utilize an FFL transfer service for out-of-state buyers, I will for the right offer. But be aware there will be a $35 shipping/handling fee, it must be transferred to a FFL, and I will require full payment upfront in the form of money order before it will be shipped.*THIS IS NOT A SECURITY SIX, SPEED SIX, or GP100."

I dont know the round count but I can tell you the bore is great as are all the other parts as well as upper and lower recievers.  The gun does show minor wear on the finish as to be expected on a gun this age.  I have have fired it only on one occassion putting about 250 rounds through it. The gun is select fire and operates in semi or full auto mode.  I have more pics if the buyer desires.   Now for the brass tax.... This firearm is a registered, stamped, class 3 weapon.  If you would like to buy it but not sure how the process works, just ask me.  There is a few hoops you have to jump through with the ATF before you take ownership of it.  I am not into playing B.S. games.  Make sure you are legally allowed to own this firearm-that is your responsibility to determine that.  I most likely will not trade for anything and wont respond to silly offers or others I feel that are a waste of time or flat out non-sense.  Buyer is repsonsible for all costs relating to transfer, and ATF excise stamp.  including cost of the weapon itself.   We will be doing the transfer at one of my selected gun stores here locally that are licensed to transfer class 3 weapons.  I will not ship."

Great condition and shooter. Has two magazines and original box. Trusted my life to this firearm Never malfunctioned. Not even during the recomended 500 round break-in. I have used Winchester White box, Hornady XTP, and Remington ammunition in it, all without a failure. You can trust your life to it also. Just care for it as the owners manual suggest, use a good grease like LUBRIPLATE on the mating surfaces and it will run like John Moses Browning intended a 1911 to. Very accurate too. Just like the reviews say. It shoots to point of aim at any combat distance, reliably.I do have mixed feelings about parting with it, since it has been such a good piece. I am selling to fund a Sig Sauer Fastback Carry Nightmare in 357sig. I really like Sigs and the 357sig round. I just hope it is as reliable and accurate as this Kimber!! Just not in a position to buy an $1100 firearm at this time without parting with something."

The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. The cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and an incredibly smooth double action-only trigger stroke that's fast to fire in critical defensive situations. The rear sight is drift-adjustable, and the pinned-in polymer front sight features a white bar-dot configuration.Click here to Purchase or Check AvailabilityFeatures    Type: Pistol   Action: Double   Caliber: 9mm   Barrel Length: 3.0""   Capacity: 6+1 (One Magazine)   Safety: No Manual   Grips: Black Poly Grip/Frame   Sights: Drift Adjustable   Weight: 15.9 oz   Frame Finish: Black   Frame Material: Polymer   Slide Description: Stainless Steel"

This is the top of the line Beretta auto shotgun designed specifically for clay sports. It was designed from the ground up as a clay gun which provides the low recoil of an auto with the gun handling of an over-under.  It is a break open action, similar to an over-under, and ejects shells out the bottom, making it perfect for both right and left handed shooters. The stock is adjustable for cast-on, cast-off and drop using stock shims. In addition the stock also has an adjustable comb, length and butt pad placement.  Every time I bring it to the range, this gun is the center of attention due to its unique looks and operation. It is the softest shooting 12 GA shotgun I have ever had the pleasure of shooting.
Comes with all tools for disassembly and 9 chokes. 
I am selling because I have switched hobbies and no longer find the time to go shooting.  I can provide additional pictures upon request.

More details below from Nightforce's website.The U.S. military asked for a scope that is exceptionally fast and applicable to a wide range of targets at various distances. The NXS™ 3.5-15 x 50 F1 is the answer. The reticle is located in the first focal plane, which has distinct advantages in high-stress situations and when the user might encounter targets from up-close to 1000 yards or more. A first focal plane reticle remains in the same visual proportion to the target across the scope’s entire magnification range, making it especially appropriate with rangefinding reticles. Combined with Nightforce highly tactile and intuitive adjustments, it makes for a scope that is extremely quick, accurate, responsive and utterly reliable."
