If I have to ship the pistol, it is cheapest for me to use my FFL dealer so he can ship via USPS. He MUST ship to another FFL. You will need to send (or have your dealer send) a copy of the FFL along with payment. Payment can be USPS Money Order, or any other type of certified check or money order. $20 will mostly cover my costs for USPS Priority and FFL transfer fee - add $5 if you want the shipment insured. Once USPS tracking indicates the it has shipped, the gun is yours, so consider insurance carefully.If you live nearby, I will consider local pick-up - only after I learn a little about you. At a minimum you will need to show a valid TX drivers license. CHL is preferred."

Inertia driven and known to be one of the fastest cycling shotgun for it's time. This was the design right before the M1 Super 90 was introduced. It has a one piece 7 shot magazine tube...there is no seem or extension.  The hole unit unscrews from the reciever for easy cleaning. It holds seven 2 3/4"" shells in the tube. It cannot be ghost loaded and is chambered for 2 3/4"" shells only.  I bought this used about 10 years ago and there was a Weaver type base attached to the barrel which I removed. The drill and tap job looks like it was well done..see pictures. There's a Pachmayr White Line recoil pad installed. It's the grind to fit type and though the work wasn't very good it still looks like it belongs. Gun is in excellent condition for being over 30 yrs old. Wood has just a few very light dents/nicks that you have to hunt for. Reciever has one spot near the bolt catch button where the finish has been worn off. Other than that it's a great looking home defense shotgun with wood furniture that you don't see these days. Comes with original box. Call or text 4one9-675-zero528 for more pics or info. Won't respond to either until after 4PM during the week. No trades."

Production year c.2008. Beautiful figured stock with classic lines, 24"" barrel with hooded front sight. I removed the rear sight to clear the scope, it is included with the gun. This rifle is in absolutely flawless condition without a scratch on it. There are less than 150 rounds through the gun. I originally purchased it from a gentleman who had bought the gun and put two boxes of ammo through it at the range before losing his eyesight in his dominant eye through a workplace accident. I bought the gun when I lived out west with the intention of taking an elk with it. During the time I owned the gun, I put no more than 5 boxes of ammo through it sighting in the scope and shooting a few tannerite targets. I never managed to get an elk tag, and this gun mostly sat in the safe for the 5 years i have owned it. Other important details: Gun comes with 3-9x40 nikon monarch scope, was $500 new. also includes mount and rings. Comes with Montana leather sling and Butler creek scope covers. Custom trigger job by a smith in Sacramento. Trigger breaks like glass right at 2#. Action was also glass bedded by the gunsmith. This gun is not only presentation-grade beautiful, it is insanely accurate to boot. I am putting 3 rounds in the X ring at 200 yards off the bench and I am a lousy shot."

Sig code E29R-9-EQ. It has 3 mags total, nights sights and factory installed SRT (short reset trigger). According to Osage County guns (one of the only places I could find info on this firearm), they indicate:This is a non-cataloged item. Previously Sig Sauer made some P226 Equinoxes in 9mm because 9mm Equinox slides were built by accident and they finished the guns instead of destroying the slides. Those guns were never available again after that run. We are not sure if the same mistake happened with P229 slides and the factory finished the guns or if this is a limited short-term run of this configuration. We cannot guarantee we can get more once these are sold.Here is the link if you want to go on, see what it sold for when it was available and the specifics of it.  Just copy and paste to your browser.https://www.sigsauerguns.com/p229r-9mm-equinox-truglo-ns.htmlThis is a rare (and GORGEOUS) Sig.  Put that Sku into GunBroker and you'll find there is none sold nor any for sale.  These things do not come up, especially in this condition.  Most of them are sitting in collectors' safes.I would keep it, but after trading for it, I realized I am a 1911 guy deep down and it deserves to be in someone's Sig collection.  Also, I am more of a shooter rather than a collector, not that this wouldn't be the prettiest gun on the range if you did decide to shoot it.$1200 oboAlso, I have a Galco Miami Classic shoulder rig (Sig under the left arm and 2 mag pouches with snaps under the right arm).  I'd add this into the deal depending on what we come to."
