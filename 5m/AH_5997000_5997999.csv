Note that the entire rifle is up for sale for $1300 as well but would prefer to just sell the upper and everything else listed as extras. The Upper is Made up as so: The Upper is a JSE Surplus 6.5, with a 20 inch bull barrel, YHM 308 brake, YHM Freefloat rail and gas system. Higher End Chrome Bolt Carrier and Alexander Arms Bolt Head. Anmbidextrous Charging Handle, Single point QD sling mount, Bipod Picatinny to swivel stud adapter, and an AR-PEPR 30mm set of rings (NO scope) Overall This is a pretty Maxed out Grendel Build, have done 1/2 to 3/4 MOA before with a 5 shot group, about 300 rounds through upper, no issues. The gun also comes with 8 15rd ASC 6.5 MAgs with couplers so the mags can be attached in groups of 2, Hornady Reloading DIes and a WFT-2 CAse Trimmer with a 6.5 head (Basically most of what you need to reload Grendel if you already load for other rifle calibers). Including all the ammo i have which is 300rds of brass cased (Some are Handloads in only new Unfired Brass, No Reloaded Cases... Tested to Well within Safe Pressures and under 1MOA Groups), and 257 rounds of Wolf Steel cased (total of 557 rounds). Also 92 pieces of fired BrassOnly Reason I am selling the upper is to put money into a new platform. Note that what you get here would cost you about $1500-1600 New. This rifle is a pretty nice all around platform, recoils only slightly more than a 5.56, and the accuracy is certainly there. I am open to offers and possibly trades depending on what you have. Would most likely be willing to trade for an AR10, a Bullpup or compact tactical rifle, or a Long range bolt Gun. Any questions let me know. ... Also originally listed the entire rifle so the pics will reflect as such. What you get here is everything minus the complete lower. If anybody is interested in the entire rifle Im willing to do 1200. The Lower is pretty high end, Match 2 pound trigger, Magpul Pistol Grip and trigger guard, LUTH-AR MBA-1 buttstock. Dont be afraid to shoot me a cash or trade offer, worst I can do is say im not interested, Thanks"

During the process, a two-part surface layer is formed, an outer iron nitride layer with a nitrogen diffusion layer below it. During this treatment, nitrogen and carbon are absorbed by and diffused into the surface of the metal. Reproducible and uniform layers with a predetermined thickness will be formed on all areas of the metal. The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with BLACKNITRIDE™ have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more expensive processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, BLACKNITRIDE™ gives better corrosion protection at equivalent or lower costs. Additionally, BLACKNITRIDE™ is commonly used as an alternative to high temperature conventional heat treatments such as carburizing and carbonitriding."

Built around a Cold Hammer Forged, 14.5” Lightweight profile barrel, the V11 SLW has an Extended Flash Suppressor which is pinned and welded to reach the NFA required 16” minimum barrel length. The Mid-length gas system provides smooth and reliable cycling under any conditions and reduces both perceived recoil and wear on moving parts. A free-floating SLiM Rail 12.0 handguard offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. With the KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock and an uninterrupted 1913 Picatinny rail on top, the V11SLW has plenty of room for the sights, optics, and accessories the operator may require. The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

IRC, the very first of the ""Colt"" SM1861's were hand-made by an N-SSA lad circa 1988-1989ish. That fell apart, but a short while later, circas 1995 Colt reoffered the SM1861. The original vision was for a limited edition (1995 to 1998 ) rather than a true mass production run.
Colt advertised them as a Colt product, made in the U.S.A

Made in Stratford for just five years in blued and polished stainless steel. The only difference from the famed Undercover was the name stamp and the addition of a red dot front sight.If you're not a Charter believer, consider that any first generation rarely comes up for sale. Mainly because they just keep on running. It's also true that they aren't seen as collectible. However, they did give the S&W Chief's Special a run for its money for two decades."

It has a nice, polished blued finish which has some wear on the backstrap, but is otherwise in good condition. It's already one of the most ergonomic semiautomatic pistols out there(similar in shape to the CZ-75 series of pistols), but the Pachmayr grips make it even more comfortable to shoot. The recoil spring and mainsprings have been replaced and upgraded with better/modern Wolff springs, giving it a very light trigger pull, and exceptionally controllable recoil. The magazine disconnect safety has also been removed to maximize the trigger's potential.  Unlike other Hi Powers with either low profile military sights or target 'beer can' sights, this one has regular 3-dot sights, which is the standard with most other pistols. Additionally, the barrel/bore is still in excellent shape. All serial numbers match. It comes with one 14 round magazine.WILLING TO SHIP, BUYER PAYS $25 EXTRA FOR S&H"

This is the stuff I no longer need. All is used but in very good condition. Maybe 300 rounds through the barrel. The barrel is a PSA and is very accurate to the sights that are on the slide. Slight marking on the barrel where the slide touches it. The slide has no scratches on the outside. Typical wear on the rails on the inside, it looks like it was hardly used because it was hardly used. The guide rod and spring mechanism are included. This stuff would be useful for someone that wants to have multi caliber use out of their pistol. If you have any of the other full size frame pistols in another caliber you could just throw this on and you are converted to 9mm. Make note that this will only work with other 4th generation frames. I will ship it to you with a tracking number. I am not firm on the price, I will take any offer for consideration. I do also have the original barrel but I intended on keeping that but if the offer is made for it I will consider it. If you have a trade, I will hear any offer, not looking for anything specific.
