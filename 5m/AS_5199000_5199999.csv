I have heard you can use a normal 5.56 magazine with these just you can only put in about 20 rounds as the cases have a slight taper vs the straight case on the 5.56.

Remington designed the 44 Magnum cartridge by lengthening the case of the 44 Special by .125 of an inch. 44 mag was the result of handloaders loading 44 special to it’s maximum potential.The 44 Magnum round was an instant success and has remained popular even after losing the title of most powerful production cartridge. The ammunition became a massive hit when it was featured in Clint Eastwood’s ""Dirty Harry"", bringing the power and grace of the 44 special to the forefront of American gun-admirers' minds. Check out our line-up of 44 FMJ ammunition as well as 44 jacketed hollow point rounds for sale listed in the categories below44 Remington Magnum is an exceptionally capable short range hunting round --- favored for it’s penetrative ability, it’s massive projectile, and it’s accuracy. Inside of a hundred yards the 44 Mag caliber is hard to beat. It is also suitable for medium and large game, capable of taking down animals up to the size of an elk. 44 Mag is also a round favored for the field self-defense due to it’s massive power, which when loaded correctly can take bears.The 44 Magnum is the most popular of big bore pistols for it’s combination of power and it’s ability to be used in multiple platforms. Few rounds can be utilized in revolvers, semi auto handguns, and rifles, while packing such a punch."

He has since grown and got his own bow, so I no longer have a need for this one. It would make a great bow to teach a kid or woman how to shoot on and comes ready to shoot with all needed accessories. I attached a pic of the specs showing draw length and weight. The arrows are still like new and everything is in great condition for its age. Thank you for looking and please let me know if you are interested. I am not interested in trades at this time."

The one with the 3.5 HP motor needs the carb cleaned (realistically be best to replace it, roughly a $12 part online).
The 3.5hp one has a broken front fender, otherwise is in the same shape as the other.

By serial number this puts the year of manufacture of this rifle in 1941, only 875 Winchester Model 70's were made in this caliber before WW2. This Mdl 70 is one of the RARITIES of Model 70 collecting. Simply put the quality of the rifle is superlative. It feature Super Grade Sling Swivels, a factory red ""Winchester"" butt pad that is still pliable, express sights and a dark figured Walnut that might have made this rifle a special order? The rifle retains 98%-99% of it's original blued finish, a bright bore and the wood has some storage bruising which is consistent with it's age as all the pictures indicate. It also has a late 40's period Lyman Challenger All weather scope mounted on the rifle. To mount the scope the rear bridge has 2 holes, which might or might not have been drilled by the factory? However rarity and condition over ride this state of affairs.The question you have to ask yourself is when will I see another pre WW2 Winchester Model 70 in 375 H&H in this condition again? This rifle has been in my collection for 23 years. Acquired at H&H Shooting Supply in Pomona, CA.Please ask any questions that you might have. With USPS MO I usually ship the same day all other methods must clear. This rifle because of the cost will be sent USPS REGISTERED MAIL to be able to insure it for it's full value.Buyer pays actual shipping. This is C&R OK. I will entertain reasonable offers.Shipping charges if returned are non reimbursable"

The frame incorporates a trigger mounted safety that prevents accidental discharge from impact if the VP9 is struck or dropped, and a disconnector ensures that the slide must be in battery for the VP9 to fire. The take down lever acts as a disassembly safety and precludes the VP9 from being disassembled unless the magazine is removed from the magazine well. If cocked, the firing pin is also decocked as the take down lever is rotated forward. The design of the VP9 allows the operator to visually assess the status of the firearm by featuring an extractor that also functions as a loaded chamber indicator. A red colored insert at the back of the firing pin indicates if the firing pin is in the cocked or uncocked mode. Witness holes on the back of the magazine housing allow the operator to view the amount of ammunition present by means of a quick glance. VP9 controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, as well as an easy-to-access ambidextrous magazine release on the rear, bottom portion of the trigger guard. Ambidextrous finger recesses, located on the bottom sides of the magazine well, allow the operator to achieve purchase on the magazine’s floor plate in the unlikely event that the magazine does not drop free when the extended flanges on the magazine release are activated. The VP9’s high strength polymer frame includes a unique ergonomic handgun grip design consisting of interchangeable grip panels and backstraps, as well as a dustcover with a standard Picatinny rail interface. The handgun grip design includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Milled from a solid block of high carbon steel and then enhanced with a corrosion resistant nitro-carburized finish, the slide on the VP9 features non-radioactive luminous sights as standard that are adjustable for both windage and elevation, front and rear slide serrations, as well as extensions on the back of the slide."
