Waterproof & Fogproof
Porro Prism
7.4° Angle of View
Individual Focus
Made in Germany
Features
The Steiner Commander XP C 7x50 binocular is a serious boating instrument.  It is built for a lifetime of rough seafaring environments, with simply brilliant optical and mechanical performance that lasts and lasts.
Continuing upon Steiner's 7x50 class, the most important innovation with the Commander XP are the XP optics; they're a high definition, broadband optical formula featuring record-setting transmissivity for clear, sharp, high contrast, and comfortable images in any light.

In addition to the XP Optics, the Commander XP C has a highly-evolved optical coating on the objective and eyepieces called ""NANO Protection"".  This hydrophobic coating repels moisture and dirt, leaving lenses clear.  Like a windshield wiper for your binoculars, you'll find that you'll rarely need to wipe them clean.

The compass function in the Commander XP C is Steiner's best technology, and is known for being a lightning-fast performer which gives accurate readings quickly enough to be used as a preferred instrument in professional boating races.

With true Mil-Spec weatherproofing, the Steiner Commander XP C is nitrogen purged and externally sealed, with each unit individually submerged to assure waterproofing.  It is also tested to withstand a 70°F temperature change without internal fogging!

""NANO-Coat"" hydrophobic external eyepiece & objective lens coatings
Steiner's ""Sports Auto-Focus"" system allows sharp focus from 20 yards to infinity without making eyepiece adjustments
Evolved NBR long-life rubber armoring 2-3x more durable than previous generations
Full multicoatings upon every air-to-glass surface
Includes 3 easily-exchanged eyecup sets (flat, winged, and extended) to provide supreme comfort for all users
Included comfortable Clic-Loc neoprene strap as well as XP Floatation strap which permits binocular to float in water
Illuminated compass with exceptionally-fast adjustments to bearing
Excellent viewing angle and eye relief for compass-enabled 7x50 unit"

I acquired this from a gun store in Miami. I received it unfired and it has remained so. The only minor blemish is the all too common kiss-mark on the bottom hand guard trough, where the bayonet folds into the wood. It is very minor and cannot be seen unless looking at it directly from the bottom. Other than that, the rifle is in EXCEPTIONAL condition and is a true collector's piece more than anything. I own another Polytech Spiker and would prefer to expand my collection in other areas. 

Let's just say that I currently have ""enough"" Preban Chinese AKs 

$2,200 obo. I have a VERY strong preference for dealing locally and I would much rather deal with someone who can show ID and a NC CCP or PPP. 

Since I know you'll ask, I'll go ahead and list some of the potential trades I would be interested in 

*HK Prebans (91, 93, etc.)
*Other Norinco or Polytech Variants
*Galil or Valmets
*Pre ban semi automatic rifles in general
*HK, Sig Sauer, Colt, or Beretta m9 semi-automatic handguns (I have a NC CCP)
*Revolvers chambered in .357 (S&W, Colt, or Ruger GP series)
*IWI Tavor
*Scar 16 (I might be tempted into another 17)

Lower Trade Interests:
*High end glass (night force compacts, leupold mk 4s) 
*Remmington 700s chambered in 7mm rem mag, .308, or .30-06. 
*.308, 9mm, 5.56, 7.62x51 ammo. 
*Colt AR-15 rifles 

I can do single gun deals or multiple gun deals. I can add cash or accept cash depending on the trade package.

I am selling my SigSauer 2022 pistol with all accessories.  It was my first handgun and is a great gun.  It is a polymer Sig.  It is chambered in 9mm Para and has had 2,000 rounds put through it.  I have always used ball ammo and never have put steel through it.  It comes with a paddle retention holster, mag pouch+4 mags, laser sight which is on target, 500 rounds of ammo+31 rounds of Federal Hydrashok (my carry rounds), 15 rounds of PMC(my backup mag), and 15 rounds of TNJ in addition to the ammo.  I also have brass that I have collected and if you buy, you are more than welcome to have at no extra charge because I do not reload.  I took very good care of this gun no matter if I shot 1 round or 300 rounds I cleaned it and oiled it every single time.  A gun is an investment and I take care of my investments.  

This Sig is a DA/SA with a 10lb DA pull and a 4.4 SA pull.  It has a polymer grip and holds 15+1.  The sights markings are white but I have them marked out with black marker because the white bothered me.  It will come off easy.  

I will respond to email as quickly as possibly, but I will only meet if you want to buy.  I have provided a lot of pictures to demonstrate the teardown.  I prefer to meet in Saint Charles County.  I will only meet during the day in a public place eg; Bass Pro parking lot, Walmart, public shopping center, etc.  

I will consider taking negotiations on pricing, however what we agree to in email is what the final price is.  I will also email more pictures if you are interested."

Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor.

The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability. The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones.

Length (stock retracted): 32in	

The AR6720 represents a new generation of Colt rifle, which comes standard with an optics ready rail and a flip-up rear iron sight. Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor.

The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability. The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones.

STAG Arms Model 3 is a great rifle for LE, survival and sporting purposes. With a 5.56 chambered, 1/9, 16"", 4140 steel, chrome lined, government profile barrel ready to spit out all of the most commonly used bullet weights without a hitch (and as fast as you want, thanks to that glorious M4 feed ramp)

Milspec Upper, Trigger pack, springs and more.

Like Magpul? OF COURSE YOU DO. People spend upwards of $400 on the stuff, but I'm handing it over for free. The ACS stock is utility and function with water-resistant compartments to store batteries, papers, oil and more. The ACS even has a sweet pinup (YOU CAN REMOVE HER, BUT WHY WOULD YOU?!) The MOE grip stores things as well. MOE handguard beats the heat. BAD lever makes you smoother at mag changes and clearing failures... AS IF THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN.

EoTech? What?! Yeah, that's right. I am moving the EoTech as well. Great EoTech, NVG capable, runs on AA batteries. AA BATTERIES! Because CR123s are for suckers. EoTech Blinking at the end of the world? GOOD THING YOU BULK BOUGHT AAs AT SAMS CLUB. Your fauxperator buddies will be whining as they flip up their irons in defeat, sitting on top of a pile of dead CR123s.

Why buy a STAG? BECAUSE STAG LOVES YOU. I said it. It needs to be said. Stag has the best warranty in the business. Infinite round count guarantee on barrels and transferable lifetime warranty. You broke the rifle? Call them up, wait for them to give you a shipping label, sent it in and before you know it, they send it back. NO QUESTIONS ASKED. I've had them call me before just to check on me. I sent them brownies. Let's see Colt, S&W or Bushmaster give a damn about you like that. H&K would just laugh at you. STAG15= Craftsman Tools.

So here is the skinny- my truck broke down and I got stuck with a bill. I gotta handle my business. I have another rifle as well, so I had to flip a coin to decide which one goes.

The AR can also go for $770.01 by itself, but you're seriously losing out on an EoTech. EoTech won't be sold separately. What is that? ""My DPMS/M&P15 SPORT/Bushmaster Carbon was $300 lower than that"". COOL STORY BRO, Let's see how their customer service treats you after about 3000+ rounds. (210 round count fired in the rifle for sale). 

I can also cash-trade. 
Things I want: 
CZ P-07 Duty in 9mm
Glock 19 Gen 4 (Not Gen 1, 2, or 3)
Possibly an AR Pistol with Sig Brace, but doubtful.

Things you'll be ridiculed for trying to offer me:
Gold
HiPoint
Cobra
Kimber
Springfield
Slavguns (Russian, Romanian, Mosins, Century Arms, etc)
Bubba Guns (hunting rifles, shotguns revolvers)

""But that Price is High?"" 
*dragon kick to the stomach* 
QUIT YOUR SNIVELING. THIS AIN'T UNICEF.
It is fair value minus $150.00! Impeccably kept and cared for, cased and all. you get the case, too.

Want a sling? YOU GET A FREE SLING. IF OPRAH CAN GIVE EVERYONE A CAR, I CAN GIVE YOU A SLING.

So, seriously.. what is the hold up. BUY THIS RIFLE and harness its MAGIC POWER*.

(*Rife may or may not have magic powers, as these claims have not been evaluated by the FDA)

Kahr CM9 in great shape with zero issues and purchased new on 10/8. This Kahr has 49 rounds through it exactly and fires true and extremely accurate. I am looking to sell my CM9 due to it being for my wife and her having a hard time with the recoil and going back to her P238. My CM9 will come with everything it did new along with a Crossbreed Horse Hide SuperTuck Deluxe IWB Tuckable Holster ($79.99) / Don Hume J.I.T. Slide Leather Holster ($22.99) / 1 - 6 Round Magazines ( Only came with one) 1 - 7 Round Extended Magazine ($29.99) Hogue Slide On Grip ($4.99) There is well over $500 in this package with all the extras. If you haven't looked at the CM9 / PM9 and you’re looking for a slim concealed carry option with a great trigger and reliability this may be your ticket. The CM9 is as close to a quality pocket 9mm as you're going to find being smaller than the Shield / XDS / PPS. The CM9 is rated for +P loads as well. I am looking for something else at this time and below are a few things I would be interested in. No black powder / archery / shotguns or antique firearms please.

The M9A1 is an evolution of the legendary Beretta M9 military semiauto pistol, developed with the advice of several law-enforcement and military agencies around the world. The M9A1 Compact With Rail Inox is a smaller and lighter variation that features an attractive and super-resistant stainless-steel (Inox) finish. Its many tactical features, ruggedness and absolute reliability make it a great choice for on- or off-duty carry, as well as personal defense or concealed carry. 
Compact and Super-Resistant 
Compared to its full-size counterpart, the M9A1 Compact Inox is a full ¾” shorter and 2.3 oz. lighter, making it even more comfortable for all-day carry. Also, its shorter trigger-reach will make it simple to shoot even by users with smaller hands--and even for that first double-action pull. While in the holster, its super-resistant stainless-steel finish makes it stand up to sweat even on scorching summer days, while also making it more impervious to corrosion between shooting and cleaning. Includes 2 13 round magazines and one 15 round magazine. Very hard to find. Beautiful gun.

Hello all, 

I have a Kimber Desert Warrior 1911. It has effectively been converted into a Warrior by way of a professional grade black armor coating, a lightening trigger job, and a cosmetic change in handgrips. The gun is in amazing shape and I would say there are well under 500 shots down the barrel. 

I am looking to trade for a S&W or a Ruger GP chambered in .357mag. I will also sell outright for $750 firm. You will need an NC CCP or PPP. 

Thank you

Great gun, built like a tank, rock solid but still an accurate fun shooter.  No idea on round count but every once in a while I take it out and put a box of cheap ammo through it, I've never once had a single FTF or failure in any way with this pistol.

Comes with the pictured rubber grips installed, much nicer than the stock plastic, which I can not find, sorry. 

Comes with 4 preban 15 round magazines, all functioning flawlessly though one will need a spot of surface rust removed.

This gun will fire any ammo you have from the cheapest Russian junk to +P high quality stuff without any hiccups. 

Yes, it's a big gun but I have successfully carried this one concealed with the right belt and holster, and having those preban mags in a heavy, low recoil pistol is a plus.  

This would be a great pistol for a nightstand, or a duty pistol for a guard, fun range gun, or as I had it for SHTF as you can't kill it with a nuke.  If you shop around, you can find 32 round preban magazines for this as well.

In good condition, with appropriate age wear, but functions flawlessly.  Also comes with original Ruger box and manual.

Will be transferred on EFA10 within a reasonable distance to me in the Millbury/Worcester/Uxbridge area. I'm not driving to Boston or Springfield to sell a $350 gun, thank you.
