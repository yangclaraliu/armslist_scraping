This firearm was used one time at a gun range. The pistol is in like new condition. This firearm comes with two 12 round clips. The asking price is firm. Need to use a licensed dealer (FFL Holder) to complete any transactions. Local sale only. Will not ship.
Most of the striker-fired pistols on the market today do not feature an external, manual safety. The G2 differs in being fitted with an external thumb safety that, when engaged, immobilizes both the trigger and slide. The safety is well positioned and swiping it off with the thumb of your right hand as the pistol is drawn is almost a natural action.
Additional safety is provided via a lever on the face of the G2’s trigger, which must be completely depressed or it blocks trigger movement, and a firing pin block that is only disengaged by a full stroke of the trigger.

Costilla Ave Ste B Centennial, CO  80 PH# REDACTED Mil-Spec Monkey Cool Guy Hat DLUX *New Gen Model with removable retractable ear plugs.  MSM Cool Guy Hat DLUX: (Also available in MULTICAM)The foundation of this awesome hat is a true FlexFit hat with the top rivet removed and added on loop fastener. The front panel is approx 4"" x 3"" and the rear is 3"" x 3"" with a 5.5"" x 1"" strip at the bottom for name tapes. There is even a 2"" x 2"" diamond up top if you are cool enough to need IR patches. The end result gives good patch holding capability without looking like a full head of loop. All edges have been sewn down for super smooth no snag functionality. Just in case, cord hangs from the bottom back as a lanyard attach point if high speed adventure comes your way, or as a hat hanger if you are slightly less tactical.The DLUX element on this hat is the integrated hearing protection. Rather than having to hold an extra plug case, these are already close to your head and retractible so no fumbling around. Plugs are included, however the user can use any that are screw-in compatible. To deploy, just pull plugs out of the pouches with enough slack to comforably fit in your ears. When complete, pull the plugs out of your ears and press each retract button which is the whole side of the retractor. The plugs will now be retracted and can be further tucked into the pocket for a cleaner look. Don't worry, these hats are still compatible with sunglesses and active/electronic ear protection. If your plugs ever become damaged or wear out, they are completely replacable with a new set thanks to the velcro backing on the retractors and on the plug pocket.The Multicam costs a bit more since it is done with fancy very weather resistant Multicam Alpha material and matching VELCRO® Brand Multicam loop.   Available in size L/XL 7 1/8” - 7 5/8”, All colors In Stock. Currently available in: Khaki, Loden (GreenishBrown), Black, and Multicam.Per the manufacturer: It is not advised to wash these hats with the retracto plugs attatched as it may damage the retractors. http://www.lifeandlibertygear.com/shop/  Life and Liberty Gear Body Armor, Tactical Gear, Emergency Medical Supplies  Dealers for: AR500 Armor, Hesco Armor, Mayflower R&C, Velocity Systems, Warrior Assault Systems, Condor Outdoor, Blue Force Gear, High Speed Gear, Spyderco, MTEK, Eleven 10 Gear, Spyderco and more  Rifle Rated Body Armor Soft Handgun Rated Body Armor Helmets Plate Carriers IFAK Kits Morale Patches Hats Rifle Slings MOLLE Pouches Chest Rigs Backpacks Pocket Knives"

In fact, the only way to know its not a 45ACP is to look at the barrel. This Colt is fun to shoot, and VERY accurate. There is virtually no recoil because its .22, and the weight of the gun also helps. Gun comes with a Blackhawk Holster and the original box and accessories. Looking to trade for a different handgun.

This helmet was specifically designed to give you the highest level of safety, comfort and modularity currently available in a modern ballistic helmet. The lightweight shell is constructed of high performance polyethylene fibers, and features an undercutting geometric profile that follows the natural shape of your head providing exceptional stability and coverage. Additionally, all of the removeable fasteners have been designed for maximum strength and weight savings in order to further reduce the total system weight. The FLUX Ballistic features a 100% boltless shell. There are zero cuts or holes in or through the ballistic material, assuring maximum ballistic performance. The high cut edge profile was designed to be compatible with a wide range of existing communications headsets and accessories. Lightweight polymer retaining structures are bonded to the outside of the FLUX shell and provide a secure mounting platform for the FLUX M-LOK accessory rails and the Wilcox L4 three hole shroud. Several variations of ballistic side covers and mandible will soon be available to increase the protective coverage of your helmet if needed. The interior Fluxliner™ offers excellent impact protection and is manufactured using a proprietary rate-sensitive foam. Two sets of adjustable comfort pads are included with each helmet, which let you manage the internal layout to customize the interior just for your head. The retention system also features Cam-Loc sliders for ease of adjustment, an ultra-suede chin cup. The ends of the retention terminates with Inverseclips® allowing for easy removal and additional safety.

The gun has a low round count and was cleaned after every time that it was fired. For the right price I have 292 rounds of practice ammo and 30 rounds of Federal HST 147gr +P that I will include.
