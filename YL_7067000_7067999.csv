It has a $200+ professional stipple job, Meprolight (TruDot) three dot night sights with orange tritium in the rear and green tritium in the front, extended slide release, (2) 10rd mags, kydex IWB holster, Fobus OWB paddle holster, Glock mag loader, and case.

I also installed Talon grips over the stipple for a more confortable concealed carry (I don't wear a t-shirt underneath and move around a lot) but that can easily be taken off if you prefer.

Scope is used but all functions have been tested are confirmed to work correctly. Elcan was contacted and they did verfity the scope is a military overun model. These are impossible to find and alot rarer then the 5.56 model. Ive only seen 4 ever for sale and will never be released again to the public bu elcan bc all must go to militaries around the world. This is the scope socom picked for the SCAR 17. So here a chance for someone to complete their scar or any 308/7.62 battle rifle. This is the toughest scope ive ever used and built like a tank. Also picked for sopmod block 2 scope. Looking to get $2000 cash for it or around $2500 in trade. Trades- Salient, Agency Arms, LMT 308, REPR SBR and will consider offers. Cash price is firm, do your research last two sold on ebay for $2500 and more. Great investiment i have never seen the su-230 scopes loose value.Also there is a HUGE difference between the su-230 military model and the civilian specter dr model. The su-230 is built to higher standards and can take a ton more abuse. The reticle is the way better with regular cross hair tree instead of the civilain model with huge circle obsturing your target. Personally i refuse to use the civilian model bc the reticle is horrible. Thus why i only use the su-230 on my rifles. There is a reason why elcan hasnt released any more military overun to the public, bulld time and cost is alot higher and all go strait to military spec ops units all over the world.All SALES are FINAL, No Returns or Refunds because the scope is rare and can be easily damaged if someone mishandles the scope. Thus please ask as many questions as possible and I do not mind sending pictures or videos of the scope and any of its features. Ask as many questions as possible. Only purchase this item if you are POSITIVE this is the scope for you. Once you pay and it, ships, the scope is yours."

This is the tall model and extends from 24 to 62 inches.  This is a great price for these, so it is firm.  The best discount price I've seen anywhere is over $100 plus shipping.If you need it shipped, I understand, but the buyer would pay shipping.When setting it up in my house to focus on distant targets, I found it to be lightweight and rock-steady. The top rest swivels in any direction for moving shots. What I like about it aside from that is that I can adjust the height one-handed, without even looking at it, simply by pulling the trigger – the legs slide out to any length instantly. I found out I could use it to shoot standing up, kneeling, or sitting down.If you're reading this, I still have them for sale! :-)Thanks for looking!"
