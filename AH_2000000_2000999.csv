It is brand new, has never been fired. The cosmoline is still present on the receiver. 
This is a reliable Italian made Fausti shotgun and is constructed with the same high-quality materials that you'll find on guns that cost 2 or 3 times the price of this one.
The wooden stock on it has a beautiful grain and the nickel-plated receiver is finely engraved. It is hard to capture how finely engraved this gun is in a picture, but I tried my best to show it. This shotgun features a brass bead front sight, a top tang-mounted safety, automatic ejectors, a first barrel selector switch near the trigger, and a coin-finished receiver with heavy engraving. It includes two screw-in choke tubes and a soft case.
This gun has never been fired and it shows. It is in pristine condition, not a flaw anywhere.
I have priced it at $750 bucks, I am losing money on it at that price, but I really need to sell it because I have found a shotgun that I really want so I have a little bit of room to work with you on it... If you are interested just contact me and we can work something out.

The Picatinny rail located on the barrel runs from the chamber area to right behind the front sight allowing the use of scope rings (optional) and aftermarket optics.

General Features

With a host of options and configurations, and a broad range of accessories, the AW is a true weapon system. Every component is manufactured from corrosion resistant material or given a protective finish prior to assembly, ensuring an AW rifle will perform reliably and consistently whether used for marine operations, in the desert or the arctic.
The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up.
The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy.
The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate.
Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting. .
The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired.

Safety

The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters. When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged.

Construction

Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel."

The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly.





The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

ALSO SPIKES UPPER 110$  mi BILLET STRIPPED UPPER  140$

All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door.

I have a 1953 Norinco 1953 in good condition (I really don't know how to rate the condition of this rifle, but I'd say ""good"" is conservative).  Matching numbers.  Shoots accurately.  

Comes with an ATI Fiberforce stock, extra receiver cover with scope mount, as well as the original SKS receiver cover...(PLEASE NOTE...scope in pictures is not included).  

Also included is the original bayonet, a ""tri rail"" barrel mount, 2, 30-round magazines (as well as the original 10-round), and 100 rounds of Wolf 7.62x39 ammo.  

I have owned the rifle for 10 or 12 years, and have put maybe 300 rounds thru it.  Fun to shoot.  Cheap ammo.

I can email a few more pictures if you like.  Also, I actually live in Santa Fe, but make frequent trips to Albuquerque."

Firm on price. No Trades.

This is a Daewoo, Model K1A1, (AKA MAX 1, AR-110C) 5.56 NATO tactical rifle. It was only imported into the USA from 1985-1989, and is no longer imported, making it very difficult to find, and highly prized among collectors and shooters. It accepts any standard AR-15 magazines, in 10-15-20 and 30-round and above capacity. It features a collapsible stock, battle-field reliability and easy take-down. The K1 assault rifle was developed circa 1983 by the South Korean company Daewoo Precision Industries Ltd (a division of the large industrial corporation DAEWOO International Corp.) as a replacement for the license-built M16A1 rifles, used by the South Korean Army during the 1970s. The improved version, Daewoo K2, appeared circa 1987 and replaced the K1 rifle in production and service. At the present time the K2 assault rifle and K1A1 carbine are the general issue shoulder arms with the South Korean Army. Semi-automatic only, export versions of the K2 rifle, known as a Daewoo DR-100 (pre-1994), DR-200 (post-1994, both chambered for .223 Remington cartridge) and DR-300(post-1994, chambered for Russian7.62x39mm cartridge), are intended for the civilian and police markets. The earlier K1 semi-automatic versions were exported from Korea as Daewoo MAX-1 and MAX-2 rifles (both in .223 caliber). The K2 rifles were designed as improved variations of the M16 rifle. While retaining most of the M16 design features, Daewoo designers replaced the direct gas system of the AR-15/M16 rifle with the more common and reliable gas piston system, and made several other improvements, resulting in very good combat weapon. 
Technical details: The Daewoo K2 is a gas piston operated, selective fire, magazine fed weapon. The K1rifle and K1A1carbine differs from the K2 rifle by different gas system, shorter barrel with different muzzle compensator / flash hider (K1A1 carbine only), and different type of buttstock. The K2 gas system features a long stroke gas piston, located above the barrel. The bolt group is more or less similar in design to the M16 design, with a rotating bolt that has 7 lugs and locks directly into the barrel extension. The cocking handle is attached to the right side of the bolt carrier and reciprocates when gun is fired. The return spring with its guide rod is located behind and partially inside the gas piston rod, and, unlike the M16, does not take space in the buttstock, allowing for folding or completely retractable butt to be used. The receiver is generally similar in design to the M16 rifle, and is made from two halves, upper and lower, machined from the aluminum alloy forgings, and linked by two cross-pins. It must be noted, however, that Daewoo receivers are NOT interchangeable with any AR-15/M16 type receivers. The trigger unit is fitted with a 2- position safety / fire selector switch, located at the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip: Semi and Safe. The feeding is achieved by using M16-type magazines. Both K2 and K1 rifles incorporate a bolt stop device, which holds the bolt open after the last shot from the magazine is fired. The sighting system consists of the hooded front sight, mounted on the gasblock, and the L-shaped dual aperture rear sight, with one small aperture for daylight conditions and another larger aperture for low light conditions. The range adjustments are made by the rotating knob at the right side of the rear sightblock. Maximum range setting is 600 meters. K2 also can be fitted with the see-thru scope rail just ahead of the rear sight block. The K2 rifle is fitted with the side-folding plastic buttstock and plastic furniture. K1A1 carbine has the retractable steel wire buttstock."

This Pistol is a Belgian Mfg. Browning Hi Power in 9mm Cal. It's a Vet Bring Back and is consigned from the son of the Vet that brought it back from WWII. The Nazi Waffen marks are W140 which appear on the frame and slide. The holster is also Nazi marked and dated 4? I think the last date number is ""4"" but I can't tell for certain due to the fact that the wear from the closure has rubbed it out. The mage pouch for the extra clip is missing from the holster. The makers code is: ""CGN"". The grips are the late war Bakelite style. The bore is excellent with no rust or pitting and the gun test fired fine with no mechanical issues. There are matching numbers on the barrel, frame and slide. The gun retains 70-75% of it's original finish as the photos show. This is a very nice example of a ""bring Back"" rig that would fit great into a WWII collection. The gun qualifies for C&R transfer HOWEVER: PLEASE CHECK YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE BIDDING AS SOME STATES HAVE RESTRICTIONS. CA. BUYERS MUST HAVE A 01 FFL TO PURCHASE. THIS GUN CAN NOT BE SHIPPED TO NY STATE. Please check your local laws on ownership of the 13 rd. hi cap mag. Thanks for looking. Item will be Shipped UPS Ground. Must ship to a valid FFL holder!"

522,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2000522,For Sale:  Surefire X400,"Murfreesboro, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 350,"Listed On: Monday, September 9, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The SureFire X400 combines a brilliant white light with a bright red laser aiming device in one WeaponLight. A high-efficiency LED generates 170 lumens of brilliant white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with good reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The LED has no filament to burn out or break and generates tactical-level light—enough to overwhelm an aggressor's night-adapted vision—for 2.4 hours per set of batteries. The 5-milliwatt, 635 nanometer laser sight, located below the primary light, is nearly twice as bright and much more visible than the nearest competitor. The laser's adjustment mechanism uses Nylok® screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. The white light/laser combination makes the X400 effective in close- to medium-range engagements, ideal for law enforcement, military, and self-defense use. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof. The X400 comes with two adapter wedges permitting rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. An ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation, and a mode switch allows you to select white light only, white light + laser, laser only, or system disable. Optional pistol grip switches permit operation with the top grip finger, leaving the index finger free to operate the handgun trigger. Other switches are available for operating the X400 when attached to a long gun. I am asking $350 obo. If interested text me @ REDACTED for fastest response."

The MN10 lamp/bulb has an output of 125 lumens. The SureFire M961XM07 also supports the MN11 lamp/bulb (not provided in this listing) for an output of 225 lumens. You can buy these MN11 lamps online.

726,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2000726,For Sale/Trade:  DBAL-D2,"Murfreesboro, Tennessee, United States","$ 1,400","Listed On: Tuesday, August 20, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The DBAL-D2 (Dual Beam Aiming Laser) is a multi-function Class 1 Infrared Laser from Laser Devices, Inc.  Being Class 1, it is completely Eye-Safe and available to the general public.  Class 1 IR lasers feature a 0.7mW rating which is not restricted by the FDA. While this is a lower output than the standard 5mW+ IR lasers used by Warfighters and LE Professionals, it is perfectly adequate for targeting at ranges out to 250 yards. This encompasses most ranges at which users will engage targets during night shooting and training.  The DBAL-D2 is designed to be weapon-mounted and act as an aiming system when the shooter is using head-mounted night vision goggles.  With the maximum identification range of the latest Gen3 tubes being between 100-115 yards, the 250-yard range of the Class1 laser is perfect.
At its core, the DBAL-D2 is a civilian-legal DBAL-A2 (AN/PEQ-15A).  It features a Class IIIa visible laser pointer (available in red or green), Class 1 Infrared laser pointer, and Class 1 LED IR illuminator.  The Illuminator is what sets the D2 apart from the legacy LDI Class 1 lasers.  The DBAL-D2 features an integral LED Infrared illuminator, complete with High/Low settings.  At high power, it runs at 600mW, generating IR illumination out to 800 yards (750 yards useable).  This incredibly high power illuminator is an LED, making it completely eye-safe.  What’s more, the 0.7mW infrared laser will not wash out in the illuminator’s beam, giving the shooter clear and precise aiming out to the laser’s maximum range under less-than-optimal lighting conditions.  Please note that the illuminator will “reflect” off walls at high power and close range, effectively washing out the lower power laser.  For these applications, it is recommended to use the illuminator on its low setting.  The illuminator features a variable bezel that can be focused from a wide/short-throw (30°) to a narrow/long-throw beam (2°).
Functionally, the rest of the DBAL-D2 provides the same benefits as the legacy systems.  The Class 1 IR laser works great out to 250 yards and the visible red or green laser is the same as the others.  One difference is both lasers are slaved, meaning that they zero each other when adjustments are made.  This makes zeroing the laser a lot easier.
Physically, the DBAL-D2 features the same robust aircraft-grade machined aluminum housing as LDI’s military lasers.  Obviously, the illuminator housing is larger to accommodate the LED, but other than that, it is about the same size as an AN/PEQ-16B.  It is extremely rugged and can take a lot of abuse.  In fact, when you get the DBAL-D2 in your hands, it is very apparent that it’s built like a tank.  The D2 uses the same excellent HT Self-Adjusting Throw-Lever as every other LDI laser.  This is one of the best quick-detach mounts on the market.  We have yet to find a rail it won’t work on.
The DBAL-D2 is the embodiment of innovation in the civilian night vision market.  LDI listens to its customers and makes products based on more than just what the government wants.  There is no finer multi-function laser on the market.  The inclusion of the infrared illuminator in the unit allows the shooter to free up real estate on the weapon platform for other accessories, or simply condense the amount of things hanging off the gun.  Add in the fact that the illuminator is one of the finest we have seen, and you have a winning product.  Please note: the illuminator is an LED, so there is visible downrange signature.  A visible red light (inherent to all LED’s) can be seen from over 100 yards away when viewed within 2° of the emitter.  This is a very small window, but something professionals need to be aware of. I'm asking $1400. Text REDACTED for quickest response."

Other info: Ive had this rifle for only a few months and have only used it twice. I put two 50 rd boxes thru it and didn't have any issues. The rifle works fine and so do the red/green dot and magnifier. 

Only issue I have is that my fiancé considers it a little too heavy for her. In a few months when my son turns 7 I would like to take him shooting and this rifle wouldn't be suitable for him. So here I am selling this thing.

I purchased this for 84.99 from the DPM website with hopes of running a race gun, but we have hit hard times and need to pay the bills. I'm asking $60 and will ship for an extra $5. Please have a look and if you have any questions; please feel free to ask. I can be reached by email or by text @ nine1eight 8zero1 six2five4. Willing to accept paypal payment. Thank you. 

Below if some information on the system. 

DPM MS Recoil System SPRINGFIELD XD SERVICE MODEL 4"" BARREL 9mm - 40S&W

The Mechanical Recoil Rod Reducer System is a direct replacement for the stock recoil rod and does not change the configuration of the gun. This system works due to the multi spring intricate rod (three springs) and controls the functionality of the gun. The third spring which is contained within the rod controls the movement of the slide so it never rams on the frame.Also accompanying this system are two separate springs so the owner can fine-tune the weapon for his/her personalstandards.


With this system you will have absolute 
control over your weapon 
and a reduction of the recoil while 
shooting and you will protect
your weapons frame from abrasion

* 1. Significant recoil reduction 
* 2. Better control and greater accuracy
* 3. Slide Protection
* 4. Elimination of jams
* 5. Better double-tap concentration
* 6. Improved Firing Speed
* 7. Faster follow up shots 
* 8. No modification is required
* 9. All parts are manufactured precise 
and aligned so we can guarantee you an 
optimum action of this system."

Description	The P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame Sig Sauer pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the Sig Sauer P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular Sig Sauer slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the Sig Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly.

is a compact Springfield XD chambered in 9mm. This has been a very fun and accurate gun, but i need to sell it to get a new sig i have my eyes on.

This gun comes with:

(4) clips, (1) factory hard case, (2) clip belt holsters, (1) clip speed reloader, (1) shoulder holster, (1) in the pants holster, and (1) factory holster.

I am asking a firm $460 for the gun and all accessories. It shoots very well and has been taken care of since day one.  Normal wear is visible on the barrel (where the barrel contacts slide), but is in great condition.  For a full discription of the gun click here.  

For those of you who have never shot an XD, the trigger pull is amazing.  The gun features a palm and trigger safety.  Recoil is very resonable and easy for all sizes of shooters.  Clips fit an amazing 16 rounds and are all in great condition (i’ve barely used a couple of them)."

The gun was originally a reverse two-tone, but I sent the slide into Sig Sauer and had them bead blast the slide to a nice SS finish to match the frame.  I also had the barrel (which only has 105 rounds through it) polished to a mirror-like shine.  I put on a 100.00 pair of black/silver wood grips (pictured) which are actually Sig P220 Equinox grips.  I also have a pair of 75.00 coco bolo checkered wood grips.  I will also include the Hogue rubber grips that came with the gun.  I have installed an SRT (short reset trigger) and put in a black coated stainless steel guide rod, but will include the original parts with the sale.  I have two extra sets of grip screws to include (one set silver, other set black), that I will throw in as well.  If interested, I have an extra Sig factory barrel that is brand new (without package) for an extra 120.00 (these are difficult to find and I paid 175.00 for it a few months ago).  The price is for everything listed except the extra barrel - 1180.00 for package; with extra barrel 1300.00.  If you need a holster, I think I also have an unused Blackhawk Serpa belt/paddle holster around somewhere that I would throw in as well; request this if you want it, otherwise I will not include it.  The gun shoots great and is in excellent condition, but being all stainless, it's a little heavy for concealed carry (for me anyway). Comes with original case and accessories and 3 eight round magazines (it only came with two, so you are getting an extra one!).  Thanks, for looking."
