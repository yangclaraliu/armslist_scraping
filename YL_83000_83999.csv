It's a verticle foregrip with a light, laser, and strobe! Mounts on your standard picatinny rail. GREAT for an AR-15! This light is valued around $200 NIB! Look it up!

This light is VERY bright! We're talking 600 lumen! It has strobe capability, a push button for quick burst of light (you could do mores code with it) AND a laser BUILT ON to the light! The laser is clearly visible at 100 yards. Haven't tested it past that but I'm sure it would work at greater distances.

There are a few scratches on the actual knobs where you adjust the laser. It's not bad. Either way, it still looks great and it works PERFECTLY! Rubberized grip for good retention,  and it takes 123 batteries. 

The batteries are still good in mine and I've used it a good bit in the last six months since I got it as both a gun light AND a flashlight. It comes in the original box/case and it's even got a belt carrying case in the box!

The GLARE® MOUT is a non-lethal visual disruption laser (dazzler, ocular interruption device [OID]) ideally suited for small-arms weapon integration as well as mobile crew-served applications. When a suspect individual approaches a restricted or controlled area, the GLARE MOUT is able to hail and warn that person before shots have to be fired. Its shockingly bright green dazzler beam sends an irrefutable, multi-lingual, cross-cultural message that “you mean business”. Reports confirm that the GLARE MOUT has saved numerous lives of both soldiers and non-combatants in Iraq and Afghanistan.  A hand-held kit is also available for non-weapons-mounted deployment. 

The GLARE MOUT is compact and lightweight and is already approved for use by all branches of the U.S. Armed Services.

• Lightweight, small profile

Rainier offers a large selection of swaged core copper jacketed bullets that are low in cost but substantially high in accuracy. Rainier swages their bullets twice with lead wire in an effort to ensure the tightest uniformity as well as prevention of premature wearing of barrels. While Rainier doesn't publish their own reloading information, they recommended using lead bullet load data when loading their bullets. A roll or taper crimp may be used with their bullets. Rainier recommends a maximum velocity of 1,500 fps. 

These bullets feature a lead core that is completely covered by copper plating. They are resized after being plated with approximately 0.004"" of copper plating. This unique design makes them suitable for most indoor ranges, which often require the use of bullets with no exposed lead. The base is slightly concave to maximize the bullet to bore seal."

Introducing the new Mossberg® 935 Magnum™ semi-automatic 3-1/2” shotgun. Built from the rock-solid foundation of the Mossberg 835® pump action — the original 3-1/2” shotgun — the 935™ is an impressive performer to say the least. Built to handle the hardest hitting 3” & 3-1/2” payloads — this is a shotgun that doesn’t hold back on features either. Just shoulder the 935™ and you immediately appreciate the seamless integration of stock and forearm to receiver. A receiver, it should be noted, that is painstakingly set at a perfect angle to generate instant eye-rib alignment for rapid target acquisition. You’ll appreciate as well the fiber optic sights on both waterfowl and turkey models when used in low-light conditions and the magazine quick-unload button for when the day is done. But make no mistake, the 935™ is not about collecting compliments mounted on the wall. It’s about filling a game bag. With a new self-regulating gas system that vents excess gasses to aid in recoil reduction while eliminating stress on critical operating systems, that’s exactly what it’s set out to do.

The Latest In Hi-Tech Concealment

The 935 Magnum™ is available in a variety of the latest hi-definition camo patterns to blend into your favorite hunting location. Patterns include — Mossy Oak® New Break-Up® and Shadow Grass®, Advantage® Max-4™ and Realtee® Hardwoods® HD Green, all specially developed to conceal you from prying eyes.

This model has the MossyOak Breakup.

Turkey/Waterfowl COMBO includes: 24""w/ Ulti-Full Turkey tube, Adj. Fiber optic sights and 28"" barrel with Front bead Fiber Optic sight and Accu-Mag choke.

Vent Rib, Adj Front & Rear Fiber Optic Sights,synthetic-mossy oak finish, turkey gun,xx-full choke, length- 42 1/4
The new 535 ATS marks a new era for Mossberg pump action shotguns. Influenced by the success of the 3"" chambered 500 and the 3-1/2"" chambered 835, this shotgun brings the best attributes of both models, delivering outstanding versatility without compromising on performance. The 535's ""All Terrain"" flexibility is best appreciated in the field. It's chambered to handle 12 gauge, 2 3/4"", 3"", and even 3 1/2"" magnum loads, for maximum stopping power. The Uni-line receiver design assists in fast target acquisition. With the Trophy Slugster cantilevered scope mount system, barrels can be swapped without disturbing a well-sighted scope. The sleek barrel profile, coupled with a shortened magazine tube, provides a comfortable balance and swing. I also have a 38 special snub nose if any one is interested. Its double action, six shooter. Armscor 206. I would sell it for 175.00. Or trade it for somthing."

It has had a mount upgrade, a GG&G quick-detachable throw-lever upgrade. Decide you don't want it for the moment to switch to a magnified scope? No problem, just throw the lever over, the Eotech pops off, when you want it back on just throw the lever back over it's that simple. It will even generally hold a zero to within .5 MOA or so, no need to rezero!  This optic is in excellent condition, with only a pair of tiny silver nicks on the protective hood which seperate it from looking new.

If you are unfamiliar with this optic, it is a very sturdy, reliable, fast, and effective holographic red dot sight. It features a 1 MOA dot inside a 65 MOA circle, meaning the dot is one inch wide at 100 meters. It is adjustable for several brightness setttings. What's best about this optic that seperates it from Wal-Mart specials is that it is very sturdy. Eotech's are commonly purchased by servicemembers for use on their duty rifles overseas, because they are sturdy, reliable, and very fast on target. 380 and a pick-up in the Stillwater area please.

I will close this out this saturday.
Thank you all for your offers,and though I did get some good ones,my only trade intrest is listed.

I have an NHM-91.
It is dressed in Russian RPK wood and russian pistol grip.
The wood is nice and the grip is brand new,just came in from the ukraine last month.
It has its carry case.
chinese 5 round mag.
chinese somewhat rare 30 round mag.
chinese 40 round mag.
4 pack of romanian 40 rounders.

When I got the rifle the PO put a white sight post,I was able to locate a chinese metal stock sightpost and put it back to OG.
I also fixed the plunger with spring so it locks any muzzle device you put on there in place like a true AK-47 should!
chinese 74 type brake.
chinese AK bipod.
Brand new chinese kit with brass tips and rod.
When the nhm were first sold new,they came with a cleaning rod,but no place to put them on the rifle so most are now lost.
This has a cleaning rod.
Also has a round metal chinese cleaning bottle(how cool is that?when was the last time you have seen a metal one?)
chinese sling.
chinese scope mount and rail for the AK rifles.
The NHM doesnt have a scoperail so I picked this up several years ago at a gunshow for that""incase I want to add a scope""
Looks alot like the mosin scope mount.
it can be adjusted and is very nice milled steel.
I have not seen these mounts at the gunshows in the last few years.

I have put alot of time into this and the pieces that come with it

-Aluminum (Non-Pinching) Charging Handle
Also included:
-6 Hi-Point Magazines
-50 Rounds of .45 ACP FMJ
-17 Rounds Federal Hollow Points

-Factory Charging Handle
-Factory Sights

NOT INCLUDED: Are the various firearms and weapons in the picture.  Also, the Bushnell Tactical Elite Optic currently on the firearm in the picture is not included. Also, the vertical grip in the picture is not the 5 position grip that I am including.

All together what I paid for the rifle as well as the extras are well over $425. So this is a great deal. If you add up retail prices of the rifle, the extras (rails, shroud, charging handle, extra mags, ammo) You would spend in excess of $500 for everything that is included here. I'm am only selling because I have too many firearms that just sit around the house. Only ones I use on a daily basis are my handguns for Concealed Carry."

***Please be realistic with your offers. No I will not take $500 or an off-brand pistol for a rifle that is selling for $900+ on gunbroker without any extras.***"

There is almost no rust on this gun, and there are just a few small marks in the wood.  Better than 90% of the original finish is still there.

The receiver is case hardened, so it has the beautiful colors.  This example really is exceptional as far as the coloring goes.  Serial number indicates it was manufactured in 1980, so it's a ""real"" Harrington & Richardson.  This shotgun is in much better shape than most of the shotguns you see in this price range.

It is a break action, single shot, 12 gauge, and it has a fixed full choke and a functional external hammer.  3"" chamber.

Perfect for shooting trap, cowboy action & SASS, and it makes a great beginner shotgun.  Full choke also makes it a good turkey/bird gun.

The gun has a 3.5"" barrel and holds either 10+1 or 12+1 depending on what magazine you use. Gun comes with two magazines and original case.

As stated by the original owner the gun had only had 20 rounds fired through it until today when I put two magazines through it(22 rounds) for a total of 42. Target is shown in one picture which was shot at 12 yards...I'm a bad shot to!

You obviously can't believe everything someone says but this thing looks new besides some handling marks which aren't very noticeable at all. Only thing really worth mentioning is the mark right below the slide release.

The gun functioned 100%, has a great trigger but only have one issue which isn't the gun's fault. My hands are so dang small for a man that I can't actuate the slide release while in the ready to fire position. Shame because this is a lot of firepower in a small package!

Chambered to accept all surplus and match rounds.

Made off of a vulcan receiver and bolt.( after inspecting their newer design at the machine gun shoot off I WAS EXTREMELY IMPRESSED with the size of the lugs) and the way they have improved their design. NOTHING like their old crap junk design!

Saftey Harbor Muzzle break
(which is extremely effective!)
Shooting 3200fps +/- 700 grain rounds this rifle kicks LESS THAN a 12 gauge shooting 2 3/4 shells.

Timney adjustable trigger set up,  set @ 1.5 lbs

Krieger Barrel 8 groove 1-15 twist, then had it tapered to reduce weight (started as a bull barrel, but the gun weighed 40 damn pounds) so tapered it to reduce weight

BUT, with a bull barrel this kicked as little as a .22 mag rifle,,,that was impressive.

I have some Raufoss MK211 RDX explosive rounds for this, and they are $50.00 per round extra.

I am a dealer so need to transfer this

the .38 smith and wesson is just to give some the idea of the size of this rifle and rounds.

Rifle has had about 50 rounds through it,,,,with no mifires, jambs, sticking or anything.

With API or AP, this will punch right through a 2 inch thick steel plate, (have the plates as proof)

With match grade ammo and a trained shooter, this rifle will hold a 12"" group @ 1800 yards with no problem at all."

It has the original magazine , marked Savage .25-20 or .32-20 (these are like unicorns apparently to find.). Bore is in nice condition, I don't really think it has been used much, shows very little carry wear.

This includes a box of mixed Remington ""Kleanbore 100gr. lead soft point, and Super X Win. JHP rounds, 44 rounds total. This is a nice old rifle, would be a lot of fun in the deer woods.

The ""Sentinel Snub"" version is fairly scarce from what I have seen on some of the auction and HS sites, even more so with the factory bobbed hammer., so it has some interest to the High Standard crowd.

Shows wear and tear from being the knockaround gun for a few decades, original bakelite grips are in good shape, works DA or SA flawlessly, no ejection issues as long as you clean it once every 5 or 6 years, and the bore is great. The hammer is case hardened, that isn't rust you see there.

Just a nice old tin can shooter, these were incredibly well built, reliable ""kit gun"" revolvers, and it is an accurate little shooter as well, just right for the console of the truck, tackle box, or to just take for a walk in the woods. 9 Rounds of a good hot .22 wouldn't be the end of the world as far as a nightstand gun, too.

I am not a dealer, you must have a valid pistol permit to buy this and i must see it when you pick up the gun. I will then give you a bill of sale, you go to the clerk and add it to you license.
If you want it shipped i will need payment in full and a valid FFL to ship it to with a copy of their license, that is the ATF rules for shipping a fire arm.
