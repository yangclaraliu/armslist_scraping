For added safety the rifle's action can be locked with the supplied keys that prevents the hammer from being cocked. The Rossi Rio Grande Lever-Action Rifle has a steel blade front sight with a gold-colored bead, dovetailed into the barrel, and a stamped-steel buckhorn-style rear sight that is ladder-adjustable for elevation and drift-adjustable for windage.

This is my four year old Benelli SuperNova Slug gun. I purchased it brand new to be my deer gun and had to order it from Benelli as they were nowhere to be found. After 7 months of waiting on the gun I never even bothered to use it as intended. It has been sitting in my Liberty ever since.The gun has never been carried in the field or taken on a hunt. I put a total of 5 slugs through it (Hornady) just to test it out when I first got it. It has since been cleaned twice.The gun comes with a ComfortTech Gel cheek riser ($100) as well as the flat one from the factory. My goal was to put a scope on it but never got around to it. If you decided to mount an optic on it you won't have to worry about adding a cheek piece. It also has the three stock shims so you can adjust it to your fit, assembly tool, and original manuals. Sling is also included.My loss truly is your gain on this one. These CryoBarrels are insanely accurate and the gun is like brand new. I just have no need for it.The cheapest I can find this gun anywhere online in stock is $750, and thats only two websites. I am asking $475 for everything or best reasonable offer. I will not respond to low-balls. NO TRADES!!!Deer season is only a few months away!!Thanks for looking!"
