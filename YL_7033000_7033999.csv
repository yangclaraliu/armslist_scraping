I highly doubt it though because this gun is a blast to shoot with the Slide Fire stock attached. Basically shoots full auto legally with a bump style action. I have shot it around 200 rounds and it preforms flawlessly. The received does have the legal case number written with a metal marking pen. Was made in Romania and has import marking for CAI Georgia, VT. This gun is a shooter, not a museum piece. Also included are 4 30 round mags, 1 is a Tapco, the other 3 are metal. Finally, I have 2,080 rounds of Monarch 7.62 X 39 FMJ and 640 rounds of TulAmmo 7.62 X 39 FMJ for a total of 2,720 rounds. All total invested is around $1,650. Make me an offer, but please be reasonable. I am looking for cash only, no trades unless you have something untique like a WW2 German Luger P-08, WW2 German P-38, etc that I will consider.

There is an embargo on these rifles, with people demanding higher prices for the M44 in particular.  What is in circulation is it, with no more expected anytime soon.  B. The owner said he'd place a price of $350.00 on the rifle, and considered it to be a fine example of the Mosin Nagant.  He wouldn't mind buying it for his own collection.C. The rifle has been refinished, but the job was done well.  The bolt and buttplate are painted camo green, but doesn't affect functionality or worth by any means due to it being easily removed by whoever wishes to do so.D. The bore is good, with no signs of being re-bored or counter-bored.Overall, the gun is a good military, Cold War era collectible with a relatively cheap price attached to it.  The ammo is also easily, and cheaply, found.  I've owned it for twelve years now, and I will attest that it is probably the most interesting gun I've ever shot in regards to bolt actions, especially if done at dusk.  It kicks like a mule, but that, to me, is just part of its rough character.  Make no mistake, it's a peasants weapon.  It is considered a SHTF necessity by some.  And, if you're a fan of the Walking Dead, the same model can be seen being carried by Maggie.  Personally, if I can't sell it, I'll just frame it, put an image of Maggie carrying one, then sell it for a couple hundred more to an avid Walking Dead fan.  That is not likely to happen, but not a terrible idea."

Making the pistol even more user friendly, GLOCK has introduced a reversible magazine catch on the Gen4 pistols, now right and left-hand shooters can enjoy the pistol as Gaston Glock envisioned. To tame the recoil of the 9mm cartridge, GLOCK has introduced a dual recoil spring system that not only makes the GLOCK 19 a soft shooting pistol but also significantly increases the service life of the pistol. The GLOCK 19 has changed the semi-auto pistol market as we know it thanks to innovative design, space-age materials and reliability that has defined the GLOCK name. Embraced worldwide by shooters in both professional and civilian circles, the GLOCK 19 has gained worldwide acceptance. Police and military turn to the Glock 19 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments. This pistol is offered with a 10 round magazine for compliance but a 15 round magazine may be fitted where legal. Thanks to the large magazine capacity, the GLOCK 19 has more than enough firepower to be used as a standard sidearm while retaining a compact and concealable form factor for plain clothes officers. Civilian shooters embrace the GLOCK 19 for many of the same reasons as militaries all over the world, but the customizability of the pistol also helps find a home for the compact Austrian pistol in competition circles as well as in the hands of concealed carriers and homeowners looking for a cost effective firearm to defend their families.

Really a beautiful classic firearm with an important part in American history! During World War 1 these revolvers were issued to officers once the demand for 1911s could not be met. This one appears to have been professionally refinished and the timing in single action seems to be a hair off. I ordered the new cylinder arm, to correct the timing and the buyer can have a gunsmith fit the part. Beautiful example of history! Will meet at the ffl of your choosing or can sell to someone with a C&R license. I would prefer to work with someone with a C&R.

Making the pistol even more user friendly, GLOCK has introduced a reversible magazine catch on the Gen4 pistols, now right and left-hand shooters can enjoy the pistol as Gaston Glock envisioned. To tame the recoil of the 9mm cartridge, GLOCK has introduced a dual recoil spring system that not only makes the GLOCK 19 a soft shooting pistol but also significantly increases the service life of the pistol. The GLOCK 19 has changed the semi-auto pistol market as we know it thanks to innovative design, space-age materials and reliability that has defined the GLOCK name. Embraced worldwide by shooters in both professional and civilian circles, the GLOCK 19 has gained worldwide acceptance. Police and military turn to the Glock 19 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments. This pistol is offered with a 10 round magazine for compliance but a 15 round magazine may be fitted where legal. Thanks to the large magazine capacity, the GLOCK 19 has more than enough firepower to be used as a standard sidearm while retaining a compact and concealable form factor for plain clothes officers. Civilian shooters embrace the GLOCK 19 for many of the same reasons as militaries all over the world, but the customizability of the pistol also helps find a home for the compact Austrian pistol in competition circles as well as in the hands of concealed carriers and homeowners looking for a cost effective firearm to defend their families.

The world's first truly dual field of view combat optical sight, the SpecterDR switches instantly from a 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight with the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes. Selected by USSOCOM for elite SpecOps mission, the SpecterDR™ dual role rifle sigh by ELCAN is reliable, amazingly bright and deadly accurate. Whether the mission calls for clearing a building or open-terrain patrol, SpecterDR™ gives you both fast acquisition and long-range target identification. The unique locking lever mechanism brings you accurately back on target every time. The remarkably bright, clear ELCAN optics extend your daylight operations. Why risk yourself and the mission with red dot or fixed telescopic sights that do only half the job? Carry the one and only combat sight that switches between CQB and precision ranged fire mode - in the blink of an eye. Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a brilliant red dot in the center. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN's legendary crystal clear image. In CQB mode, the SpecterDR has by far the largest field of view in the industry. The 4x and CQB Reticles are plainly visible even in the case of loss of electrical power due to battery failure or EMP. The SpecterDR offers the best single solution for Long Range and CQB engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use.

The M-44 was produced as a shorter, lighter, version of the standard M 91/30 rifle from 1944 through 1949. The Russians were searching for a weapon that was more fast handling and practical to carry and thus the M-44 was born. At only 40' overall, this is a very practical carry / hunting rifle and still retains a high degree of accuracy. Each rifle also incorporates a side folding bayonet.

The M-44 was produced as a shorter, lighter, version of the standard M 91/30 rifle from 1944 through 1949. The Russians were searching for a weapon that was more fast handling and practical to carry and thus the M-44 was born. At only 40' overall, this is a very practical carry / hunting rifle and still retains a high degree of accuracy. Each rifle also incorporates a side folding bayonet.
