You can have the firearm safely holstered and when u draw the holster stays in bag, purse, or pants.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
The VanGuard 2 is a minimalist IWB holster.Â  Unlike traditional IWB holsters, the VG2 covers only the trigger guard of your weapon.Â  This unique design eliminates the bulk of a traditional holster, while providing a level of safety and security not attainable by simply sticking a pistol in the waistband of your pants.
The VanGuard 2 can be used multiple ways:Â 
First, it can be used (without the lanyard or the strut and soft-loop assembly) as a trigger guard cover for storage and transportation safety.Â  This prevents foreign objects from finding their way inside the trigger guard and potentially pressing the trigger, while still allowing the slide to be cycled and the magazine released.Â  This gives users the ability to clear the weapon without the danger of a negligent discharge.
Next, it can be used with the static-line tether for on-body (IWB) or off body carry (such as inside a bag, purse, briefcase, vehicle console, etc).Â  This allows the weapon to be safely carried with a chambered round without fear of a negligent discharge, while still being rapidly deployable.Â  The holster can also be removed by catching the nose of the holster and prying it off.Â  This allows one-hand deployment of the weapon even if the tether or attachment point fails to remove the holster.
Finally, the user can attach the strut and soft-loop assembly to create a stable, secure, IWB holster.Â  The complete system is fully adjustable for ride-height and cant, is tuckable for maximum concealment, and fully ambidextrous.

Chambered in 9x18mm Makarov, which is similar to 380 acp but ballistically superior. This is a solid milled steel, military grade firearm with a chrome lined barrel. Cosmetically similar to the Walther PPK, it will fit in holsters designed for the PPK. DA/SA with a decocker and loaded chamber indicator.
This is a 1968 model with a rounded hammer for snagless drawing. The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is very hard wearing. This was done about a month ago by FTW Coatings here in town, and the weapon looks like it is in brand-new never issued condition now. I have also added custom walnut grips that give a more ergonomic fit than the originals. Comes with two magazines, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I have ground down the finger rest on the non matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady xtp defense rounds and the original grips.
With the gun, refinishing service, and grips, I have just over $500 into this pistol, but I will set trade and sale value at $400.
I am looking to make a trade for a quality .380 pocket pistol or .38 snub revolver. Like a S&W Bodyguard .380 or .38, S&W 638, Kahr CW380, CM9, CM40, etc.

735,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3525735,For Sale:  Hidden Compartment Locking Rifle Chest Coffee Table,"Willoughby, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 400,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 19, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"SOLD...     Can build more upon request approximate build time 2-3 weeks. stained or painted any color.

The idea that inspired me to design and build this table was to create a coffee table that has a hidden compartment in it so you can keep your firearms and self defense weapons nearby while at the same time keeping them hidden from thieves, while i agree its a good idea to keep a shotgun or other firearm nearby i believe it to be foolish to keep a shotgun in the closet or under the mattress because thieves and punks could gain access to it more easily. so i came up with the idea to build this coffee table locking rifle chest so you will be able to have your self defense firearms nearby hidden in plain sight and locked up and secure. This is the first of many more table designs i plan on building.   



This table is very heavy and locks shut with a built in lock, i used heavy duty front door hinges to secure it. unlocks with a key. can be locked shut without a key or you can set it to require a key to lock shut, your choice depending on your needs. it can hold 4 full length rifles or shotguns that are 4ft long overall, the rifle rack dividers are removable. i stained the outside a dark walnut color and coated it with 3 coats of polyurethane, the inside is coated with outdoor spar varnish to protect it from any gun oil that might spill on it.  Outside dimensions are 5' ft long by 26.5"" wide, 21.5' high. the inside compartment dimensions are 48"" and 7/8th"" inches long by 16"" and 7/8th"" inches wide by 9""and 1/4"" inches deep.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1â overall length and an 18.5â cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3â (6 per tube), or 14 rounds of 2 3/4"" shells (7 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. You can choose to use different loads in each tube, from shot to slugs!

 The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

 The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.
