This Saiga has 50 rounds through it (most test rounds) and a TON of upgrades!

Saiga (special and limited edition with the ""LRBHO"")
- Kushnapup stock (I kept the tang. With the stock it is about the length of a mossberg 500 with no stock!) Very easy to remove and assemble!
-I installed a ""low brass kit"" which allows it to cycle even the cheapest bird shot!
-Rear sight replacement installed to use scope/red dot 
-Installed side rails and tactical flashlight set-up 
-Eotech XOS2 ""Zombie stopper"" edition (OPTIONAL)
-20 inch barrel
-Door Breacher Muzzle Brake
-Still have the original stock and for end 
-4 Magazines 10 round each (highest quality mags I could find!)

With everything I put into this tactical, semi-auto, mag fed, bullpup, high-brass 00 buck pumping beast of a shotgun, I'd value it at well over 2 grand with the Eotech. You can put a simple red-dot on it if you'd like it without the Eotech. 

Most Saigas without all these amazing features and the stock go for over a grand. This is fully loaded!

No other .22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger® 22/45™ pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 .45 caliber pistol.

In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for .45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Also perfect for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting, the 22/45 is available in a variety of configurations and barrel lengths, each with the same trusted reliability that Ruger has delivered since 1949."

It was made in 2011 by Remington to commemorate 100 years of the 1911. It is a beautiful pistol with scroll engraving on both sides, front and rear of the slide. This pistol has just under 100 flawless rounds through it. I consider it a semi-collectible gun and so mostly it just sits in my safe. I have added a nice matched pair of stag grips but I still have the custom Remington grips that came with it to include. If you Google Remington R1 Centennial you'll get all the info on this pistol. Mine is not the one with the unattractive gold banner on the slide it is the more common of the two with the engraving. It comes with original case and paperwork, unused 1911 tool, take down tool, 2 original mags (I could add mags for right trade), original custom Remington grips and Stag grips. This is a beautiful tribute to the original 1911 with a few upgrades to make it run better than the original ( lowered ejection port, match grade barrel w/polished feed ramp, brass bead front sight ). I'm not selling at this time but I place a value of $1100 on it with the stag grips and $950 without the stag grips OBO. We each pay for our own background checks and transfers. Yes, I have to transfer this pistol. You can email me through armslist or text me at 3o3-9Otwo-563o Thanks for looking!"

Like new, original owner. Made in RUSSIA Saiga AK 47 chambered in 7.62x39mm. Shot very little. I had two, but sold one so made a new post. This beauty comes with a tapco G2 trigger group installed, upgraded trigger/hammer spring, hogue grip, tapco stock. Saigas also have the bolt catch/holdopen lever which is pretty neat as well. It accepts all standard AK magazines. Comes with one 30 round magazine. This rifle cycles and runs flawlessly, and is smoother handleing then alot of my other AKs. Obama banned the importation of saiga/kalashnikov(stiil legal to own though) late last year. They will soon be difficult to find.I can add ammo,more mags, or my other armslist adds for the right trade. Open to hear cash offers, but really looking to trade. Ptp/ptc and ID required. Can send more pictures or info upon request. Please don't offer me your $500 pistol and think I'll consider, nonsense offers will be ignored."

Don’t Miss Out On This “All In One” Training… http://sorenw.1066599.hop.clickbank.net?x=lp260&tid=al

EJ made this “AR-15 Crash Course for people who went out there and bought an AR to protect themselves and their family but don’t know how to use one.

Alot of people are a little intimidated by such a big weapon...and rightly so, because these things are made to destroy and are NOT made for ‘just in case’ situations. If you’re going to use one, it’s because you mean business.

I know I’ve been saying a lot about how dangerous they are….Which is why I wanted to let you know that while you should be careful, it’s not impossible for a complete beginner to learn how to use one. In fact, this course will get you there in just 2 short hours (you’ll still need to pratice of course).

When I said everything about the AR-15, I meant it. This course will have you equipped with enough knowledge on the weapon to feel confident enough to use it should the time come and you need to protect yourself.

You can get this potentially life-saving training all for less than the price of a family meal at your local restaurant. You make the choice.

Made in Hungary by FEG. After the original Browning patents for the Browning Hi-Power (BHP) expired, the Hungarian conglomerate of FÉG developed one of the most faithful versions of the Browning design ever made in quantity outside the FN factories in Belgium and Portugal. The BHP and the FP9 are so similar that many parts are interchangeable between them, including the magazines. So, like the BHP, the Fp9 is a single action pistol. This pistol feels great in the hand – exactly like my 1981 BHP - and has a similar trigger pull. Note: the non-vented rib version of this pistol was exported as PJK-9HP/P9M models. For FTF sale in VA, buyer must be 21+ years of age and have (1) a VA driver’s license, and (2) one of the following: a concealed carry permit, LEO ID, or a copy of VA gun store invoice in buyer’s name in last year.

Someone apparently swapped the original trigger for an adjustable, but that's not a bad thing. As I understand it, in the early 1920's the US Government provided a gun plant for Brazil in Itajuba; Colt built and ran it, provided the machinery, etc. Later the Brazilians took over the plant entirely. In nice shape, seems to work fine, bore very good with minor frosting in a couple areas. Gives the appearance of not having been shot a lot and pretty well maintained. No import marks so I assume whatever came into the US prior to 1968. Nice gun makes a great shooter. Will sell to an Indiana or Ohio resident using an 01 FFL in Greendale, IN or Cleves, Ohio area. Will ship, 01 FFL to your 01 FFL for $20. My e-Bay ID is Rmasters3 and I have over 2,400 Positives."

I would prefer to see a CCW or Pistol Permit even though it is not required for a long gun purchase. This rifle was bought and put up with the intent to buy a scope down the road to add on. I have since decided to sell the rifle and put the funds to another project.
