This ATI GSG-5 1st Anniversary Model 22LR HV is special in many ways. This is the model that H&K, who successfully sued GSG (who makes the guns) for something called “trade dress infringement,” which is the legal equivalent of calling someone a copycat. The final decision was that the current stock of GSG-5 firearms could be sold to the public. So once this stock of original weapons are sold out, the market for collecting this will rise. There were some suttle changes made to conform to the new requierments which are; Change in the grip, Square front sight, redesigned safety selector, intergraded weaver rail, intergrated sling bracket This became the GSG-522. This 1st Anniversary Edition Model GSG-5 is the original Model that H&K went to court over.
The GSG-5 is an identical replication of the MP5, except one great thing: It’s a 22 cal.. Because of the low coast of ammunition the GSG5 makes a perfect plinking rifle, training rifle or serious varmint hunting rifle. Nothing of its kind has ever been introduced in the United States. The user will be impressed with its weight and performance. If you are a varmint hunter you will be encouraged by all the options the GSG5 has to offer with its railing system., faux suppressor  and easy change magazine.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION Falling somewhere between the Scorpion Pistol and Carbine is this oddity. Strange though it may be, it’s perfectly set up for those who desire a two-stamp gun. The extended forend from the Carbine will hide most 9mm and hybrid cans, while offering M-LOK attachment points and boosting the sight radius a good deal. Still using the 7.7” barrel of the standard Scorpion Pistol, a 5” KAK Flash Can extends the barrel to just a hair past the forend. Dual threads of 18×1 and 1/2×28 make fitting a suppressor simple, and adding an arm brace or cheek rest is as easy as can be with our accessory adapter kit. Even simpler is the addition of the factory folding stock, assuming you can stomach the ATF’s current wait times. Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4″ sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants. The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws."

It has a fixed rear valley sight, and an adjustable orange post front sight. The revolver itself is very light for its size, 23.1 ounces. The condition of the firearm is very good, no heavy wear on the metal, oher than a powder burn pattern from the cylinder gas escaping, and no heavy wear on either grips. The barrel is in good shape, but it does have a coating of lead from range use, so the barrel needs to be scrubbed well. It will also include it's original case, the safety keys, and gun lock.It is rated for 357 MAG and 38 spl+p. I have personally fired two boxes of 357 through and plenty of standard pressure .38. The 357 MAG can be snappy due to the gun's weight, but still definitely usable for defense if you wish. it is extremely accurate for its size as well, especially with quality .38.Please contact me if you wish to have any pictures of the firearm or have additional questions. I will only sell to a VA resident, unless you are willing to come to and pay my local shop's transfer fee, which is $50."
