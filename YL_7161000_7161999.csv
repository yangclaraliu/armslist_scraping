This is a no frills AR variant with no dust cover or forward assist. I'm reluctant to sell this rifle at all but I substained an injury that required surgery and weeks off of work and I need to supplement my missing income. The rifle is in great shape and condition as I take care of my stuff. I have put a few hundred rounds through her with no problem at all when using quality mags. The factory mags suck! The forend grip turns into a decent bipod which works well with the kids learning to shoot this caliber and keeps them from handling the more expensive rifles. I also changed out the factory grip to a houge grip and added some middle class flip up iron sights. It also has a Daniel defense pepper box muzzle break. Rifle will come with the 2 factory mags only. I can swap out the furniture to stock if you want the price to be lower. I prefer to deal with ccw holders as I am one myself. Would have to meet in my area cause I can't drive right now. Thank you for looking. Please text only to 216 five five one- four three seven five. Feel free to shoot an offer.

History: By the early 1960’s, the gunsmiths and job shops of northern Italy became very adept at supplying US replica importers.  The business of reproduction firearms manufacture became particularly successful and organized around Brescia.  There, several family shops thrived and grew into enduring, world class gun makers.  Uberti and Pietta remain today.   Armi San Marco, Armi San Paolo, and Jager were very successful over the 70’s and 80’s.Armando Piscetta and his Loano company Armi Jager started building Peacemaker clones in 1962.  A small importer, Inter Continental Arms of Los Angeles, began selling it in the US.  Inter Continental called it the “Dakota”.Jager’s early single action was significant as Italy’s first Peacemaker clone.  More so, it was quite a bit better than the Sauer revolver.  It was finished nice, functioned well, and still affordable.  It established a reputation for quality among the Italians & Americans. ."

This is a no record gun unfortunately. A lot of these early fluted guns went to some interesting places like Richmond, Va. and New Orleans. Unfortunately, there is no way to know. Grips are very good and there is an “A” carved in the left hand side of the grip by the frame. Very neat all original Colt Fluted Army!Any questions?

This rifle is perfect for someone looking for a plinker, target shooting, cowboy action, or just about anything you could want from a .22!  It's rugged, it's got a nice smooth action, it feels well built, and it shoots straighter than I can.  It's practically new-in-box. (I can even provide the box that it came in if you would like) We have shot the gun a grand total of around 10 times, but have put about 300 rounds through it.  I've never had any failures to fire, and never had any feed or extraction problems. The manual and website states that the gun has a 14 round capacity but I've been able to squeeze 15 +1 into the rifle's tubular magazine.  All-in-all, I would say this is the perfect gun for just about anybody looking for a nice simple .22, with the added bonus of being extremely fun to operate with that lever action.
 
I would like to try to get rid of it relatively quickly for convenience's sake, but I would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have.  Asking 300 OBO.  If this posting is up, I still have it! I'm also including about 200 rounds of .22 with the gun!"
