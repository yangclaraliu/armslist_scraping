Overall, for a 100+ year old gun its in very good shape with only several small spots of rust, a few scratches and dings in the stock, and some patina and wear in handling areas (ie the barrel above the forearm, hammers, etc.). Most, if not all of the Damascus marks are visible in the metal- Damascus has a design like this: )))))))))) Some slight cracks and chips around the receiver. Barrels are in very good shape externally, however they are pitted quite a bit inside since it was used with blackpowder. The barrels are made of Belgian Laminated Steel, due to this the gun is not safe for modern shells. I am not the original owner so i dont know the past of this gun and what it has been put through. As far as I know, all parts are original and present, and I have had it inspected by several competent gunsmiths.***Due to the Damascus design, I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST USING MODERN SHELLS***My number is 585750350three, my name is Riley- feel free to text or call for pictures and information    $275 or best offer"

Chambered for the 7.62x39mm, this rifle has a 16-1/4"" chrome lined barrel with threaded muzzle brake and bayonet lug. The Chinese AK's are highly respected and are among the best available but thanks to the Clinton era import ban, they have been getting harder and harder to come by. The thicker 1.5mm stamped receivers are more durable than many of the 1mm thick Eastern block rifles, and the Chinese guns really are built to last. This rifle is in excellent original condition and I'd grade it about 99% overall. There is no rust or pitting. The stocks are in excellent condition with just a few tiny handling marks (these rifles seemed to ship new with a few handling marks). This rifle was a relatively early Sile import and has a blued bolt and the /66\ arsenal marking on the left side of the trunnion. The serial numbered parts are all properly matching, including the bayonet! The mechanics are in perfect working order (AK's are good for that!) and the bore is excellent. Internal inspection confirms that this rifle is absolutely unfired since it left the factory! It comes in the original box that numbers to the gun and includes all three 30-round mags, cleaning rod, bayonet with scabbard, sling (still sealed in plastic), buttstock cleaning kit, port cleaning tool, oil bottle, and owner's manual. They just don't get any better!"

This is also desirable because it has the triangle factory 66 84S-3A military designation marked on the trunnion. As a collector of AK's, I also love the sharp edge '6' on the rear sight leaf. This is a premium PRE-BAN AK. This is a pre-1989 ban rifle"

A favorite of collectors, Winchester commenced production of the M1 in December of 1940.Having seen some degree of rebuild, the rifle does retain several Winchester components, including the bolt, with some clear later-war time replacement parts, among them the Springfield production rear sight and gas assembly. Additionally, the rifle is fitted with a desirable Danish VAR barrel-regarded by shooters as one of the best barrels ever produced for the M1-which confirms it's post-war service with the Danish military. A fine example for the shooter with broad-ranging collector appeal, this early Winchester M1 would be suited to any military or WWII arms collection.Very good condition, the rifle has seen no post-service refinish and retains around 70% phosphate finish with the small parts showing the most wear. No rust or deep pitting are present and all markings are correct, with no import mark, suggesting that this weapon was imported by the CMP."

Comparable to the M1 Garand. The gas flow can be regulated just like the FN FAL, of which this is the precursor. The gas system can be turned off to shoot like a manual repeater. This feature was originally for launching grenades.This particular rifle is the rare Venezuelan model chambered in 7X57 (7mm Mauser), ten rounds capacity. Only 8,012 Venezuelan models were made. All matching numbers, correct markings, cartouche, crest, etc. The bore is like new, shiny and sharp. The original finish (enamel over parkerized) is in good condition for such a rifle, with some enamel wear on the magazine, trigger guard, a few spots on receiver. Everything under the hood is in excellent condition. The rifle has been fitted with the recommended two-piece firing pin and the original one-piece firing pin is included.The french walnut stock is quite handsome, but has been tampered with at some point...a previous owner tried to sand the pistol-grip area down to fit his small hands, or maybe make some kind of target stock profile. At least that's the story I got when I bought it years ago. By then it had been restored to the proper shape and thickness with a fiberglass repair kit, and it has been done very well (see photos).I shot just a few rounds through this rifle to adjust the gas setting for PPU ammo. It functions perfectly and is accurate. I have 15 boxes of new, non-surplus, PPU ammo (300 rounds, worth about $250) that go with the rifle."

Minor slide wear, but nothing excessive or concerning. The frame is in great shape as well, given the age of the gun. The mags show more wear than the gun itself. Obviously I can't tell you how many rounds have been put through it, but it's a USP, so it's not much of a factor. Since I've owned it, I've put three or four hundred rounds through it myself with no issues with brass, aluminum, or steel cased ammo. Everything has fed just fine with no hiccups. It has H&K's V3 trigger, which means it is decock-only; there's no safety. The gun has an AC date code, which places it as a 2002 manifacture. It comes with three 12-round HK magazines. No case or paperwork. Would prefer buyer to be a TN HCP holder. Will not ship, likely will not come to you unless the deal is heavily in my favor. The only trades I'm interested in would be a CZ Scorpion, or an FN FNX-45 Tactical in FDE.REDACTED for faster responses."

The sight works great, but he put a couple of punch marks on the side of the sight. The marks are small and I have pics of them. Please text 205-223-390three, or email for all pics.

VKT (Valmet) marked 1942 production on a 1901 tang dated receiver. Beautiful shooter, arguably the finest Mosin-Nagant variant ever made. She's in full wartime configuration barring the sights. I've replaced the rear notch with an aperture and the front blade with a thinner target profile blade. Both are drop in parts, nothing has been modified on the rifle and the originals are included. I'll include a Russian double ammo pouch along with a few stripper clips, and an original Finnish cleaning kit with all the fixings including an SA marked oiler. The ammo in the picture isn't included, I ended up shooting it. Really don't want to sell her but I'm wanting to get another vehicle before hunting season. Reasonable offers will be entertained, only trading I'd be interested in would be as a partial trade (with cash or other guns on my end) against an older Jeep Cherokee, Grand Cherokee or Comanche.

I left, came back, and my roommate was gone and so was my brand new Beretta 96FS. 10 years later, Tigard Police call me up and tell me that I could pick up my hand gun! Seems it got into some bad hands, and was picked up in a drug sting. They held it in evidence trying to pin it on someone. Strange world, right? Anyways, I like the weapon, but bought a new car. So, I could use the money. The weapon comes in an evidence box!!! You'll have to buy up a carrying case for about 20 bucks, but it is in great shape. Unless the FBI used it as a trainer and restored it, it has less than 100 rounds down the chamber. A tiny scratch in the finish, you may not see above the hand guard is evident. The rifling looks clean. It's probably just been sitting for a loooooong time. (No rust evident)As far as the weapon is concerned. It's .40, I like them better than Glocks, but not as much as M&Ps. Single stack, solid weapon. If you served, you probably know exactly how to handle these things and that is a plus! The FS has no real safety. It has a decocking lever, instead of a safety. So, it is shooters preference. I never liked the standard Beretta's safeties, so I like this model better. Anyways, that is the story and the deal! We'll do a transfer that will come out of the price, and if you want. We got 100 rounds to test fire it, if you have a range you want to meet at!"
