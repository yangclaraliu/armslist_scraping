Put an XD® Mod.2® in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch larger than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact.

To reinforce it even more you could easily fill the void with an epoxy or something similiar.

There are 4 total bolt hoding the magwell to the reciever, 2 infront of the trigger and 2 behind. Cutting off the flange entirely will still leave 1 bolt behind the trigger. An entirely new mag adapter can be bought for $270.

If that isnt rare enough, this gun is believed to be one of a couple thousand rifles built by the Navy for Marine Corps marksmanship training in the mid 1960's per lack of enough M14 rifles. As with all those guns, this one has a 7.62mm barrel as built on a special contract with SpringField Armory in 7.62mm NATO(308) correctly dated 1965. Springfield Armory made no other 7.62mm Garand barrels! This example is in exceptional shape, and appears to be all IH except the trigger group & barrel.

I am selling this Rifle as used only because I am the Original Owner. It has NEVER been fired and am only selling it because of suffering a recent stroke and just have to many bills rolling in. The story behind this Rifle is I purchased this Firearm from my Local Dealer a couple of years ago, and just got it set up to take to the range this spring, and had a few medical issues, so I can no longer continue this project."

Bluing is a great condition, and timing and lock up is great.  Now you can own a piece of history with a revolver from the Smith & Wesson Classics line. The Classics bring timeless and coveted models back in production. Each model, known for its legendary performance, has been enhanced with modern advantages. Smith & Wesson Classics embody the best of both worlds. This small revolver, designed primarily for plainclothesmen and off-duty police officers, made its public debut at The International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in 1950.  At the conference, the Smith & Wesson sales force asked the police chiefs to vote on a name for the new revolver.  The most commonly suggested name was .38 Chief’s Special®.  Designed with the needs of law enforcement officials in mind, the Chief’s Special proved to be a popular revolver for personal protection due to its size and weight. When Smith & Wesson adopted model numbers in 1957, the Chiefs Special became the Model 36. Smith & Wesson J-Frame revolvers have had your back since 1950.  These small revolvers were designed to fire full power rounds and are as simple and easy to use as they are reliable. It is no surprise that the Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular, small-frame, defense revolver on the market.   Ammunition and accessories are all 5% off with the sale of a firearm.  ------Specs:------ Caliber – .38 Special Capacity – 5 Barrel Length – 1.7” Over All Length – 6.7” Weight – 23oz.
