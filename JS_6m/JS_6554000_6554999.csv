All of the edges are sharp, and does not show signs of heavy use, just finish wear and cleaning. Most of the rifle is a pleasant plum to silver/patina including the barrel and magazine tube. The bore is fair for an early Winchester being a balance of roughness and shiny spots with defined rifling - Rates 6.5/10 in my opinion. Wood is very good with excellent fit and no repairs or cracks. Action locks up tight and is very crisp for an antique 1873. An honest example of an 1873 in the best caliber with a long barrel! Letters with the Cody museum and will come with a serial number search sheet confirming the configuration."

Most of the factory original varnish is present on the butt stock and forend. No refinishing has been done. The wood has some light figure to it as expected on a special ordered takedown rifle.

Air filters – The air filter may seem small in the gradn scheme of things, but it does an excellent job of preventing dust from coating some of the more vital parts of your engine.2. Quality car tires – As the only part of your Forte family car that actually touches the road, the performance of your tires is crucial to the safety of your vehicle.3. Serpentine belt – The accessories in your Kia Forte are powered by the seprentine belt. The accessories in question include the water pump, alternator, and air conditioning compressor.4. Spark plugs – The task of changing the spark plugs is a little tougher than the other maintenance items mentioned already, but it’s well worth the effort. A fresh set of plugs can deliver an improvement in performance and fuel economy.5. Brakes – You don’t really realize how important your brakes are until you are forced to use them in an emergency situation. A good set of working brakes is essential to the safety of you and everyone else who takes a ride in your Kia Forte 4-dor sedan or 5-door hatchback.6. Oil changes – One of the easiest ways to keep your car running as smoothly as possible is to make sure that you maintain a regular oil change schedule. A good motor oil will keep all of your engines moving parts lubricated and safe from the negative effects of heat, friction, and combustion.Phone : 888 284 4718Web : www.westsidekia.com"

Here's the skinny.Glock Gen4 19 MOS bought new by me at ECC in J-town when they first arrived. She comes with everything she came with from the factory (other mounting plates, three mags, ext), the installed Ghost Inc. EVO Elite Trigger Connector (that has ZERO over travel, awesome must feel), suppressor height sights to co-witness the RMR. The RMR is a RM-02. The battery has been in it since the Christmas of 2015, so it should need changed sometime soon. But currently to me the 6.5 moa dot, is the best choice for pistol optics.(I just took it off and mounted it to an AR, But it can go back for the right price) The TLR-1-HL is also included. Only because the pistol is coming with a nice Kydex holster that only fits the 19 with the light on it.

It could be discribed as a cross between a normal AR15 and an AK. I have both an AR15 in .223 and an AK so for fun shooting it's to close to my other guns. The round is also more for hunting and I don't hunt. Also the round is used for its subsonic capibilities for silencers, and I have no interest in silencers. Therefor I have decided to sell it and use the money for a different build like a 450 bushmaster or an AR10.Included:Complete AR ready to fire, 30round mag, some ammo (around 10-30 rounds I have to check), some brass, and 2 sets of dies Lee collect dies and hornyday 2die set.price:$600 just the gun and mag $650 everything dies, ammo and brasscontact:chase call or text 920-428-777fivemeeting: i cane meet in Appleton Oshkosh or greenbayi work in Clintonville so anywhere up there as welloffers:i will take offers and trades as well just ask worse I can say is no."

Ideal for handloaders who use a rotary or magnetic tumbler and want their brass cartridges to be sparkling clean inside and out. The media can be used with brass cases with any primer pocket or flash hole size without fear of having stuck pins.Created from extremely tough 302/304 stainless steel, these pins will last for thousands of cleanings. The pin dimension was specifically designed such that the pins will not get jammed sideways or side-by-side in the primer pocket or flash hole.These 302/304 stainless steel pins are magnetic. The process by which it happens is called Martensitic Stress Induced Transformation (MSIT). This allows you to easily separate and pick up the pins with a strong magnet. We recommend using a rare-earth neodymium or large coated ceramic magnet to capture all the pins that fall out of the tumbler.Diameter: .047""Length: .255"""

Originally purchased for my better half, it has had about 250 rounds down the tube. The plastic case, owner’s manual, cleaning rods, lock and one magazine are included. The condition is excellent.Would be a good, economical pistol for your truck or bug out bag."
