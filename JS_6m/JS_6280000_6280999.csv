Please Note: this item is only available for local pick up around the Cincinnati Metropolitan area (West Chester, OH). The picture posted is not of the actual parts kit for sale, as it's currently boxed up and I haven't taken pictures of it yet. The picture above does represent what the parts kit is. I encourage anyone who is serious about purchasing this kit, to include your phone number in your email, so that we can discuss any questions that you might have prior to meeting. I also encourage the buyer to fully inspect the parts kit, prior to purchasing. I want my customer to be completely satisfied with their purchase. 
 
You get everything that I received with this kit. Because this does not contain a receiver, it is not considered a firearm, and does not require an FFL background check, however I require that the buyer must show a form of government ID (state of Ohio drivers license) to confirm date of birth, as this item is only for sale to those who are 18 year's of age, or older. Also, by purchasing this parts kit, you the buyer attest that you are a United States national and that there are no laws preventing you from lawfully owning this parts kit. 
 
I'm selling this parts kit as I already have two other parts kits, and I've decided that I no longer need three. I'm asking $250.00 USD since I'm trying to sell this as fast as possible, so my loss is your gain.

By the end of 1863, most Federal infantrymen were armed with either this musket or the Enfield. This 58 caliber reproduction percussion rifle has a 40"" barrel with a 1 in 66"" twist. Features a one-piece American walnut oil finished stock, birght steel finish, military style sights, steel buttplate, trigger guard and barrel bands and a swelled ramrod like the original. The lock is marked ""1861 Springfield"" and is emblazoned with an eagle. 
This has never been fired and comes with 58 caliber balls and caps (no powder), and leather sling.  Look it up on line at Midway, etc. to see that my asking price is very fair since the musket alone sells for $999.00 plus tax and shipping.    Absolutely NO shipping, NO trades, and no other photos will be sent out.  I have done my best to photograph and accuratly describe this rifle and will only deal face-to-face with serious buyers - period.
