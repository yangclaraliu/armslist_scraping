The .338 Lapua Magnum is a hard-hitting, heavy recoiling round, though with a 26"" barrel and muzzle brake on a gun weighing in excess of 10 pounds, the Savage 110 FCP manages the recoil well allowing shooters to concentrate on placing shots with precision. The 110 FCP features Savage's AccuTrigger® that is fully adjustable to provide a light, clean, crisp break at the shooter's desired pull weight. A HS Precision synthetic stock beds the barrel action solidly for consistent accuracy in changing environments. The 5-round detachable magazine facilitates loading and unloading, and the 3-position safety allows chamber to be loaded and unloaded with the safety engaged. Fluting on the barrel enhances rigidity, and speeds in cooling. The Savage 110 FCP Bolt-Action Rifle comes with a Picatinny rail for mounting the optical sight of one's choice. The entire rifle is finished in matte black.Manufacturer model"

This gun is only slightly larger than the Glock 19 which is a highly regarded carry gun. This is the V7 of the 45c which means there are more upgrades and desirable features. This gun shoots extremely smooth and soft. Without question the softest shooting .45 I own. Unfortunately I have some other priorities that i have to let this gun go for some extra cash. There is slight holster wear on the top left of the slide but otherwise, this gun is flawless. The two included holsters are from candgarms.com and you will be able to carry concealed out OWB. Both are for right handed shooters. This gun has the outstanding LEM trigger with the factory lighter version for a smooth, crisp trigger.

I purchased this gun because of how many people rave about how great the fingergroove-less frames are. Turns out my hands prefer the fingergrooves. Modifications include Trijicon night sights (clearly not new, but still visible in low light) and a flat-faced trigger (appears to be a Suarez International, but I don't see any logos on it). The barrel has some wear (it's a 22 year old gun after all), but much less wear than my other Gen 2 police trade-in guns. The gun DOES have the locking block frame cuts, so you don't have to worry about stress fractures.This gun will be transferred FTF through an FFL (so have a PPP or CHP). I will pay the transfer fee if the transfer is at Fuquay Gun and Gold. I can provide more pictures upon request. Thanks for looking!"

Last Chance! ***,"30 - 45 Minutes West of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida",$ 400,"Listed On: Saturday, October 29, 2016",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Beautiful Mosin Nagant CarbineThe pictures do this no justice. This will be the last time I list this for sale. It's a Mosin Carbine I bought a few years back and one of the few Mosins I have kept in my collection. I only keep guns that I find are prestine enough that I may not find another in its condition which I believe this to be one of them. ( The ONLY thing wrong with this rifle ( that I have seen ) is the trigger pull. The trigger pull has a couple seconds of delaying the firing pin when pulled, but you can buy a brand new match grade trigger ( such as Timney ) that literally drop in for around $50. Which is what I had planned for the rifle, but I'm getting into newer guns and need to let a few old ones go even though the prices of these have doubled in the past years and will probably continue rising.) The gun also comes with an unserialized Bent Bolt ( these sell for $60+ easy alone in the condition this one is in. Looks professionally done or like an actual bent bolt pulled from a Mosin Sniper. I wouldn't sell it though as it makes for a much smoother operating action when used. That will be the buyers decision though. A regular beat up Mosin Carbine sells for $300-$350 easy these days so I'm asking $440 FIRM as people are starting to recognize the potential of this cartridge and rifle. I've been seeing modern guns are even starting to be produced in 7.62x54R now such as brand new AK Sniper Kolishinkov is still producing. This is one of the best rounds you will ever find and especially for the prices you can find them at in the surplus market.  I love the history behind the Mosin, the caliber , and the carbine models which are super hard to find these days from what I've seen so I won't be lowering the price. Sorry, so please no offers besides the listed price. I will sell the rifle and bolt separate if you do not want the bent bolt. ( I'm not selling the bolt unless the rifle is sold first though ) I'll sell the rifle alone for $400.I may POSSIBLY trade if the value is above the value of mine ( I'll set the trade value at $500 as I would rather have cash, but am willing to help you if you want the Mosin bad enough and the deal helps me as well ). Items that may be of interest. We will figure cost differences and if I need to add cash or you after talking.- AK's- Tristar Tec-12 semi-automatic/pump 12 gauge - Kel-Tec SU-16C ( Only the C Model or any model you can fold and still be able to fire) - Kel-Tec Sub 2000 / Sub 2K in 9mm Glock Magazines.- FNX 9 with Decocker and preferably a compact model ( will entertain the .45 if presented )- Beretta 92FS Compact or the Type M ( either one )- Nice pre built .308 AR lower receiver - AR-15 parts such as a nice drop in trigger or other higher end products, the newer AR built drum magazines that hold 50 + rounds but aren't to bulky. ThanksLocated close to Jacksonville ( about 30-45 minutes west. Towards Lake City, but can meet at a reasonable distance if the deal is worth it for me )If interested please text me at 904-5zero9-0517 with what you have to offer.

I bought the gun a couple months ago after trying to find a nice WASR 10 but having no luck. Then a coworker was needing some cash and sold me his WASR 10 for a deal I couldn't refuse. Therefore I'm selling this RAS47 as I have no need for two AKs. The gun only has 40 rounds of Golden Tiger FMJ fired through it. I cleaned it well, oiled, and greased with Mil-Comm TW25B before shooting, and shot the 40 rounds. Made a slight adjustment to the sights and had it dialed in nicely (shooting 2-2.5"" groups) at 100 meters. I then cleaned, oiled, and greased again and she's sat in the safe since. I will also throw in two Tapco 30 round mags with the gun.  Price is $620 OBO. Not really looking for trades at this time. I will sell only to Alabama residents with a valid/non-expired drivers license and prefer you have a valid/non-expired concealed carry permit. Also be willing to sign a bill of sale. I live in the Grant area but work in Huntsville near the Gate 9/Research Park area, so I would be willing to meet anywhere in between. Thank you for looking, and I hope this AK can be of use for you. -Mike"
