This batch had the lanyard loop delete unlike the first batch. Frame, slide, and barrel have about 800 rounds through it. I had the original OD green armory-koted in black instead. Gun is still tight as the day I received it. Some finish wear coming off of the slide near the muzzle (I don't particularly like SA's armory-kote as it wears pretty damn easy...). I never used the factory magazines, as I have a set of Wilson's and Dawson that are far more reliable.Included with this gun is a complete ignition set that was hard tuned by a very reputable gunsmith (PM me for details, as I no longer have the receipt). The hammer is a Hearthco Vector, which was made per Apex Tactical (yes the M&P guys) request. They really got this one right and it is one of the BEST hammers I have ever had the pleasure of using (it's up there with SVI and Limcat). Strut, Sear, and Disconnect is made by Extreme Engineering, which is exactly the same as Cylinder and Slides parts. Trigger is a 10-8 Medium Flat that was also armory koted. There is a brand new Clark Leaf Spring for you to tune yourself if you so choose, but the existing spring in the gun can be used in conjunction with these other parts for a crisp 2.5# trigger. I shot it a few times and took all the parts out for a cleaning and reinstalled all the original parts. I had this set made because I was curious about the Hearthco hammer, so since it is tuned for this specific gun, it must be sold with it.Gun also comes with:Harrison Design Forged Extreme Service Slide Stop (BLUED & FIT). I had this fit by the same gunsmith who did the trigger and it is my favorite slide stop by far.10-8 VZ grips with super scoop w/ 10-8 grip screws.10-8 G.I.

It's old and looks it. Not beat to death but worn. I've never seen one of these on Armslist before, nice antique. Still locks up tight and both triggers cock when the barrel is opened, and it fires both barrels when the two triggers are pulled. I've never shot it, but the guy I bought it from is quite a bit my senior, and I'm in my mid 40's, he said he used to rabbit hunt with it when he was a kid with standard 20 gauge shells. I can't say that is safe or is not safe. I would check it out thoroughly before using it. Great vintage antique for the wall, as that was my intention, but I guess it could be used too if inspected thoroughly and matched with correct 20gauge ammo and pressures for that era. Need cash, but I always consider trade offers, I like guns."

Made in 2009.  I bought it used in 2010 to practice double action rather than put any wear on my constant companion .38 AIRWEIGHT. While condition is very nice, I never had the box for it. This is a nice size for a man or woman, CCW, home protection, or target practice at realistic distances. It's light, has a good sight radius (for a snubby), smooth, and strong  STEEL with an easy to cock hammer and .357 capability. Like all S&W single/double actions made after 2001 it has a never used internal lock. If you're looking for a small .357 Magnum, you might want to TRY a lightweight before you buy. Some find the plastic/aluminum .357's to be unpleasant to use compared to a steel snubby.  I bought a brand new one just like it over a year ago but can't bear to use it since tihs works perfectly. I would sell it unfired in SER. # box for $700, but really prefer to sell the used one.    I DON'T DO PICTURES OF ANY KIND so available for local cash sale to OHIO resident only, NO shipping, trades, or B.S. offers, CCW holder preferred.

We machine this bad boy out of 7075 billet Aluminum and finish it in a durable Type III Hardcoat Anodized finish. Of course, we cut the M4 feed ramps before the Anodizing process to avoid reliability issues down the road. We also flared the side walls of the receiver to eliminate accidental bolt release problems and we also machined the upper receiver in a way that lets you use the popular Magpul BAD lever or other aftermarket bolt catch levers which most other billet upper receivers don’t let you do. Because of our beefier design, it allows for less flex than forged upper receivers. We also play nice here at Spike’s Tactical and because of that, we machined our billet upper receiver to accept most aftermarket rail systems as well as pre-install the forward assist and the ejection port door. Just like how our billet lower receiver utilizes set screws to retain everything in place, the forward assist is held in place with a set screw for easy disassembly if you ever need to in the life of this upper receiver. Our billet upper receiver matches our billet lower perfectly, but it also works great with standard forged lowers so it’s fully up to you on which receiver you want to use. Get one today and make your next build the envy of everyone at the range! Features  Machined from billet 7075 Aluminum with a Type III Hardcoat Anodized finish M4 feed ramps machined before the Anodizing process Flared side walls to eliminate accidental bolt release Pre-installed forward assist and ejection port door Works with the Magpul BAD lever and other aftermarket bolt release levers Spikes Tactical engraving Works with most other aftermarket rail systems    Included  Spike’s Tactical billet upper Gen II receiver (stripped) Forward assist and ejection port door cover come pre-installed Spike's Tactical Lifetime Warranty"

This gun dates to 1918 and Was built on a spare model 1917 frame, since Colt's government contract had just ended, there were still many parts lying around. All model 1917s were in .45 ACP using moon clips, so this was a gun produced for the civilian market. Given that the war ended in November, there is but a 1 and a half month window in which this revolver could have been built. This variant is therefore very uncommon. The condition is very good, the cylinder is tight with only a tiny bit of slop. I have fired it quite a bit and it performs very well. The bore is clean and the rifling is strong. The nickel is not factory but it was done very well and is quite old. The only flaking is on the hammer where it interfaces with the frame. price is negotiable."

Comes with 3 15rnd mags, hardcase, Legion logo softcase, Legion challenge coin. All paperwork. It is registered with Sig, that is how I got the legion logo soft case with challenge coin and yes it does transfer with the new owner. No paper work needed because it is in Sigs system no matter who owns it they get access to all the legion products, all that is needed is the serial number.Gun is in very good condition with one little mark at the font of the slide which you can barely see unless you look very hard other than that which is nothing the gun is one of the better used ones i have seen and is in like new condition. I take very good care of all my guns. The gun shoots great with not many rounds fired threw it at all. Only trading because I don't really use it or carry it, in fact I never carried it and it has never been holstered. The Grey works trigger they come with is awesome, it has a adjustable back stop, DA or SA, and a very very short reset with all polished internals. This is how it comes from the factory and the x ray night sights are truly one of a kind and you will have no problem with sight acquisition. You ask why are you wanting to get rid of such a nice gun? I am a 1911 guy, I own many Sigs and all 1911 accept this one and my 320. This gun just did not fit my needs but we all have our own taste and needs out of a firearm. I am sure this gun will make its new owner a very happy person. Honestly I rather trade for what I am looking for then spending more money to buy it and still have a gun I will never use. This is not fare to the gun to be stuck in a safe lol it needs to be shot and carried and live out a happy life lol. Be that person and give this Sig a happy home.I do not always get email notifications.
