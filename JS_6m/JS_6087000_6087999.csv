2. A revolver - I really want a black Charter Arms Undercover. Smith & Wesson - 9mm Ruger LCR is also good

The factory put on a brand new slide, with internal extractor, and a new recoil assembly.The frame, trigger, and barrel have a cumulative total of 461 rounds on them. The new slide and recoil assembly have a round count of 46. This gun was never carried and aside from the trips to the range to break it in, it has sat in my safe.I am looking for $900 plus applicable transfer fees. I will not ship.I would rather sell this, however I might consider a trade given the following conditions:- Nothing in .40 S&W- Not interested in AK's, AR's, or shotguns at this time- If an equal trade value can be achieved, a S&W M&P (no mag disconnect safety, full-size grip/frame) or full size Springfield XDM in 9mm might be considered- A bolt gun in 6.5 Creedmoor or perhaps .260 Rem might be considered. Much lesser consideration would be given to a bolt gun in .308- Regrettably I don't currently have cash to add to any deal. I'm trying to sell this to fund other projects."

We got this rifle in bad shape. The bore was good and the metal was good. The stock and trigger were bad. Someone had done a very poor sporterization on it. We cleaned it up and found that it was a German 98k that still had the eagle on it that had been rebarreled by the Israelis in the 60s to 7.62x51. We stripped it down and duracoated the main components black and accents were duracoated in combat grey. It has a weaver one piece scope base with a Redfield 4-12x40. We then added a timney trigger and put it is a gray and boyd's prairie Hunter stock. This is a very nice rifle now and is a very very good shooter. We are willing g to ship for $25.00 to the lower 48. Alaskan residents will need to pay actual shipping. No sales to CA, NY,DC, or HI.

This is a 29"" model and has only been opened once to verify serial number. It comes in a Pelican Case. It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough. Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability. Enhanced modul.arity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side"

Townsend Whelen. Col. Whelen was the commanding officer of the Frankfort arsenal at that time.The .35 Whelen is a great cartridge for any North American game as well as the whole spectrum of African plains animals. Following its development in 1922, it remained a wildcat cartridge until 1988 when Remington began offering factory loads in this caliber.One of the good things about this cartridge is that it is reasonably available (there are currently 44 different offerings for .35 Whelen ammo on GunBroker) but it is not so common that your buddies will be likely to ""borrow"" your ammo.My rifle is in very good to excellent condition with only a few small handling marks. There are 11` Remington 700s in .35 Whelen currently offered on GunBroker. Their prices range from $825 to $1,199. Only one has a scope and that rifle is in rough condition and the asking price for it is $899.99.My rifle has a Leupold VX-1 2-7 scope with the duplex reticle. Along with the rifle, I have 16 rounds of Hornady Superperformance 200 grain soft points and 19 rounds of Remington 200 grain Core-Lokt PSP ammo and 4 once fired cases. If you are a handloader, you can easily make cases from 30-06 brass just like James Howe did in 1922.Meet me face to face with cash in the Pelham area and be prepared to show your identification and sign a bill of sale.

Or cash only $600 each!!perfect gift for the guy that has everything. If my wife was to purchase something like this for me I would be floored! These bronze statues are so beatiful. Great for a den or man cave or simply in your formal living room.Take the time to show around and compair. These are the larger size that measure 32""-34"" tall and about 20""-26"" long. And weigh about 50-60lbs. So when you goggle these statues make sure you compair the size because these are very large, they measure up over 32"" and over 20"" in length.Comparable ones are $2900-$6900 in value. I am only asking $600 each!! You could buy these and relist for $2000-$3000 might take a week or two to get $2000-$3000 but it's defiantly easy money. I just don't have the space where I live. These are much higher quality than most. They are displayed on solid marble base as well.The Indian example is called ""CHEYENNE"" this piece retails for over $5000 See the link to the website explaining the quality and detail including the price. You will see other examples that are priced between $1500-$$2600 but they are much smaller and don't have the detail and craftsmanship like these examples.The other example is called ""Mountain Man"" the retail price on this item is well over $6000. I have provided a link to an example to this one as well see below. You will see others priced lower but they are much smaller and are not solid bronze and don't have the detail craftsmanship like these two examples.I am kinda firm on the price. You could easily buy these and enjoy them for 10-20 years and resell them for twice this price. I am only selling them because I need the money. I would also entertain a trade for a couple rifles or pistols, my trade value must be between $1500-$2000"

I bought two of these and have carried one for almost two years, and in excess of a 1000 rounds of flawless rounds shot. ""Unbelievable"" accuracy for such a small barrel. Which is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled barrel. Info below. This one comes complete in box, two mags. $525. https://www.gunsamerica.com/blog/kah...l-made-in-usa/From Khar's website:The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

I bought two of these and have carried one for almost two years, and in excess of a 1000 rounds of flawless rounds shot. ""Unbelievable"" accuracy for such a small barrel. Which is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled barrel. Info below. This one comes complete in box, two mags, all paperwork $525. https://www.gunsamerica.com/blog/kah...l-made-in-usa/From Khar's website:The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."""

Folks, be reasonable with your prices. Your used Glocks are not worth more than $350. Especially if it's a gen 2. You guys know better than that. I don't feel sorry if that's the price you paid for them. Do your research. Your guns are used, you can say they're NIB all you want. They're still used.
NO SUBCOMPACTS. Open to offers. I have permit, state id, willing to sign bill of sale and submit to background check."

I bought two of these and have carried one for almost two years, and in excess of a 1000 rounds of flawless rounds shot. ""Unbelievable"" accuracy for such a small barrel. Which is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled barrel. Info below. This one comes complete in box, two mags. $525. https://www.gunsamerica.com/blog/kah...l-made-in-usa/From Khar's website:The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

I bought two of these and have carried one for almost two years, and in excess of a 1000 rounds of flawless rounds shot. ""Unbelievable"" accuracy for such a small barrel. Which is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled barrel. Info below. This one comes complete in box, two mags. $525. https://www.gunsamerica.com/blog/kah...l-made-in-usa/From KAhr's website:The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

I bought two of these and have carried one for almost two years, and in excess of a 1000 rounds of flawless rounds shot. ""Unbelievable"" accuracy for such a small barrel. Which is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled barrel. Info below. This one comes complete in box, two mags. $525. https://www.gunsamerica.com/blog/kah...l-made-in-usa/From Kahr's website:The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

Large capacity for cleaning barreled actions up to 34"" inside and out!
Lyman has introduced the market's largest and most powerful ultrasonic cleaning system: The Turbo Sonic Power Pro. This system's extra long, heated tank and ten powerful industrial transducers allow gunsmiths, armorers or any shooter to quickly and easily clean, lubricate and protect the widest range of metal items.
Designed for high volume cleaning or for larger than normal items, the new Turbo Sonic Power Pro's 34-3/4"" heated stainless steel tank can easily handle most barreled actions, upper receivers, as well as quantities of handguns. The powerful industrial transducers aggressively deep clean and degrease items, both inside and out. In fact, the Power Pro is such an effective cleaner that Lyman recommends that cleaned parts immediately be ultrasonically treated with Lyman's Turbo Sonic Gun Lube. Changing from cleaning to lubrication is easy with the built in drain system.
Designed for volume professional usage, the Power Pro features an all stainless design and professional controls. For complete control of the process, the Power Pro has both a timer and an adjustable heat control. Temperatures up to 175 degrees can be selected.
