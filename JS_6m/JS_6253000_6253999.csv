It is correctly marked with the two SS skulls on the barrel, one with just SS, one with SS2 over it. The receiver has light markings on it but it is still clear enough to read the 'Amberg 1917' on the receiver. Meaning, this was originally a WW1 Gewehr 98 long barrel rifle. However, when Hitler came into power and began forming his SS he needed newer, more modern rifles. So what they did was rework WW1 mausers into K98 configuration. Many many SS rifles have WW1 receivers. In addition, to hide that they were ramping up their war industry, they refrained from putting SS markings on the receiver, to hide that the rifles were newly manufactured because it was forbiden by the treaty of versailes. This K98 also has a star at the wrist of the stock, which is another signature SS K98 marking. Over the time SS or skull above/under the star has mostly faded and I cannot distinguish it out. On this rifle the numbers don't match, as there are few numbers at all. But the stock is in great condition. Has a reinforcing stock lug as you can see in the photos. This rifle comes with a cleaning rod, and has many WW1 Gew 98 pieces on it, which is correct for this rifle. The bore has strong rifling and no visible pitting, though it is dark. I suspect a good scrubbing will brighten it back up. There are no import markings on this rifle.Will entertain trades, however cash is preferred. Selling for school.Seriously inquiries only please.Text or call 3six0-3four8-seven629I also answer emails very quickly*sorry about the rotated pictures, no matter what orientation I upload them in, Armslist tilts them*"

Flexible platform: Comes with extended 13 round magazine with custom Springfield Mag X-tension sleeve – this is like a full size weapon.  Or you can buy the shorter magazine that holds 10 rounds (without the extension sleeve) -- this transforms the gun into a smaller, easier to carry weapon.
XD®’s come loaded with features that set them apart from the competition. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator give the shooter instant tactile and visual feedback about the condition of the pistol. This means you can know at a glance – or at a touch – if there is a chambered round and if the striker is cocked. Three separate safeties guard against accidental discharges and provide extra peace of mind. The Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ prevents unintentional rearward movement of the trigger. The grip safety keeps the pistol from firing unless the shooter has a firm grasp on it. And an internal firing pin block goes the extra mile to bring you a pistol fully designed with safety in mind.
The accessory rail that comes standard on every XD® gives you the flexibility to mount a light, laser or other accessory on your pistol. An ambidextrous magazine release means the XD® doesn’t care whether or not you’re a lefty. And the high polish stainless steel magazines drop free with refreshing eagerness."

The perfect storm of engineering is the reason it wins so many competitions:Low bore axis and specially designed slide make for super low recoil. You stay on target for multiple hits. Tight tolerances keep it more accurate than most people can take advantage of. Smooth double action for the first pull, light single action for the rest of the 18-round mag.Decocker instead of manual safety means it’s as safe as any Glock, without the risk of forgetting a manual safety. This SP-01 has the following Cajun custom work done:Defensive carry package, $180Barrel bushing “10X”, $60Disconnector type 2, $38Disconnector install kit with salve pin, $12Stainless steel guide rod, $22OEM “thick” trigger, $20Lifter arm spring, $3Then on top of everything, I have the .22LR conversion kit! So you get the advantage of all the custom work, plus you get to shoot .22 whenever you want. The breakdown is as simple as pulling out the pin and switching slides.Gun comes with original box, manual, 4 9mm mags and 2 .22LR mags. If you’re the once-a-year range guy, keep scrolling - It’s overkill. But if you have ANY interest in getting into IPSC, USDPA, 3-gun, or other pistol competitions, you will freaking LOVE this gun!Call or text REDACTED to pick up this jealousy-inducing speed racer. You deserve to have fun and look good doing it!Thank you, and merry Christmas!"

It's an excellent gun, I'm just consolidating everything to 9mm or smaller. The night sights are VERY bright (removed right now as shown in the pics, but will have the gunsmith put them back on in the next day or so) and have white halo's around the tritium vials, so you can see them very well in the daytime too. Here's what all is included, as well as the cost: The gun was $628, polish job was $135, extra magazine (Chip McCormick, yes, these will take 1911 magazines) was $25. Total was $788 before transfer, etc. I have the case, trigger lock, manuals, etc it came with too.SECOND GUN: I have a SCCY CPX2 9mm. Black frame and stainless slide. In like new condition with only two mags fired. 2 magazines, box, etc. I had an issue with the barell and they sent me a new one (they will send you anything you ever need FREE as their customer service and warranty are AMAZING). So, the barell is brand new and unfired (haven't gone back to the range yet.) I bought this one used for $220. Between my he two guns,nover $900 invested.

This upper reciever is BCMs high quality clone of the navys SPR, the MK12. It is begging for you to buy and fit a quick detach suppresor. quick description: -BCM MK12 MOD4 upper reciever purchased complete (not built by me) from BCM. It is an 18"", 410 stainless, hand lapped, button rifled MK12 (heavy) profiled barrel fitted in a BCM upper reciever with a BCM magnesium 13"" free float (very light weight) handguard. A BCM BCG is it's heart. Barrel end fitted with a BCM MOD1 compensator, which is the longest version and does the most to reduce muzzle flash and rise. There is a Vortex HS LR 4-16× BDC scope with optional sunshade on the rifles flat top with a Larue SPR lever mount, which can be quickly removed to give access to the troy industries flip up sights for backup or close quarters use of this lightweight (as possible), collapsible stock 18"" heavy profile barreled versatile AR15. The larue mount allows the scope to be removed and replaced without tools and stay close to zero after removing then re-attaching, when used correctly.- The lower reciever is a Noveske N4 gen 2, a billet, flared magwell, great looking lower. The lower is attached to a BCM/VLTOR intermediate buffer system which is longer than a carbine buffer tube, shorter than a rifle tube and houses a VLTOR buffer...renowned for its soft shooting characteristics allowing for quick follow up shots on target. The gun is charged by a quick pull of the BCM Mod 4 charging handle and fired by a light press on a Giessele National match two stage designated marksman trigger tuned by a gunsmith to around a 1lb second stage break. The gun is stabilized by an Atlas 5-9"" bipod held on by a Larue lever mount. Grab this gun by its very comfortable Ergo deluxe pistol grip and take it home today. All parts EXCEPT the Noveske stripped lower were purchased new for this build. The Noveske lower was from another unfired gun, all other parts purchased new and only unpack aged to put on this rifle. This rifle has NEVER been fired. In fact, this rifle has never left my house and has never spent more than an hour outside of my humidity controlled gun safe since it was built by me in 2015. All parts are brand new. I have receipts. i was going to a lot of training classes at the time, and bought this rifle intending to take a police marksman course. Never made it to that sort of course so never shot the rifle.Build cost about 3700 for all parts and shipping. Text me for more pictures  Thank you for reading my post.REDACTED"

First is a forged MEGA Arms brand stripped upper/lower. Includes a complete CMMG lower parts kit to complete it. Also with the upper is the complete forward assist and complete ejection port cover to finish it out. Also included in this is a Rock River TRO rail with QD attachment point, rail sections and barrel nut to attach, length is 11.25 inches. Last is a Daniel Defense MFR rail, 12 inches long. Has been previously painted and has some damage to the end of the rail where it mates to the upper. Does NOT impair function or cause any issues, just some scratches and decent gouges in the end of the rail. I have no idea what I did to cause that, but it's there if that matters.

It is 100% factory with no alterations. Like new condition!
Unlike some AR10 rifles, DPMS Panther arms made this one the perfect weight for target shooting or combat. Weight and barrel is the perfect combination -- feels manageable and well balanced.
Generous recoil brake / flash suppressor.
Handy six-position telescoping buttstock.
20-round FACTORY magazine included.
Flattop upper receiver – customize any way you like! Integral full-length Picatinny rail for the easy and secure mounting of scopes, other optical sights, lasers, infrared and other such accessories. It also has a smooth barrel profile, and has another piece of Picatinny rail integral to the gas block, for a detachable front sight if you want that.
All of the controls, safeties, etc are of the typical AR style.
Regarding recoil: I’m on the lighter side of the weight scale and avoid heavy recoil shooting, but the AR style recoil system and muzzle brake take up the recoil on this gun just fine. I don’t need much adjustment after firing. Provides the confidence for very precise and quick follow up shots.
Exceptionally functioning smooth action confirms the feeling of precision and feeling that the entire fire control group is smoother …… and gives you the well-made sense you get from picking a nice rifle. The trigger breaks nice and clean like a piece of glass snapping.
I’m not the world’s best shot, but this rifle makes even me look like an expert!   I grouped 1.5” at 100 yards and I’m a VERY crude shooter – amazing accuracy for me as I can’t do that with any rifle. Thought this was excellent accuracy for what many describe as more of a battle rifle."
