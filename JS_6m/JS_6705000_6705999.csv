I'll take 45 for it.Next is a customized Galco summer special. It is a left handed version for a service model xd. I did not like the very thin easily collapsed piece of metal that Galco uses, so I replaced it with 2 strips of kydex and restitched the complete holster with black colored thread that came with my leather punch sewing kit, the thread is not the thin regular clothes thread from Joann fabrics.... New this was well over 80 bucks, since it has been customized I'll take 45 for it, only reason I don't use this is because traded off my xd.Next is a very new Tucker leather iwb single mag pouch, It is for the xd45, it might work with other double stack 45 or maybe even 40s&w.... New it was 24+tax I'd like to get 15 for it.If I ship please add 7 dollars, if you buy the summer special and the mag pouch it will still only be 7 shippingAny questions feel free to ask them....ThanksApparently my pics are too big this time around I can email pics...."

The original hard rubber butt plate has some cracks and chips, as you can see from the picture. I would guess this has been from some rabbit and squirrel head crackin'. If you are truly a hunter, you know what I mean...It is said that the Germans in WW1 complained about this weapon's evil twin, the trench version, that was surely a violation of the Hague Convention as it was devastating to them in trench warfare. It is also rumored that our US boys had been used to bird hunting with this shotgun and would shoot grenades being lobbed at them, either blowing up the grenades or at the very least, knocking them off course...
