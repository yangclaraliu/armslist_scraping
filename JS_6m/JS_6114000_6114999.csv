It's a factory ELR rifle from Christensen Arms in 28 Nosler. With Hornady's 175 ELD-X, it shoots 1/4"" groups consistently. Look up the specs on the rifle, it's an astounding and lightweight rifle and the cartridge is good to a mile. No kidding!The optic is a custom built 4-24 VX-6 Leupold out of their custom shop. I had Mil based turrets put in with the push button zero stop on both the elevation and windage. It's also been custom painted by Leupold Custom Shop to match the rifle. (Scope is sold, just the rifle now!) The rings are from Seekins Precision. 
 
All in all, you'd be hard pressed to find a better, more ultra high-end rifle for any big game animal in North America. The condition is like-new. I've only worked up a load for it. Took me about 30 rounds or so and I've got data out to 750 yards. I do have some custom hand-loaded ammo for it, Redding match dies and what's left of the box of Hornady ELD-X bullets. I can prodide load data and balistic data, too. Rifle MSRP is $4200Scope cost around $2000 from the custom shop. Dies, brass and whatnot is easily another $300. So I've got $6500 into this rifle and it's brand new except for me working up a load. You're getting a SCREAMING deal on this package. *Bipod and front rail aren't included. I'm open to reasonable offers, but lowballs will be ignored. NO TRADES, PLEASE!And, I've had trouble replying through armslist in the past, so please provide either your email or cell# so I can connect with you live. And- I'm happy to email additional pics. I could only upload 2 for some stupid reason. I will ship the gun, but buyer pays for shipping."

And it is only going to get worse as we get to the end of the year.
 
That means once you get it outfitted (good optics are a must on this gun) you could be looking at $6000 or more. That is just nuts. 
 
Here is an opportunity to get a very lightly used gun - fully setup and ready to take advantage of the Scar's long range accuracy.  Save yourself a few grand.
 
This gun has been babied.  It has gone from the safe to the case to the range and back, and only a few times.
 
I can find 2 marks on this gun.  There is some wear on the front rail where the bipod mounts, and a mark on the plastic under the stock hinge from installing the CA stock lock.
 
What you get:
 
Scar 17S - Excellent condition Approx 300 Rounds
Leupold VXR Patrol 3-9 Tactical Reticle
Larue QD mount
Fastfire III
Larue scope mount
GG&G bipod
Magpul AFG
Pelican case
Original box
2 Factory mags
Bullet button
Stock lock
2 Mag blocks
 
Don't hesitate on this one!I would prefer a cash transaction in person.  I am willing to ship.  You pay shipping, and paypal fees (3%) I have all the components to make this gun Cali legal (until the end of the year) Make sure you and your FFL are ready to make the transfer, and understand all the necessary laws.  If the transfer is made locally we will work with the FFL of my choosing.  I am not considering offers at this point.  If I did not need money now, I would wait until mid December and make a KILLING. If you want me to respond - If the listing is up, this is still available.  Second, make me think that you are actually interested in buying this thing, not just a scammer.  Tell me who you are and where you are."

I built it as an entry level precision rifle, but have moved up to a 6.5 Creedmore now. The following is the list of upgrades currently on the rifle.Bell&Carlson M40A5  Medalist fully adjustable stock. Stock has been bedded, reamed out to fit the heavy barrel profile of the rifle, and painted in woodland camo.LaRue Tactical 20moa scope base.TPS Precision 30mm rings.Vortex Viper PST 6-24x50 illuminated scope. First focal plane, MOA reticle, MOA turrets.Harris Bipod. Mounted to a Anschütz stud adaptor on the bottom rail of the stock.Custom trigger job. Stock trigger was completely broken down, cleaned, polished, and the geometry of the trigger was adjusted to allow for the cleanest break possible. It is currently set at 3.25 lbs, but can be adjusted anywhere from 2.5-5 lbs without removing the trigger pack.Internal magazine has been modified to hold 5+1 rounds instead of the standard 3+1.Padded cheek riser/storage compaertment that I keep a small log book and some spare rounds in.The original box/paperwork, as well as the original Hogue rubberized stockIt shoots sub-MOA every time with match ammo, as long as the shooter does their part.I hate to let it go, but I have bills to pay. Cash only at this time. Open to offers, but low ball offers will be politely ignored. Keep in mind, the scope itself is over $1,000. I will not separate the scope or accessories from the rifle. It's a package deal only. Thanks!"

Military use:The United States military used a short-barreled version known variously as the ""trench"" or ""riot"" shotgun. The Winchester Model 1897 was the major production, but Remington made 3500 of the Model 10-A version for issue to U.S. troops during World War I. The Model 10 was modified by reducing barrel length to 23 inches (58 cm) and adding sling swivels, a wooden heat shield over the barrel, and an adapter with bayonet lug for affixing a M1917 bayonet. These trench guns with serial numbers between 128000 and 166000 were stamped with US and the flaming bomb insignia on the left side of the receiver. The United States military also purchased a number of Remington Model 10 with 20-inch (51-cm) barrels for guarding prisoners, and 26 to 30-inch (66 to 76-cm) barrels for training aerial gunners. The Model 10-A was used in limited numbers by the Marine Corps through the 1930s."

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.Finish Black Type Semi-Automatic Action Striker Fire Action Caliber 9mm Barrel Length 3"" Capacity 6 + 1 Safety No Manual Safety Grips Black Sights Fixed Weight 11 oz"
