The barreled receiver is from James River Armory and features a forged receiver and bolt with a Criterion barrel.  The receiver is marked “Rockola M14” (as a tribute to the Rockola company that built Garands during WWII) The build was completed with 100% USGI op rod, trigger group, gas puck, and a beautiful figured birch stock, which was tastefully refinished to retain the history, proof mark and defense stamp (the grain on the grip is darker from being held by soldiers in the past…and I wanted to retain that history). Springfield M1As are quality replicas of M14s, but they are made with investment castings to keep down cost and are not USGI spec. This is a true M14 built to 100% USGI specs. The trigger has been trued and polished, and breaks like glass at 4lbs 10oz (to remain legal for Camp Perry matches).  The sling is a 1903 leather adjustable swivel with brass hardware. The case is M1950 paratrooper’s case. Also comes with 3 USGI military issue 20 rd mags…2 still sealed in packaging (these are the best mags you can get…not cheap copies). The scope is a vortex crossfire 4-16X50 mounted on med height rings so the iron sights can still be used. This set up shoots 1MOA with match grade ammo. This is an awesome old-school tactical long range set up…sure there are lighter, more accurate modern rifles out there…but this has a cool factor that is unmatched.

Secured to the gun in two ways, the Carver uses a brass mounting point (basically a miniaturized Seattle Slug) to provide weight where you need it. The aluminum version improves balance and recoil control while making reloads a cinch. All ""full circle"" magwells work like a funnel, guiding the magazine where it needs to go. Using one, it's much easier to reload at maximum speed. The CARVER Magwell is a LARGE aluminum magwell for your Glock that adds the largest opening of any other magwell, a full 1.5 inch by 2.375 inch long width. That equates to 3.56 square inches to funnel your Glock magazine into your Glock for lightening fast reloads. This mount is made exclusively in Greensburg, PA. This magwell fits G20 and 21 Gen1-3 Glock models. Does not fit SF models. If you're looking for maximum reload speed, this is your part. Other Features of the CARVER Tactical Magwell Include: CNC Machined from 6061-T6 Aircraft Aluminum (+/-.002"" tolerances) Magwell weighs 0.9 oz Aluminum insert weighs 0.8 oz Fits into the IDPA box with ease Benefits of the CARVER Tactical Magwell Include Allows the use of stock magazines or magazines with mag extensions to easily reload The design improves the grip of the magazine when doing a tactical reload Forward swoop of the magwell provides a consistent grip when drawing Lightweight6565"

A.The following is my usual process in making a knife: 1) Profile the blank (I’m currently doing only stock removal, and I don’t see that changing any time soon) 2) Drill holes for handles 3) Clean up the surface of the blank 4) Using a belt grinder, I grind the main bevels by progressing from a 36 grit belt to a 220 grit belt 5) Carefully wrap the knife in stainless foil and triple fold the edges 6) Heat treat the knife in an oven 7) Plate quench the knives when the critical temperature is reached 8) Let the knife cool to 150F, and then return knife to the oven for the first temper 9) Remove knife, and let cool to room temperature 10) Dip in liquid nitrogen filled cryo tank over night 11) Finish second and third temper 12) Clean up flats and ricasso from 80 to 120 grit 13) Regrind the main bevel from 80 grit to 220 grit 14) Roughly sharpen a V edge with a 120 grit, and refine edge up to a 320 grit 15) Frosty satin the entire knife, etch logo and clean up the etch, clean up the spine and bevel the corners for a smooth spine 16) Tape up the entire knife blade and ricasso, then clamp the blade tang to whatever handle material I’m using (usually micarta) 17) Drill holes into the handle material using the clamped tang as a template, and scribe the outline of the tang onto the handle material 18) Rough cut the handles on a bandsaw 19) Pin and clamp handle set together and clean up the front of the handle slabs on the grinder 20) Temporarily pin and glue the handle scales onto the tang, remove pins and shape the handle scales on the grinder 21) Hand sand the handle scales to smooth out contours and finish 22) Countersink the handle material 23) Cut rivet tubing (oversize) with a hacksaw and grind tubing to size 24) Flare tubing 25) Grind entire spine one last time to clean up spine and ensure that the handle scales are flush with the tang 26) Remove tape and apply Stupid Sharp edge (discussed further below) 27) Clean entire knife with Simple Green, and pat dry. That’s all there is to it, now the Stupid Sharp Knife is done! Q. What steel do you like to work with and use? Why? A. In no particular order Carbon: CPM-3V, CPM-M4, A2, D2, 10V Stainless: AEB-L, M390, CPM-154, CPM-S35VN, Elmax I also like Titanium (6Al-4V) knives with a carbide edge (further discussion below) Generally, I like A2 and M4 for working knives that’ll see field time. I like A2 for its toughness, ease of field touching-up, and decent wear resistance. CPM-M4 is a “high speed tool steel” and is some good stuff. It takes a fine edge, holds it like a pitbull, while remaining relatively tough. At higher RCs (63-64) it holds an edge for a looooong time. If it were more stainless, it would be my new favorite steel."

I'll sell it in parts or in a single lump.I'd like 60 cents per round ($180 total), but that's flexible and I'm absolutely prepared to negotiate if that seems unreasonable- make me an offer.

Feel free to look up the headstamp yourself to be sure.)They're headstamped WRA 69; I looked that up and it's made by Winchester in 1969. So it's new manufacture, not reloaded, Vietnam war vintage, and by all accounts great ammo that is still viable & virile. It's on 5rnd stripper clips in cardboard sleeves, 2 clips per sleeve, then all stacked in a 5.56 ammo can. It's been stored indoors and is in great shape, nearly no tarnish or anything. I can provide photos if requested.

These KS-47s are basically an AR platform that is chambered in 7.62x39, and accepts any AK magazine. Way cheaper to shoot than firing 5.56 or 223, plus much more punch! If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, check out the video on youtube (PSA KS47 -vs- CMMG Mutant).The Palmetto State Armory KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK. While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines, that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 lets the AK shooter capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR-style platform. Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver, the KS47 features an AR-style modular configuration which consists of a barreled upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. The modular configuration allows customers to have several different barrel configurations with one lower receiver, just by releasing two pins. Lower: The 7075-T6 billet lower receiver is hardcoat anodized, and accepts standard AR15 fire control groups. The extended magazine release is outside of the trigger guard for safety, which allows for an AK-style release movement, but also features oversize side paddles for fingertip release by the trigger finger. Fitted with a Ergo grip and M4-style stock, the receiver also features a standard, mil-spec diameter, 6 position, 7075 carbine buffer tube. The KS47 lower has steel reinforcements to accept AK style surplus magazines including drum-style.Upper: The KS47 hybrid upper receiver is precision machined out of billet 7075 T6 aluminum, and then hardcoat anodized for durability. While retaining the look of a standard M4 upper, the KS47 hybrid upper is designed to work with either the KS47 lower, or the standard AR47 lower. The chrome moly vanadium barrel is chambered in 7.62x39 with a 1 in 10 twist, has M4-style feed ramps, is nitride treated for accuracy and durability, and is finished off with a 5/8-24 thread A2-style compensator. The forward, assist, dust cover, charging handle, and safety are all standard AR15, as is the PSA Slim Keymod free-float rail and barrel nut.BCG: The hybrid KS47 Bolt carrier group works with either AK47 magazines or AR47 magazines, and features an extended firing pin. The carrier is made of 8620 steel, chrome lined and phosphate coated, and the chrome lined gas key is attached with grade 8 bolts and properly staked. The Bolt is made of phosphate coated 9310 steel. The KS47 Upper and Hybrid BCG are compatible with standard AR15 lowers for use with AR47-style magazines.I'm asking $900 for the rifle with one steel or PMAG 30 round magazine (buyers choice). *** Drum magazine in pics is not include with this sell.Private Party DetailsRegistered on 12/30/2013Listings by this userLOCATION: Raeford, Fort Bragg, Fayetteville, North CarolinaSHIPPING:NoCATEGORYRiflesMANUFACTURER Palmetto State ArmoryCALIBER 7.62x39ACTION Semi-automaticFIREARM TYPE Rifle"
