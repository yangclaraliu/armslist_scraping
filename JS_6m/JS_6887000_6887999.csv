Also has sling, cleaning kit, and 3 sets of furniture (1 set Bulgarian polymer, 1 set Romanian G wood, and American plastic set).  Also comes in original box and have a Russian crate all the stuff will come in. This is a good straight AK I'm open to trades but cash is mainly what I'm looking for. I don't have to sell just trying to free up some room in my safe for another rifle I'd like to buy. I'm located in somerset KY. I believe this is a fair price for a Bulgarian AK 74 plus all the stuff it comes with as the ammo alone would be about $170 and each mag on sale is roughly $30 for a total of about $210 and the furniture is roughly $89 for the Bulgarian plastic and the Romanian wood about $40 so your getting the AK at $141 bucks so if you want a good deal on an AK 74 hit me up if you try and low ball me don't waist my time or yours. I will not separate it all has to go together. If you got any questions about the AK feel free to message me."

It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels, accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the pistol's grip position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model has an OD Green frame, black slide with night sights, and includes three (3), 15-round magazines.

Manufacturers Description
ATOM was a concept brought about by a requirement to mount Aimpoint’s excellent line of Micro optics on pistols. The extension of the design allows you to mount nearly any compact optic to your pistol without being stuck with one option. The ATOM adapter plate system not only allows optic modularity, but also future-proofs your investment. As new pistol-ready red dots come to market, we will make new adapters as required so the newest technology will always be just an adapter plate away.
 Material: 17-4 Stainless Steel Heat Treated to 44-46 Rockwell
Coating: Black is DLC / FDE is a PVD
Sights: Stainless Black Front/Black Rear
Serrations: Front and Rear
 
Atom Slide Includes: Slide, BUIS, pre-installed striker channel liner and Glock OEM Internals"
