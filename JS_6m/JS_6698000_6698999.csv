And also selling with it 600 bullets. 400 are cast lead and two hundred are copper jacket. Also have a couple hundred spent brass. So everything you need to load makarov ammo. Asking 75$ which is half of what I paid for it , not including shipping which ads a lot more because no local stores carry makarov supplies or dies. Lee dies will fit any standard press including 30$ hand presses if you don't have a press you can get started cheap. I also have a trimmer bit so you can cut down 9mm luger brass. It works and is safe. I've done it plenty, it's actually stronger. My price is fair and firm. Everything is new and I'm excellent condition, I bought it a few weeks before I ended up selling my makarov pistol. Also I have a mag for a makarov pm and box of silver bear ammo and a few boxes of reloads I'd be willing to sell for an extra $25. Thanks for reading!"

With a lightweight, compact design, this versatile generator provides easy portability for camping, recreation and home backup power. The Honda EU2000I features a smooth-running Honda engine that is reliable and super quiet, producing less noise than a normal conversation. This CARB compliant model meets strict standards and can be sold in California.An inverter equipped generator is essential if you are using generator power for your laptop, game console and sophisticated HDTV. Do the research. It could save you damage to your electronic gear. This generator was purchased in 2014 as a backup for our home food storage equipment. There again we were warned that to protect our refrigerator and freezer from damage caused by unregulated power, an inverter equipped generator was essential. We have started and run this generator, each time with fresh gas in it, for 20 minutes each spring and fall. Fall 2014, Spring/Fall 2015, Spring/Fall 2016, and Spring 2017. That is 6 times it has been run 20 minutes for a total run time since new of 2 hours. In the interim the generator has been stored inside (fuel vent closed it is certified for inside storage) in a dry/clean environment. It has never been used outdoors or in construction. At the time we purchased this, due to storms throughout the country, these generators were selling for an average retail price of $1,200. The Honda website lists the current MSRP as $1,149. Local outlets like Northern Tool sell them for $999 plus tax = $1,068. This generator has one minor flaw which is where the starter rope has been pulled against the side of the case causing a slight gouge. For sale for $699 firm. I don't need help selling it. And we don't have to sell it. But I could use the funds for another home project. Cash only. Exchanged in a Wichita QuikTrip parking lot of your choosing."

This was made to be as much like class-3 as you can get w/o a license.   It was owned by a prop company that made firearms used in TV and movies.   This pistol makes about a 3 frame appearance in the new Battlestar Galatica reboot (w/o fake surpressor)  It has been rented to a host of movies over the years.  Each time slightly changed.  This is meant to look like an Uzi slash HK-MP7.  It also mirrors the Evo 9mm Scorpion but pre-dated it by a decade.  The top has a custom full length picatinny rail.  It has a holographic sight and co-witnessing pop up HK style iron sights.  It also has a flat laser and a built in blue LED tatical flashlight in the forward 3 sided picatinny rail hybred system.  The laser is activated via pressure switch.  It includes a 10 round magazine that hides in the pistol (and when using the 10 round mag no one can figure out what it is and will ask a million questions) and a 30 round Butler Creek Mag.  It can use any of the 50 or 75 round 10/22 magazines. The fake surpressor is a barrel extension.  It seems so realistic that until class-3 guys shine a flashlight down it they think it is real.  (it is solid)  It also has the screw on muzzle protector when the fake surpressor is taken off.  I also have the box given to the Acadamy Awards for Battlestar Galatica best props consideration that will include with this.  Is a red transperent box and has a DVD of samples scenes on it, it is in fact also a collectable.  This is just an awesomely cool pistol. This has not been fired by me, and kept in my gun safe now for almost 10 years.  The choice is yours if you end up owning it to keep as a collectable or an awesome pistol that looks like something extremely exotic.  In the grip is a set of replacement batts and firing pins and parts sets for the pistol, the bottom of the grip has a large snap open storage compartment.  These extra parts adds a lot of value as these parts are hard to find.  This was made to be a collectable that would withstand the test of time."

But only a select few are tough enough and accurate enough to be called a SIG. The SIG516 is the natural evolution of the platform, with a host of enhancements designed to survive anything, anywhere.  Built for Harsh Tactical Environments The SIG SAUER advanced short-stroke pushrod system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched. A standard 5.56mm NATO Nitride chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment.  Adjustable Gas Valve An adjustable gas valve allows operators to increase the flow of gas when using lower pressure ammunition or when adverse conditions require additional energy. Reduced flow and the off-position enhance the use of suppressors. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded 1/2×28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts.  Ambidextrous Charging Handle and Controls Whether you’re left- or right-handed, there should be no compromise in shooting performance. The SIG516 features an ambidextrous selector, bolt release, magazine release and charging handle."

I bought this from a seller in Belarus and had this imported, I'm asking $250 and I will ship provided you pay shipping. I'm selling this scope because I would like to shoot competition with my ak and this scope isn't as fast as I would like it to be. It comes with everything that came in the original box including manual (in Russian), rubber scope caps, hex tool, sun glare cover, and weaver mount for pictanny rails. Some background info: The scope is a lightweight and extremely rugged optic originally designed for the SV-99, made by Belomo (Belarusian Optical and Mechanical Assosiation), which was a major optic assembly plant for the USSR, now in Belarus and currently supplies military optics to the Russian army. From what I read, this is a prototype scope that has seen use by Russian paratroopers because of the compactness and lightweight of the scope. Russian optics.net has some good info on this scope and so does Belomo's home webpage if you need more info."

232,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6698232,For Sale:  MARLIN CAMP CARBINE 45,"Blacksburg, Roanoke, Virginia","$ 1,000","Listed On: Monday, April 10, 2017",Rifles,Marlin                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"A Marlin Camp Carbine in .45 ACP caliber, which is a somewhat scarce rifle. I bought this gun in 1995 and have used it very little: it has had fewer than 200 rounds through it and is in excellent shape. I’ve added a fully-adjustable Williams peep sight, which required relieving the left side of the stock for the elevation adjustment; and a Williams “Fire Sight” front sight blade. These are the only modifications.  
It has a “Garand” type safety, in the trigger guard; and the bolt stays open after the last round has been fired. Magazine release is by a button on the left side. It comes with three magazines: the original factory 7-round one, a stainless steel 8-round magazine with a rubber bumper pad, and a “long” magazine that holds 12 rounds. Any magazine for a Colt M1911 or a clone will work. I am also including a scope mount base and screws for it. The rifle ships with the original box and a duplicate copy of the owner’s manual.   Shipping is $45 to your FFL holder.
The Camp Carbine is a lightweight, short, handy rifle with many uses. It will serve well as a truck or boat gun, and is excellent for home defense, as it’s easier to shoot accurately than a handgun and uses the powerful .45 ACP round. It’s not a hunting rifle but it’s suited to medium sized animals such as coyotes. It would take a deer with proper bullets and good placement. A farmer friend who has one of these keeps it in the cab of his combine and shoots groundhogs with it! This particular rifle is not the least bit picky about ammunition, in my experience: it feeds cast bullets, hardball, hollow points, and even target wadcutters without a hiccup. Ejection is positive and it has never misfired in my hands. 
The .45 caliber Camp Carbines are far less common than the 9mm ones, and quite hard to find. Not many were made and the prices are rising steadily. Because this gun is not “As new in box” (though nearly so) I’ve priced it to sell quickly. If you live in one of the states with magazine capacity limits (such as New York) I’ll leave out the large-capacity magazine and reduce the price by $20. 
Payment must be by USPS Money Order ONLY.  Sorry, but I won’t take checks of any kind, because in the past I’ve had several people on this site try to scam me with bogus “cashier’s checks.” These scam artists have been reported both to the Armslist authorities and to the BATF.  If you want it, you have to send me a proper FFL; I will verify it through BATF’s “EZ Check” system; and only after that will I ship to the licensed premises.  I’ll need a PAPER copy of the FFL, SIGNED IN INK, along with proper payment. This rifle does NOT qualify for a C&R sale, it has to go to a dealer. 
NOTE: I AM NOT AN FFL HOLDER. Please be CERTAIN your dealer will take this rifle from a private party, as the law allows him to do. If he insists it must come FROM an FFL (which is not required by law) then I will have to charge an additional $50 to cover handing fees at my end. Or...you could find another dealer who understands the law as it's actually written, not as he thinks it should be."

This is a factory Colt rifle, not a DPMS, Rock River, Bushmaster, PSA, etc so don't try to low ball me.  This is top of the line, and my price is more than fair.  This was the OEM-1 Model (so I added the colt handguards and the colt stock).  Also included with the rifle is the brand new Aimpoint ACO.  I bought this optic to put on this rifle (hasn't even been mounted by me).  I'm selling the rifle with the optic, so you don't even have to worry about getting a new red dot for the rifle.I'm PCSing soon, so this is priced to sell.  This package deal won't last long, so I am going to go with the first buyer who can provide cash and meet in Vass, NC.  Rifle is $825 and optic is $385 for a total of $1210.  Will not seperate at this time.  I'm a reasonable person who supports the 2nd Amendment and everyone's right to bear arms, so if you can show me where you can get the rifle or optic brand new at a better price, I'll match it.  Thanks for looking."

Where other Commander models fundamentally alter the 1911 design by shortening frame rails, adjusting the cycle length to shorten rearward travel, and affecting the timing of recoil and feeding, the Cabot remains true to internal ordnance prints. To the eye, the S103 appears a standard commander-length slide and frame, but upon takedown the shooter discovers that the internal dimensions of a full-size 5” barreled 1911 have been preserved. Your Cabot S103 Commander has the same cycle length and internal function as the ever dependable sidearm designed by Browning which has served armed forces worldwide for over a hundred years – “full cycle technology” as our engineers have termed it. The proven pedigree of the 1911 has been re-engineered in carry-size to ensure better feeding, consistent ejection, and above all – reliability. You’ll sacrifice nothing in electing to carry the Cabot S103 at your side."

I'm not looking for trades but not to say I won't accept them. Let me know what you have, worst I can do is say no thank you. No low ball offers, I do not need to sell. Please don't flag because I won't accept yourtrade.  Thank you for looking."
