This 1911A1 was manufactured by Union Switch & Signal in 1943. Of the nearly 2-million 1911A1's manufactured during the Second World War, only 55,000 were manufactured by US&S. Only the fabled Singer is rarer. This pistol is in excellent shape and appears to be 100% original and genuine. The frame is properly marked with the circled RCD acceptance found only on the US&S production. Neither the frame nor the slide have the ""P"" proof which is correct for the earlier US&S pistols. All of the various parts are correct for a US&S including the coarse checkered hammer, finely knurled mainspring housing, blued trigger, ""concentric circle"" barrel bushing, HS barrel, etc. The original Dulite blue finish is fully original and in excellent overall condition with some normal expected handling wear and a very slight touch of patina to the left side of the slide. There is no significant rust and absolutely no pitting. The frame's bullet ramp is milled in the white, as is correct for an original finish pistol. I'd grade the original finish at about 96-97% overall. The original Keyes Fibre grips are in excellent shape, matching the pistol. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. About the only detractor is a so-so magazine that could use an upgrade, but that's a very minor issue. This is a very collectible 1911A1 and one of the most desirable of all WWII pistols. A great example!"

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago, the only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,360 in cash or higher in trade.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's new.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

With crystal clear optics, an adjustable focus lens, and a comfortable eye relief of 3+ inches, it is comparable to sights several times the price.The glass reticle can be illuminated in red or green, in multiple brightness levels for a clean sight picture regardless of lighting or environment. And, unlike red dot sights, the reticle is visible with or without illumination, usable with or without battery power.Text Kevin 48O 2 7 8 68O5 for questions!"

It has a nice walnut stock, 23"" octagon barrel, front and rear peep sights, steel buttplate, and ornate iron trigger guard. The gun functions as it should, and is fun to shoot! I would recommend that you only shoot low-pressure ""CB"" shorts in it, as even these rounds probably exceed the original black powder proofs for that rifle. That being said, the barrel is quite thick with no flaws that I can see. It's smooth bore, so you could also shoot shot shells.   What makes this rifle unique is the firing design. Breach block cocks back and is released with the trigger.  The round fires when the block closes... the fireing pin is part of the block. It's foolproof, simple and quite interesting! It's been a great little keepsake, but now it's time to move it to someone else who can cherish it. I live near Mt Vernon, Burlington, Sedro-Woolley, and can meet you near I-5. This gun was made prior to 1898, so it can be sold direct without any transfer. I will need to see ID though. I could also ship it straight to your door.   Sorry, but I'm not really interested in any trades (never hurts to ask though!), and the price is firm.Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

Higgins model 583.2 bolt action 16 gauge shotgun for sale.  It is chambered for 2 3/4 shells and has a full choke.  There was damage to the stock that was repaired in several locations and the stock was reinforced to prevent the damage from reoccuring.  Some of the reinforcements were done by the factory on several other models.  I have used this shotgun for two years during pheasant season and to shoot countless clay pigeons at the trap range.  This shotgun would also be a great way to introduce a new shooter to the sport by providing a softer shooting round than a 12 gauge while offering a better hit chance than with a 20 gauge.  I will include 5 full boxes of shells and a partial box if you decide to purchase the shotgun.

I mounted a HiLux 4-16x50 scope which will allow you to use the full range of the cartridge.Included with the rifle will be the manuals for the gun and the scope and the plastic PTR case.  I will throw in a baker's dozen German 20 round mags and, if my price is met, a Templar Tactical (now Crux) muzzle brake / mount device with a new crush washer (it allows you to mount an Ark 30 or similar suppressor, which is not included in this sale). Further, I can remove the optic and we can negotiate a lower price. I would prefer to deal with fellow veterans or chl holders so please don't be offended if I ask. I will consider partial trades but am really looking for the cash to fund another project. Thank you for viewing and your consideration."

I'm told by another Armslister that this was probably post WWII, when the US gave a bunch of these and M1 Carbines to the Austrian Police.  There's also a bunch of numbers and vaious proofs stamped from all over.   It looks like the revolver was originally made for foreign contract prior to 4/24/42, before the Victory serial numbers started. The serial number is 888XXX.  After serving in WWII in Europe, it was then reissued to the Austrian Police.  The revolver has some holster wear, but overall the bluing looks very good.All in all, the gun fires great, locks up tight, and is in great condition. It also has REAL stag grips and lanyard ring.I can meet at a gun shop in South Mount Vernon where the transfer is only $25. I might be able to meet in Bellingham as well, or farther south if I'm heading that way. Buyer pays transfer fee. This would qualify for C&R; I can sell directly to C&R FFL holders.
