One that loses its value over time ( a commercially made rifle ), and one that is an investment….that is, it will at least HOLD its value, and likely INCREASE in value over time. ( a genuine U.S Carbine .Caliber 30 M1 rifle , made during WWII). You DO get what you pay for
As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot…. Very controllable, with plenty of punch .  Just as important, you can find parts for it if something needs to be replaced ( not always true with a commercially made rifle ).   
The rifles that I have listed from my collection, are all investment quality USGI rifles .  You decide what will be best for you in the long run…  Inland was the only maker of the M1A1 Paratrooper Carbine. This rifle has a barrel date of 12-43. It retains early features such as:  Type 1 barrel band, flip rear sight, push button safety and M1 mag catch. RI over 3 pistol grip, OI marked stock, and complete USGI paratrooper wire and butt stock. ( there are reproductions galore out there ! ) I believe that every part in this rifle is inland. Please ask questions. Many more pictures available. FFL to FFL outside Oklahoma."

The Skorpion vz. 61 is a Czechoslovak 7.65 mm machine pistol developed in 1959 by Miroslav Rybář (1924–1970) and produced under the official designation Samopal vzor 61 (""submachine gun model 1961"") by the Ceska zbrojovka arms factory in Uhersky Brod from 1961 to 1979.
Although it was developed for use with security forces and special forces, the weapon was also accepted into service with the Czechoslovak Army, as a personal sidearm for lower-ranking army staff, vehicle drivers, armoured vehicle personnel and special forces. Currently the weapon is in use with the armed forces of several countries as a sidearm. The Škorpion was also licence-built in Yugoslavia, designated M84. It features a synthetic pistol grip compared to the original version. A civilian, semi-automatic version was also produced, known as the M84A, also available in .38 ACP.The Skorpion was developed in the late 1950s by Miroslav Rybář with the working name ""model 59"". The design was finalized in 1961 and named ""Samopal Vz. 61."" It was subsequently adopted by the Czechoslovak Army and security forces, and later exported to various countries. Yugoslavia produced a version under license. It was also used by armed groups, including the Irish Republican Army, Irish National Liberation Army and the Italian Red Brigades. The Skorpion is a select-fire, straight blowback operated weapon that fires from the closed bolt position. The cartridge used produces a very low recoil impulse and this enables simple unlocked blowback operation to be employed; there is no delay mechanism and the cartridge is supported only by the inertia of the bolt and the strength of the return springs. When fired, gas pressure drives the case back in the chamber against the resistance provided by the weight of the bolt and its two recoil springs. The bolt travels back, extracting the empty case which is then ejected straight upwards through a port in the receiver housing top cover.
The Skorpion’s compact dimensions were achieved by using a telescopic bolt assembly that wraps around a considerable portion of the barrel. The weapon features a spring-loaded casing extractor, installed inside the bolt head and a fixed, double ejector, which is a protrusion in the weapon’s frame.
As the bolt is relatively light, an inertial rate reducer device housed inside the wooden pistol grip lowers the weapon's rate of fire from 1,000 rounds/min to a more manageable 850 rounds/min. The rate reducer operates as follows: when the bolt reaches the end of its rearward stroke it strikes and is caught by a spring-powered hook mounted on the back plate. At the same time it drives a lightweight, spring-loaded plunger down into the pistol grip. The plunger is easily accelerated and passes through a heavy weight which is left behind because of its inertia. The plunger, having compressed its spring, is driven up again and then meets the descending inertia buffer. This slows down the rising plunger which, when it reaches the top of its travel, rotates the hook, releasing the bolt which is driven forward by the compressed recoil springs.Features:
The weapon is hammer-fired and has a trigger mechanism with a fire mode selector, whose lever (installed on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip) has three settings: ""0""—weapon is safe, ""1""—semi-automatic mode and ""20""—fully automatic fire. The ""safe"" setting disables the trigger and the bolt in the forward position (by sliding the bolt catch lever upwards).
The Škorpion uses the 7.65x17mmSR Browning Short (.32 ACP) pistol cartridge, which was the standard service cartridge of the Czechoslovak security forces. It uses two types of double-column curved box magazines: a short 10-round magazine (loaded weight—0.15 kg) or a 20-round capacity magazine (loaded weight—0.25 kg). The bolt remains locked open after the last cartridge from the magazine has been fired and can be snapped back forward by pulling the cocking handle knob slightly to the rear."

With no snap, the SLS allows for a smoother single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The hood can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. It is also far less likely to release accidentally than conventional thumb break snaps. The rugged STX Tactical® finish protects the gun against scrapes, scratches and dents. The molded sight track and soft SafariSuede™ protect the gun's sights and finish.

I have a custom SBT Turett ordered directly from SIG that will come from the factory and be part of the deal. These are only 5.25 lbs for the bare rifle.  Makes a nice legal deer gun in Ohio for people that want a light gun and don't like recoil.  Ruger quit making the .44 and the .357 back in the fall of 2016 and these are starting to really go up in price. Only reason I'm selling is because I moved up to a 450 Bushmaster since the law changes last week for legal guns in Ohio for deer.  New...the rifle will cost you well over $700, closer to $800 and the scope is about $130-150 anywhere.  Scope carries no hassle lifetime guarantee, transferrable to everyone that owns it.trying to basically give somebody the scope for free if you buy the rifle!  Lower price....needs to move. $700 scoped rifle, $600 for rifle with rings.  This is my ""off season"" price.  As it gets closer to Deer gun season, I'm going to start raising the price each time I bump it.  These are going up as the NEW stock sells out and none available from Ruger anymore."
