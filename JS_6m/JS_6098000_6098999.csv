Has more wall penetration than a 9mm.  The glow in dark night sights are a marvel in itself, the extended releases make for easier operation, and the very grippy grip adds a perfect amount of cushion and ergonomics to aid in recoil reduction and controllability. From checking retail price for this setup with accessories ($750+ minimum) and auction vendors you cant really beat this deal.  This comprehensive package is literally all you'll ever need with this G22.  It almost pains me to part with it,  whoever gets it will be happy they made the choice.   Thanks for looking. * PAYMENT AND SHIPPING *  -  Accept cash in person, bank transfer, money order, btc.  Sale/transfer will be done by the book through a licensed FFL dealer.  Can ship to one as well upon receipt of payment, shipping is $20."

There are no extra holes drilled in this Winchester anywhere. It has a 25” round blued barrel, open sights, hooded front sight, and folding rear sight. It has a hinged floor plate and a grooved trigger. It retains all of its original bluing which shines bright with a deep and rich luster. There are no rust issues. It has the factory sling swivels and the correct Red Winchester recoil pad. The walnut stock is in 95%++ condition showing only a few very minor collector type handling marks. The stock is walnut with a checkered pistol grip. The LOP is 13 1/2”. The wood is in excellent condition with no cracks, no chips, no breaks, and no splits.
