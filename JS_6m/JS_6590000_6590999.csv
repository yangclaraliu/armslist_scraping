A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.   PRODUCT SPECS Caliber: .380 ACP Length: 5.26” Height: 3.75” Width: .750“” Barrel Length: 2.80” Distance Between Sights: 4” Weight (unloaded): 8.8 oz Trigger Pull: ≈5.5# Magazine Capacity: 6+1 Rds Magazines: 2"

Price is firm, and sales tax will be added to Arizona sales.   All major credit cards accepted, no additional charge.  DESCRIPTION Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment. **Includes a free 1 year NRA membership, a $40 value**   PRODUCT SPECS Caliber: 9x19MM Length: 5.60” Height: 4.00” Width: 0.80” Barrel Length: 3.00” Distance Between Sights: 4.25” Weight (unloaded): 11 oz Trigger Pull: ≈5.5# Magazine Capacity: 6+1 Rds Magazines: 1"

Price is firm, and sales tax will be added to Arizona sales.   All major credit cards accepted, no additional charge.  DESCRIPTION Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.**Includes a free 1 year NRA membership, a $40 value**    PRODUCT SPECS Caliber: 9x19MM Length: 5.60” Height: 4.00” Width: 0.80” Barrel Length: 3.00” Distance Between Sights: 4.25” Weight (unloaded): 11 oz Trigger Pull: ≈5.5# Magazine Capacity: 6+1 Rds Magazines: 1"

The X95 features STANAG magazine compatibility, forefinger ambidextrous magazine release, interchangeable pistol grip assemblies and a tri-rail forearm with removable rail covers for easily customizable accessory placement (flashlight, laser, vertical fore grip, bipod, etc.). Like its predecessor the TAR-21, the X95 is 100% ambidextrous to right or left hand operation with the optional opposite hand bolt."

This is a 50mm objective scope, not the standard 40mm, so it gathers alot of light, but you will likely need ""high"" rings to mount it. Never been mounted. I had this same scope in Silver on a rifle that needed to be sent in prior to deer season for repair. I didn't get it back in time and bought a new scope and mounted it. Then Nikon sent me this replacement in ""black"" which I have no use for (Silver was discontinued) So while I opened the box, it's just been sitting here. Nikon lifetime warranty.

This pistol operates flawlessly as it should and has the same internal frame design as the CZ 75. Again this was the first clone ever produced and the only one I know of with a trigger guard undercut that helps you get an even higher grip. This pistol has a very low bore axis so it shoots very flat and has the same safety mechanism as the Beretta M9/92fs but is much easier to access then the Beretta because of the placement on the slide and width of the slide. This gun speaks for itself $350 firm these are selling for more on GunBroker and GunsAmerica when they pop up in this condition they are usually $500 or more I am giving this up for $350 cash which is a steal!*** REDACTED ***

It is a TRUE single shot with the steel bottom in the action and not a plate over the magazine. It has a long action too, again showing it was specifically made as a single shot 223, which 223 is short action. Also has a tactical bolt handle. The receiver is blued, the barrel is stainless. This action is solid.Researching this gun, what I understand it was made in the late 1980's to early 1990's. I also read somewhere at one time some of these rifles were made for the Boy Scouts of America, not sure. If anyone has info, that would be appreciated.The stock is a sought after factory skeleton Choate and the fluted and recessed 26"" barrel is truly free floated. The stock alone goes for $270 at Choate.The trigger is the nicest trigger I ever felt. Light. Betting no more than 2 pounds.Includes a Plano Airglide gun case which goes for $60 alone. Weaver scope bases included.$450 FTF. Will not ship at this time, this thing is a beast, very heavy, and not sure if I could find a large shipping box to fit this and the large case.NO TRADES PLEASE.Thanks and check out my other listings. Selling off my personal inventory. If you buy two items, will give you a break on price and shipping."

The pre-cursor to the Model 1897 they were only produced for three years between 1893 and 1896. Approximately 34,000 total. They are black powder only. Winchester offered a voluntary trade in program for a new Model 1897 when it was introduced. This particular 1893 was manufactured in 1895. It has typical handling marks for a 120 year old gun but everything works as it should and the bore is in excellent shape. The fore end is not cracked, a common problem for the early, three-screw style fore ends. It is missing the butt plate. It had a rubber Pachmyr pad on it when I got it, but it looked terrible so I took it off. An early 1897 plate should be an accurate replacement. It has a somewhat strange patina too it, I have no explanation for it.I'm interested in trades for other early and antique sporting arms and curiosa. I am not really interested in Mil-surps, maybe US military.  I will trade up or down with cash either way.  Face to Face sale only and I might ask to see ID or a LTCF."

The reason this rifle is a good deal is first of all, if you want me to prove I spent over $1,300 on what I'm selling (without taking it to the range more than once to zero it) I absolutely can, but what makes it a good deal is that i'm including the optic, mount, case, a few magazines, etc. But here are the detailsBurris PEPR cantilever scope mount (~$110-$120 on it's own)Vortex Strike Eagle scope ($300-$350 on it's own and backed by vortex's lifetime warranty on their products)2x Hexmags 1x Magpul gen 2 windowless pmag (Also I have one mag loaded with some Hornady 75grain home defense ammo which is like $25 a box which comes with the rifle)Flambeau Tactical hard caseCVlife bipod (Didn't have the cash at the time of the build to buy a proper harris but for a budget bipod it actually does it's job quite well for bench shooting) It's a great rifle, I just didn't have nearly as much money as I would have wanted to to turn it into kind of a dream AR. If I was going to turn it into a perfect competition / target rifle I would basically just be putting a geissele match trigger in and picking up that harris bipod. Notably because I went with a prebuilt upper assembly and the scope is a vortex (also a lifetime guarantee on their gear) the upper and optic of the rifle are both covered warranty wise. I will entertain trade offers with cash attatched, realistically i'm not looking for anything but I'm mostly looking for cash."

However, the builder knew exactly what he was doing when he constructed the pistol, as it functions smoothly, and is wonderfully built. This pistol would be a great addition to any collection.The grips currently on the pistol appear to be cocobolo wood.Near the muzzle on the right side of the slide, the pistol has some minor scratches that should be fairly simple to remove, beyond that, the finish is almost perfect.Includes the hardcase, original grips, two magazines, and fifty rounds of Winchester White Box.I would prefer a trade, but I am willing to sell for $1100 OBOI'm looking for a higher end AK-74, such as an Arsenal.
