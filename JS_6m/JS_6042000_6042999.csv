I will be taking this to sell at my local gun shop if I don't hear from anyone by tomorrow, which I am sure I will take a big hit on. Any reasonable offer will be considered. Here is more about the firearm:Thoroughly cleaned after every range trip. About 500 rounds through it. Bought this past February of 2016. It is new since Magnum Research bought out Desert Eagle back recently. Bought it originally because shooting 44 magnum is a lot cheaper that shooting .50 AE. If you want to shoot .50 AE, all you have to do is switch out the barrel; the bolt and magazine are compatible with .50 AE. The Desert Eagle can be fickle with ammo but found that PPU JHP from sgammo.com at only $28 per box of 50 rounds cycle flawlessly. Here is a break down of what it comes with, what I paid and my asking price for the entire bundle. Serious inquires only please:• Desert Eagle Stainless Steel 44 Magnum with Integral Muzzle Brake (Paid $1800 with Tax)• 5 Additional Magazines (Paid $250)• Custom Punisher Cross Draw Chest Holster (Paid $200)• 812 Rounds of 44 Magnum JHP PPU Ammo (Paid $454)• SureFire X300 Ultra Tactical Light (Paid $200)• Condor Case ($30)• Hoage Grips ($50)• 44 Magnum Bore Snake ($20)• Desert Eagle Speed Loader ($30)Includes all original paperwork and case.Total Investment: $3034Asking: $2400 OBONo trades.

Manufacturer: Ruger   Model: Hawkeye M77 FTW Hunter   SKU: 47145   Caliber: .30-06   Capacity: 4 Rounds   Barrel Length: 24"" Threaded (1/2x24"")   Finish: Hawkeye Matte Stainless   Stock: Natural Gear Camo Laminate   Weight: 8.2 lbs   Sights: None, Drilled and Tapped   Twist: 1:10   -Also includes: rugged one-piece, stainless steel bolt; studs for mounting sling swivels.   The Ruger® Muzzle Brake System includes a removable, radial-port muzzle brake that significantly reduces felt recoil. For times when the brake is not preferred, it may be replaced by the included dynamically-matched muzzle weight. Switching between the brake and the weight will not change the bullet's point of impact for a particular load. Description:    -Non-rotating, Mauser-type controlled round feed extractor is the most positive case extraction system ever invented, and features a fixed blade-type ejector that positively ejects the empty cases as the bolt is moved fully rearward.   -Hinged solid-steel floorplate for easy unloading without having to chamber each cartridge. Features an engraved FTW logo and patented latch that is flush with the trigger guard to avoid accidental dumping of cartridges.   -Three-position safety is easily accessible and allows the shooter to lock the bolt or to load and unload the rifle with the safety engaged.   -Cold hammer-forged barrel results in ultra-precise rifling that provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning.   -Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver, provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field (scope rings included).   -Ergonomically pleasing stock features a soft rubber buttpad with buttpad spacers that allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters or varying levels of outerwear (three 1/2"" spacers included).   -The included thread protector may be used if neither the brake nor the weight is desired.

These are not Makarov pistols, but do fire the same caliber cartridge 9x18/9mm Makarov. Manufactured at the world-famous Radom Circle 11 plant in Poland, this is an excellent choice for combat, self-defense, open or concealed carry, target practice/range gun, or simply an addition to any respectable firearm collection. The double-action trigger pull is difficult so that it will not accidentally discharge with the hammer de-cocked and a live round in the chamber while carrying. The single-action trigger pull is extremely short, crisp, and enjoyable. This pistol can be taken down and re-assembled quickly with ease. These come from Poland used by Polish Military and Police and may or may not show slight use. They are still in the inventories of Polish Armed Forces and Police to this day. Very Good Condition.   These are stock photos – exact condition will vary.   Must be 21+ years of age to purchase.   Price: $269.99 each"
