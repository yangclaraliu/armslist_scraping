I'm listing it as used because it WAS previously sold at retail. I bought this from the original owner who stated he never fired it. Rings are still in package and the bolt looks new. The box did not fare as well from storage as the rifle which is immaculate. There are a couple of minor handling marks in the bright ss finish on the barrel. My experience in the past with these SS Rugers is minor scratches or marks can be polished out with little effort but I'll leave that up to you. The skeleton stock is in great condition with just a couple of very minor scuffs from safe storage. When I first bought the gun there was one very small area of surface rust[1/16""] just ahead of the receiver. The rust wiped right off of the SS but left a very minor dark spot. I tried to capture it in the photos but it is hard with the flash and the SS finish. Again it may polish out with little effort but I'll leave that up to the new owner. It is hardly noticeable in person or in the pictures but I am an OCD stickler when it comes to condition so I like to point out EVERYTHING I see no matter how small or minor it may be. There is nothing worse for me than surprises on your end of the deal. Strong bright bore.
This is the nicest example of the Skeleton M77's that I have ever had....I'm just thinning my herd of safe queens. Any questions please ask prior to bidding.
Rifle will ship via UPS ground insured for the purchase price. I'm a private seller so I will include a copy of my Drivers license for your FFL's records. If you need the rifle to go through an FFL on my end.....I can do that too but they charge me $30 so total shipping would increase to $65 in that case.
USPS money orders only for payment and should be received within 5 business days."

It has about 40 rounds through it.  It was purchased at Ammo Bros. in ontario.  It will include two magazines, the holster and the case. Please note that this sale will be 100% legal.  We can do the transaction at Ammo bros in Riverside or Turners in Corona. Please be sure to have 2 forms of identification and your handgun safety certificate card in order to process the sale. I paid about $730 out the door with tax, dros and holster. You will not need to pay tax.  I'm selling this because I orginally wanted to get my permit to carry with this, but i was able to find someone that will sell me their glock 43 instead. It's very accurate, but the 45 caliber is a little to strong for my wife. I am available to do the transaction during the weekends or i get off of work at 6:30 m-f.  Send me a text or an email if you have any questions. REDACTED"

As you can see from the pictures, they have a vivid, unmistakeable grain that, in addition to being gorgeous, is something that no snythetic ivory substitute has ever or could ever hope to replicate, and it should therefore be obvious to anyone that they are the real deal. They are marked ""Hand Crafted for Colt Firearms"" on the back in blue ink, and he actually had several other sets of ivory grips marked in the same fashion.  According to the seller, this mark indicates that they were all made by Jim Alaimo, who would later go on to found Nutmeg Sports, during his time as the overseer of the Colt Custom Shop. (I cannot myself attest to this, but some searching with google does seem to indicate this is the truth.) Though they seemed a bit long for a Mustang, he assured me they were made to fit that exact model and that they would require no special fitting to go on one.Having a Colt Mustang, I bought them, only to find that my suspicions were correct, and they were indeed about 3/4 of an inch too long to fit my pistol. To be fair, it appears that the seller was not entirely incorrect, as they would indeed have fit my Mustang if it had been a Colt Mustang ""PLUS II"" model, which is a variantion that mated the shortened slide of the Colt Mustang with the full size frame of the Colt .380 Government Model (not the full size Colt Government Model, mind you...the .380 Government is a different beast, or approximately a 3/4 scale recreation of one). I will therefore repeat: these grips are made to fit either a Colt Government .380 or Colt Mustang Plus II.This is the mother of all longshots, but I will trade my ivory grips that will beautifully fit either of these two classic Colts for grips of an equally valuable material that will fit a Colt Mustang. Materials I consider of equal value include elephant, walrus, and hippo ivory, fossil ivories such as mammoth and walrus, engraved sterling silver, genuine mother of pearl, and musk ox boss. Sambar stag might possibly approach a near equal value, but only if it is a truly exceptional example of such with the most impressive popcorn texture, and so might select examples of jigged bone, but again only if it is of such an exquisite grade as I doubt has ever been made to fit a gun this modern. I have no interest in trading for any synthetic ivory or pearl substitutes and probably not any woods."
