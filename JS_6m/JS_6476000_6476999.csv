SUAREZ ""FLAT AND STRAIGHT"" TACTICAL GRADE TRIGGER
The Tactical Grade ""Flat Faced"" Trigger closely replicates the feel of a 1911 trigger. Our Tactical Grade Glock Trigger has been thoroughly tested to insure reliability, consistency, and uniformity of weight. You will immediately notice the difference in your shooting performance after installation.
The trigger face is totally and geometrically flat:  Look at all the match rifles used to set combat rifle marksmanship records.  They all use flat triggers.  Flat triggers are totally flat and straight, not just ""square faced"" curved triggers.  ""Flat and straight"" triggers improve your mechanical leverage and allow you to consistently place your shooting finger in the most advantageous location for you.  Additionally, these triggers maintain a more consistent feeling trigger regardless of where on that trigger your finger is placed."

Red Army looked for a new, modern semiautomatic pistol to replace obsolete Nagant M1895 revolvers and a variety of foreign semi-automatic pistols. One of the most popular foreign handguns, purchased in numbers during 1920s, was the famous Mauser C96, and the Red Army really liked its powerful 7.63mm cartridge, which, in slightly modified form ,selected for its future pistol of domestic design. Red Army tested several pistols of various designers, and in 1930 eventually selected the design of the famous Russian arms designer, Fedor Tokarev. During 1930 - 1932 Red Army procured several thousands of new pistol, and after initial field testing requested several improvements, which resulted in the adoption of the model 1933 Tokarev pistol early in 1934. This pistol was manufactured in increased numbers prior to the Great Patriotic War. Before July 22, 1941, about 600 000 TT-33 pistols were delivered to Red Army. During war pistols were made in increasing numbers. In 1946 the TT was slightly modified to cut production costs, and its manufacture in USSR finally ceased circa 1952, with the adoption of the more modern 9mm Makarov PM pistol. However, TT served with the Soviet Army well until 1960s, and with the Soviet Militia (Police) - until 1970s. During late 1940s and 1950s USSR also supplied some of its new allies from Warsaw pact with licenses to manufacture TT, and it was produced in China, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia, in more or less original forms. Most military TT pistols of non-Soviet manufacture were also in 7.62mm, with some commercial export versions available in 9x19mm Luger, and fitted with some sorts of manual safety. For its time Tokarev TT was a formidable weapon, with good penetration and effective range. It was of good reliability and easy to maintain. What it lacked most was the manual safety, and its grip shape was not too comfortable. The Tokarev TT is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It uses Browning swinging link system, borrowed from the Colt M1911 pistol, modified to simplify production. The single action trigger had no safeties, other than disconnector to prevent out-of-battery fire, and a half-cock notch on the hammer. The only safe way to carry TT was to always have an empty chamber. The hammer unit was made as a single unit, easily detachable for cleaning and maintenance. Some years later Swiss designer Charles Petter developed similar system for the French Mle. 1935 pistol. Steel magazine held 8 cartridges. Fixed sights were factory zeroed for 25 meters. Grip panels were usually made of plastic or wood (wartime production)."

MSRP $229. Lowest price I've seen online $184. From Galco: ""Galco combined features from their Miami Classic with a traditional vertical shoulder holster to create a system that's perfect for the 21st century's first responders and military personnel. Proven in Iraq and Afghanistan, the VHS has been field tested over military uniforms and general hunting clothing with great success, and thousands are currently in use by American armed services personnel fighting the Global War on Terrorism. Although Galco did not set out to create another concealment rig, they discovered that it's hard to break away from their roots. The VHS provides a long-awaited alternative for those who want the concealment of the Miami Classic but prefer the classic vertical carry style. A key component of this patented shoulder system is its spider harness. All four points of the spider harness can pivot independently and are connected by the clover shape, trademarked Flexalon swivel back plate. This, along with their patented swivel connectors, results in a perfect fit and lasting comfort for virtually all body sizes and shapes. The Vertical Shoulder Holster System consists of holster, harness, ammo carrier and a set of system screws. Fully modular, optional accessories and components may be purchased separately. Whether you patrol the perilous sands of the Middle East, walk the mean streets of metropolitan America, or stalk the hunting fields of the world, the VHS will help you and your handgun stay secure in an often-dangerous world.""price does not include shipping"

When set on 1x, the PSU provides a huge 26 degree field of view facilitating rapid “both eyes open” target engagement. Set on 1x it can be employed similar to a reflex sight, providing quick hits on multiple or fast moving targets. With the flip of a switch the magnification increases to 4x providing target identification, ranging and engagement at extended distances. A Bullet Drop Compensating reticle combined with a simple to use “no math” telemetric rangefinder provides fast and reliable hits.Built to survive harsh conditions the PSU is manufactured from a solid aluminum alloy body. The design is both shockproof and watertight. The fully multi-coated optics provides a sharp and bright image with accurate color rendition and excellent resolution. The illuminated reticle features seven intensity settings and is powered by a readily available CR2032 3-volt battery. The BDC reticle provides ballistic compensation out to 800 meters. The telemetric rangefinder allows ranging out to the same distance. Capped adjustment turrets provide quick and trouble free zeroing. Once zeroed all ballistic corrections are made using the reticle.Very compact in size, the PSU is only 7.4 inches long. Weight is just 24 ounces. Eye relief is a generous 2.75 inches. The PSU mounts easily to a MIL STD 1913 Picatinny rail and features two QD levers. These allow rapid attachment and removal, no tools required. Extremely robust, the PSU is a perfect match for an AR-15 or other Modern Sporting Rifle.    Magnification easily changes from 1x to 4x    32mm objective provides a large Exit Pupil    Very wide field of view    Compact size, only 7.4 inches long    Illuminated 800 meter BDC reticle    Illuminated 800 meter telemetric rangefinder    Seven intensity settings    Power provided by common CR2032 battery    Only 24.6 ounces with QD mount    Fits Mil Std 1913 Picatinny rail    QD levers for rapid on/off    Shockproof and watertight construction--------------Specifications--------------Magnification:         1x and 4xField of View 1x:     26Field of View 4x:     6.5Exit pupil:         8mmEye relief:         70mmAdjustment range of the sight by height:     +0-10 mils, min.Adjustment range of the sight by direction:     +0-10 mils, minThe height of optical axis to the seat plane:     37.5mmPower supply:         CR2032 3VOverall dimensions:     7.5x3x3 inWeight:         24.6 oz."

This pistol for sale was manufactured 8/19/1998 and is called a Pre-rail version since in 2000 S&W added a rail to the frame for accessories which most S&W enthsuiasts don't care for. The Pre-rail versions are highly sought after and now hard to find in really good condition like this pistol. The grips are like new, the recoil spring is new, and there are only a couple of signs of minor holster wear on the frame.   The TSW (Tactical Support Weapon) features thicker full length frame rails for enhanced accuracy and delayed unlocking to reduce felt recoil. That and a dual recoil spring set-up make this a highly controllable soft shooter for accurate follow up shots and comfortable fun at the range. Considered a compact with it's 3.5"" barrel,  I found it's accuracy every bit as good as my full size pistols at all target distances with the Novak Lo-Mount 3 dot sights.  The .40 S&W cartridge was developed by Winchester and Smith & Wesson in an effort to to create a round with knock down power similar to the FBI 10mm round (also .40 cal.) but with a shorter case which would facilitate accuracy and allow use of a smaller, more comfortable grip frame. As a result the .40 S&W became the cartridge of choice for law enforcement agencies.Frame construction is lightweight aluminum alloy with a stainless steel slide for a total weight of only 25.7 ozs. empty so this pistol is perfect if you want a handsome carry gun on steroids.The action is called Traditional Double Action (TDA) which describes a longer 1st shot trigger pull which cocks the hammer, and single action short, crisp, and light trigger pull on subsequent shots. An ambidextrous safety / decocker is featured for convenience and ultimate safety.This pistol comes with 2 S&W factory 9 round magazines in equally nice condition in a Smith & Wesson plastic case including the original instruction manual, gun lock, orange empty chamber flag, wax wrap and paperwork it came with new. Additional S&W factory 9 round magazines are available at my $40 cost. Another plus, S&W 11 round Hi-capacity magazines with flush fit adapter are also available for this model for added firepower.Please email  or call / text Bill 813 . 857 . 8287 for more info or pictures. I'm willing to meet anywhere in the bay area to show this fine pistol."
