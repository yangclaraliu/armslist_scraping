Like new condition.The Savage® 11/111 Trophy Hunter XP Bolt-Action Rifle comes ready to take into the field with a factory mounted riflescope and exceptional out-of-the-box accuracy. The Trophy Hunter features Savage's AccuTrigger® that is easily adjustable by user to get a light, crisp release with no creep; while a lever mounted within the trigger body blocks the sear unless the trigger is intentionally pressed in the center, virtually minimizing the risk of accidental discharge. The basic bolt design assures that the locking lugs fully contact the receiver, holding the headspace to a minimum every time the bolt is locked. The tight headspace and a free floated barrel contribute to the excellent accuracy Savage rifles are known for. The Trophy Hunter XP combo comes with a Nikon® 3–9 x 40mm scope with a BDC (Bullet Drop Compensation) reticle that gives hold-over points for precision long range shooting. The synthetic stock, barrel, and receiver are finished in matte black that won't spook game, and sling swivel studs and a soft rubber butt pad are standard. A 3-position receiver tang safety is easy to reach with the shooter's thumb, and allows the rifle to be loaded and unloaded in the safe position. A detachable magazine provides quick and safe reloading and unloading of the rifle. The Savage 11/111 Trophy Hunter XP combo is a highly functional, yet practical bolt-action rifle that will serve years of rugged use.    Exceptional out-of-the-box accuracy    Fully adjustable and safe AccuTrigger    Free-floated matte finished barrel    Factory mounted Nikon riflescope    3-position receiver tang safety    Drilled and tapped receiver    Detachable magazine    Synthetic stockPatented BDC reticle: The BDC reticle allows hunters to hold 'dead-on' at ranges exceeding those previously thought possible. The BDC's unique see-through ballistic circles offer an incredible advantage for long range shooting, yet allow a normal sight picture for shorter-range shots where the crosshair itself is the aiming point.Extremely bright sight picture: Allows for high-resolution images even when hunting in the least desirable conditions.Versatile magnification range: Offers the flexibility needed for any type of hunting situation, from heavy timber to the open prairies.Waterproof, fogproof, shockproof: Nitrogen filled and O-ring sealed.Multicoated optical system: Multicoated lenses boost light transmission up to 98%—unheard of in similarly priced scopes.Generous, consistent eye relief: Keeps your brow safe—even with the heaviest recoiling cartridges, lightweight rifles, and severe shooting angles.Precise hand-turn 1/4-MOA click adjustments: Positive-click reticle adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting even with heavy recoil.Sun Shade Adaptable: 40 mm & 50 mm models."

The barrel is the correct 39 inches long. There is no mount for a bayonet on the barrel. One screw from the Snider brench appears to be missing.  Some odd things about this rifle that made looking up its history rather difficult.  There are no markings on the brass butt plate.  No markings on the brass trigger guard.  No W.D. markings. No markings on the wood stock. Also, another odd feature is there the rear sight is gone. I can’t find any milling marks on the barrel to indicate whether it was broken or intentionally removed. The 1853 Enfield prior to the Snider conversion had a rear sight. So was this done on purpose after the conversion, or someone half assed it? I don’t know."

It looks to be unfired since leaving the factory, the bore is gleaming, and even the chambers are exceptionally clean. The Dome Blue is deep and rich, with only a slight turn ring on the cylinder. The case color is 100% vivid, and the grips are about flawless. The original box is in very good condition, other than the estate had a large inventory tag over the end label, taking much with it when removed. The cardboard b outer sleeve is also present. This is a very unique USFA, as it was ordered with a 6 inch barrel and is chambered in 38-40. This caliber is one of my favorites, as it is actually a full .40 caliber. I suppose Winchester did not want to confuse the public by having a 40-40 and a 44-40. Regardless, these are the features that collectors will be looking for as the value of these fine single actions continues to soar.

Murcott 68 Haymarket London.  The trigger plate was made by Theophilus Murcott.  The plate is a converted flintlock trigger plate to a precussion cap.  The breach was also converted from a flint lock style to the precussion cap.  The plate is likely 1840-1850's of manufacture. Making the trigger plate over 160 years old itself.
Between 1860-1878 there was a man named Theophilus Murcott that had a gunsmith shop at that location. It is also the same address for W W Greener sportsman firearms that occupied the location at the same time frame. However, W.W. Greener still exists at 68 Haymarket in London to this day.
 
Furthermore, Theophilus Murcott was the man that in 1871 designed and patented the first successfully mass produced hammerless shotgun. A design still used to this day in modern hammerless shotguns. This shotgun is likely one of his “Rookie” or “Novice” made shotguns. Possibly made in 1861 when he first started his business in London.
 
There’s very little fine detailing done to this shotgun. I can find some detailing on the trigger guard and on the back behind the trigger. The wood shows signs of having been sanded down near the butt plate. Unknown why. Seeing as how basic the design is with a lack of any fine details I’d say this was a base model shotgun in the shop.
 
The ramrod for loading is missing. Someone replaced the front steel band with a copper band likely while it was in a muslim country such as Turkey or Afghanistan. The hatching on the trigger is well worn. At 156 years old it’s been through many hands.
 
There are two holes, one on top and one on bottom of the muzzle. No idea why. Don’t know if that’s original or modified. Barrel measures almost 43 inches long. The barrel itself was made by wrapping a long steel band around a bar and turning it into a barrel.  Definantly original style of making a gun barrel.  Sorry but I will not take offer's less than $100. It's worth up to $120 as a rather unique wallhanger.  Buyer pays shipping."

Once I bought the pistol I then added the following:- Vortex Strikefire halo site. Not a cheap Chinese deal. Was over $200 back when I bought it. Closer to $300 if memory serves me. You can choose Green or Red reticle. Still has the original battery and shines bright, so that tells you I've used it very little.- Laser/illuminator combo (green laser) - paid $90- The sling and custom attachements (not KelTec junk). Fox sling, forget who made the attachements, but it was a guy who made them specific for PLR16's. Paid $50 for the mounts, sling, etc.- Red Lion Forend - $150- Two 30 round Pmags. $24- The gun was $550So....just over $1k in it. I've shot exactly 100 rounds through it. Will sell for $700 cash FIRM or a trade valued a little higher as shown below..."
