The exposed hammer of the 637 enables you to cock the revolver for deliberate, precise aim. Shooting in double-action mode makes the revolver extremely fast to deploy in stressful situations, as there is nothing to remember to do except point and pull the trigger. The low profile, ramp front sight and the fixed notch rear sight are quick to line up, and the inherently ergonomic design, and synthetic finger-groove grips aid in the gun's natural pointability. The Model 637 is built on Smith & Wesson's famous J-Frame; it has a 5-shot cylinder rated for +P .38 Special ammunition. Stainless steel and alloy construction resist corrosion caused by humidity and perspiration when the revolver is carried close to the body. The Smith & Wesson 637 Airweight Double-Action Revolver carries easily, deploys rapidly, and has enough firepower to handle any self-defense scenario."

Included is everything pictured. The 2 10 round magazines that came with it, and 2 9 round magazines, which I like because it makes no difference to me whether my pinky is on the grip or not (I must not use it too much) and the shorter grip makes it Really easy to conceal! I just got this gun a couple months ago, and have only had it to the range once. So it has 100 rounds through it.  Sadly, my wonderful Hemi Challenger, with less than 35000 miles on it, apparently needs tie rods! So, here's a great deal on a gun that still sells out so fast they are sometimes hard to find.  If you have a G19, pretty much all of the holsters work with this (some that are closed at the end don't)."

Opportunities in life come around once in blue moon, here is one of those opportunities that might be hard to overlook. I've owned a few Pythons over the years and this Stainless Steel Python is probably the best you can ever get. It has the action smoothness of a 1957 Python and the excellent machining of a 1970's Python. Yet this 1984 Python is made in Stainless Steel and has all the great features of all the Colt Pythons ever made over the years. Some Python Collectors have said that the T series Colt Pythons were the best ever manufactured and I happen to agree. ""Totally Awesome"" is the description that comes to mind. If you desire the best, then here it is. Unequaled in workmanship and lethality, this Colt PYthon in Stainless Steel is not only the one gun to carry but also fits well into a collectors safe. Great for survival and hunting also. Too bad I can't find the box on this 33 year old wonder! Listed here for a Penny , above all the rest. Factory wood grips that are perfect! This Colt Python is 99%! I've only shot a box of ammo out of this fantastic pistol and it hits the center X of a bullseye at 50ft. every shot! If you are a Colt Python connoisseur then you realize what a find this is. Strap it on or bring it out occasionally to marvel at with your friends. All will agree, you have the best, which is a comforting feeling to have. This T series Colt Python built in 1984 is a treasure and a one time opportunity to hand down a Colt collector through your family generations.PAYMENT IS BY BANK DEPOSIT."

Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56, another 9mm stripped lower, side charging uppers and factory Glock 33rd mags in exc/new codition as far as use/springs go.  I'll even consider PSA(or similar brands) pistol uppers and $250-$300 cash, depending if new or used, since I can buy most of those new complete from PSA for around $300 shipped.  Might also trade for a Glock 17 Gen 4 in NEW condition.
If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.

Except for markings, it is virtually identical to the US Ross Model 1905.There is much confusion over the correct name/model for this bayonet and it has been known by many different titles: Canadian Ross Rifle Bayonet, Model 1910 (aka Mark I Ross; aka Model 1905; aka Model 1905/1910; aka Pattern 1908; aka Model 1910, etc). The 1905 designation is due to the 1905 adoption and issue of the .303 caliber Ross Rifle. However, the Ross was not originally equipped to allow attachment of a bayonet. The bayonet was officially adopted in 1908 - although patented prior to that in 1907 - but was not issued until 1910 (the confusion over model-year designation becomes very apparent). In reality this bayonet is best known as the Ross Rifle 1910 Mark II Bayonet.These bear the distinctive markings: ROSS RIFLE CO. / QUEBEC / PATENTED 1907 on the pommel, right (obverse); various acceptance/inspection marks can be found on the left side (reverse). These marks usually consist of: two-character designation II (for MkII); an ""arrowhead shape in a circle,"" the Canadian Government Ownership Mark; a ""crown over a number"" is a Ross Factory Inspection mark; and an issue date, i.e. 8/10 (August 1910).The .303 Ross Rifle and Bayonet were used by Canadian units in WWI from about 1914 to 1918. They were phased-out - when possible - by the .303 Lee-Enfield Rifle and Bayonet. Hilt has an oddly ""squared"" steel pommel; integral push-button/internal-spring latching mechanism. The cross-guard step - unique to the Mark I - has been removed on the Mark II as well as the internal muzzle spring.Steel crossguard with upper half being a muzzle-ring, lower half being a quillon with flat drum finial.Single-edged, knife blade is un-fullered; there are at least three accepted variants. The scabbards are brown leather.  Call or text 717-468-8446 $165.00 OBO  Local pick up only."

This is one of those rare Colts that you hear about but rarely get a chance to own. These don't show themselves very often, so this may be the only chance for one in this condition. This is just the way it left the Colt factory back in 1988, the only year of production. The box for the STALKER is in pretty good shape for 29 years old. One sold a couple of years ago, with incorrect grips and a VERY rough box. Just try and find another one for sale in any condition!!!
