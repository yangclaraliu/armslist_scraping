Pre-1972 Rounded Hammer Spur (Post-1972 Models have the Triangle Hammer Spur) Loaded Chamber Indicator Two 6-Round Original Factory Magazines Included – One will match the serial number   Combat Arms Description: This pistol is a Combat Arms personal favorite for accuracy, reliability, range, and simplicity in a solid steel construction with a permanently attached fixed barrel. These are not Makarov pistols, but do fire the same caliber cartridge 9x18/9mm Makarov. Manufactured at the world-famous Radom Circle 11 plant in Poland, this is an excellent choice for combat, self-defense, open or concealed carry, target practice/range gun, or simply an addition to any respectable firearm collection. The double-action trigger pull is difficult so that it will not accidentally discharge with the hammer de-cocked and a live round in the chamber while carrying. The single-action trigger pull is extremely short, crisp, and enjoyable. This pistol can be taken down and re-assembled quickly with ease. These come from Poland used by Polish Military and Police and may or may not show slight use. They are still in the inventories of Polish Armed Forces and Police to this day. Very Good Condition.   These are stock photos – exact condition will vary.   Must be 21+ years of age to purchase.   Price: $269.99 each"

It has the two mags, the 7 round and the 8 round, and the original box. It has some finish wear as it's seen some carry but nothing I would consider a ""blemmish"" or anything. It shoots great. I've run probably 200-300 rounds through it with 115 grain range FMJ and about 20 124 gr.+P Golden Saber's to make sure function with JHP's was good. Frankly, it's just a situation where it's not blowing my skirt up anymore and I'm just more apt to prefer Glock platforms all around. Great gun, great concept, great round, really accurate, manageable recoil, great ammo options and availability, but it's just not doing it for me. I'll need to see a valid Florida CCP for a trade and I'n not adverse to doing a cross bill of sale if that's what it takes.   Thanks for reading the add.  If you're so inclined, text me at REDACTED."

This ammo was made by taking compressed copper powder to make the projectile. As soon as the projectile strikes a hard surface it shatters. It's extra safe shooting steel close-up as well as using inside shoot houses. Do your research before sending me your offers this stuff is not cheap. I don't care about where and how much you can get it for on other websites if that is the case order it from them. Last time I checked a box of 50 was going going for 24.99 for about 50 cent around and I'm only asking for 350.00 for 1000 rounds so that is a deal already you will pay 500 for 1000 rounds of this stuff.

Details as follows:---Rifle:-AK-74-- Numbers matching NEW Bulgarian kit on an NDS-74 (Nodak Spud) receiver by TGI Imports, in excellent condition.  Yes, it has the side optics rail (many of these did not).  For clarification, this is a TGI FACTORY BUILT rifle, not a home build. TGI only made these guns with NEW Bulgarian kits for a short time, and these are considered on par with Arsenal rifles (minus the price tag!)-Barrel is chrome lined, finished with an original Bulgarian chrome lined AK74 brake.-Furniture consists of a Polish bulged front end with a Romanian stock.  Both have been refinished and differ slightly in color, stock has had a small repair on the right side.  Colors and finish are very nice, really pops in the sunlight (see pic)-Grip is a standard bakelite-Sling is a standard surplus green canvas, NOS conditionOverall, less than 500 rounds through gun---Mags (all 30rd):-2x East German bakelites-2x Izzy bakelites-5x Bulgarian black polymer---Ammo:-450rds Wolf Polyperformance and Military Classic, all in 30rd boxes-60rds loose 7n6 surplusLooking to sell everything for $1250At this price, the package is a deal. The rifle alone (when they can be found) has been found going for $1k. Top that with mags at $35-40/ea, and ammo at $0.15-0.20... Do the math. Obviously, I don't expect ""brand new"" or ""gunbroker"" prices, hence my package deal being well below the total value. That being what it is, the price is firm. Would prefer selling, but to help out with the expense I can accept partial trades. IF YOU WANT ""MSRP"" OR BRAND NEW VALUE FOR YOUR TRADES, I WILL EXPECT THE SAME. Likewise, lowballers and other asinine offers will be ignored."

Sighted in at 200 yds and shoots 1"" high at 100 yards.If you could only own one rifle, the 7mm Mag would be a great choice.  It is fast and has a very flat trajectory.  It is good for Texas white tales in the woods or open plains and can handle any other game on the North American continent. It is also accurate.  I shot a turkey through the neck with this rifle at almost 100 yards."

Originally, there were to be 1000 of these rifles imported but far fewer actually made it into the country.

The various major parts are serial numbered and all matching (except the flash hider) and it comes with a new condition Russian PSO-1 detachable scope that is also serial numbered to the rifle. Condition is excellent, as new. I would grade the rifle at 99.9% overall. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent. The rifle is unfired.

The scope mounts in a B&T mount (best there is).  If you want to go light or shoot in heavy metal 3-gun attach the wood furniture and shoot the iron sights!  It's a change that takes minutes.  This is the complete kit and best deal on Armslist now.  The trigger pack has had a Bill Springfield trigger job making a tremendous difference.  Also included for you aficionados are 1) German army cleaning kit with extra patches 2) manual of arms 3) six mags painted in multi-cam to match full of ammo  3) Nine mags in black full of ammo 4) Rear sight adjustment toll 5) HK sling 6) HK heavy buffer (doesn't fit wood stock - you'll have to drill the hole in the butt stock deeper to use this) and ammo can. Everything shown in the pictures.  All mags are disassembled so that you may repair your existing mags."
