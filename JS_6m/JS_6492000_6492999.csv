Has original wood colt hand grips. The revolver locks up with no movement! The trigger is extremely nice! I have not taken it apart, but if it has not had a trigger job then colt had a wonderful design. I don't know why they don't make them like this anymore. I have owned 4 revolvers. One older S&W and 2 newer S&W, and 1 Taurus. The wheel on the revolver is the only revolver I have had owned that does not move at all when you let the hammer down and hold the trigger, the wheel has zero movement! The trigger is by far the best feel and pull weight of the 4... there is of course some wear on the outside of the barrel. Mostly around the last two inches. No deep scratches or dings.... just 50-57 years of being held, moved,carried.... on the barrel it says police issue 38 special. The inside of the barrel and wheel look extremely nice. This gun is clean and a all American Colt is what you will get. Extremely reliable and accurate! Great for conceal or whatever..this is a Coltand will most likely out shoot most new 38 specials sitting on the shelf! In person only at a safe place for both parties.. thanks"

Mechanically the firearm is in excellent condition. I have several hundred rounds through this but internally it still looks like new. Was always cleaned after firing and well maintained. Cosmetically it has some minor carry wear, as this was one of my carry guns for a few years now. The most notable wear is some minor pin prick pitting on left side of slide under the M&P logo. The roll marks have been filled w/ gray enamel paint. Comes with 4 factory S&W mags. (1) 8rd and (3) 7rd mags. 2 of the 7rd mags have aftermarket aluminum base plates with pinky extensions. Factory plastic base plates included. This has the professionally installed Apex Tactical Action Enhancement Aluminum Trigger and Duty/Carry Kit. If you've never shot a shield with this kit, I can assure you that it's a night and day difference. Old factory parts included. Night sights are (I believe) Ameriglo ""Figure 8"" or ""i dot"" sights. 1 dot on front and rear, both tritium. Front dot has luminescent yellow outline. Sights are only a few years old and still very bright in the dark. Two holsters. A custom made leather/kydex IWB holster (well used, but well broken in), and a Desantis black leather Thumb Break Scabbard OWB holster with dual cant options and thumb break. This holster is like-new, as I didn't wear it often. Both right handed. I've got (give or take, and neglecting gunsmith labor) about $800 in this package. Factor in depreciation, mods people don't want, etc... I guess I'll ask:$450 OBOAnd see what people offer. Mainly interested in cash, as I'm trying to finance a new Sig. I suppose I wouldn't be opposed to trades if it catches my eye. Buyer must furnish ID and be willing to sign a bill of sale. CHL holders will be given preference. Many more photos upon request. Thanks for looking!"

This firearm has only been fired 500 times. This means that this weapon is in perfect operating condition and is just broken-in and will preform better than a new firearm right out of the box. This also means no wasted money for you breaking in this gun, so you can get right to using it to its full potential the day you take it home with you.The firearm comes with four high capacity 20-round mags, the original case, original user's manual, and a Blade-Tech USA adjustable holster. The current MSRP on this firearm listed on SIG's website starts at $1,304.00 USD making $1,000 a very reasonable price for a gun that has been broken-in, very well maintained, and has minimal use.Features Include:-- TRUGLO front Tritium Fiber Optic sights accented by the SIGLITE Tritium rear night sights.-- Beavertail frame unlike the standard SIG SAUER P226, allowing for more control over the firearm in any situation.-- Short-reset triger which has been shortened by 60% from the standard P226. This allows for faster and more accurate follow-up shots-- Trigger is SIG's upgraded trigger and features a smooth and crisp reset and break, making it a dream to shoot.-- The decocker allows the gun to be decocked without risk of firing the weapon accidentally.-- The slide is made of stainless steel coated with SIG's premium Nitron coating.Additional facts:I purchased this firearm from its first owner who only had the gun for a couple months before selling it out of necessity. He told me, ""I am selling it because I need more money to buy a plane ticket to go see my dying grandmother."" He also said there was nothing wrong with it and he hated parting with the gun. I later concluded that there was absolutely nothing wrong with it and fell in love with it but it is time for me to let someone else enjoy this beautiful gun. Please let send me a message if you are seriously interested in the gun and want to buy it, or if you have any questions about the gun."

I guess this gun is pretty rare, they only made it in 1983-1985. It's just like the 950b but a sa/da where the 950b is just sa. It's small that the tomcat and is .25acp and comes with a leather holster and 100 rounds. It shoots great and is surprisingly accurate. In photo it is next to my bodyguard just to show size comparison. Bodyguard is not forsale. This gun is hard to come by in ma"
