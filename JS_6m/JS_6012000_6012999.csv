It has a custom camo paint job applied by me (If you really want the scope in another color I may possibly be able to accommodate that for a slight up charge, message me and we can work something out) to match my current rifle and has been on the scope and rifle for about 6 months now so there are normal wear marks on the custom camo paint job however the factory finish is in mint condition. There are zero scratches on the eye piece lens and objective lens as well as zero damage to the scope, everything works perfectly. The pictures I have posted of it shows the condition it is in but if you have any questions or want more pics I'll be happy to send them. These model of scopes are some of the most durable I have seen and have some of the best turrets on the market in my honest opinion. In July this year I hit a target with this scope at 1,825 yards so it will serve anyone well to that distance or beyond depending on the rifle you have it mounted to. I will also be including a 2 inch sunshade as well as a 4 inch sunshade in with the listing, normally only 1 of the sizes come with the scopes from the factory (mine came with the 4 inch). I do still have the original box and will ship the scope to you in it, I can also send pics of the box if you wish. The Vortex anti can't device (level) can ship with the scope upon request but unless you ask for it, I will be keeping it. I also have some used Vortex Defender flip caps for each lens that I can include in the purchase if you request. Nothing else pictured comes with this listing, only the scope, 2 sunshades and possibly the Vortex A.C.D. and the flip caps. As you can see I took great care to mask off all of the important numbering on the scopes usable parts as well as have took the liberty of adding custom yardage markings on the parallax correction knob so that you know where each parallax setting is accurate at each range. The scope still has the Bushnell Elite Lifetime Warranty and they will repair or replace it no questions asked should you have any issues out of the scope for the life of the scope. If you have any questions at all or want to make an offer, let me know. If you are interested at all, send me a message and/or make me an offer, we will work something out.Specifications below:Finish:Matte Flat Dark EarthPower x Obj.
