This is the newest model of the P320 with the flat slide release lever and the newer slide lock lever. I put an Apex flat faced trigger in it, but also included in the sale is the stock trigger, stock white dot night sights, an outside the wasitband holster made by Sig Sauer, an inside the waistband holster made by Blue Alpha Gear, and six P320 magazines. If you didn't know, this is Sig Sauer's striker fired pistol which is comparable to the Glock 19. I enjoy the gun a lot, but just need the money back from what I put into it at the moment. I am the only owner of this pistol and I have only put less than 150 rounds through it. This gun is basically brand new. I purchased it in October last year. No scratches or dings on the gun. I am asking $1,350.00 or best offer. This is a Non-California Roster handgun, but can be sold to anyone via a private party transfer. And yes I legally own the gun and it is registered to me. I am not sure why it is saying unregistered at the bottom of this post, so no need to question that. I will only meet at an FFL dealer and must be a serious buyer. Please don't waste my time. If interested please email me and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank You."

The finish is pretty worn and has some pitting, but no rust. The gun functions and shoots as a Mauser should. The stock has been sporterized at some point, but it was nicely done and the barrel is free floated. It is chambered in the original 8mm Mauser (8 x 57 JS). Serial numbers on the barrel and action match, the bolt is the newer k98 style curved bolt and doesn't match. I have 1.5 boxes of ammo to go with it. This would make a good deer rifle if you enjoy hunting with iron sights. I can send more pictures upon request. Cash and local sale only. Price is firm. Text Roy at REDACTED."

I bought this short sword/dagger from a USMC vet in the early 1990's when he was moving into a retirement home. I bought it with a rifle a couple bayonets and some other trinkets. I have long since sold the rest but have held on to this for some reason. It's really interesting to me and it is well marked on not only the wood scabbard but also the tang of the blade. It appears to have been made from a longer sword at some point. The wire wrap is coming undone particularly on the grip side. The blade may have been cleaned at some point but well before I bought it. I am willing to answer any questions I can and can provide better pictures if needed. It is also available for in person inspection if you live in El Paso.

This Taurus model is on CA DOJ safe gun roster list. Extra Accessories Included Plano Case Inside the WaistBand Holster Features Taurus Security System (TSS): Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Transfer Bar: The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear. This Taurus 605 is brand new and has never been fired. Firearm was placed in a safe for storage.

The receiver has been trued and lugs lapped to 85-90% contact and bolt fitted to the race by gunsmiths at Scheels in Des Moines IA, I have receipts to verify this. The bolt is a one piece bolt from Pacific Tool & Gauge with M16 extractor. The barrel is a Black Hole Weaponry chambered in 300 Winchester Short Mag with 3 land polygonal rifling, 1:8.5 twist rate. Muzzle threaded 5/8x24 with a surefire warcomp suppressor adapter currently mounted (has been mounted since the rubber thread protector was removed to protect the crown). The barrel has an M24 ""heavy"" profile and is made of shot peened stainless steel. The current round count on this barrel is 92. The proper break in procedure found in the Barnes reloading manual 4th edition was followed to ensure longer barrel life, greater accuracy, and ease of cleaning. This barrel has only been touched with a one piece carbon fiber .30 cal rod. This is a ""rem/age"" type barrel so the headspace is easily adjusted with a savage barrel nut wrench. The rifle currently will NOT chamber most factory loaded ammunition, it is set for my hand loads. If desired I will readjust the headspace to accept standard SAAMI loads prior to completing the sale. The action is sitting in a Bell & Carlson A2 stock. The stock has been bedded to this action using devcon epoxy and the barrel channel has been inletted to allow for free floating of the heavier profile barrel. The optic is a Sig Optics Tango-4 6-24x50 first focal plane scope with illuminated reticle. It is a mil scale reticle with mil adjustments. I would consider selling the rifle without the optic at a reduced price. I also have 92 pieces of fireformed brass and ~130 pieces of un-fireformed brass (all federal headstamp) and redding competition 3 die set that I can sell with the rifle if desired. Contact me and I can send a picture of 5 shot group fired at 104 yards using 220 gr smk's and reloder 19 powder and full length sized brass. Thank you for taking the time to read this, Please dont hesitate to contact me with any questions. 816-three seven seven-9513.
