This model is no longer in production, and rarely seen any more. It is (IMO) one of the best rifles ever produced by Tikka. It is in perfect cosmetic and mechanical condition with a beautiful walnut stock, with stippling, vertical pistol grip, and adjustable cheek piece. It has a user adjustable trigger (currently set at about 20 ounces with no creep or backlash). I am the original owner. I bought it as a 308 in 2005 after returning from my first (and last) prairie dog shoot in Texas, and was determined to build a 1,000 yard dog killer. Life got in the way, and I didn't (and won't) get back there. I sent it off to Pac-Nor Barreling (Brookings, OR) and had them true the action and install the new barrel. It is their stainless, three groove, air gauged, super match barrel. Length is 26 1/4"", and measures 1"" dia. at the muzzle, and 1 1/8"" dia. at the action. It is full length free floated. The barrel has had exactly 100 rounds through it to fireform the brass, and was broken in by cleaning after every 5 shots. The rifle also comes with a Burris Elite 4200, 8-32X40 A.O. scope with a ballistic mil dot reticle and target knobs. It is mounted with Burris Pos- Align rings with 10 degree up inserts for long range zeroing. Rifle and scope weigh approximately 14 pounds. This package also comes with 100 pieces of W-W fire formed and prepped brass in MTM cartridge boxes, and a set of Hornady Custom Grade New Dimension dies with micrometer adjustable bullet seating stem. 75 grain Sierra H.P.'s @ 3,675 fps were shooting into .40""/100 yds, and Speer 87 grain TNT'S @ 3,545 fps went into .25""/100 yds. - with the fire forming loads ! This is a looong range killing machine ! I will ship it UPS Insured in a hard case, and the dies & brass in a separate package via USPS. Price is $2,600.00 which will include delivery to your FFL.

There will be a variety of educated opinions with vigorous defenders, but Holland & Holland will be included in the debate. Building fine sporting arms since 1856, there is little doubt that H & H will always land in the top 5 BEST GUN makers in the world. Mostly known for their side by side shotguns and fine rifles, the past decade or so has seen a strong demand for fine over/under shotguns and Holland & Holland was not going to fall behind the times by ignoring this market. H & H approached designing their new shotgun in 1995 with the idea that they wanted to maintain their “BEST GUN” status in the eyes of the shooting community, so they developed an over/under with a noticeably shallow frame, finely sculpted fences and frame, and a hand-detachable trigger plate lock mechanism a bit like the best Perazzi made guns. The design and manufacture has met critical acclaim from all corners of the world as a “home run” in creating a truly BEST GUN over/under. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THEY BUILD THE WHOLE GUN IN HOUSE IN THEIR LONDON FACILITY with a combination of high tech materials, CNC machinery, and Holland & Holland traditional hand fitting and finish that cannot be duplicated in mass production. Even Purdey of London contracts with an Italian firm for the building of their over/under. Holland would not settle for that. These little Sporting Models handle dynamically, weighing just 6 1/4lbs. and balanced perfectly between the hands. The gorgeous walnut stocks are expertly shaped and checkered. The hand engraved action is adorned with gorgeous case color. This gun has Holland screw-in chokes (from Briley Manufacturing) so you can have a very versatile, gorgeous BEST gun for sporting clays and shooting of all your upland game. To buy this gun new today from Holland & Holland would cost over $75,000. This gun shows no wear, has been shot very little, and can be bought for a fraction of that price. Cased in a fine leather case complete with maker’s label and accessories, it is a stunningly attractive gun that will continue to grow in value as you enjoy its use.For serious and direct communication only text 770-742-8614 BarrelsBarrel Length: 28""Chokes: screw ins; .000/.004 (A,B)Bores: perfect mirrorBore Diameter: .613 both% Blue: 100%Chambers: 3""Ribs: vent rib, tightSights: single ActionAction: Tight, way right of centerEjectors or Extractors: ejectors, strong, timedCase Color: 100%Screws: perfectEngraving: sharp clear scrollTrigger Type: single, crisp, inertiaTrigger Guard Color: 100% stocksType: pistol grip/field style forend/ Prince Of Wales styleLOP: 14 11/16"" rear triggerLOP To End Of Wood: 14 1/4""DAH: 2 1/8""DAC: 1 3/8""Cast: neutralCheckering Condition: perfect; mulleredButt Treatment: special plate/pad sporting asking price { negotiable } $30000 Shipping  Ground$500.00 Inspection/ Return Policy  Three Days from the date the item is received"

LOCAL Sale only, No shipping. Gun is located in Bartlett,IL Aggressively priced to sell for $300 (None Negotiable)Reason for sale: Building an AR15 All Illinois laws will apply at time of purchase. If interested call or text REDACTED About this gun:  The Bersa Thunder Pro is their main full-size handgun.  A solid pistol that draws equally from Walther and Beretta designs, the Thunder Pro is a comfortable shooter with good ergonomics reminiscent of modern Browning Hi-Powers.  It also offers good capacity at 17+1 rounds in 9mm Parabellum.  The Thunder Pro features a lightweight alloy frame that brings the unloaded weight down to just 30 ounces unloaded, even with its 4.25-inch barrel.  The Thunder Pro is 7.5 inches long by 5.5 inches tall and 1.45 inches wide.  The slightly above-average width is a result of a fully-ambidextrous safety and slide stop.  The magazine catch is also extended and reversible for southpaws.  And you can run them fast.  Bersa Thunders are known to those who have shot them to have good triggers, light and snappy in single-action and the double action is very smooth and doesn’t stage.  There is a slight amount of take up but less than you’d expect from most service pistols, let alone any handgun that costs this little. Bersas are used in shooting competitions internationally including IPSC and are the standard duty pistol with most of Argentina’s military and armed forces.  They’re tough guns.  We’re not saying they don’t fail, but if they can go 50,000 rounds before they break, well that’s a general plus in our book.  If that’s not enough for you, you can watch a video on youtube called ""Bersa with 1500 shot and no jams"" where 1,500 rounds is fired in a single session, without a single failure.  When the gun gets too hot they give it the bucket treatment."

Not interested in any extras. I have 500 dollars and don't care what you include (I want all stuff from factory of course). 500 is the max so if you have a bunch of stuff on it or done to it I don't care for it. I actually wouldn't mind a ghost connector or something like that and would pay for it but I have no interest in buying an 800 dollar Glock. I have my own sights I want to put on so I'm not paying for night sights. Dawson precision is probably all I'm interested in and would pay more for. Feel free to offer but I'm just giving you a heads up. Please respond with pictures. Try finding anyone else on here who will pay this much without wanting any extras...

This unit is the side imaging unit complete with GPS and 7"" color display. It has only been on the water twice on my kayak. I've decided I'd rather keep it simple and cut weight on my kayak, so here it is. It comes with the factory box and paperwork. None of the cables have been cut or altered so the unit has plenty of wire for kayak or bass boat use. I upgraded to the HD transducer for a better picture, this was a $100 upgrade. I'll also include a neoprene cover and a RAM mount that were purchased separately. I'll take $500 for it. This price is very fair and FIRM, the unit looks brand new and works great. I also have a Navionics map card for it that I can include for an extra $100. For you fellow kayak guys, I'll include a RAM Arm transducer mount for $25. I'm not going to sell any of the extras separately unless the Sonar unit sells first. The battery in the photo is not included, it only tested at 8.8v at full charge so it's not any good. Sorry. I'll consider working a trade for a Glock 19, Wiley Clapp 4"" Ruger SP-101, black Kahr PM9, Smith and Wesson M&P 340 J Frame, or a like valued M4 config AR-15. I have around $1,000 invested in this package."

The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."
