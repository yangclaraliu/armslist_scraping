About 500,000 units were produced, including the hand chiseled engraved ""Renaissance"" and the ""Lightweight"" version. The Lightweight utilized a 6061 T6 aluminum receiver and chrome-plated over electro-less nickel slide and external detailed parts. This particular version of the Baby Browning pistol was developed and marketed in the commemoration of the Concord Supersonic Jet which was introduced to the public circa 1965. With the exeption of ther special order Nickel Plated units and the above-mention custom built pistols, all of the Baby Browning pistols were finished in hot blue. The halt to exports to the USA in 1968 was dictated by the Gun Control Act of 1968. The bullet in the photo is a Hornady .25 acp 35 grain XTP. The fired round went through 230 pages of a book and expande quite nicely. You can see what price this model is going for on Guns International. There's a couple posted.Price: $750.00"

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. Upon firing, the patented, dual-extractor system pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also one of the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber.  It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included. Barrel on this model is 18"" long. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with a A2-style flash hider.  All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel assembly. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from optics and sight systems available on the market. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference."

I got this in a trade a couple years ago and never bothered with it as I can't use it due to an injury.  I haven't got the Boss manual but you can download it . It comes with a free floating barrel with a hand reamed chamber for tighter tolerance and more precise head space. The integrated trigger is a crisp 3.5 pound pull that breaks like glass. These things alone improve accuracy but to top it off it also has the Boss muzzle break which allows you to fine tune this into a Lazer accurate firearm. Also helping is Browning's high quality Inflexible recoil pad reducing recoil by 25 percent. I do not have the box or manual for this . Looking for cash.If you hurry you can get this set up for opening morning. Make offer.Let's meet."

How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel.  This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case. Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology  It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round. Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols. Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.  Size & Features With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. The CCP comes in stylish stainless or Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols.  It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation. This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface. Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide."

It has Trijicon HD night sights (about 2 years old) installed as well as a Powder River Precision Ultimate Match trigger kit (I do still have the stock trigger parts). The barrel has been polished to a mirror like surface which noticeably smoothed out the slide action and gives it a great look! (No, polishing the barrel does not cause it to be more prone to corrosion) The trigger kit reduces the pullweight of the trigger by about 1 lb and shortens the pull and reset compared to the stock trigger. These are top tier upgrades and the firearm is amazingly accurate! The ONLY reason I'm selling is I'm switching over to the XDm platform. The Trijicon HD sights and the PRP trigger kit are expensive upgrades, and you're getting the whole package for a great price! It comes with 2 extended 16 round mags with extension sleeves and 1 compact 13 round mag that has the pinky extension to it (another extra). This really is a fantastic carry firearm! The price is firm at $540 and a great deal. The Ultimate Match trigger kit is around $130 and the Trijicon HD sights are around $130. I have more pics I can email or text when we communicate. The ONLY trade I'm open to is an XDm 3.8"" in .45acp, preferably bitone. Must have MN i.d. and Permit to Purchase or Permit to Carry!"

Also the rotating locking lugs work like a bolt action to insure stability of the bolt at discharge.A VERY UNIQUE gun.The scope in the picture is not included but can be negotiated for.If the ad is up, it's still available for sale.
