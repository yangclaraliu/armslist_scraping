FEG copied of Walther PP, and in my opinion the FEG is a better gun and very accurate.  Hammer springs can be bought from Wolfe Springs with the 11 lb just right.  Also higher power recoil springs can reduce kick but with the 32 ACP not necessary.FEGs are very accurate shooters and even better once springs changed out.  I have not changed the springs on this gun.I will ship to another state or location FFL only.  Buyer pays approximately $35 plus insurance for shipping and must send or email copy of Drivers License & FFL.  USPS Money Orders only accpeted.Please email for more info include your name and number if you don't mind.  I will respond to all inquiries so feel free to ask questions.  However, I will be firm on price with this due to rarity ( few out there and most are Import Marked)."

I'm the original owner and the pistol has approximately 1300 rounds through it with ZERO malfunctions. The pistol comes with two factory H&K barrels, .40S&W and .357 Sig. The pistol, barrels, and magazines are all made in Germany and the German .357 Sig Barrel was very difficult for me to find, but the quality is second to none. In addition, I sent the pistol to renowned H&K gunsmith Bill Springfield to further smooth and refine the LEM trigger for accuracy and consistency. The target photo speaks for itself....that's 40rds total, 10rds per diamond, at 25ft with cheap practice ammo. Needless to say this is a VERY accurate compact carry pistol. With .357 Sig, I can easily tag steel targets at 50-75yrds which makes for an ideal woods or hiking gun. Here's what's included:- P2000SK V2 Pistol with custom Bill Springfield gun smithing- Two barrels: .40S&W and .357 Sig- 3 German made subcompact magazines and 2 German made extended magazines - Tritium night sights- H&K compact laser aiming device- Two IWB holsters, one from Theiss and the other from Peter's Custom Holsters- Carrying case with documentation and multi size backstrap.- I think I have a set of spare sights I'll toss in if I can confirmFull disclosure: the pistol has some holster wear marks near the muzzle (see pics).Price for the package is $575 or best offer. TRADES CONSIDERED: Classic WWII rifles (Garand/Mauser/Enfield), 10mm pistols, quality 1-6 or 1-4 variable power optics, Glock 19 package deal, HK or CZ pistols, CMMG Mutant rifle, nice AK rifles, or a CZ 527 rifle in 7.62x39. I shoot lots of different weapon platforms from combloc pistols and rifles like 5.45x39 AK74's to Noveske Recce rifles to lever actions, so make me an offer. Of course it goes without saying, but +\- cash is expected to offset a lopsided trade on either side. Please no offers for lawn mowers or non-working hot tubs, lol."

An improved E3 round-lug bolt design both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. The ambidextrous bolt release, selector lever, and magazine release offers left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. The 5.56 mm 3-Prong Flash Eliminator interferes with propellant gas combustion forward of the muzzle to significantly reduce flash signature, will not ring upon firing or when struck, and is compatible with the Knight’s line of 5.56 mm QDC Signature Reduction Devices."

This lower comes with the Franklin Armory BFS (Binary Fire System) installed. This system gives you (2) fire options. (1) Regular Semi-Auto & (2) Binary. Binary mode fires a shot on the pull & release of the trigger. This basically gives you a 2-round burst or controllable simulated fully automatic. This was a project of mine over the last couple of months. About 150 rounds down range. Selling to get started on my next project. PERFECT CONDITION / MATICULOUSLY MAINTAINED.
