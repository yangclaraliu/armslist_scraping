Again ammo is available. Very accurate.Note: Have had inquiries if gun safe for smokless? It is a Black Powder era (1884).It was cleaned and maintained a d stored in a flap holster that removed the nickel plating.The timing is perfect. I used black powder blanks and ammo ($40) .I have shot Bullseye 38 sw ammo which is a low velocity smokeless. You can tell its low pressure.Anyway the 5 & 6 inch barrels are scarce and you can tell the gun wasnt abused or unprofessionally dismantled."

A single stage adjustable trigger breaks crisp and clean, allowing hunters to make quick, accurate shots under field conditions. The coldhammer-forged stainless steel barrel, free floated to the synthetic stock, provides superb accuracy and maintains its point-of-aim in changing weather conditions. A single column polymer magazine feeds reliably, and facilitates in loading and unloading the rifle.

I am not the original owner, and the condition the gun is in now is the condition I bought it in. It shoots and funcions flawlessly, although after shooting it for 4 years I have found it likes bullets in the 170 gr weight area better than anything lighter. Being from 1953, it was built when Marlin was still in New Haven, Connecticut and it does have the JM stamp on the barrel. I am asking $400 cash only.

I'm not a laser guy but this is the only one I would own.  I'll be happy to pop the stock guide rod back in and sell that way or you can kick it up a notch and go all out with laser.  Your choice.  This has been my carry gun for a year or so.  It gets fired nearly never as I compete and this is not a competition gun.  It comes with factory night sights that glow bright.  I have installed the factory extended slide-stop in case you need to drop the slide from locked-back position with one hand. Makes it a LOT easier than the flat little unit they ship with.  I recently installed the Tango Down Vickers rear slide plate that simply extends about 1/8th of an inch on each side at the rear of the slide so that it can be racked with wet or otherwise slippery hands or even against a belt or boot heel.  I can easily remove that if your prefer.  Comes with factory box, 2 factory Gen 4 mags, backstraps, cleaning rod/brush, paperwork; everything that came with it.  I'd like $525 for it without the laser.  Add $225 if you want the laser.  Laser is very new and I have fired exactly one (1) round using it. That one round was only to see if POA is POI.  It is.  Dead center.  (I'm not a laser guy. Mainly just there in case the wife needs to use it.)

It has a Trijicon front night sight and Tru-Glo back sights. These are fresh night sights and very bright. The reason that i mixed them was that the front Trijicon is slightly smaller than the Tru-glo back sights and that makes it very easy to pick up the sight picture in low light situations. It also has an oversized slide stop on it. This G-19 is in great shape and has had less than 2 boxes of ammo through it. It is sighted in and really accurate at around 20 yards. The only reason that i'm selling it is that I have 2 of them in FDE and just can't justify keeping both. I have had gen 3 and gen 4 Glocks and actually really prefer the gen 3's.. they just seem to have a better trigger and feel to them (in my opinion). Anyhow, this one is a great shooter and has the somewhat rare flat dark earth frame. Thanks for looking and MERRY Christmas!"
