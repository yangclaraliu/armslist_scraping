The Volquartsen Fusion is the first semi-auto rimfire rifle with quick-change barrels in three different calibers. You can choose between the 17 HMR/22 WMR model or 22 LR model. When we say easy, we really mean it. It takes only seconds and requires no tools to switch the barrels and, just that quickly, change calibers. This ingenious design also allows the rifle to be broken down quickly and easily for compact storage. The Fusion’s interchangeability is not its only ahead-of-the-art feature. Each component on the Fusion rifle is either CNC-machined from billet material or wire EDM-cut. Just a first glance tells you this rifle is truly different and that it is specifically designed for function and practicality. It is, for all intents and purposes, a real working rifle, with features that include Picatinny scope mount machined integral to the receiver and Picatinny mount installed on the bottom of shroud."

Purchased and installed the PRI muzzle brake which really tamed the recoil , and helps get back on target. This rifle has only been properly broken in approx 40 rds. I have it dialed in with the 168gr BTHP federal gold medal match ammo.....5 shot .425"" group at 100 yds. ......also purchased 40rds of the 178gr BTHP Hornady Superformance Match.....which should add 200yds to the range of this rifle,  and 120 rds of the Superformance 168gr A-max  just for comparison, just haven't had the chance to try it yet.....I was hoping to sell this as a package deal with all ammo approx 240rds, the sniper Midway 2/Gun Sniper Drag Bag/Case, the harris bipod and the BCM adapter for rail mount of bipod. This was all purchased new by me a few months ago and only selling to fund a purchase of new les baer pistol for bullseye, which Is more of a neccessity at the moment, otherwise I would not consider selling.  Anyways, if you are looking for a 1st class long range rifle that looks as awesome as it shoots, and will never let you down, these savage rifles are a fine choice.......btw I also splurged and mounted the scope with leupold tactical steel rings...another $140......In all I have over $3100 and a lot of time invested in this project which makes it an awesome deal for the right person, who refuses to accept less than the best.....if interested please call.....will not respond to text.....nine 80 seven two 2 nine 0 27....jody......"
