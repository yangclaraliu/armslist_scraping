The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles really add to the looks as well. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius.
Another consideration is weight. The T3 actually weighs one ounce lighter than most officer size 1911s. This makes the T3 the first choice for an all-day carry pistol.
Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eights Night Sights are standard. The mainspring housing, as well as the rear of the slide, are horizontally serrated to match. This feature also helps prevent snags on silk lined jackets and coats that checkering often causes. The top of the slide is also serrated to reduce glare.

There was a time when just about every shotgun was a piece of artwork. Today, lots of shotguns and rifles are considered working guns. The A5 Ultimate is a working gun for sure, but it does it with a level of artistic panache that few others can match. I'll ship it"

It is a very easy project to finish, and would be quite fun to put back together. I just never ended up sitting down and ordering the parts, so my money started going into other projects. The barrel is fully intact, even the finish is near spotless on the barrel, the action has normal handling wear but still very nice. The bore is sharp and shiny, honestly it looks like it has hardly been shot. Somewhere along the line probably in the 50's after the war someone picked this thing up as surplus and took everything off that made it heavy and it didn't need to shoot, then they sawed the stock off right where the rear band sat, and sawed it a little crooked at that.Now as it sits the barrel free floats, and this old two groove is a tack driver. I had half a mind to just keep it and clean up where the stock was cut a little and call it good, but I know I'd hardly ever pick up enough ammo to shoot it as much as I'd want to, and I don't want to pick up all the stuff to start reloading for it.
It came to me without a magazine and that's another thing I never ended up getting for it.However it does come with the following: - No 4 Mk 2 Bayonet and scabbard- 20 Rounds Original .303 Brit GB49 7 headstamped Mk7 Cordite Ball ammo- 40 Rounds PPU .303 Brit 150 Grn SP BT ammo- 20 Rounds Federal .303 Brit Power-Shok 180 Grn Speer Hot-COR SP ammo- 4 Original blued steel British stripper clips- 17 Original parkerized steel British stripper clips (various markings)- 20 Once fired PPU brass- 5 Once fired original surplus GB49 Mk7 brass Message for questions or more pictures"

This one is a Remington 700 LTR in .308 with a 1:12"" twist rate. The bolt was fluted by Kampfeld Customs. The barrel was threaded and the bolt knob was installed by Nine Run Guns. The AAC 51T brake does need the shim set, which AAC will send to you, and it will need to be properly timed and installed. Included is an excellent condition Timney 510 that breaks at about 2.5lbs or so. The rifle is in an XLR Element chassis system with a Tactical Lite stock and the standard Ergo grip. The mag release shows some wear, but otherwise the chassis is in excellent condition. *No mags/bipod included, however!*Aside from installing the brake, you'll need a scope base of your choosing, plus a scope, rings, and a magazine.

The process starts with a lead billet that is extruded into wire. The lead wire is then swaged into a core. The cores are copper plated, then re-struck once more. Though not common in the industry, this restrike process produces a bullet that is more uniform, with a more precise diameter and a smoother finish for a better shooting and a better looking bullet.

I'm only selling to make room for another project, because simply it is my newest rifle & I believe that such a awesome firearm shouldn't just be sitting around. It has less than 100 rounds fired during one trip to the range so still very new. This rifle is truly awesome the quality can be seen and felt instantly. It has the FDE/milspec+ color ris ii rail which you can't buy on its own anymore. The Daniel Defense m4a1 goes for $1700-$1800 before tax. I'm pretty firm on the price of $1580 & not interested in trades especially not interested in trades consisting of non firearm items. I am in Santa Fe so you would need to meet me in Santa Fe. Best way to reach me is through text @ 5zero5-6six0-9519. Thank you for your interest.I might also be willing to separate the upper and lower if you are only looking to purchase the upper and not the entire rifle."
