You have to run about 100 rounds through a piston-gun and a gas-gun to really notice the difference. Piston-driven guns require less repairs and replacement of parts. This specific one has the most robust materials that can withstand the rifle to allow it to maintain performance at peak levels at all times. ***Transfer of firearms ownership between individuals must be managed by a third party who is a Federal Firearms License (FFL) holder. Buyers should either have an FFL or find an FFL in their local area to take delivery and manage the transfer of the item for them before they attempt to purchase an item. This typically means the buyer must contact a locall gun shop and make arrangements for the transfer."

The parts in this kit are all OEM Glock and not aftermarket and it also comes with a GLOCK OEM disassembly tool to assist in putting together. We have even upgraded some of the OEM parts with competition components, these are the ones most commonly replaced with aftermarket parts, but still Glock OEM.  With this kit, the frame accepts Glock17 (Gen 3) 9mm slides, as well as the Glock 40 caliber slide. The Smith and Wesson 40cal slide is also compatible with the Sig357 barrel configuration, which essentially gives you 3 different calibers to choose from.   Normally you will pay 150 for the frame and 125 for the kit along with shipping for each, but it is all here in one place and ready to go for $240"

The numbers are all matching. It is chambered in 7.62 Nagant, an unusual but readily available round. This revolver is in beautiful condition, nearly like-new. It was made in 1917, making it exactly 100 years old. Interestingly, 1917 was the last year of Czarist Russia before the communists took over. One of the really cool things about this revolver is it can shoot 32 ACP. All you do is swap the cylinder out. The cylinders are hard to find, but I've included one with the gun. The revolver also comes with a military surplus leather holster, complete with the cleaning rod and militiary-issue screwdriver.NOTE: I have a tin of 1,092 rounds of military surplus ammunition for this and will sell it for $275 to the buyer. That's less than any price you can find online."

Mil-Spec AR triggers breaking around 7lbs, it is also side charger which is cool.  Lots of good reviews on these and will eat any ammo, but just like any firearm, it groups better with certain ammo.  If you are looking for a lightweight reliable AR pistol for home defense, truck/car gun with lots of firepower or one you can fit in a small backpack, this one is for you.  I was going to add a folding adapter and brace to keep in the truck, but decided to use another AR I already had set-up.  Comes with one 30rd. Pmag.
$700 firm in cash or best trade offer will be considered.  After adding the tri-rail my price is a little more than what they sold for, but I cannot find this in stock anywhere, so if you can find it cheaper, great, buy it while you can.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment.  If wanting to trade, just let me know what you have and the overall deal and I will consider.
