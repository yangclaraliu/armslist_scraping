The gun has beautifully figured high-gloss walnut stock and forend. The reciever is inlaid gold with the Ducks Unlimited insignia and flushing duck. I would rate the gun at 95% with only a couple of very minor handling marks. The A-303 is considered by many to be one of the best semi-auto shotguns of all time. You can virtually go back in time and get this one, and put the first round down the pipe!$780 FTF. FFL Transfer required, buyer to pay fee."
