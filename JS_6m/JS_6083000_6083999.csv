Created to be worn behind the hip at 4:00 or 5:00, this holster offers the best in comfort and speed for concealed carry use.
The MTAC’s top grain cow hide leather backing is the most comfortable material to wear against your skin. It provides a soft flexible material that does not rub or pinch.
The Kydex body on the MTAC provides a rigid material that is custom fit to each firearm and maintains its shape even with the pistol un-holstered. The smooth, low friction surface allows for a fast draw and easy one-handed re-holstering of the firearm. The all-Kydex body will not bend or stretch over time and is impervious to sweat and solvents.
The MTAC’s Kydex body is also interchangeable, allowing you to have one holster for all of your firearms. You can purchase spare bodies on the Spare Body page.
The MTAC attaches to the belt by two clips mounted to the leather tabs on either side of the holster. These mounting clips distribute the weight of the loaded pistol while holding securely to the belt. A shirt may be tucked in over the gun and holster providing complete concealment. The clips will also allow for ride depth or cant adjustment by using the different mounting holes."

I am selling my .308 Mossberg Patriot Night Train. It has a 6-24x50 scope with mil dots, muzzle break, neoprene stock sleeve, and a Caldwell bipod. I have taken very good care of this rifle and it only has had about 40 rounds through it. I already have a deer rifle so I figured there is no use in having this one."

Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
Ribber Grip
Exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.
Taurus Security System (TSS)
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
7 Rd Cylinder Feature
Some Taurus models offer our 7-shot cylinder. A shot above the rest.
Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the

Has never been fired other than factory function test fire. I Had a Aimpint Comp M4 mounted on it and it sat in safe. Was sadly a safe queen due to having shoulder surgery shortly after buying her. It has a GG&G qick release push button mount and comes with 4 extra FN Scar 17 20rd Magazines for a total of 5 20rd FN Magazines. Also has all literature, lock etc that it came with from factory. There is a mark on the upper rail where i mounted the Aimpoint Red dot, nothing major just a little of the finish rubed off on the edge or the rail notch (shown in pics). Selling for 3300.00. Considering what these are selling for online and the prices i seen at a few local gun stores, i feel this is very fair. Meet in person at public area, cash only. If you would like I can transfer this into your name at H&H or similar FFL. Not really interested in trades. you can text me at 4O5 3I4 74O7 or message me from Armslist. NOTE: will only let me upload 4mb in pics so i can email or text extra pics if needed."

It shows zero signs of ever being fired (I have never fired it, nor has the previous 2 owners). It is in excellent condition inside and out.
It is preban, de-sporterized, 922r compliant and fully transferable in MA.
The stock set is USA made from Ironwood Designs and is made from Afromosia (African Teak). It was finished with pure tung oil and is pretty stunning to say the least.
Comes with 10 re-finished preban mags with USA made base plates and USA made Weapontech enhanced bolt hold open followers.
It also comes with the original Norinco “386” stock set, original Chinese 5 round magazine and original base plates and followers if you ever care to re-sporterize the gun.
Based on my limited research, this was one of the earlier Mak 90’s that were imported and has many crossovers with the Polytech Legend.
I never planned to part with this, but need the funds.
 
Price - $1800 transfer in Worcester area
