We need a new car so something has to give. The build contains only the finest, parts and some are not available for purchase any more. The build list is as follows.
The heart of the rifle is the AX556 ambi lower by AXTS. This is arguabley one of the finest lower receivers ever built. These are not for sale separately anymore and the company has since changed their name to Radian so even if they started to sell them as an individual item again, they wouldn’t have any of the old company markings. This lower is completely ambidextrous and features the A-DAC system which allows the shooter to lock the bolt to the rear by simply holding down the magazine release and pulling back the charging handle. This makes clearing malfunctions extremely easy while the shooting hand remains on fire control. When they sold them they were a $500 lower. Now they will go for up to $1000 for the stripped lower. If you can afford it, it is the best money can buy.
The trigger is the Geissele super 3 gun trigger. If you know, then you know. There is no take up and a super clean break. Super short reset. My favorite trigger hands down.
Safety is the ambi Battle Arms short throw which is completely bad ass.
The barrel is a 14.5 inch Rainier Arms Ultra Match with a pin and welded AAC brakeout. 5.56 mid-length gas.
Adjustible SLR gas block.
The rail was made by SLR specificly for the first generation Arsenal Democracy Reaper 33. It was only made for that rifle (which I own). I later replaced the rail on the R33 with the next gen, but used the first gen rail for this build. Rail has a Keymod rail in place with a FDE Magpul UBR. BCM FDE Keymod rail covers at 3 and 9 o’clock.
Stock is the Magpul UBR.
Upper is the Rainier Arms Billet Upper with a Rainier Arms Avalanche Ambi charging handle with FDE wings.
Buffer is a Spikes Tactical tungsten filled buffer.
Bolt Carrier Group is Rainier Arms.
Grip is Magupl MIAD.
The entire rifle was assembled by Rainier Arms. They also sent it out for Hydrodip in Kryptek Highlander. Everything has been dipped except the grip which was Cerekote hand painted and the barrel which was Cerekoted patriot brown. NOTE: The guys that did the hydro did it with the rail section in place. It is not removable, unless you take a razor blade to break the hydrodip.If you know hydrodip, it can be brittle. There are chips missing from the dip from being stored in the safe and from having some accessories mounted. These are specifically cosmetic. If I had to do it over again, I would have gone the Cerekote Route.
This rifle has 90 rounds down the pipe. 3 mags. That's it. This is evident from lack of wear on the brass deflector and brake out.
This rifle shoots incredibly flat, has a very soft recoil thanks to the mid length gas and SLR block. I have shot it suppressed once and it was amazing and can be tuned with the block. It cycles very smooth. This rifle was shot twice then put in the safe. Sad for me, good for you.
This rifle is like new if you can live with a few chips out of the hydrodip. This is a one of a kind rifle that will treat you right. Again it was built by Rainier Arms to my specifications.
Must transfer at FFL of your choosing. Buyer to pay any transfer fees. Prefer an in state (WA) sale.
If need be, I will ship to an out of state FFL (DL and FFL required), however payment must be received in full prior to shipping. No international sales! Buyer to pay all shipping and insurance charges. Rifle is as described to the best of my ability and will ship as is. It is. No returns. This rifle is top notch, in 100% working order at the time of sale and will serve you well. It is up to the buyer to have the rifle inspected by a qualified gunsmith prior to use. Seller assumes no responsibility for the rifle or what the buyer does with it after the sale is complete.

It is a single stack 9mm 8+1 capacity, 3 dot sights uses glock sight in rear and sig sight in front so could be changed if desired.  Dao trigger is crazy smooth and breaks around 4 lbs. This would make a great carry gun for anyone. Very compact, lightweight and recoil is mild. 3.3 inch barrel. Has no problems always fires. The gun will come with one magazine, a glock case and a cleaning brush. This pistol does have some minor pitting/rust on left side of slide but nothing too bad... I'm wanting a  quick sale so $180 obo (about 50% off) first come first served. REDACTED. Let me know if you'd like more pics or info thanks. Will just need to see a MO ID and can fill out a bill of sale If you prefer."

These were made in the DOU BRNO plant with German tooling and parts post war.  Would make a nice project gun to restore with the correct bands and stock.  Be a really good shooter and a budget minded way to get into a German K98.  The good: -Not a Russian Capture -Finish is great on the action, barrel, and bolt. -Bore is perfect  The not so good -Bolt does not match but is a correct late war style bolt -No markings on the receiver besides the BRNO plant name and the small lion stamps. -Stock and bands are not correct to the rifle. Stock is not all that great of condition. I did wipe down with Tung oil. No varnish. -Upper handguard wood is missing in front of the hand guard  At this point and time I am not interesting in selling. I would like to trade for other military weapons.  No Mosins.  Will consider repairable sportorized rifles.  I will throw in money for rifles worth more then this K98."

For those of you not familiar with this firearm, it is from the company that invented the pocket-sized 9mm pistol, and the original is still, in the opinion of many, the best. This MK9 was made in 2008 and is in mint condition, test fired only. It comes with the original box, manual and other papers (still unopened), factory trigger lock, one flush fit magazine which holds 6 rounds (plus one in the chamber) and the supplied extended magazine which holds 7 rounds. Please see the photo to see how small this pistol is compared to my medium-sized hand.
This pistol features all stainless steel construction for lower recoil, a match grade polygonal rifled barrel, and no MIM parts for enhanced durability. It also has steel dovetailed sights which are easier to replace with the available night sights should you choose to. This gun is incredibly accurate for its size. I tested it and shot two magazines worth of head shots at 15 yards without a single miss.
Do not confuse this pistol with the much cheaper and less refined Kahr CM9, which has a polymer frame, a standard grade barrel, some MIM parts, a non-dovetailed plastic front sight which costs more to replace, and which comes with no extra magazine and in a cardboard box. The CM9 is a good pistol, but the MK9 is a great pistol. MSRP on the MK9 is $880, but I'm selling for a lot less because I already have another Kahr almost exactly like this one.
I will consider best offers on this pistol. If you have reasonable offer, let me hear it, but I have absolutely no time for low-ballers. If you have a trade in mind for a top quality handgun, let me know and we'll talk.
Due to some mobility issues I have, transactions need to take place at my office in Homestead. I'll put on the coffee and you can handle this and maybe some other guns and if we can make a deal, we will. If not, you will have at least made a new friend. Isn't that better than meeting in some parking lot?To buy the gun, you will need a Florida Driver's License. You will also need cash. We'll do a Bill of Sale and trade copies of our ID's. All laws complied with. Thanks a lot for looking at my listing."
