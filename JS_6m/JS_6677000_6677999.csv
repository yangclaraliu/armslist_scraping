Absolutely love this gun but it has become more of a ""show piece"" for me because its just too damn pretty for me to take out and shoot all the time. I also have more guns than I care to mention and a newborn at home. Selling the gun makes more sense than just having it sit in my safe, especially when I could use the money on stuff for the baby. Full disclosure here... I had one FTF with this gun using ZQI ammo (had never heard of it before) but everything else was flawless. Still, I wasn't happy that I had the malfunction with the ZQI ammo so I sent it back to Springfield to have them polish the feed ramp. Since I got it back, it has performed flawlessly with absolutely zero malfunctions and that's the honest truth. I have babied this gun since the day I got it and I've probably only had it at the range 5-6 times with about 250 rounds through it. If you're like me, I never believe people when they try to tell me how many rounds they put through it, but take one look inside the barrel (after you triple check that it has been cleared, of course) and you'll be able to tell that it has been taken care of. I actually keep it in a padded, fire-proof lock box because its too good to be with the others. I always said I would never sell any of my guns, but priorities change when you have your first baby boy. I will post pictures on here when I get home from work but in the meantime, if you email me, I can send you as many as you want. If you are local and would like to see the gun in person, let me know and I'll see what I can arrange. I will not move on the price for the simple fact that even used, these are selling for $900+ online and in stores. Adding tax in store would also add another $70 or more. BUYER MUST HAVE AND SHOW CURRENT, VALID OHIO CCW OR BE WILLING TO TRANSFER OWNERSHIP AT A FFL DEALER AT HIS/HER OWN EXPENSE. PERSONAL CHECKS NOT ACCEPTED. CASH OR MONEY ORDER ONLY."

Using the HK- proprietary gas piston system found on the HK416 and G36, the MR556A1 does not introduce propellant gases and carbon fouling back into the rifle's interior, making it the most reliable of any AR-type firearm. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. This handguard system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR rifles. The HK rail system can be installed and removed without tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR566A1 is produced in the USA from both American and German-made components. Additionally, subassemblies like the MR556A1's upper receiver is fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. This mdoel uses a barrel produced by HK's famous cold hammer forging process using the highest quality steel to produce a long life barrel that provides superior performance with minimal degradation of accuracy and muzzle velocity after prolonged use.

I have a Lee Hand Press Kit, (300 BLK casings) Correction: 9mm, (Winchester 296 Powder) Correction: Alliant Unique and Hodgdon Tite Wad, (WSR primers) Correction: CCI Small Pistol Primers, and (168 grain HPBT projectiles) 90 Grain JHP, 115 Grain JHP and 115 Grain Ball. I have copious experience reloading 12 gauge for my two sons who shot trap until recently (one year, we reloaded 5000 rounds and STILL had to buy practice ammoI need someone who has done some reloading who can teach me the process so that I can transition to using the single stage press I have at home, then move up to the Hornady AP kit I have waiting, when my skill level allows me to crank out serious volume.  The end goal is to spend next Winter loading ammo, then not have to buy ANY ammo in 2018. I know. Everybody tries to do this, but they end up buying SOME ammo in the end.  If I have to buy SOME ammo, it's it's an improvement over buying all of it.//MAIN EDIT BEGINS:IMPORTANT:After several people told me that I should do this, I have changed my initial goal from 300 BLK to 9mm Para.  I have CCI 500 Small Pistol Primers1lb Unique1lb Tite Wad500 pieces of unpolished brass (un-decapped)Above are the items I have in my office and can lay eyes on.9mm Die (I think I know where it is.  If I can't find it, I will just buy another. It's not as if I can do without them.)EDIT ENDS//I can buy ammo for anywhere as $0.66 to $1.25Reloading costs would be approximately$0.28(avg projectile cost), a max of $0.50 in powder and, $0.04 for a primer.  The cases can be made from Lake City 5.56mm GI brass, which is almost free.  Ready Made 300 BLK, on the other hand, is $0.79. for a total of  $1.61 MAXIMUM.  More realistically, it will be made from reclaimed Lake City 5.56mm or 300 BLK cases that can be used several times for $0.82 for whichever bullet weight, shape, design and accuracy optimized for the rifles my son and I have in this caliber.  I am willing to pay you for your time in cash, powder, ready-to-load lead shot or you can keep a portion of the ammunition we load in the process of my learning to reload.  I am sure we can come to an agreement for your compensation.Eventually, I am going to have to learn to reload5.56mm257 Weatherby30/30308 Winchester300 WeatherbyIf I buy the case, it will make things less financially attractive, up front, but38 Special357 Magnum44 Remington Magnum (for pistol & carbine)9mm (for pistol & carbine)380acp45acp45/70 Government for Old Trapdoor actions and Modern Lever ActionsI think this is a complete list of calibers.  I do not expect you to tutor me on them.  I just think 300 BLK is a good place to start.  Even though the BLK is not the simplest of the rounds (I think the 9mm or the 380 would be) it is also not as difficult as some of the others, such as one of the Weatherby cartridges."

Here's everything that comes with the kit;    Remington 700 with factory stock, XLR Carbon Chassis installed, Vism dragbag (folds out into a shooting mat - very handy), Timney Trigger installed, Sightron Siii SS 6-24x50 FFP LR scope, 10 round magazine, Weaver Multi-slot base 20 MOA installed, Vortex Precision Matched Scope Rings installed, Bore Guide (from Mike Lucas), Dewey Bore Rod, Hope's no. 9 cleaning solutions and assorted brushes.  I can install the scope if you like to factory settings or if you prefer, I can leave the scope off if you have a preferred set of rings that you would rather use.  This Sightron scope has made for excellent glass and customer service.  I've also added a ""fast lever"" on the scope to be able to adjust the scope faster.  Any of these things are easily removable, even the factory stock.  Going back to a deer rifle platform is as easy as two or three screws. All together I paid over 3000 for everything that I'm selling for 2500 cash, buyer pays for background check.  Thank you for looking, please let me know if you have any questions! Mark* For some odd reason there was no selection for ""308 Winchester"", so I selected .308 Nato but this is indeed a 308 Winchester caliber rifle."

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
