I cast them by hand and inspect each one myself so you can be assured you're not getting something screwy from someone not paying attention. Just to emphasize, these are only the bullet TIPS (often called boolits). You can use these to load your own cartidges. I use these in my own bullets I load and have better results than off-the-shelf walmart ammo. Obviously it will also depend on what powder, etc. you use, but that's not hard to figure out if you don't already have a preferred formula.I do have written confirmation from the Program Manager (IOI) at the Firearms Industry Programs Branch here in MO that these are perfectly legal to make and sell without an FFL, so there are no laws being broken here (always a plus).The basic ""package"", per se, would be simply cast and sold. I can however size and lube if you'd like. I powder coat mine for my own personal use, so I don't keep a lot of lube on hand, but I can order it without an issue if you can't provide it. Sizing & Lubing adds a very minor amount extra. Pricing is as follows..356, 100ct. - $7.00(Round nose, 124gr. mold - weighs roughly 130gr. with my alloy).356, 1,000ct. - $60.00(Round nose, 124gr. mold - weighs roughly 130gr. with my alloy).356, 100ct. sized & lubed - $8.00(Round nose, 124gr. mold - weighs roughly 130gr. with my alloy).356, 1,000ct. sized & lubed - $70.00(Round nose, 124gr. mold - weighs roughly 130gr. with my alloy).401, 100ct. - $8.50(Truncated cone, 175gr. mold - weighs roughly 180gr. with my alloy).401, 1,000ct. - $75.00(Truncated cone, 175gr. mold - weighs roughly 180gr. with my alloy).401, 100ct. sized & lubed - $9.50(Truncated cone, 175gr. mold - weighs roughly 180gr. with my alloy).401 1,000ct. sized & lubed - $85.00(Truncated cone, 175gr. mold - weighs roughly 180gr. with my alloy).451, 100ct. sized & lubed - $10.50(Round nose, 230gr. mold - weighs roughly 235gr. with my alloy).451, 1,000ct. sized & lubed - $95.00(Round nose, 230gr. mold - weighs roughly 235gr. with my alloy).452, 100ct. - $9.50(Round nose, 230gr. mold - weighs roughly 235gr. with my alloy).452, 1,000ct. - $85.00(Round nose, 230gr. mold - weighs roughly 235gr. with my alloy).452, 100ct. sized & lubed - $10.50(Round nose, 230gr. mold - weighs roughly 235gr. with my alloy).452, 1,000ct. sized & lubed - $95.00(Round nose, 230gr. mold - weighs roughly 235gr. with my alloy)Please note: The more you buy the more you will save.If you are looking for other amounts, 500ct, 10,000ct. etc. let me know and I should be able to work with you and still keep your cost down.I am located in St. Robert, MO and can meet anyone for sales, etc. However, if you'd like me to ship, I can do that also (at cost). I have talked with just about every person in California (yes, the state) and as long as it's just the lead tips they don't mind the shipping across state lines. Other states may vary, but generally speaking CA is the hardest to work with.Shipping can be had for roughly $6-7. The amount that will fit in the box will vary depending on bullet size. .356 is roughly 900 per box, .452 is roughly 600 per box.Please note, if you are looking for a different bullet size, let me know. I may be able to work something out for you (I have for others).Please contact me at REDACTED. Text or call.lead-boolits.fwscart.comThank you!-Joseph"

I use these in my own bullets I load and have better results than off-the-shelf walmart ammo. Obviously it will also depend on what powder, etc. you use, but that's not hard to figure out if you don't already have a preferred formula.I do have written confirmation from the Program Manager (IOI) at the Firearms Industry Programs Branch here in MO that these are perfectly legal to make and sell without an FFL, so there are no laws being broken here (always a plus).The basic ""package"", per se, would be simply cast and sold.

I have talked with just about every person in California (yes, the state) and as long as it's just the lead tips they don't mind the shipping across state lines. Other states may vary, but generally speaking CA is the hardest to work with.Shipping can be had for roughly $6-7. The amount that will fit in the box will vary depending on bullet size. .356 is roughly 900 per box, .452 is roughly 600 per box.Please note, if you are looking for a different bullet size, let me know.

They don't seem to agree with Hornady dies as much, so I'm rotating some of my sets out.  I've loaded many thousands of copper jacketed and plated (Rainier, Xtreme, Berry's) through all of these without any trouble.  I think a combination of the slightly wider diameter of the bullets and the higher friction of the surface coatings are the source of the problems, but I digress.  I still use my Hornady die sets for jacketed rifle bullets.  The 9mm and .45 ACP sets each come with a Lee Factory Crimp Die.  Note that the .40 S&W dies do not specify a taper crimp like the newer sets do.  Whatever type of crimp (roll, maybe?) they perform has been perfectly adequate in every handgun I've run, from Sigs to CZ's to FN's to Glocks.  The dies have some tool marks on them, and despite my best efforts to keep them dry, they are starting to show some discolored area that are probably going to become rust spots someday.  All have the Titanium Nitride sizing rings, so you don't have to lubricate your cases when sizing.  The Sure-Loc die locking rings are all included.  Prices are as follows:
9mm Luger w/LEE FCD - $30.45 ACP w/LEE FCD - $30.40 S&W, no FCD - $20Take all three sets for $70!
They ain't pretty anymore, and I've certainly gotten my use out of them.  If you're new to reloading and don't want to spend a lot of your startup costs, the break-even on these dies is going to be a lot lower for you.  I'd also be happy to give a new reloader a hand setting up."

The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break."

Rifle is glass bedded into heavy beautifully grained walnut stock. National match barrel, front and rear hooded sights and operating rod and bolt. Has bayonet lug and USGI bayonet included along with 2 25 round magazines and 3 20 round magazines. This rifle is in immaculate condition and aside from a couple of safe ding scuffs looks as though it has been in a time capsule.  Hard to find a cleaner example of a national match M1-A from the era when Springfield essentially built them by hand. Not in a hurry to get rid of but I've had her a long time and seldom shoot her so it's time to let her go to someone who would let her run.Also has Springfield 2nd generation scope mount and 3-12x56 illuminated reticle Accushot scope on it presently."

I was fascinated by the design but it was a safe queen until my dad thought it would be a good carry piece due to his weak hands (he had to have a 45). It does have less felt recoil than any sub compact poly 45 pistol I have shot. However, the double action trigger pull is too much for him beyond a few rounds. So, on the block this goes. Price reflects scratches from my dad having carried it. Only trade I will consider is partial. I will trade for an M&P9c +cash. Cash will depend on features (Apex trigger, night sights, etc).
