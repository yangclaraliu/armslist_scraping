Please do not be afraid to tell me about your trade and all you have with it, remember I only know what you tell me. Include a price and photos if possible.

I have a dozen or so 22lrs and this thing is seriously unbelievable. The quality is on par with some of my $3k+ rifles. It was a hard pill to swallow spending so much on a plinker but I honestly can't say enough great things about. I'd like to see someone buy it for their kids because It'd be the greatest gift ever. My kids are assholes and dont deserve it, lol. Make an offer Im a cool gun guy. Not trying to make money and the worst I can say is no. I just ask that you please don't waste my time.Bumping and edited because the op was butchered and I've had some solid offers but there's been a lot of flakes.

713,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6970713,For Sale:  Con Pair COP SS-1 4 Barrel Derringer .357 Mag 357,"houston, Houston, Texas","$ 4,320","Listed On: Monday, June 19, 2017",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This auction is for a Low Number Consecutive Pair of COP Concealed Off-Duty Police Model SS-1 4 Barrel Derringer Pistols in .357 Magnum / .38 SpecialThe COP .357 is a 4-shot Derringer-type pistol chambered for .357 Magnum. The double-action weapon is about twice as wide, and substantially heavier than the typical .25 automatic pistol, though its relatively compact size and powerful cartridge made it an option for a defensive weapon or a police backup gun. The COP .357 is quite robust in design and construction. It is made of solid stainless steel components. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by sliding a latch that ""pops-up"" the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time. Older ""pepperboxes"" also used multiple barrels, but the barrels were the part that rotated. The COP .357 operates similarly to the Sharps rimfire pepperbox of the 1850s, in that it uses the ratcheting/rotating striker, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence. Two complaints about the COP .357 are that it is too heavy to be used as a backup gun, and that the trigger pull is too heavy for rapid fire—even heavier than most modern revolvers. A smaller version was manufactured in .22 Magnum"
