It comes in factory box with all of the origianal paperwork. Also included is a Wilson Combat Stainless steel guiderod and plug mostly because I hated the two piece guide rod that came with it... it's not practical as you need an allen key to take it off. There is no idiot scratch on the gun and I haven't submitted the paperwork so it still has the lifetime waranty if you want to take the time to register it. The case is the new gray one not the old blue styled one. It has the two factory mags that are just plain GI mags that hold only seven rounds. I carried it a bit but it was way to heavy and because I already have three other 1911s I don't really need this one. The price you see is the price you pay so please don't lowball me. A NH drivers license and CCP are a must or buyer pays the $20 FFL fee.

Product Description  There has never been a higher demand for self defense handguns than there is today. The greatest demand is for the smallest, lightest gun available, but this has drawbacks. Generally these guns are difficult to shoot well, lack stopping power and recoil can be a problem. If you can?t hit or stop what you are shooting at, what good is the handgun? We can understand all of these concerns as we face them every day as well. We wanted to give our customers the smallest, lightest gun that we could without sacrificing accuracy, dependability and stopping power.  Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can?t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.  The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5? slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.  Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you?ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern. SPECIFICATIONS  ECO ECO .45 ACP  Model ECO Caliber 9mm Magazine Capacity 8 Frame Material Forged Aluminum Slide Finish Duty Finish Grips G10 Overall Length 7.25 in Barrel Length 3.5 Height 5 in Width 1.45 in Weight 27.1 oz Trigger Mech Single Action Front Sight Fixed Night Sight Rear Sight Night Sight Safety Manual thumb safety, grip safety MSRP $1,623 Product Name ECO"

Magazines hold 13 rounds, so with 3 mags and one in the chamber that's 40 rounds of 45 ACP. The trigger has a nice pull and crisp break, most Springfield XD's Ive tried have a very gritty feel but this one may have had work done before I bought it. Its actually nice to dry fire and easy to field strip and clean. I'm selling only because I need the money. I think $400 is a very fair price for everything you are getting, the XD pistol is practically new despite its age. I'm sure whoever gets this pistol will be very happy with it.

The Holster works great but I've since purchased a slimmer gun that is more convenient to pack. I bought the holster from an independent gun shop for $150, later noticed safariland sells it for around $100. That said I'd be happy to sell it to you for $65 in person or $70 with shipping within this great nation. I live in North Portland near the PCC college campus, I'd be happy to meet up with you for the sale. Thanks!Dave PS. I used loc-tite on the down straps that connect to your belt because I had one of the scews pop open the first time I wore it.  If you are of average height you won't want to adjust them but if you are not they will need a little solvent to get open."
