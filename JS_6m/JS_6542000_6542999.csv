There are a few light scrapes, and nicks/cuts on the synthetic stock and action, which have been painted with a Woodland Camouflage pattern. The receiver on this shotgun is in great shape, with only a small handful of light, shallow nicks and cuts. It does not show any rusting, staining, discoloration, or pitting, and the chamber opens with ease. This shotgun also boasts a 28"" Barrel with a ventilated rib, that's ported near the end. The barrel is also topped with a level sight, and is capped on the end with an Accu-Mag Choke. This is a nice unique gun that would be a great addition to any collection."

Both the upper and lower are factory RRA national match. The upper has had the barrel bead blasted to give it a matte appearance (was done as a factory upgrade by RRA) and has the NM 1/4x1/4 .040 hooded aperture. The lower has RRA's fantastic NM trigger and also a Brownell's lead stock weight installed in the stock (also very easy to take out). The weight is completely unaltered so it can still be adjusted to your preferred balance. I also have a brand new Turner Saddlery 54"" NM service rifle sling installed.  I have fired approximately 60 rounds through this rifle, so it is about as close to new as you can get. With Black Hills 77gr .223 I was getting about 0.85"" groups at 100 yards, and given my exceptional mediocrity with shooting I have no doubt that this rifle is capable of meeting or exceeding the 0.75MOA rating that its given.  I'm asking $900. All of this would cost ~$1300 to put together new. Not currently looking for trades."

I bought it new and only took it out shooting twice and it just sits in a case. It looks and functions pretty well brand new. The painters tape in the photo is just there to cover up the serial number. Im not a dealer so just cash and a handshake will do. Here is the listing from the store if you want some more info on it. This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

The rifle is full custom and a great shooter...shoots consistant sub MOA groups at 100 yards with plain white box Winchester ammo.This was built off of a Tula Hex receiver mosin that shot great but had a cracked stock, I had the barrel threaded to accept a custom Barret style blow back muzzle break that works fantastic in reducing recoil and muzzle rise...this is not a cheap crap slip on or pin on break.I installed a Rock Solid Industries optics rail system modeled after the US army's M24E1 sniper rifle picatinny rail system. It is mounted perfectly straight both elevation and windage using a combination of a chambered laser bore sighter and a picatinny mounted laser on the rail its self and measured 4 inches in fron of the barrel and at 100 yards matched evenly.The bolt has been polished to work VERY smooth, sent Rock Solid Industries the bolt and had them tig weld the bent bolt and re-polish it to be used with a scope system. The stock is an ArchAngel Gen 2 stock with detachable magazines, comes with (1) 5 round mag and (1) 10 round mag. The Stock is capable of adjusting barrel tension for accuracy but shoots best free float as i have it now. It is fitted with a Timney Trigger system set between 2.5 and 3 lbs and is adjustable from 1.5 to 4 lbs and has a thumb safety system and Timney Triggers are lifetime warranty triggers. This trigger aids in making this rifle very accurate to say the least. The barrel and receiver is coated with OD Green ceramic CeraKote used for full auto guns that has a 700 degree heat resistance and is extremly durable.The rifle has a Pentax Gameseeker III 8.5X-32X-50mm Plex Reticle Variable Power Scope mounted on a Rock River Arms solid high rise scope mount...this mount does not budge! The rifle has nice sharp rifling and shoots great, very accurate for a WWII rifle and gets a lot of attention where ever you go to shoot it. The bolt is very smooth, stock is adjustable for length and also has adjustable cheek riser. Very fun rifle to shoot with a lot of knock down power for use as a hunting rifle. I do not really want to part with the rifle but i want the Ruger Precision Rifles in .308 and have to sell toys to buy new toys lolThe rifle comes as you see it with everything I listed and I do still have the box and paperwork for the scope. It will also come with (1) 440 round unopened spam can of good quality Russian Surplus steel core ammo that you can no longer buy due to import restrictions but perfectly legal to own and shoot. I have well over $1,000 invested in the rifle but also understand you dont always get all of your money back out of toys when you build them and have it priced accordingly for a great deal but non negotiable.  750.00 FIRM and no trades.  The ammo alone before the import ban was going for 100.00 plus per 440 round can so your actually getting around 1200.00 worth of rifle and ammo for 750.00 I can email more pictures upon request."

You love their rifles, come and give their pistols a try.The DB380 is a micro-compact .380 acp polymer frame pistol made in the U.S.A. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""Zero-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine, and real windage-adjustable sights. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features an FEA (Finite Element Analysis)-designed slide and barrel that are stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil. The absence of removable pens and tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are all hard-coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment. This EXO model is self-lubricating with an exclusive EXO (nickel/boron) coating to protect the slide from wear, pitting, and rust.Background check for transfer is free***No trades at this time***"

The magazines are in excellent condition, there is nothing wrong with them at all.

It is mounted perfectly straight both elevation and windage using a combination of a chambered laser bore sighter and a picatinny mounted laser on the rail its self and measured 4 inches in fron of the barrel and at 100 yards matched evenly.The bolt has been polished to work VERY smooth, sent Rock Solid Industries the bolt and had them tig weld the bent bolt and re-polish it to be used with a scope system. The stock is an ArchAngel Gen 2 stock with detachable magazines, comes with (1) 5 round mag and (1) 10 round mag. The Stock is capable of adjusting barrel tension for accuracy but shoots best free float as i have it now. It is fitted with a Timney Trigger system set between 2.5 and 3 lbs and is adjustable from 1.5 to 4 lbs and has a thumb safety system and Timney Triggers are lifetime warranty triggers. This trigger aids in making this rifle very accurate to say the least. The barrel and receiver is coated with OD Green ceramic CeraKote used for full auto guns that has a 700 degree heat resistance and is extremly durable.The rifle has a Pentax Gameseeker III 8.5X-32X-50mm Plex Reticle Variable Power Scope mounted on a Rock River Arms solid high rise scope mount...this mount does not budge! The rifle has nice sharp rifling and shoots great, very accurate for a WWII rifle and gets a lot of attention where ever you go to shoot it. The bolt is very smooth, stock is adjustable for length and also has adjustable cheek riser. Very fun rifle to shoot with a lot of knock down power for use as a hunting rifle. I do not really want to part with the rifle but i want the Ruger Precision Rifles in .308 and have to sell toys to buy new toys lolThe rifle comes as you see it with everything I listed and I do still have the box and paperwork for the scope. It will also come with (1) 440 round unopened spam can of good quality Russian Surplus steel core ammo that you can no longer buy due to import restrictions but perfectly legal to own and shoot. I have well over $1,000 invested in the rifle but also understand you dont always get all of your money back out of toys when you build them and have it priced accordingly for a great deal but non negotiable.  750.00 FIRM and no trades.  The ammo alone before the import ban was going for 100.00 plus per 440 round can so your actually getting around 1200.00 worth of rifle and ammo for 750.00 I can email more pictures upon request."

The receivers are both made from forged 7075-T6 aluminum with an anodized finish and a MIL-STD 1913. Bolt assist and integral carry handle. Micrometer rear sight for fine adjustment to the rifle caliber effective range. The durable synthetic stock has cushion furnishing and is very comfortable for the comfortable shooting experience. Birdcage-style flash suppressor by Fabian Bros. Fabian Bros Muzzle Stabilizer was created to overcome the failings of most muzzle brakes and flash hiders.  First and foremost the two features are generally mutually exclusive: good muzzle brakes are bad flash hiders and good flash hiders are seldom good muzzle brakes.  The Fabian Bros Muzzle Brake has an additional feature in that it not only significantly reduces recoil and minimizes flash it also improves accuracy while keeping the muzzle on target for the oft needed second shot.

This one has a very good trigger.  I have taken about a dozen Whitetails with it, mostly head & neck shots.  Probably shot less than 200 times total.  Original box included.     The deal includes the pistol with the original box, mounts, rings, 2X Burris scope with Target Knobs, RCBS specialty dies,  100+ rounds of brass, and a box of 100 Hornady .358 180 grain SSP projectiles.     Get it all for $750 (includes bases too)(breakdown: $475 pistol, $225 bases +rings +scope, $100 dies +brass +bullets).Accurate, and easy to carry - I carry it on my left forearm and tuck it inside my jacket if it is snowing.It's a peach!  I bought it new about 30 years ago.  It is in pretty nice shape, with the exception of a scratch on the barrel between the front sight screw holes.     Making brass is simple.  Run .30-30 or .32 special brass into the die, remove, then trim it by about 1/4"" with a tube cutter.  Do the final trim to length on a regular brass trimmer, then you are ready to load.  .30-30's are probably easier to turn up than even .35 Remingtons these days, and probably cheaper!     Come see it in Janesville.  A Face to Face transaction is preferred.  If I need to ship, the pistol  needs to be paid for in advance via a postal money order - No Exceptions.  You pick up shipping.  Sorry, it is a pain in the A--, but scammers abound on this site.     Thanks for looking!"

This advanced operating system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched. A standard 5.56mm NATO chrome-lined chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment.
Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded ½x28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts. All upper assemblies are shipped with a recoil buffer and action spring. These components must be installed to ensure proper function of the SIG516 upper assembly on your AR-type lower receiver."
