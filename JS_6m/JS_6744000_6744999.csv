If you look around you will find no one has the All Weather .45-70 in stock & if you try & order one through a gun dealer they can't get it. What I did to get this unicorn is I contacted Henry directly & it took 3 months backorder to get it. I have been reluctant to sell it because it is such a nice rifle; the chrome & black is really sharp & the fit & finish is excellent. I have a credit card bill I must pay off. Prefer local cash pick-up in the Terre Haute area; but will ship to your FFL for $35 double boxed insured. Will accept check, check must clear before shipping. Will accept PayPal, buyer must pay the 3% fee.Also have Hornady LEVERevolution .45-70 Government 325 Grain Flex Tip Ammunition I will sell at a discount with the rifle.If interested call REDACTED."

That's why Clint Smith approached Les Baer about developing a dependable, combat-proven 1911 with which he and his students could feel completely confident.   So, Clint Smith specified the features he wanted and Les Baer built it.

This light Kicking caliber should be the perfect deer/antelope gun. It is very trim and easy to carry. There are no marks on the metal and just a couple of light marks on the wood. I recently purchased this one but decided I need to be selling my rifles instead of accumulating them. I don't think you will be disappointed with this one.

The aspheric lens creates a wide field-of-view, with sharp image quality, allowing user to keep both eyes open and focused on the target. Slotted windage and elevation dials allow positive 1 MOA adjustments without the need of lock screws. The Leupold DeltaPoint Pro Reflex Sight is constructed with a lightweight aluminum housing, shrouded in spring steel for maximum durability, and has been waterproof tested to 66 feet.
