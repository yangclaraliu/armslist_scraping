Developed at the request of those in the SOCOM community, the PWS MK112 Upper has quickly become a favorite for law enforcement agencies. The MK112 retains lethal capability out to 400 meters with varying types of ammunition.  Nickel-Teflon® coated enhanced piston bolt and bolt carrier are precision machined for perfect fit and functionality making the PWS MK1 rifle operating system efficient and effective.
 
Model Number: MK112
Action Type: Semi-automatic
Caliber: NATO 5.56
Length: 21.5“ Weight: 4 lbs, 3 oz
Barrel Length: 12.75” Isonite QPQ Treated
Muzzle Velocity: 2833 ft/sec
Muzzle Energy: 1105 ft-lbs
Muzzle Device: Triad 556
 
Features:
-PWS Forged Mil-Spec Upper
-PWS Isonite Treated Barrel
-PWS Nickel Teflon Enhanced Bolt Carrier Group
-PWS KeyMod Rail System
-BCMGUNFIGHTER Charging Handle
 
PUSH VS PUNCH
By utilizing a one piece design, the PWS piston system creates a purely gas to metal operation, rather than metal on metal contact that you may see in other designs. That, in addition to the longer dwell time from the increased mass in the Enhanced Bolt Carrier, creates a pushing action rather than a punch. This results in dramatically reduced felt recoil.
 
ADJUSTABLE GAS BLOCK
The four position adjustable gas block restricts gasses, rather than venting them from the side. This allows the unused gas to exit from the front of the gun, rather than the sides of the gas block, resulting in a more quiet operation.
 
QPQ ISONITED® BARRELS
Utilizing only the highest quality chromoly barrel blanks, PWS .223 and 300BLK MK1 barrels are turned in house then Isonite QPQ® treated for increased surface hardness and corrosion resistance.
 
PROFILE
Our barrels are designed with a heavier profile that increases longevity and accuracy, creating a balance between weight savings and sustained durability.
 
BOLT CARRIER GROUP
PWS bolt carrier groups are machined from tool steel at strict tolerances, then Nickel Teflon coated for durability and to reduce friction.
 
MASS
Features an increased carrier mass to extend dwell time and delay unlock. As a result the PWS bolt carrier group allows chamber pressure to be greatly reduced for easier extraction.
 
CONTACT POINTS
Gaps and channels between skid pads allow for fewer points of contact. This results in less friction and keeps debris from interfering with function.
 
BOLT
The PWS bolt system is Nickel Teflon coated and optimized for the .223 wylde chamber. It features a small assist spring for system assembly."

It was first used in later stages of the Philippine–American War, and was widely used in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The pistol's formal designation as of 1940 was Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911 for the original model of 1911 or Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1 for the M1911A1, adopted in 1924. The designation changed to Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, M1911A1 in the Vietnam War era.[1]The U.S. procured around 2.7 million M1911 and M1911A1 pistols in military contracts during its service life. The M1911 was replaced by the 9mm Beretta M9 pistol as the standard U.S. sidearm in October 1986, but due to its popularity among users, it has not been completely phased out. Modernized derivative variants of the M1911 are still in use by some units of the U.S. Army Special Forces, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.[4 Designed by John Browning, the M1911 is the best-known of his designs to use the short recoil principle in its basic design. The pistol was widely copied, and this operating system rose to become the preeminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols. It is popular with civilian shooters in competitive events such as USPSA, IDPA, International Practical Shooting Confederation, and Bullseye shooting. Compact variants are popular civilian concealed carry weapons, because of the design's relatively slim width and the stopping power[5] of the .45 ACP cartridge."

It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder, case-hardened trigger, and case-hardened exposed hammer with single or double action. This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a bright shiny nickel finish and has Smith & Wesson wood grips.This thirty-two year old classic revolver is in beautiful condition.

I took it to the range after I bought it and fired thirty-five factory-manufactured rounds through it, keeping the total of the rounds fired through this gun at fifty.As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is an accurate and fun gun.

The location of the spots are mainly at the bottom of the revolver by the serial number.

It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.Features:Caliber: 22MAG/22WMRCapacity: 30/ magMagazines: 2 + 1=3Finish: Desert TanSlide and barrel are 4140 steelFrame is 7075 aluminumGrip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel)Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count portsDual opposing extractors for reliabilityHeel magazine release to aid in magazine retentionDovetailed aluminum front sightPicatinny accessory rail under the barrelUrethane recoil bufferCaptive coaxial recoil springsPMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin"

I removed the original bird cage flash hider and put on a OSS Bannar Alpha 1 Muzzle Break, as well as Troy Industries HK style front and rear back up battle sights. Both can be seen on the newer MR556A1 Competition Model. I also added a ""HK"" stamped vertical foregrip and factory HK Sling Ribbon. In addition to these accessories are an HK Factory 30 Round Magazine, Manual, Sight Tool, Troy Sight Tool, HK Multi Tool and HK Gunbag. This is really hard for me, but I want to get my lady a ring.

These KS-47s are basically an AR platform that is chambered in 7.62x39, and accepts any AK magazine. Way cheaper to shoot than firing 5.56 or 223, plus much more punch! If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, check out the video on youtube (PSA KS47 -vs- CMMG Mutant).The Palmetto State Armory KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK. While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines, that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 lets the AK shooter capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR-style platform. Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver, the KS47 features an AR-style modular configuration which consists of a barreled upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. The modular configuration allows customers to have several different barrel configurations with one lower receiver, just by releasing two pins. Lower: The 7075-T6 billet lower receiver is hardcoat anodized, and accepts standard AR15 fire control groups. The extended magazine release is outside of the trigger guard for safety, which allows for an AK-style release movement, but also features oversize side paddles for fingertip release by the trigger finger. Fitted with a Ergo grip and M4-style stock, the receiver also features a standard, mil-spec diameter, 6 position, 7075 carbine buffer tube. The KS47 lower has steel reinforcements to accept AK style surplus magazines including drum-style.Upper: The KS47 hybrid upper receiver is precision machined out of billet 7075 T6 aluminum, and then hardcoat anodized for durability. While retaining the look of a standard M4 upper, the KS47 hybrid upper is designed to work with either the KS47 lower, or the standard AR47 lower. The chrome moly vanadium barrel is chambered in 7.62x39 with a 1 in 10 twist, has M4-style feed ramps, is nitride treated for accuracy and durability, and is finished off with a 5/8-24 thread A2-style compensator. The forward, assist, dust cover, charging handle, and safety are all standard AR15, as is the PSA Slim free-float rail and barrel nut.BCG: The hybrid KS47 Bolt carrier group works with either AK47 magazines or AR47 magazines, and features an extended firing pin. The carrier is made of 8620 steel, chrome lined and phosphate coated, and the chrome lined gas key is attached with grade 8 bolts and properly staked. The Bolt is made of phosphate coated 9310 steel. The KS47 Upper and Hybrid BCG are compatible with standard AR15 lowers for use with AR47-style magazines.I'm asking $900 for the rifle with one steel or PMAG 30 round magazine (buyers choice).   Would trade for a Sig Sauer P226 MK25.Can add additional items for the right trade.*** Drum magazine in pics is not include with this sell, at this price."

The slide, barrel and internal parts are all stainless, while the alloy frame is anodized to match the color and finish of the other components. It also features stippled-textured soft rubber grips that further absorb recoil while affording a firm and positive grip. Besides being one of the most photogenic handguns ever made (it appeared in countless movies and TV shows), it is perfect for home or personal defense, as well as concealed carry and recreational shooting. Superior Reliability The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period.     Match-Grade Accuracy out of the Box Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of  match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only make the 92FS super-accurate, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple to this the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class. Packed with Useful Tactical Features This pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster or at the range. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its satin stainless finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning. A pistol that is designed to work hard, be easy to maintain and perform flawlessly, the 92FS Inox is a premium-quality handgun that will be the jewel in any shooter’s collection."

After the recent tensions with Russia, however, the Obama administration banned the import of any more of these Russian rifles. This rifle is no longer importable and as such has become very rare and highly sought after by both collectors and those who want a top-quality AK74.Shoots 5.45x39mm, a very effective Russian round with almost no recoil.Rifle comes with Arsenal's own AK-74 muzzle brake that is extremely effective in reducing recoil and muzzle rise. The black polymer upper and lower handguards have stainless steel heat shields that do a great job keeping the handguards cool under fast firing. The SGL31 features a hammer forged chrome lined barrel that is built to stand not only the test of time but against any environment or situation encountered. And, with Arsenal's exclusive two stage trigger design, the SGL31 provides a clean and crisp pull when shooting.I have about 500 rounds through the rifle, with little wear to show for it. I always meticulously cleaned and maintained it after every shooting session with it and it is clean and in excellent condition. Comes with 30rd Bulgarian surplus magazine.Price is firm.

The magazine, floorplate, and even the mag release lever are steel on this model.In my 35 years of hunting whitetail deer, I carried the 308 when I didn't mind a bit of tracking. I carried a 30-06 when I only wanted to track the deer 1.5 feet straight down. Nuff saidWill consider reasonable offers.The sale of this firearm will require a background check and ffl transfer.

Designed to be small and compact for easy carry conceal or small storage areas, this Model 36 J-frame has a pinned 1.875 inch (sometimes called a 2 inch) barrel. It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder, case-hardened trigger, and case-hardened exposed hammer with single or double action. This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a bright shiny nickel finish and has Smith & Wesson wood grips.This thirty-three year old classic revolver is really pretty. The original owner fired three cylinder's worth of rounds before storing it. I took it to the range after I bought it and fired thirty-five factory-manufactured rounds through it, keeping the total of the rounds fired through this gun at fifty.As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is an accurate and fun gun. While this gun is pretty enough to just put up somewhere and admire, it is dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun.There are a few very small light surface spots (not rust) on this revolver from time in careful storage over the past more than three decades, but I am not sure any of them even show up in the non-retouched pictures. The location of the spots are mainly at the bottom of the revolver by the serial number.Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.I have received many inquiries, some offers, and a couple of ""I'll take it"" emails recently from folks who have not met and verified the following criteria or weren't able to buy right now, which have prevented sales to legitimate would-be purchasers.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale.

Rarely used, just don't have room or time for it. Comes with case. 1300 firm NO TRADES PLEASE // MSRP $1849DANIEL DEFENSE V9™ LW (DANIEL DEFENSE TORNADO®)The new Daniel Defense DDM4V9 Lightweight is designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications. The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Lightweight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The V9 Lightweight is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip and is finished with Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTIONLOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.
