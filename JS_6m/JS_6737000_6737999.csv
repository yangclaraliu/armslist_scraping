The customization includes a 1960's Fajen stock and a re-barrel in the rifles original caliber, the powerful and flat shooting .264 Winchester magnum. Barrel length is 26"", perfect for extracting the maximum performance from the speedy .264 Winchester magnum. Lands and grooves are sharp and shiny. The action is the renowned Sako L61R. The action is a first year (1962) production L61R as denoted in its serial number (#1735). The only modification to the bolt is the wing type bolt safety instead of the #4 trigger safety common to the L61R action. This wing safety was a common modification back in the day, particularly on more expensive customizations. It was done for those discriminating shooters who preferred a safety which blocks the firing pin, like this modification does, instead of the safety on the original L61R trigger which only blocks the trigger sear.Buyer will have to pay $20 for shipping"

I have about 300 rounds thru it with no failures to feed, fire, extract or eject. I just can't say enough good things about this rifle and the Windham name has an awesome story behind it. But, in order to fund my SBR build I will have to unload this one. I have added a free float quad rail, which required me to replace the gas block, and added a lever extension to the charging handle. It also has an Ergo grip, which is in my opinion the most comfortable grip on the market, and Magpul MBUS flip up sights. I have also replaced the backplate to an aftermarket sling mount backplate. It has a Magpul MOE foregrip which is a nice addition. I will include the single point sling with the rifle. I currently use a Bushnell TRS-25 red dot sight (best budget optic on the market) mounted on a UTG MED-PRO Compact Riser (pictured) but it would be an additional $50. Otherwise, I will use it for my SBR build. However, I will include 2 NIB Magpul Gen 2 magazines with the rifle. Feel free to call or text REDACTED"
