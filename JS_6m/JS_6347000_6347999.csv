The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. Maximum effective range with the standard 6-inch barrel is 200 meters (650 ft.). The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear and enhances the obturation between the bullet and the bore, thus increasing accuracy. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The combat-type trigger guard is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position, permitting rapid change of magazine and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing.

With the exception of the ramrod this example is complete and fully functioning, including its signature long rand leaf sight. This example has a chunk of wood missing behind the front band, but is otherwise intact. The right side of the butt stock has a set of initals, L.P, carved into it. The metal has an attractive chocolate color over most parts. There has been some cleaning done in an apparent attempt to reveal markings around the breech. The gun is bare of markings, save for an allignment mark at the rear of the breech and tang. The bolster and lock show some old pitting from field usage. The bore still shows good rifling, although it is dark. The stock is in good condition apart from the noted defects. It has typical usage wear and bruising, but no real cracks or splits. This is a great example of one of the rarer imported arms of the Civil War, with an estimated 3,000 being imported by Federal agents and arms speculators. Shipping is not included in the price, but I figure it will run around $40 with insrance. If you would like additional pictures I will be happy to send them.I posted this listing earlier in the day and it way flagged as a scam.

Comes with an offset mount. Have only used a few times and just prefer a higher zoom capability. I did a lot of research on this scope and for the money it is hard to beat. It has a laser etched reticle so it does not require the usage of battery to light up. That's not typical at the price range these sell at. Battery is a common CR2032 and has the same battery that came with it. Again, not used much so I'm sure has plenty life left. Offset mount comes with it. These sell for 75.99 on Amazon. Looking to get 60.00 OBO. Might even do some trading for some .223, 9mm, or 30-30 ammo. Let me know. Serious people only please. Don't be a bum and waste my time or yours.

690,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6347690,For Sale:  Confederate Altered M1816 Musket,"Mt. Pleasant, East Texas, Texas","$ 1,800","Listed On: Wednesday, January 18, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a nice example of a genuine Confederate altered Model 1816 flintlock musket. This musket started life as a M1822 (M1816 type 2) produced by Marine T. Wickham of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It may have been one of the 160 brown finished Wickham muskets delivered to the Commonwealth of Virginia under the Militia Act of 1808. In any event this musket was percussion altered via the brazed bolster method by the Union Manufacturing Company of Richmond in 1861 or 1862. This firm was the second most prolific alterer of flintlock musket for the State of Virginia, having converted between 10,060 and 11,315 muskets for the state. The firm also sold component parts to the Confederate Government as well. This example has the typical round bottomed bolster of a Union Manufacturing alteration, although it lacks the ""U"" stamping on the barrel, lock, or hammer that ""Confederate Rifles and Muskets"" correlates to the muskets. However, the book also makes note that not all examples bare the ""U"" stamping. I have two additional examples in my collection that lack the ""U"" markings as well. Unfortunately this musket was cleaned at some point. The metal is turning back to a pewter to gunmetal fininsh and has no active rust. The lock is functional, although the cone is missing. There is some scattered light pitting over the gun, which is much more noticeable around the bolster and lock. The tang was broken at one point and has been repaired via brazing, which may date to the percussion alteration. The ramrod is included, although it is about 1/2 inch short, having no implement threads. The front sling swivel is broken. The stock was also sanded, but is in remarkably good shape, and still has nice definition to the lock pannels, etc. The stock flat is devoid of any cartouches, and may have not had any to begin with. The biggest drawback to this gun is that hammer, which is not a Confederate hammer, but more likely a replacement from a Henry Leman alteration. It fits the gun well, and is a somewhat close representation of what the proper Union Manufacturing hammer should look like. All in all, this is a solid Confederate musket at a price that I doubt you will see one at any time soon. My first listing was flagged by someone who neglected to even give me the benefit of the doubt and message me concerning the validity of the post. I request that if you feel this post is spam or a scam you contact me so I can prove otherwise. Shipping is not inclued in the price, but I expect it to run about $50 with insurance. Pick-up and inspections are also welcome.Thanks for looking."

The Vertec, unlike most Berettas has a thinner vertical Vertec grip instead of the large Beretta hump, which makes it feel MUCH better in your hand. Another Vertec upgrade is the flush barrel and the dovetail-mounted sights which lets you easily swap in others.This firearm is upgraded with a Wilson Combat Short Reach Steel Trigger (which replaces the composite trigger), a Wilson Combat Extended Mag Release (which replaces the very small, plastic mag release), and a full set of Wolf Hammer Springs (16lb, 17lb, 18lb, 19lb), the 16lb aka the ""Beretta D Spring"" is currently installed, which is the spring they use on their decocker-only models for a lighter and smoother double action pull. After installing the upgrades, it has been tested and everything works perfectly.This firearm also comes with all factory parts, and THREE magazines. A 10 round magazine, a 15 round magazine, and a 18 round flush fit Mec-Gar mag that is less than a week old. Below I will list all parts.In this package you get:-Beretta 92FS Vertec Inox-Wilson Combat Short Reach Steel Trigger-Wilson Combat Extended Mag Release-Wolf Spring Set-3 Magazines-All factory partsI'm asking $900 for this, which considering how much they sell for (When they actually come up for sale, once every 5-6 months) is definitely a really good deal, especially with the upgrades and extra mag.Definitely open to trades. Prefer polymer striker fired handguns in 9mm, but I am willing to consider all trades, the worst I could do is say no eh?Optimal trade would be a Steyr 9mm + cash, but since those are pretty rare I won't hold my breath.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED or messaging me on here at any time.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

For sale/trade, I've got a completed 16"" upper for an AR15 type rifle and a whole handful of AR parts. (Basically everything but the lower reciever and trigger group)The upper itself was custom lapped / squared to be better mated with the barrel. The barrel mount is now flatter, and the feed ramps line up perfetly.  It is slightly used, no more than 200 rounds through it. It consists decent quality parts: - Diamondhead 10.25 inch Free Float Keymod Handguard / Rail- PSA Full auto Bolt Carrier Group- PSA Mil-spec Charging Handle- Mil-spec complete upper (Custom machined, see above) - PSA 16 Inch .223 Wylde (1:7 twist) Nitride-treated Barrel (5.56 and .223 compatable) - A2 Birdcage Flash hider + crush washer- Mid length Del-Ton Gas tube - Low profile Yankee Hill Gas Block + roll pin- Some type of Sling loop / mount thingThe whole assembly is easily worth my asking price. But to make things sweeter for you, I've added a bunch of extra free shit as well: - Magpul Verticle Foregrip (Slightly modified to fit on the rail) - BCI Carbine Length Buffer Tube + Nut - New Buffer + Buffer Spring- Collapsable m4 style Mil-spec butt stock- Tapco Rubber Recoil / Stock Pad- Soft Rifle CaseSo that's almost everything you need to build an ar-15 rifle, but without the actual gun part (lower reciever) so I believe no FFL is required. I will not accept less than my asking price for all this great stuff, because it's a very reasonable price to ask, and this is a lot of super great stuff. I may trade, though. (I will pay my own FFL fee in this case)"
