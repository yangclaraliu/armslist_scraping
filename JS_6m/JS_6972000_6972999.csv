This is an awesome rifle. The full list of specs are attached as a photo. The biggest thing about this rifle is that it is a factory piston impingement system. Another note, this rifle has a 14.5"" barrel BUT the compensator is welded on to qualify it as a 16"" barrel. I have read of people drilling thru the pin weld. I originally intended to use this rifle for Texas Hog hunting but never had the chance to hook up with my group that goes. Although i haven't hunted with this rifle, i have used it in a carbine vitals class and after 500 rounds the gun was remarkably clean in comparison to DI guns. This rifle is factory OD Green. it originally had tan furniture. I swapped the black Magpul sights with another rifle of mine. I also replaced the charging handle with a Bravo Company USA Charging handle and changed the pistol grip to a Bravo Company USA grip. The Buttstock was tan but i painted it OD green to match, you can see where the paint is wearing off from use. I did not intend to sell this rifle, hence swapping parts to how i want them. With the rifle comes...

5 - 20 round Pmags
1 - 10 round Pmag
1 - Magpul Single point sling
1 - Bravo concealment .308/7.62 Pmag holster (Left Hand)

This revolver has had custom work done on it at the S & W Performance Center. It has had a trigger job (very sweet smooth double action pull and around a 2 pound single action pull) It came with a beautiful satin finish, which is a little darker than stainless. It also was ported at the Perf. Center. I got this around 2000. I shot it about a dozen times then cleaned it thoroughly and put it in my safe to collect. This is a gem of a revolver, if your a revolver person or collector. It is easily in 96 to 98 % condition and maybe even better..I can not see a blemish on it. The turn rings are barely visible. These things are about as rare as a moon rock....especially with the Performance Center custom work, ports and presentation grips. It has, as you can see, fully adjustable sights. Comes with plastic box and manual. I have seen these things on a gun website or two a few times and they have been well over what i'm asking for this. Must be legal Tn. resident...I will ask to see your ID. Prefer to deal with a permit holder. Even though this is a very collectible revolver it would make a great carry weapon as well.

I need help with $120 and I'm losing hope, I never lose my faith in G0d but I wont have a roof over our heads for my 2 year old if we don't come up with the money by tonight and this has broken me down more than you will ever know, we have been sleeping in my truck and I dont get paid till next Friday June 23rd to pay the rest of the rent, my number is 615-439-8899, I would be more than glad to talk with someone and tell them our story and how we got here or please pray for me and my family as I'm just needing some help or a loan and anything that points me in the right direction, I dont care what it takes to save my family and will write a contract and sign it, let you hold my bank card or the registration to my truck I would do it or help would be something I would never forget, I'm really scared and have prayed and prayed and prayed and ask G0d to take care of this thank you and G0d Bless ANYTHING HELPS I'm only doing this for my 2 year old, if you can't help just please send me a message saying you will pray for me and my son thank you so much, I don't care what I have to do to keep this roof over our heads, if its a loan then I can give some collateral to hold, or I can do whatever to work it off I just need help, if its not the full $120 then anything helps even if its a little! Thank you and g0d bless, just a simple message saying I will pray for you helps as well PLEASE I need some assistance and just a friend to talk to that can help ANYTHING HELPS I ALMOST HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED please let me know if I can do anything to earn it or a loan would have written terms and I will sign it, I really need help and prayer as I am starting to panic and I can't find any help, I have a 2 year old and I just want the help for him please I can meet with anyone to prove I'm not a fake or a bad person I'm just in a tough spot, for some reason my cry for help is going unnoticed and don't know what to do, the reason he was able to make us leave until i pay that is due to me not being on the lease as I took over the payments for another person so I wouldn't have to pay a down payment and he is being really unfair, I will even let you call and talk to him cause I don't want people to think I'm not a real person that needs help, PLEASE JUST A SIMPLE MESSAGE SAYING YOU WILL PRAY MEANS ALOT, cause I can't find the last bit of help I desperately need, I don't care if I have to give someone my bank card to hold and my social security card, even the registration to my truck just so you know I have to come back to pay if its a loan, I posted this as my last resort so if someone could please explain why I can't get help or if there is something I should do to make people know that I am real person in need of help, I have received messages saying people are cautious to meet in person, well to prove I'm really in need I will meet at a police station or anywhere that makes you comfortable, this has been the hardest thing we have ever been through, G0d bless ANYONE who takes the time to message me and say they will pray for us THANKS The only reason I am posting here is cause I am running out of options and losing hope so I know it will most likely be flagged but I just need a friend"

My name is Jake, and up for sale/trade is my Remington 700 .308 bolt action rifle. My goal when buying/putting together this rifle, was to build a tactical rifle that could be shot at distance extremely accurately while suppressed. I succeeded. Let me tell you, it's fun to bang steel 500+ yards out effortlessly while your rifle barely makes a noise, REAL FUN. However, after shooting it less than a hand full of times (It has sat in my safe, clean and taken care of since),  I've decided to move on to something a little more practical for myself while still utilizing my 30 caliber suppressor. So I am selling this rifle to build a high end 300 blackout pistol. I might be convinced into trading for one, if you just so happen to have a badass 300 blackout pistol laying around. I am open to smart, fair offers. Bellow is the parts list of what will be included with the rifle. Please dont waste my time, and I wont waste yours! Please feel free to Email me with any inquiries/offers. **Suppressor not included, although highly recommended.  ;)Remington Tactical 700 SPS AAC-SD 16.5""Manners custom stock chassis Seekins detachable box magazine kitVortex PST MRAD 6-24x50mm FFPAccushot Atlas BT10 bipod2 Magpul 10 round p-magsMidwest Industries scope mountWarne fixed scope ringsI will also include about 100 rounds. Some subsonics if you have use for them, and some regular hornady.If you were to go through and add up the cost of all these parts new, it would be well over $3000. And believe me when I say, the rifle is in ""like new"" condition, everything has been babied.Thanks for looking,Jake"

The finish on the slide is Robar, which is a tough finish as well as self lubricating. The internals have been polished for a smooth trigger. Nothing has been altered on the inside. The previous owner decided to make this easier to conceal and carry so he chopped the frame to Glock 19 size. He also stippled it, although the stippling leaves much to desire. I have shot 200 rounds through it, and it is dependable and very accurate. Just with a new frame it could be returned to original state. I would like $350 for it. Does come with box, one 17 round magazine with +2 extension, as well as a 15 round Glock 19 magazine that fits flush. It is I believe more than fair.

Rare .22 caliber single shot rifle that shoots caseless ammo. Excellent condition with about 400 rounds of ammo. The Daisy V/L was the first production rifle for caseless ammo.It was released in 1968 by Daisy. In 1961 Case Hough, the president of Daisy purchased the design of a new firearm system. The new system was developed by a Belgian Chemist. The V/L ammunition consisted of a .22 caliber bullet with a small cylinder of propellant on the back, and no primer. The rifle resembled a typical spring-air rifle, but the 2000° hot, high pressure air served not only to propel the projectile but also to ignite the propellant on the back of the V/L cartridge. The rifle uses a small, unique and well designed part called an Obturator (obturator/ignitor) to compress the air as it is pushed through a tiny hole. This air is heated as it is pushed through the small hole enough to ignite the powder of the caseless round. Please check my listings as I have listed or will be will be listing many guns in coming days and weeks as I get time.( Ruger Night watchman, Mini 14, Colt WWII commeratives, Gold Cup, M1911A1, Beretta 92, PX4,CX4, Calico M100, M950, Marlin 444, 45-70, 44 Mag  Para Companion 7.45, P14.45, P14, P16,P18 Limited, Taurus PT1911, 1949 Argentine Sist.
