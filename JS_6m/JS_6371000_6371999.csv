This is when they were still made with the heavier frame. I have carried Sigs professionally for over a decade and I purchased this new in later 2007 to be my retirement gun. I am trying to buy another pistol platform though so it is for sale. It has never been fired by me- only (I assume) by Sig at the factory. I have only occasionally cleaned it. The night sights still have some life in them. It comes with one mag still in the wrap and another Sig mag. I also have a Hogue slide on grip I will throw in. This is basically a brand new pistol that has sat untouched since I bought it. I have more pictures of the internals to show lack of any wear. Feel free to e-mail and I'll send them. Must be transferred through an FFL (I will throw in a leather holster for this inconvenience ) or will sell to active LEO with credentials.

NIB is not intended for carbide or tungsten. • Improved impact resistance • Best performance is achieved when both mating components are plated with NIB • Plated parts can run lubrication free, reducing the cleaning, care, and maintenance without sacrificing reliability • All final thickness measured with XRF instrumentation technology The color of NIB BATTLEWORN™ is a dark shade of gray with an aesthetically distressed, modern “battle” finish. NIB BATTLEWORN™ creates a smooth and uniform plating barrier without adding significant dimension to the metal part, increases the surface hardness of the plated part, and produces a product that is superior to competing plating systems."

The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability* and an ambidextrous QD sling mount that will accept any push-button sling swivel. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.PSA AR15/PA10 Enhanced Polished TriggerWe start with our standard single-stage government-style fire control group, finely polish the contact surfaces and then coat the hammer and trigger in a super slick nickel finish. The result is a trigger that is substantially smoother than mil-spec. A great economical upgrade."

Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When we combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.

DiamondCoat 2

Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.

2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing

While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold. Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards we set ourselves.

Generous Eyebox
The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high power, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight pictue that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.

Blackened Lens Edges
Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical perrformance.
Twin Bias Spring Erector System
Super Fast-Focus Eyepiece
3:1 Zoom Ratio

Dual Use
Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association  men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.

When we first decided to create our own rail mounted rangefinder, we wanted something that would allow us to range out to incredible distances reliably without having to come off of the gun and without breaking the bank, and that's exactly what we're delivering to you. Additional features of the Radius include a user configurable display, continuous ranging for 12 hours with (2) CR123 batteries, and resistance to even extreme elements."

$950 firm in cash or better in trade value.  Lots of trade offers so far, but nothing I'd rather have yet over this one yet.
Prefer cash, but will consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others.  AR-15 & AR-10 receivers, parts, FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers etc.  Law Tactical Gen 3-M & side-charge upper receiver.
AR uppers in 9mm with 5""-8"" barrel, 5.56 with 8""-10"" barrel and 7.62x39 with 8""-10"" barrel. 
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 & 7.62x39 reticles, other similar 1-6+x and 1-4x with nice clear glass and true 1x, QD mounts are a plus, longer range scopes, 4-16x, 6-24x etc., needs to have good eye relief and clear glass.  I have some Nikon M-308 and M-223 4-16x I've picked up for around $300 in excellent condition and a little more with quality mounts.  I've been pleased with these, but open to others like Vortex etc.  Maybe nice micro red dots.  Not interested in online retail prices.Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  No lowballers, flakes or scammers!
Thanks for looking!"
