The tilt-breech system was designed to work with the rest of the frame to dissipate both the kick in the web of the shooting hand and the muzzle rise that happens at every shot, making this handgun far less punishing on the hand than others in its class, the PX4 SubCompact is quick back on target--a best-of-both-worlds situation combining superior concealment and low weight with a full-size shooting experience.The stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion- and sweat-resistant, making it perfectly suited for concealment even in hot and active conditions. This is a tactical pistol that is designed to work as hard as you while being as low-maintenance as possible. Disassembly is extremely easy and quick and requires no tools, while the tough and surface-treated steels enable you to keep it as good as new with a quick wipe even after a whole day in the holster.With the included interchangeable backstraps, the PX4 Storm SubCompact is easy and quick to adapt to different hand sizes (for instance, male or female) and grip styles. A built-in Picatinny rail further adds to its flexibility, making it possible to attach a variety of tactical accessories without any gunsmithing or alteration. Furthermore, most controls are either ambidextrous or reversible, making it easy to shoot and train with either hand dominant. Any shooter considering a reliable and soft-shooting subcompact for concealed carry or personal defense should give the PX4 SubCompact a very close look.I have thought about selling this pistol several times, but each time I feel it in my hand and snap that little pinky extension down on the magazine, I just think that I should keep this well made little powerhouse even though I have numerous other .40 Subcompact pistols that I have shot and carry on a regular basis. Since it appears as if Hillary will be in the White House no matter what, what better time is there to grab a potent little self defense pistol that will do a lot more than make an attacker just flinch!  Buyer must have valid Indiana ID and preferably LTCH as well. $450 cash makes this your own protection sidearm without the government knowing all your business.  However, there will be no exceptions to making sure you can currently legally purchase this quality firearm."

The forend was very difficult to remove and I ordered some new parts to make it easier for future takedowns in any event. While trying to remove the weird takedown parts the forend wood gave way. I can order a brand new forend but it doesn't look like the new furniture matches his. If anyone out there has a nonworking rifle or some parts for an older speedmaster please let me know. Without researching it I would guess this is a late 1960's version. Please send me any pics you may have. Or if you have a matching butt stock and forend you want to sell please send pictures and what you want for them

DPMS went back to the drawing board and designed a .30 caliber AR the way customers demanded it. Rearward of the receiver, the rifle is dimensioned identically to an AR-15. This means the entire rifle is lighter, more compact, and easier to haul around.Multiple improvements to the bolt and carrier group were implemented as well. A reduced diameter carrier further decreases weight, and the integral gas key is bombproof. Dual ejector springs improve ejection remarkably. and the redesigned extractor and elastomer spring will last for tens of thousands of rounds without replacement.The 16"" GII Recon is just as battle ready as the original .308 Recon, but weighing less means you can run it at your next high round count carbine course without needing to bulk up your upper body first. A 30% reduction in weight, 16"" stainless steel bead blasted barrel, DPMS hunter gas block, 4 rail free-float tube, and MagPul MOE pistol grip and stock make the G2 Recon a complete package.Specifications and Features:DPMS G2 Recon Semi Auto Rifle 60558.308 Winchester (Accepts 7.62x51 NATO) 16"" 416 Stainless Steel Barrel with Bead Blasted FinishMid-Length Gas System1:10"" Twist RateAAC 51T Flash Hider19 Round MagazineDPMS 4 Rail Free Float TubeMagpul MOE 6 Position Collapsible stockMagpul MOE Pistol gripMagpul Front/Rear Back Up Iron SightsDPMS 2 Stage Fire Control GroupForged 7075 T6 Level 3 Anodized Teflon coated upper receiverForged 7075 T6 Anodized Teflon Coated lower receiverOverall length Extended 38""Overall Weight 8.5 poundsMatte Black"

Original MSRP: $519.99, parkerized finish, dovetail ramp sight, rear ""snag free"" sight, Novak sights, series 70 type firing system, guide rod, combat hammer, skeletonized trigger, single action, 7"" overall length, unloaded weight of 34.56 oz, semi-automatic. Those are the specs. The ONLY things that has been modified on this pistol is a dot of glow-in-the-dark paint on the front sight circle, and the grips have been changed to wooden grips. This will come with everything that is pictured, which is the RI 1911-A1 CS Tactical, one Armscore 7 round magazine, one KimPro 7 round extended magazine (MSRP $29.99), and a CQC Size 01 Colt Government leather holster (blackhawkholsters.com leather slide holster with thumb break, MSRP $59.99). This is the first gun I purchased when I turned 21, which I bought used (and DO NOT know the round count), and have kept in perfect shape (except for one scratch on the handle, will explain in a second). I have put around 300 rounds through the barrel since buying used. I clean at least monthly, and after every time I shoot. I am selling this to save up some money for a competition pistol. This gun has served me amazing, accompanying me on many camping and hunting trips. The .45 ACP will take down anything that comes in its way, and it is very nice to have the compact size. The only flaw is that there is a rub mark on one of the grips from a backpacking trip that the belt clip rubbed on the grip. Otherwise, normal wear and tear, nothing else to mention. The grips you can easily replace with any 1911 CS style grips for relatively inexpensive. I pretty much ""white glove"" clean this gun every time I clean, even taking apart the magazines. This gun functions very smoothly and is awesome to shoot. I think it is fair if you pay the transfer fee and background check fee. I also have some range ammo and some self defense ammo that I can throw in for a little extra cost. There is also no case for this gun, I bought it without one and have just used a little duffle bag to store and transport it, along with the holster. Thanks for reading."

The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

I have had this on three different carbines with about 5,000 rounds between all three. Light still works as good as when I got it and its first battery I put in it. If you are worried about the freshness of the battery, I can throw in a spare battery for you. There is nothing wrong with it other than I want more lumens out of a weapon light. There are wear marks from taking it on and off. There is no damage to it, if we meet in person you are more than welcome to examine and function test it. Definitely a good amount for indoor around the house needs, but for me is lacking for outside. A brief summary of the technical aspects is that it is a 200 lumen momentary on switch wml. Meaning you have to push the button in order to have it on and only when you push it. There is a very good hotspot of the light an good spill for the peripherals of searching with the light. For more exact details follow the link to the Haley Strategic website below. If you want anymore details or have questions, feel free to ask me and I will do my best to provide answers or details.https://www.haleystrategic.com/weapon-accessories/illumination-tools/hsp-inforce-wml-blackI am willing to ship any of this though buyer will just need to pay a little bit to have it shipped to them.

The price as it is right now is non-negotiable unless you wish to pay more than the ad price. If I decide to sell for more or less I will change the ad price. Please respond courteously beginning with a traditional greeting or salutation, such as ""Good Morning Sir"", followed by your enquiry using complete sentences and then finish with a traditional closing, such as ""Have a nice day"" or ""Regards"". I have tired of receiving messages consisting of a few grunts or squeals. I simply refuse to deal with savages. No sales to thugs, felons, miscreants, subversives or otherwise anti-social persons. I reserve the right to refuse sale until the moment payment is exchanged. A bill of sale and exchange of credentials must occur. If this advertisement is still visible I still have the item."

This rifle is a fine example of a well cared for rifle I am just afraid that it is not going to be used much as we do not get very many longshots for deer here in TN. The rifle action is factory engraved along with the bottom plate. The bolt is factory jeweled. The wood is in great condition. This is a rifle I love to hold and look at just have not shot it very much. When I bought this rifle it looked like it had never been shot. It now has 22 rounds down the pipe to zero a couple different scopes.I can send you more pics upon request.

This Gun Was Purchased New 04/04/2016 and has only been owned by one person! The GLOCK 19 Gen4 chambered in 9mm Luger features a modular backstrap system that allows a shooter to tailor the rough textured grip of the pistol to their hand size for optimal ergonomics. Making the pistol even more user friendly, GLOCK has introduced a reversible magazine catch on the Gen4 pistols, now right and left-hand shooters can enjoy the pistol as Gaston Glock envisioned. To tame the recoil of the 9mm cartridge, GLOCK has introduced a dual recoil spring system that not only makes the GLOCK 19 a soft shooting pistol but also significantly increases the service life of the pistol.  The GLOCK 19 has changed the semi-auto pistol market as we know it thanks to innovative design, space-age materials and reliability that has defined the GLOCK name. Embraced worldwide by shooters in both professional and civilian circles, the GLOCK 19 has gained worldwide acceptance. Police and military turn to the Glock 19 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments. Featuring a large 15 round magazine capacity that rivals even the full-size service pistols, the GLOCK 19 has more than enough firepower to be used as a standard sidearm while retaining a compact and concealable form factor for plain clothes officers.  Civilian shooters embrace the GLOCK 19 for many of the same reasons as militaries all over the world, but the customizability of the pistol also helps find a home for the compact Austrian pistol in competition circles as well as in the hands of concealed carriers and homeowners looking for a cost effective firearm to defend their families.

I have extensively upgraded it since I purchased it in its stock configuration. The rifle stock has been upgraded to a Hogue OverMolded stock. This stock has a fiberglass skeleton with a permanently bonded nylon coating. I also upgraded the barrel from its stock set up. I have personally installed a heavy bull barrel with fluting. I upgraded the standard charging handle to an oversized tactical charging handle. I also installed an auto bolt hold open upgrade. Included in the price of this custom rifle are two accessories; a tactical rifle case and the original factory stock for the Ruger 10/22. Lastly I installed a tactical solutions mil-spec rail on top of the reciever. This custom rifle is incredibly accurate and a dream to shoot. The upgrades have made a night and day difference from its factory set up. I have kept this rifle in great condition in my safe. If you are interested in purchasing this custom rifle, please send me an email. I have many more high definition photos of the rifle. I was limited by the armslist server to the one displayed here. Of course, included with the rifle are its magazine, and owners manual. The buyer is responsible for all shipping and transfer fees.Thank you for your time and consideration. And.... yes, the patch is included =)"
