It features a three position selector - Mode 1 for Safe, Mode 2 for traditional semi-automatic Mode, or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode, the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger, whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Franklin Armory's BFS is easy to install with no custom fitting. The BFS Gen 3 offers a trigger pull of 4.5 lbs. (+/- 0.5 pound), the release phase now has a positive reset, and an updated design eliminates backup disconnector. The stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow. It works in Franklin Armory's F17 series in .17 WSM without modification. It works on .22LR and 9mm uppers without modification. The BFS works in every AR application: AR10, AR15, MPX, etc. Specifications    Type: Trigger   Model: Binary Firing System   Dimensions: Gen 3   Size: AR Platform/22LR,9mm Upper/Franklin F17 Series   Material: Metal   Action: Semi-Automatic   Trigger: 4.5 lb   Safety: Three Position   Finish: Black"

This is NOT a military grade NV set up and it won't make you a spec ops bad ass, it is however a lot of fun. I have used it on a 300 BLK and shot out to 100 yards at night, but realistically it would be ideal on a quiet .22 pistol or rifle for discreet plinking and pest control within 50-60 yards. Laser has a timeout feature and will shut off after 10 minutes run time. The NV has never been flashed or flared out. Plenty of spare batteries for the laser and the NV takes readily available CR123's. Both items are functional and can be demonstrated. All work and no play means I never got to use them much.

I bleieve the holster was around $100 shipped with the options I picked etc.Gun itself was $1280 including the tax and FFL fees (no one had one locally) so I had to order one.DOES NOT INCLUDE the Insight MRDS, I've already moved that over to my Trijicon as a backup RDS.Ideally speaking, I'm looking for an HK P30L 9mm DA/SA pistol and something to make up the difference at those only run $799 new. Maybe some night sights, exta mags, holsters, cash? I don't know.I might concider something like a COLT LE6920 too or a nice AK or AK style shotgun such as a VEPR or Saiga. All of those cost LESS then an FNX-45T btw.I'd concider a reasonable cash offer too. You know what I paid so feel free to shoot me an offer. I'm in no rush to sell this, I like it but I'd rather have something cheaper to shoot than .45ACP, I can get two boxes of 9mm for the cost of one box of 9mm."
