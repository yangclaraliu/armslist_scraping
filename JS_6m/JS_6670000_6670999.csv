Not full mag, open slide, or slight push on bottom of mag = flawless function. It can be sent back for a regular mag release and glock rail for free. however, there is a lot of information out there on fixing the mag release problem yourself, and a lot of people looking for this gun as a collectors item.I have been told it was the only picatinny rail or ambi mag release sold in the US. And I haven't seen another unfired. if you want this as a collectors item or to fix the mag release, this is for you if not it's just a regular glock, not worth the trouble trades on S&W 44,357,fnx 45, Hk45, plus cash where needed, glock 19"

They are wired into the switches on the outside of the machine, so just push the buttons and they come on. Shelving is set up for 6 long guns and 4 shelves with a ton of storage. The outside dimensions are 30x29x54. Interior space is 18x24x54. This would be perfect for a man cave or just in the basement.

If you havne't heard from me, check your spam folder. Please send pictures of trades and what you are thinking. Emails only at first because of spamming. Worse I could do is say no.

I purchased this at Cabelas, and literally only used it one time for about 30 rounds just to dial it in. These retail new on the cheapest end on Amazon for $180. Works perfectly, I just decided to go with another option. Cash only and local pickup in the champlin/Anoka area. Price is firm, no trades. Thanks!"

The rifle comes with a Firefield 10-40x50AOE scope and 213 rounds of ammo from various manufactures.  My intent was to determine what load the rifle liked best but I never got that far. I enlarged the bolt with a special plastic, can be easily taken off if dipped in boiling water, I would be happy to remove it if you don't want it. All in all I have about $900 dollars invested in this gun included sales tax.  Once again it has only had 27 round put through it. $500 Cash only, no trades.Call or Text Trent @ REDACTEDHere is a link with more details about the rifle: http://www.cabelas.com/product/Mossberg-MVP-Series-Varmint-Bolt-Action-Rifle/1367708.uts"

I am the original owner, and that's how I know it's never been fired.  It comes in the original box (with all papers etc.) with the original carrying bag supplied by Ruger. It’s very light and easy to handle.  The takedown is convenient and simple and the gun never loses zero after reassembly which is also very easy.This gun uses 10-round and 25-round magazines, and comes with two factory 25-round mags and one factory 10-round mag.  All 3 mags have factory dust covers.  The gun has never been fired and the bore is pristine and shiny.  The action and takedown mechanism are both smooth and flawless. There are no dings or scratches whatsoever on the gun.  It’s never been in the field or even to the range and it still has the original, peel-off Ruger stickers on it.  Sadly, it's lived a sheltered life in my closet because I just haven’t had an opportunity to use it. ...my loss, your gain (or maybe your gun).This sale also includes the Ruger manual, lock, and a mounting plate with screws for adding optics (the receiver is already tapped for installing the optics mounting plate).  Everything about this gun is factory standard, just as it came from the gun store.I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas. I’m in College Station so the triangle formed by Austin, DFW, and Houston is OK.  Maybe we can each meet half-way to reduce driving time.  Must be a legal buyer with a valid TX driver’s license or CHL/LTC permit.If the ad is still up, the gun is still available. If I don’t answer your email immediately, it just means I’m at work and I’ll respond as soon as I get home.I'd prefer cash and the price is firm.Definitely not interested in low-ball offers. Thanks!"
