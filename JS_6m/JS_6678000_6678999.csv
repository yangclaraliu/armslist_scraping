The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters."

The SP5K is designed and manufactured to meet the definition of a civilian pistol and marks the return of the roller delayed blowback system to an HK commercial product. This operating system is legendary in its accuracy and reliability. Originally developed on the Heckler & Koch G3 rifle, it has been used on several HK firearms.
The SP5K retains many of the critical features of the MP5, including its precision machined components and attention-to-detail quality. The SP5K is manufactured completely in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany.
The SP5K is a safe, robust, ergonomic large frame handgun. For more comfortable shooting, the SP5K is equipped with an elastic “bungee” sling. The sling is easily installed by snapping it onto the sling swivel hardware located on the rear of the receiver. Using the sling makes firing the SP5K more stable and reduces fatigue.
The overall length of the SP5K is approximately 14 inches — slightly longer than an MP5K — due to its unique handguard. The SP5K hand guard is designed with special ergonomic and safety features to protect the shooter’s hand and provide a comfortable and stable grip.
Despite its size, the SP5K is well suited for sporting use. Using the proven roller delayed blowback system; the SP5K’s inherent accuracy makes it an excellent choice for target shooting and an ideal home security arm.
And a wide variety of accessories can be added to increase its functionality. A Picatinny rail scope mount is attached to the upper receiver and allows for optional sights to be easily mounted. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK SP5K is a faithful rendering of the iconic MP5K as a semi automatic pistol."

This AR is a beauty. I just got an AR10 so this one is going to have to leave the family. This is a palmetto upper on a palmetto lower. It is a 20 inch CHF Chrome Hammer Forged heavy Barrel 1/7 twist with compensator. Spikes 6x24x50 scope with 3 inch sunshade and tip up lenses covers on removable riser mount  It has a free float quad rail, comfortable palm swell grip, drop in 3.5lb trigger, KNS anti walk pins, 45 degree back up Iron sights, fully adjustable cant bipod. It has a LuthAR fully adjustable cheekrest and length of pull stock. Has a spare mag in pouch on buttstock. Three 10 round mags included. It has a very low round count, about 40-60 rounds just sighting in and testing. I am sure I probably missed something but you get the point...its sweet."

This is a century arms, imported version of the Czech VZ58 rifle. Unlike most AK's or SKS's it has a milled receiver from a solid block of steel (not stamped). Bolt locks open after the last round is fired. Has a similar gas system to the SKS. Easy to field strip. The reliability is right there with the AK and SKS. It is a 7.62 caliber. It will come with 5 magazines, Mag pouch, bayonette with sheath and sling. I also have a couple of boxes of ammo. I have had this rifle for a few a months now. It's like new. I've enjoyed it, but most of my rifles are 5.56 so this is an oddball in my safe. It would make an excellent base for a build or a great truck rifle. The folding stock also would make it a great get out of dodge rifle as it would fit in a decent sized back pack. There are many possibilities. Most VZ58 accessories will fit this rifle. There are different stocks, rails etc. I need to trade local or at least near by as my work hours are all over the place. Buyer having a concealed carry permit is preferred.

I have a Matching 1944 M1 Garand, finished by may of 1944 so it would have been there on D-dayThe bulk of the gun was manufactured in January of 1944, barrel production took longer which was common, so it was completed early May of 1944 (Barrel is stamped May 2nd 1944)All parts are Springfield armory.  This is an original, not a CMP gun.The wood is clean, I would guess its probably not the original wood, as none of them are and that doesen't change its value, looks like it was replaced in the 60's. Its nice, not all scratched up, finish is clean, no rust on it, clean bore, shoots great.  I'm testing the waters out there, I own 2 of these, don't need to sell it, but will if I am offered a resonable price.  This is not a $1000 M1 like all the CMP guns out there, this is an original matching piece with no import stamps just the original US army issue stamps as it should be, and all matching parts.  so make offers accordingly.

The KSG™ is no ordinary tactical shotgun. Its dual tube magazines hold a dozen 3 inch, 12 gauge shells (plus one in the chamber), with the flexibility of switching between various projectiles. A patented downward ejection system makes it truly ambidextrous, while its 26.1 inch overall length, 18.5 inch cylinder bore barrel and 6.9lbs of weight make it is as compact as legally possible."

The Glock 19 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that has found worldwide acclaim with security services both private and public. The modular backstrap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the scientifically-designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G19 Gen4 retains the Glock accessory rail for your attachments.
 
Glock engineers have developed the Glock Modular Optic System featured on this model to simplify mounting of popular optics without costly custom machining of the pistol's slide. The MOS system comes with a cover plate for use when no optic is mounted and four plates options to comply with the specifications of some of the most trusted optic manufacturers in the industry. The MOS system also provides the option of adding tall iron sights, allowing the optic and the iron sights to co-witness."
