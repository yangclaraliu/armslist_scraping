The 90-Two stems from the M92 (aka the M9 , the US military's standard issued pistol) and shares several features with the model such as an open slide design, so the barrel is shows through. It has an external hammer that when cocked back changes the trigger pull from a double-action (long pull) to a single-action (short pull). Its ambidextrous safety also acts as a de-cocking lever. A second safety feature is a visible automatic firing pin block that prevents discharge if it's accidentally dropped. And three-dot fixed sights. Where it differs, it has an interchangeable front sight and a Picatinny rail for mounting lights or lasers. Lastly, it has a techno-polymer grip that is lightweight and designed for an ergonomically friendly hold. The grip is available in a standard or slim size. This Beretta 90-Two is used and has been kept in good condition. Also as a side note I tried a barrel swap with a Beretta Barrel 92F/FS chambered in 9mm and this upper assembly had no problem accepting the configuration and fired without experiencing any issues. Firearm was placed in a safe for storage.

There are small rust spots on the action and other minor spots here and there. The barrels are in decent shape. Some rust spots along the rib. Although I think most of these spots could be removed, I have not tried. I have only applied a light coat of rem oil to prevent further rusting. It's not a perfect gun but overall, it's in decent shape. Great keepsake or put it to uses as a home defense gun."

I am listing this gun as used because it has been fired by Springfield. I had it sent to them to have the standard 6 o'clock hold sights replaced with night sights that hit poa/poi at 25 yards. A test target was included. I also had them polish the feed ramp and tune the extractor. (I have this done on all my 1911s and have had great success with them.) I am not sure how many rounds they put through it for testing the sights but it was most likely not many. This gun comes with everything it came with from the factory. The only extra thing I have done is replace the full length guide rod with a stainless GI standard guide rod. If you are looking for a TRP but are not a fan of the 6 o'clock hold and want a gun that has had some reliability work done to it, this is your gun. $1200 No trades please."

The 1911. The main course here is a Ruger SR1911, probably had about 500 rounds through it, still has original packaging, soft carry case, and all the original paperwork. I've got 531 rounds of .45 acp pmc to play with, and 180 rounds of .45 acp winchester silvertips for real world application totalling out to 711 rounds of ammo. I've 6 magazines to load with all that ammo, 2 are Wilson Combat, 1 is the factory Ruger mag, and the other 3 are generic 1911 magazines. Some are 7 round capacity, and some are 8. I've got a 5 magazine pouch for said magazines, I've got a custom black leather ""Yaqui"" slide holster (minimal bulk, VERY comfortable), and I've even got a set of custom grips along with a few allen wrenches for those grip screws, and I've even got a big ol spamcan as part of the deal, to hold all that ammo."
