As you can see there's also a Hour rubber grip which makes it far easier to shoot.This gun is very reliable and I always felt good using it for conceal carry. Only selling right now because I'm in a transition and need the money.Also included is 500 rounds of good quality FMJ ammo and 97 rounds of high quality hollow point ammo so you'll never want for EDC ammo. 14 of the HP rounds are 50gr +P Liberty Civil Defense rounds which shoot and carry very nicely in this gun because they're so light.If you have questions, call or text @ REDACTED or email using this website.Thank You.**I reserve the right to refuse sale to weird or creepy people!!**"

It features a three position selector - Mode 1 for Safe Mode 2 for traditional semi-automatic Mode or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Franklin Armory's BFS is easy to install with no custom fitting. The BFS Gen 3 offers a trigger pull of 4.5 lbs. (+/- 0.5 pound) the release phase now has a positive reset and an updated design eliminates backup disconnector. The stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow. It works in Franklin Armory's F17 series in .17 WSM without modification. It works on .22LR and 9mm uppers without modification. The BFS works in every AR application: AR10 AR15 MPX etc.   FRNKLN 5550 BINARY FIRING SYSTEM GEN3  Mfg Item Num: 5550  Model Number: Binary Firing System  Purpose: Customization  Series: Gen 3 Trigger  Unit of measure: EA  Type: TriggerModel: Binary Firing SystemDimensions: Gen 3Size: AR Platform/22LR9mm Upper/Franklin F17 SeriesMaterial: MetalAction: Semi-AutomaticTrigger: 4.5 lbSafety: Three Position

Cool Rifle up for sale. Custom Ruger No. 1 in 22-250. It has a custom hammer forged barrel on it with block mounts. I believe it was unfired until I tested it because the bore looks new and the screws on the mounts were loose and had no locktite on them. I installed them properly and you could visibly see that they weren't aligned with each other properly due to the hammer forged barrel shape. Well, 5 minutes with some Burris rings with some inserts and a bore sighter and problem resolved. I had a box of cheapie ammo and after zeroing I got a dime sized group with cheap ammo so it's a shooter! Custom stock appears to be Mcmillan but no way to confirm that. Topped with a burris signature 6-24x scope with the daylight/twilight dimmer on it and their Ballistic Mil-dot reticle that's in perfect shape. Also, a new set of Lee collet dies and some once fired brass (150-200 if I remember right).$1600 for the entire package delivered$1250 for rifle rings dies brass if separated$400 for scope delivered if separated"

The BFSIII provides greatly reduced split times between rounds and the ability to place two separate shots into a tighter group.    Trigger Operation: Position 1 – Safe –Will not fire. Position 2 – Semi – Fires 1 round per pull. Position 3 – Binary – Fires 1 round on pull and 1 round on release. *  Easy to install. No custom fitting.*  Better trigger pull. 4.5 pounds, +-.5 pound*  The release phase now has a positive reset.*  New design eliminates backup disconnector. *  Stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow.*  Works in most AR application:  AR10 (308 WIN), AR15, MPX, etc.*  Works on .22LR uppers WITHOUT modification.*  Works on 9mm uppers WITHOUT modification.*  MSRP $429.99    The revolutionary Binary Firing System™ will be appreciated by three gun competitors, tactical shooters, and recreational enthusiasts. It features a three position selector that allows the user to switch from Mode 1 for Safe, Mode 2 for traditional Semiautomatic Mode, or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode, the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by simply moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger."
