This is brand new, never fired. All Mossberg 930 Special Purpose shotguns feature a self-regulating gas system that vents excess gas to aid in recoil reduction and eliminate stress on critical components. All 930 autoloaders chamber both 2 3/4 inch and 3-inch 12-gauge shotshells with ease—from target loads, to non-toxic magnum loads, to the latest sabot slug ammo. Magazine capacity is 5+1. To complete the package, each Mossberg 930 includes a set of specially designed spacers for quick adjustment of the horizontal and vertical angle of the stock, bringing a custom-feel fit to every shooter. Safety and safe handling is of paramount importance in special purpose firearms, and the 930 was engineered with that in mind. The receiver-mounted safety is convenient for right or left-handed users; simply push the button forward to take the weapon off safe. A protruding chrome cocking-indicator button is strategically placed in the front inner-edge of the trigger guard, making it easy to see and feel when the weapon is cocked or un-cocked. Unloading has been made easier too, with the Mossberg EZ-Empty™ system. By depressing the bolt release, the carrier can be pushed up and the first shotshell in the magazine removed. Simply repeat until the magazine is empty. All 930 Special Purpose models feature a drilled and tapped receiver, factory-ready for Picatinny rail, scope base or optics installation. Features:12 gauge, 18.5"" Matte Finish ""Stand Off"" Barrel, Black Synthetic Stock, White Dot Front Sight"

Fresh from a spam can repacked in a .50 cal ammo can. Packed 40 rds to the box on 10 rd stripper clips. Fuquay Varina, NC.   Last couple cans.  When they're gona that's it.  $190
There is plenty of 7.62x39 ammo on the market, but most of it is best used for practice and plinking on the range. Most 7.62x39 including HPs doesn't expand very well and isn't good SHTF/Self-Defense ammo. The Yugo M67 is an exception though and is some of the last true military surplus 7.62x39 ammo on the market.
The Yugo M67 bullet was designed to produce a superior wounding profile, speed, and accuracy. If you are looking for the best surplus 7.62x39 Ammunition for your AK then the Yugo is one of the best choices because it is true mil-spec, sealed primer and projectile, annealed brass case, and just a tad hotter of a load than the typical steel case options. Ammo is berdan primed for a long shelf life. It is mildly corrosive having corrosive properties in the primer which require clean up after shooting but those same properties extend the shelf life and sure fire capabilities even longer.
(This pic is of some other Yugo 7.62 ammo I had. The pic below is of the same ammo but loose in 15 rd boxes instead of stripper clips. This listing is identical only 640 rds in 40 rd boxes on stripper clips.)"

It is a piston driven AR, which yields a lot of great benefits, in that it cycles faster, runs cleaner, cooler, and more reliably, and is easier to take down and clean. If you have questions about the Piston vs. the standard Direct Impingement system, I encourage you to look it up. The Truth About Guns did a review on this gun, and it can be found at this link:http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2014/03/foghorn/gun-review-adams-arms-tactical-evo-rifle/The current version of this rifle can be found online at the adams arms website, though it is severely backordered:http://www.adamsarms.net/16-mid-tactical-evo-rifleThe lower is a Spartan Tactical ""MOLON LABE"" lower which has been colorized in Red and White. This stripped lower can be found at:http://www.joeboboutfitters.com/Spartan_15_Enhanced_Billet_Lower_Receiver_p/jb-spartan15.htmI am willing to include a lot of the accessories which I have for this rifle. Too many to list, but if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask me. (NOTE: There are a few things that are in the pic that I no longer have)There is a 3-9x40mm scope mounted on the gun in the pics, with parallax adjustment and illuminated reticle. It can put 5-shot groups in 2 MOA at 100 yds all day (with several sub-MOA groups mixed in)--and I haven't sandbagged it or put it in a vise or anything, that's just shooting from the grip pod (and I'm a crappy shot!). I also have a 4-reticle reflex sight with an optionally attached laser and a pressure pad. (The scope is not on the gun right now, but I can include it if desired.  Currently has the reflex sight)I have a grip-pod on this gun, as seen in the attached photos(those things aren't cheap...).  5 magazines--2x Magpul Gen3 window mags(awesome), 1x tapco AR15 Mag, and 2x steel mags. All work perfect.I currently have 840 rounds of brass cased 5.56 ammo (including 70 rounds of hollow point) to include with the deal. I can also include only 340 rounds if you would like, or zero.This gun has been meticulously taken care of and cleaned after every trip to the range. If you are a serious buyer, I would be happy to show you how to take it all the way down with the piston system--it's not difficult. I firmly believe that this is one of the nicest AR-15s I have ever shot, and it continually impresses me. I can honestly say that I have never had a misfire with it. I am just at a point in my life where this gun doesn't make a ton of sense for me to own. It's a great firearm and I would love to see it go to somebody who will use it and enjoy it.As always, cash talks, but I would also be interested in a trade for other firearms, or really anything of interest. I would consider any rifles, pistols, or shotguns, bows, hunting/target/defense, anything.

I'm always looking for concealable carry guns (4"" 1911's in .45 or 9 mm, XDs in .45 or 9 mm, Glock 43, etc.), and I'm looking to build an SBR style 9 mm or 300 blackout (with sig brace or shockwave blade since I can't own an SBR yet) possibly when I sell one of these rifles.

This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol. The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger. Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands. The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.Features:Caliber: 9MMCapacity: 14+1Magazines: 1Barrel Length: 4""Finish: Dark Earth Frame, Black SlideAction: Double OnlyFast Action Trigger"

This is the highly desirable original series Para-Ordnance. The later Para-USA guns were not created equal and are plagued with issues.Accuracy. This damn thing shoots business card sized groups at 50 yards with Winchester White Box 240gr ball ammo. That level of accuracy requires ammo that is matched to the gun which means a long series of testing custom handloaded ammo and then loading that ammo from then on. The greatness here is the ammo that perfectly matches this pistol is factory off the shelf ammo. I've never seen accuracy quite like this in a handgun using factory ammo. Hunting wasn't the original plan with this gun but it shot so well that it immediately got a custom trigger. A 40 yard shot was point, click, drop. This is one of those special guns that runs as well as any ultra high end .45 plus and it does it with ammo from Wal-Mart. I never planned to sell it but life changes. This has either been in a holster, in my hand, or in a safe so the finish is excellent.If you're local you have a big advantage of no shipping fees, no FFL fees, no FFL transaction process, and you can see the gun during purchase instead of after.No trades or exchange of services.

- Makarov

Class III item. All NFA rules apply. One left at this price. $299 out the door. NFA rules apply. You pay the tax stamp to the ATF.Cleaning the Kestrel 5.56 is a breeze. Centerfire rifle suppressors need to be cleaned and inspected, just like rimfire suppressors.With the Kestrel 5.56 full user servicability is truely a reality. The Kestrel core is constructed of stainless steel for superior cleanability. You can use chemical solutions safe to stainless steel but that remove nasty lead deposits (the ""Dip""). The core breaks down so that you can put it into a reloading tumbler, or use a bead blaster for fast and efficient cleaning. And unlike other monocore technologies, you can dip your Kestrel core without worrying about damaging the exposed finish on your core. Kestrel baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired.
