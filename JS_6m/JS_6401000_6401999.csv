""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer forged 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.
Kryptek patterns utilize a multi-directional design to effectively conceal in a multitude of terrians that have either a lateral or vertical flow. The bi-level layering of the patterns incorporate background transitional shading and sharp random geometrical foregrounds to create a three-dimensional effect that ensures the utmost in concealment at both close and long ranges. These components, combined with colorations selected and matched based on input from testing and observations from Operators in the field, make Kryptek patterns optimal for many different environments.

There were only 1350 12 ga Pigeon grade shotguns made and far far fewer with an extra matched set of barrels. Additional features that add to the rarity is that it is equipped with ejectors and the Hunter One (single) Trigger. The receiver still shows most if not all of it's fine engraving. Most of the case colors have faded. There is still a little on the water table and on the upper tang under the lever. At some point it was it was subject to some heavy handed gunsmithing. A few of the screw slots are buggered and there are a few marks on the edges where the lock plates fit in the receiver. The deluxe French walnut stock may have had some finish applied at some point. The LOP is 13 7/8"" to the end of the pad. It may have been ordered with a short stock. The butt end of the wood is still curved and doesn't look like it has been cut. the spacer and pad have been added. There is a fine hairline crack starting at the back end of each lock plate at about the 10:00 position traveling back, up and around to the end of the upper tang. It is much easier to see on the left side than the right. The lock up is tight with both barrels and the lever rests right of center when closed. Barrel set number 1 is 30"" Chainette Damascus choked full and full. It retains 90 to 95% of the bold Damascus pattern. There are just a few rub/fade areas, mostly at the camber end and around the muzzle. The bores are excellent. Very shiny no rust or pitting. The left is perfect the right has one very small dent. The chambers are bright with a small amount of rough area. The splinter style for end has a few dents on the wood edge, one fairly substantial. It has an ivory center bead and a brass bead at the muzzle. Barrel set number 2 are 28"" Nitro Steel choked Modified and Improved."

This is a milled Bulgarian rifle chambered in 5.56x45. These things are smooth as butter, shoot like a dang pellet gun, and aren't made anymore. Perfect for a Bulgarian ARM9 clone. Has side rail, and the muzzle device IS NOT pinned and welded (14x1 LH threads). This particular specimen literally has four magazines run through it, so 120 rounds. I have the original box it came in but no papers. Included are (3) black gen 2 circle 10 30 round mags, (1) clear/smoke circle 10 30 round mag, and (1) clear/smoke circle 10 20 round mag. You will notice the Magpul MOE SL grip in the pictures. I have the original grip too, so you'll get both grips. I have additional black gen circle 10 30 round mags for sale, 40 bucks each.Trades I'm interested: SLR 107R, SLR 107FR, SLR 104FR, SLR 104UR ALL would need cash on your end to be considered. If you have something else, let me know, the worst I can say is no thanks."

This optic is pre-owned but remains in excellent condition having been mounted on a safe queen rifle that I have never fired.  The scope has no marks from having been mounted and really looks just as it did when I initially bought it. I would be happy to provide any additional photos or let you take a look in person. The Minox 66432 currently listed on Amazon for just over $600 and other websites with current listings for this same model (66432) offered prices ranging from $620 - $740 plus tax and shipping in some cases. I offer the Minox 66432 scope in like new condition in terms of both aesthetics and functionality at a price that is 25% -35% less.  In addition, the inclusion of high quality Millet mounting rings saves you the hassle and extra $40 associated with getting them yourself.  So take advantage of this opportunity to pick up a fantastic high-end scope at a great price."
