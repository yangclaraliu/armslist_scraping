Its sleek lines and superior ergonomics are designed with one goal in mind: letting the A400 naturally follow your eye to the target. This is why it has quickly become a favorite among serious competitive shooters the world over. Built on Today’s Most Advanced Semi-Automatic ActionThe A400 action is the culmination of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and passion for shotguns. It feeds reliably all types of shells from 2 ¾” to 3,” with loads ranging from target-light to hard hitting--making it also suited for the occasional upland or waterfowl hunt. Also, it features the unique Blink technology, a gas-operating system that is capable of delivering two shots in less than half a second, while also integrating an easy-maintenance self-cleaning piston. Furthermore, the action has sleek lines and a low profile, meaning that the vertical distance between the dominant eye and the supporting hand is reduced to a minimum. The result? A gun that follows your swing like an extension of your body and eyesight--and many more broken clays.Extremely Low-RecoilExtremely-Low-RecoilThere are no two ways about it: felt recoil is only a liability and the less of it, the better. The A400 Xcel incorporates several recoil-reducing systems operating simultaneously to make recoil virtually negligible (70% overall reduction). One is a hydraulic shock absorber that softens the rearward energy from the action’s moving parts, which minimizes felt recoil while reducing wear within the receiver. Another is a Micro-Core buttpad that all but neutralizes the recoil generated by the power of the cartridge. Also, the A400 is designed to recoil parallel to the comb, meaning no thump to the cheek and minimal muzzle rise.Gun PodThe Gun Pod is a digital display designed for the real ""powder-head"" who wants to keep track of everything on the range. This revolutionary system provides a digital readout of the ambient air temperature, the cartridge pressure of the round fired and the overall number of shells fired through the shotgun. This enables you to further enhance your training routine, as well as get to know your shotgun better."

For those of you who aren't familiar, ""dissipator"" is a term for A1/A2 variant AR-15s that had the barrel chopped at 16"", making them more handy than their 20"" ancestors while retaining the nice long sight radius of the rifle length gas system. The downside was that having the gas port so close to the muzzle led to some performance issues. Manufacturers today produce a faux dissipator, which is a 16"" mid gas barrel with a low profile gas block, and a pinned rifle-length FSB, so you get the best of both worlds.I built this gun a couple years ago and I've put about 500 rounds through it without any problems- runs like a top. I started with a really nice barrel and built the rest around it.-Daniel Defense 16"" mid-gas CHF chrome lined barrel 1:7 twist, with a professionally pinned Daniel Defense F-marked front sight base (done by Weapon Outfitters)-Daniel Defense Phosphate BCG-Anderson upper and lower receiver and associated parts kits-Aero Precision A2 carry handle rear sight-Mil spec A2 buttstock (I've got a front sight adjustment tool and boresnake stowed in there that comes with the gun)-Daniel Defense pistol grip with integral trigger guard-Daniel Defense VFG-Magpul M-Lok rifle length handguard-Magpul M-Lok hand stopI'd like to get $600 for it, face to face.

This gun has been appraised at $2700 and is for sale for $2300. if you are a serious buyer and know how seldom these guns come up for sale and how they will continue to become more and more scarce,feel free to contact me. Also SCAMMERS need not waste either of our time. If you wanted to buy the gun before you were ""Deployed tomorrow"" you should have gotten ahold of me before.

NIB will not crack and chip like hard chrome • Temperature resistant to 1100*F • Four times the wear resistance of electroless nickel phosphorus • Improved impact resistance • Plated parts can run lubrication free, reducing the cleaning, care, and maintenance without sacrificing reliability • All final thickness measured with XRF instrumentation technology The color of NIB BATTLEWORN™ is a dark shade of gray with an aesthetically distressed, modern “battle” finish. NIB BATTLEWORN™ creates a smooth and uniform plating barrier without adding significant dimension to the metal part, increases the surface hardness of the plated part, and produces a product that is superior to competing plating systems.

These knives were discontinued by Spydero years ago and they have become hard to acquire collectors pieces. The carraca mechanism works just fine on this one, unlike many others that are listed on ebay. It also has the original box and paperwork. Features premium s30v steel with a 3.8"" blade that I have given a custom 20 degree micro bevel and 15 degree back bevel as recomended by Spyderco. This helps maintain the edge much longer than a thinner edge, but allows for more efficient cutting at the same time with the thinner back bevel. Only wear is on the left bolster, and it is some very minor and light scuffs. People are asking between 200-400 dollar for this knife on ebay and you cannot find them in stores. Face to face cash transaction only. ""First noted in 15th century Spain among Gypsies and Gitanos, the Navaja folding knife was used for work, utility and protection. They’re shaped similarly to barbering razors or novacula, meaning razor in Spanish. Modern definition categorizes it as a modified clip-point with an unsharpened concave spine swedge. Unique to the Navaja is the Carraca or ratcheting sound produced when opening or closing the blade. It announces the knife’s presence and is believed to raise anxiety and anticipation, deterring criminals. Ed Schempp’s modernized Navaja has a carbon fiber handle, stainless steel bolsters, pocket clip and the Carraca (ratcheting sound), maintaining the mystique of the Navaja."""

Like its legendary FN forefathers, this combat handgun was designed to not only survive the battlefield, but to emerge victorious. It is the latest in technological advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a host of unique features that no other handgun can match. Its 15-round magazine is precisely engineered to take a dive to the prone position and naturally roll up toward the target. The checkered polymer frame has a low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil, enhanced operator control, and a grip angle that provides unmatched natural point of aim. Two interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use. The 5.3″ cold hammer-forged stainless steel barrel has a threaded muzzle to accept sound suppressors, compensators, and other accessories. The stainless steel slide has high-profile combat night sights and includes two mounting bases to accept multiple styles of optional red-dot electronic sights. Made in the USA   These are stock photos – item is Factory New.   Must be 21+ years of age to purchase.   Price: $1,149.99 each"

Springfield Armory is widely regarded as one of the best factory 1911 makers. The pistol is chambered in .45 acp like any true 1911 should be. The gun is a NM serialized pistol which indicates that it was made in the USA, unlike many of Springfields guns which are produced in Croatia. It is one of the smoothest 1911s I have ever shot. It has around 200 rds through it and it has been flawless. The gun DOES have an ""idiot scratch"". It HAS been carried and it's not a safe queen. That being said, it is in great condition and will last for many, many years. The gun comes with one extra mag (2 total) , a Desantis leather paddle holster, a Crossbreed super tuck  holster, the original box with its holster and mag holster, and a 50 rd box of .45 acp. Please call all or text me at REDACTED.

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with, too many projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, the gain in velocity was not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago or so and just sat in the safe.  The only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have a Hogue or Blackhawk grip and/or Magpul MOE stock I can add, if wanted, just let me know.
I'll take $1,380 in cash or look at good trade offers.  This cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's new.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and cash or???  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
