It is wearing a Monte Carlo Synthetic Stock with their bolt conversion for scope clearance. I Tweaked the trigger for a more crisp break. Polished everything around the action so it is smooth. I put on a scope mount drilled and tapped to the receiver and made good clearance for ejecting the shells. It wears a Tasco 3-9 x 32 scope with flip up cover in back, front pops off. It has a quick release sling attached for easy carry, see in the last pictures. Then there is the real work I have done. Barrel is cut down to 27.3"" and recrowned. I also took the barrel down to bare metal. (Mosin's made for war were rough) the barrel had ribs of metal all up and down where I filed, then smoothed to be slick as a baby's butt before reblueing. Trigger housing is reblued too. Matching arsenal numbers on Trigger Guard, Bolt, & Receiver. This looks like a modern day hunting rifle. It still shoots the cheap and easy to find surplus ammo but there are plenty of current manufactures that load for the 7.62 X 54R so it is a great hunting rifle to take anything on North America. You will enjoy it a ton. I have and now I must let it go to someone else to shoot. I just don't shoot it any more. I have let go all my Mosin's except my M44. I have to keep at least one. I will start you off with the first 20 rounds of ammo, just because.

The last thing that attracted me to it was the locked-breech design as opposed to blowback as is typical for smaller calibers. Price is firm. I challenge you to find a less expensive online.

This item is a safe queen find with a 1998 serial number. I would rate the shotgun as excellent condition considering the age. At arms length, you'd think this gun is in new condition. Upon closer inspection, there are a few small dings and scratches on the stock and forend, but none of them cut through the semi-gloss finish. In total, they would amount to less than a half dozen instances. The metal on the gun looks nearly pristine. The only blemishes to the shotgun in this regard are two small rust spots on the side of the top barrel where this gun sat in a safe and made contact with the barrel rests. There is no pitting on the barrel, and it is not even noticable without close inspection.I'm not the original owner of this shotgun, but I question if it has ever been fired. I ran a patch down the barrels and it came out white. Also the back of the receiver doesn't even show silouettes from the shotgun shell brass.The lock up is nice and tight. The extractors function flawlessly, and there are no signs of wear. It also features the Invector Plus choke tube system."

It's a great barrel to have that will allow you to hunt with your Glock 41. With the hearing protection act passed at the state level you can hunt in NH with a suppressor so the .578x28 threads will let you do that. I hunted with it this year and shot a deer with it. It also comes with a thread protector for unsuppressed shooting. It's very accurate and fun to shoot. I didn't need any other springs or anything with this conversion. It cycles fine and didn't feel like the slide was over traveling or anything odd. The 45ACP Glock 41 MOS may also be available as well with Eotech MRDS.
