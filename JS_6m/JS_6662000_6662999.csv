The rail is a 7"" slim keymod rail which will come with two picatinny rail pieces. I purchased a couple of these late last year and placed them in the safe. I have one other cerakoted in Burnt Bronze with a biohazard lower for sale as well (check my other listing for details).I did fire approximately 15 rounds through it (brass and steel case) when I first purchased it to ensure there were no issues before storing it. Also included is one 30 round Tapco magazine as seen in the photo. Also included is a brand new set of Magpul flip up sights. These were installed after I purchased it and will come with the Magpul box as wellPistol with Sights, and Magazine $550This price is FIRM, I will not take less and will keep them in the safe. Look up cost of the Cerakote service as well as the sights and you will see that you can not replicate this firearm for the same price.I am in Thomasville but work in Winston-Salem, and would be willing to meet in the Greensboro, Winston, High Point area to complete the sale. All laws will be followed, the buyer must have a purchase permit or concealed carry permit as this is considered a pistol.Feel free to email with any questions or if you would like additional photos of the pistol."

This pistol has been on several hunting trips not locked away in some dark corner of a safe for all of its life..  So naturally there is a bit of polishing from being holstered.
Awesome pistol to shoot! It generates a Big Fireball with a Potent BOOM, Powerful enough for hunting  deer and very effective defense against wild hogs or other dangerous critters.
The Front sight is orange not certain if I had that installed or if it came from the factory that way? I have owned it since it was new some 30 years ago.
The trigger has a travel limiter installed it stops immediately after the sear is tripped for a quicker response (a gunsmith did that for me, it now cycles rapidly with minimum trigger travel very nice)
The Recoil is quite mild, it is more of a “push” than a “kick”, reminds me of a .38 special revolver.
Comes with a custom built wood box, 2 magazines, and recoil/buffer springs
The shorter spring in the photo is the original it has been compressed from recoil. The Pistol has a slightly used new spring installed in addition to a spare that is also in the photo.
The Springs were recently purchased from Numrich arms, they are a bit heavier compression rate compared to the original spring and work very wellAsking $950 OBO"

I bought this just so I can have a Sig polymer to add to my collection. I don't need it for any other reason, well maybe as trade bait for something else. I'm a fan of custom 1911s. Maybe you have something I may want, i'm probably open to options.
