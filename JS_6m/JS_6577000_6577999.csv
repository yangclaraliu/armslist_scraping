I purchased this pistol new and have carried it on and off for a very short period of time and have never fired it. I have found that I prefer one of my other CCW options over this particular pistol. Included in the sale is a clear kydex holster from Reign Tactical that is set for right hand and 15 degrees of cant as well as a full box of Hornady Critical Duty +P ammo and a Pearce Grip Plug. I will NOT separate this as it is a package deal and at a VERY reasonable price. New this pistol sells at $539 plus tax which according to Glock is the lowest retail price a Glock Stocking Dealer can sell this for so no you didn't find it anywhere else cheaper. The holster was an additional $70 plus the ammo which was $23 and the grip plug which was $5. With tax that's a grand total of $683 for the pistol, holster, and ammo. My price is firm and firm at $520 cash. If you don't like my price, be an adult, keep scrolling, and move on with your day. You WILL NOT find this deal cheaper anywhere else.
