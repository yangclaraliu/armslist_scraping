Really this gun is laser accurate and wicked fuckin smooth, I just dont want to deal with its quarks. Occasionally has a failure to extract,  that's it... really. Honestly it probably just needs a new extractor arm, but I bought it from some guy who sold it to me when every round failed ( imagine my frustration after he didn't tell me that ). After a good cleaning though, now maybe 1 time per 15rnd mag there is an issue. So like I said, probably simple as hell to fix but I'm passing the torch. Overall great firearm, really is a diamond in the ruff it just needs someone to help it one last time."

It is user-friendly, durable, reliable and accurate, while with its snag-free lines is can be tucked in any kind of holster or pocket for deep concealment. Available in .22 LR, it is perfect for concealed carry (on its own or as a backup pistol), and it keeps besting all pistols in its class for quality, value and design.  
User-friendly design is common to all Beretta small frames. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber without racking the slide. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by giving an easy and absolutely safe way to check the bore and and remove a live cartridge. Jamming and stove-piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas.Keeping an eye on uncompromising quality helps keep Beretta small caliber semi-automatics ahead of the pack. Beretta pistols in the 21 Series utilize a tough forging process for their barrels, while slides are fashioned from solid steel bar stock--and frames from solid aluminum forgings. The new stainless-steel version (“Inox”) employs the finest and toughest steels, making it exceptionally corrosion resistant and durable."

The single action feels very light and smooth.  The slide glides along the rails very smoothly.  The Sig X-ray sights are also a big improvement over the regular night sights, especially the front sight.  The checkering on the front and back straps is aggressive, as are the really good G-10 grips, all of which combine to give you a great handle on the gun with zero slippage, unlike the regular rubber 229 grips.I have owned it just a few months and must sell due to an unexpected financial situation.  The package includes the original case which has instructions, papers, stickers and lock, plus the thermal case shipped from Sig when I registered the firearm which includes the 229 Legion coin and room for the gun and mag, plus the 2 additional mags and cut-out for a knife or flashlight.The price is firm at $900 and I am not interested in a trade.  I will sell only to an Alabama resident, and can ship to your reputable FFL dealer in Alabama if you pay shipping (approximately $40 if through a shipmygun.com preferred FFL, or near $100 if shipped through UPS, the only other alternative).  I can meet you within a reasonable distance of Montgomery, AL to make the exchange.  If interested, text me at REDACTED, or email here through Armslist."

The gun has a numbers matching frame, trigger guard, and cylinder, and may also have a numbers matching barrerl, but I don't know much about these guns and can't find a serial number anywhere (the barrel may not even be a serialized part?). Anyway, the gun is in good condition for a surplus firearm, and has had exactly 29 rounds shot through it by me - not sure about any Russians that may have shot this before, but the bore looks good. I also have the original cleaning rod and holster - which kind of smells funny, but what did you expect.The gun itself is pretty dang cool. It's got the cylinder that actually moves forward to seal in the gasses when you pull the hammer back - which makes it one of the few revolvers that you can suppress. Not that you probably would since a suppressor tax stamp literally costs as much as the entire gun, but I digress. It's single/double action, but you probably won't be shooting it double action since the double action trigger pull is not exactly what you would call ""light"". But hey, it's a surplus gun, not a Colt. It was actually suprisingly accurate from what I saw in my limited shooting, and is a really unique shooting experience. The only reason I'm selling it is because I want to fund some work on my car... I need less expensive passions.I'm asking $270 for the gun and 71 rounds of ammunition (two boxes of 50 rounds, one of which is missing the aforementioned 29 rounds). Thanks for looking and have a great day!"
