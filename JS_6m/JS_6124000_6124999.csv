I also have this clamp on grip/rail system that I bought for $50. It works very well but doesn't fit in the holsters with it on. Asking $750 for it now.
 
Will entertain trades."

Was listed for 860, but I have to let it go at a loss. Security Model Browning BPS with very low round count, customized by DMC Design Max Customs. 18"" barrel chambered for 2 3/4 - 3 1/2"". 6 + 1 capacity. DMC tooled the right stock and forearm to custom fit this one like a glove, making it a One-of-a-Kind security or home defense gun. Receiver and Barrel are SOLID STEEL BILLET, so they won't ding up if you drop a 12 gauge shell on them! The BPS usually weighs 10.4 pounds with full wood furniture, but the glass-filled polymer stock and forearm drop the weight to 8.9 pounds, empty, only one pound more than an 870 Security, but with ten times the quality and smoothness.The Downward Ejection works for right or left-handed shooters.  This Browning is a tight, close tolerance weapon. With the dual forged steel action bars, the forearm doesn't even have a 1/8 inch wobble! So it won't scratch the finish off the barrel and receiver like other brands!There are mounting rails on the forearm left and right to install a laser, sling QD or tac light.  All the gun metal is original Browning, including the factory high-capacity 6+1 steel mag tube (usually 4+1 on the average BPS). The metal has 3 baked-on coats of DuraCoat done by Design Max Customs with a DMC Grip-Kote on the forearm and the padded cheek-rest.PLEASE READ CAREFULLY--The Tac-Vector Red-Green Dot Reflex Sight with Cover ($69 at OpticsPlanet) can be left on this BPS for $40 additional. The other items in the picture, the Flambeau Tactical hard case, Multi-Mission Sling, Quick-Disconnect for the sling, Mini Laser, and FireStorm Tac-Light (not shown), can be mounted for an extra $80 (a $180 value). (2 3/4"" shells are shown only to illustrate tube capacity, and metal sights are no longer available.) I won't further seperate the package unless you just can't afford certain items. I'll be happy to work with you to get you the gun you will treasure for many years.The Browning BPS is $650. DMC Ithacas, Benellis and Brownings usually sell for $900 to $1200 (think of it as a Wilson Combat Custom--without the added 50% gun-snob factor). But I must sell it now to afford Christmas for the kids and grandkids.

It's an Old Model Super Blackhawk 44 mag that has been to Alan Harton. He cut the barrel down to 5 1/2"", and added his front sight and a Bowen rear sight. He installed a steel ejector rod housing, fit the gripframe and grips to the gun, and polished and re-blued the gun. I have the invoice. I'm not unhappy with this gun. I'll probably just never shoot it. I've got the itch for something new, and thought I'd see if someone with an appreciation of what it is might be interested. Now, for the rationalizing. The last Harton invoice was about $750. The Fishpaw grips would probably cost $800 to reproduce, if Fishpaw were still taking new orders. So at $1500, you're getting the base gun free. I'd really rather trade for a TRP/Dan Wesson/Les Baer-type 1911, but single action revolver guys sometimes aren't 1911 guys. Maybe an interesting levergun plus cash. Or maybe an OM Flattop Ruger or OM 357 Ruger Blackhawk 44 special conversion plus cash. Or a Colt SAA. You kind-of see what would interest me.I'd even consider selling the grips and gripframe for $750. Or trade them for a similarly-valued 1911, or a set of stag grips and gripframe plus cash.These are some hastily-snapped pictures. I'll take some better ones in the daylight if anybody's interested in the gun. I'd also be happy to let you take a look in person before you decideFTF near Lexington, NC. I'll need to see your permit. Thanks"

Accurate as the day is long! Only reason I am considering a trade is boredom. I would prefer a trade for another gun, but I would part with it for the right price.Included with the PPK:-2 extra mags (that's a total of 3. One 6rd without pinky extension, one 6 round WITH pinky extension, and one 7rd that sticks out of the handle just slightly, almost like a pinky extension) These mags are all Walther manufacture and are not only hard to find but expensive. About $40 online before shipping/tax.-50rd box of Speer LE jacketed hollow point ammunition -Synthetic SigArms holster. This holster is actually for the Sig P230, but they're almost the same profile andit fits ok. Can hold extra mags/cleaning tools. Nothing special but good for throwing in your glovebox or between the seat.I would really prefer to trade, but like I said I'll sell to a motivated buyer."

At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.Manufacturer: BerettaModel: BU9Caliber: 9mmBarrel: 3.2"""

This one is in great shape, having spent most of its life in my gun safe except for test firing of about 100 rounds, in which it was found to be totally reliable with not only full metal jacket ammo, but with defense hollowpoints as well. This beautiful pocket gun is extremely accurate, with excellent tritium night sights and a great trigger. This would make an exceptionally good gun for small statured people, those with smaller hands, or those with hand strength issues, because the slide is quite easy to pull back, the trigger is short and light, and the gun only weighs 15 ounces. While the .380 cartridge is reasonably powerful (about the same as a .38 Special), recoil is light. This would also be a great self-defense gun for a professional person who needs to carry in complete concealment and never let anyone know they were armed, because it is so small and light, but still easy to hit with.
This P238 comes with everything it had when it was new, including the box, papers, lock, factory belt holster and manual, but there have also been some things added. In addition to the factory Rosewood grips, there is a set of custom Hogue rubber grips, with unusual SIG medallions added to them, an additional 7 round factory magazine for a total of 3 magazines (these cost $45) and a DeSantis Nemesis pocket holster. So, truly, in this package, you would get everything you need for daily carry. I even have some .380 practice ammo and some Gold Dot hollowpoints I can sell with the gun, although they are NOT included in the price.
Since this is my personal firearm, I'm willing to consider trades on high quality handguns mostly. I like 1911's, Glocks, and classic Smith and Wesson revolvers, but if you have something else to trade, let me hear about it. I teach firearms classes and do gun writing, so you never know what I might be interested in.
Transactions will take place at my office in Homestead. You'll need a Florida Driver's License and I will issue a Bill of Sale. Please email me with any questions.

The quality of this CC pistol is unrivaled when compared to other competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. This P380 comes with 2 X high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round USA made magazines. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine.The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The easy to use night sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol. The Kahr P380 has a last round hold-open, which most small guns don’t have. The idea of the Kahr pistols is that they are the functional equivalents of larger guns, in a small gun package.Pistol comes with original hard case and saftey lock and is ready for a new home.Buyer must have a current valid NE fire arm purchase permit.
