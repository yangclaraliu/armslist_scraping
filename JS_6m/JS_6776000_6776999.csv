The X400 Ultra produces tactical-level light—enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision—for 1.5 hours per set of batteries.   The X400 Ultra’s 5-milliwatt laser sight, located below the primary light, emits a high-visibility red (635 nM) beam. The laser's aiming adjustment mechanism uses Nylok screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed.   Activating the X400 Ultra is done via ambidextrous switching located at the rear of body, providing one-finger control — press the switch on either side for momentary-on activation, flip up or down for constant-on activation. A separate switch at the rear of the X400 Ultra allows you to (1) activate white light illumination only, (2) activate white light illumination simultaneously with the laser sight, (3) activate the laser sight only, or (4) disable the entire X400 Ultra.  The versatile X400 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock system permits rapid attachment/detachment from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and is O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust and moisture."

1/2 x 28 fishbone muzzle brake (Crush washer & sizing nut included.) $15
 
Butterfly charging handle. Enhance your grip and add ambidextrous pull. You can use these to pull either left or right and charge under scopes. Very fond of mine. $20
 
Magpul rail attachment flip sights, fully adjustable. Great for main or backup use. Pair for $15
 
Do it yourselfer no walk/anti rotation pins. Good for 80% receiver builds. I'll sell these as a 3-pin set (Includes 3 pins and 3 screws) for only $2
Important note on the pins: I'm selling them cheap and as a DIY project. These pins are 25mm long (I believe AR receivers are 23mm?) I bought these in bulk when I didn't want to spend $6 a pair for my 80% receiver and knew these should only be a $1 a pin import. At any rate, the connection screw and insert are long and there is plenty of room to work with to grind/cut. Anyone that can complete an 80% shouldn't have a problem resizing these screws a few mm. These will do the job and lock up tight, as they did on mine.
No one is perfect and no one gets every cut right every time. :) Therefore I'm including the extra pin and screw for DIY mistake wiggle room.
I can also supply washers and 2 pins to lock them up without grinding/cutting.
The biggest issues I've seen with 80% builds (And experienced) are improperly sized holes or misaligned holes. Both will cause the pins to migrate and fall out. Especially when fast firing. Other people like these pins because they say the friction and grind from movement and heat from a lot of fire can bore out and warp the receivers. I haven't experienced that personally but I do feel it might be an issue with the polymer lowers after quite a bit of use. Either way these screws will lock into place and not alow the pins to migrate or roll at a great price."

To commemorate this shotguns silver anniversary Benelli has created this special edition shotgun. This anniversary edition Super Black Eagle II is the same gun that has created such a following with a couple of premium upgrades. These upgrades include a corrosion-resistant brushed nickel bolt for more protection from the elements and an oversized bolt handle and bolt release for better manipulation in less than ideal conditions. This shotgun also features a 28in Crio-treated barrel fitted with an elongated red-bar front sight and mid barrel bead sight for quick target acquisition.The SBE II revolutionary Inertia-Driven System allows for quick, reliable and comfortable shots every time. It allows this shotgun the ability to shoot the heavy 3 ½ inch shells and still reliably cycle much softer loads that would turn other operating systems into a single shot shotgun. The light recoil that this shotgun offers is also due to the ComfortTech gel pad and gel comb inserts that reduce felt recoil up to 48 percent. After 25 years this shotgun is still one of the most sought after waterfowl guns on the market.

This rifle is perfect for someone looking for a plinker, target shooting, cowboy action, or just about anything you could want from a .22!  It's rugged, it's got a nice smooth action, it feels well built, and it shoots straighter than I can.  It's practically new-in-box. (I can even provide the box that it came in if you would like) We have shot the gun a grand total of around 10 times, but have put about 300 rounds through it.  I've never had any failures to fire, and never had any feed or extraction problems. The manual and website states that the gun has a 14 round capacity but I've been able to squeeze 15 +1 into the rifle's tubular magazine.  All-in-all, I would say this is the perfect gun for just about anybody looking for a nice simple .22, with the added bonus of being extremely fun to operate with that lever action.
 
I would like to try to get rid of it relatively quickly for convenience's sake, but I would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have.  Asking 250 OBO.  If this posting is up, I still have it! I'm also including about 200 rounds of .22 with the gun!"

The Marlin Model 795 is a great little rugged .22, with just about as much customizability and functionality as a Ruger 10/22 at about a third of the price!  This model comes with the black synthetic plastic stock and one ten-round magazine.  I originally purchased this gun with the intention of doing an Appleseed event with it, but never wound up getting the time or money to do so, but it would make an excellent option for a shooter looking to do exactly this with just a few simple modifications, such as adding tech sights and a sling mount. 
 
I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with this rifle, it's been a very reliable shooter, and will hit anything you point it at each time you pull the trigger.  I've been very meticulous with cleaning and oiling on it, so you won't find a spot of rust or neglect on it.  It's essentially as it came out of the box.  I'm asking $125 for the rifle and the mags OBO.  If you're quick I have a box full of .22 that I can also throw in with the rifle since I won't have a use for it any more.  If you have any questions about the rifle please don't be afraid to send me a message."

This gun does have several scratches but those are just surface scratches... Just cosmetic... You will only see them in the light. Every used AR 15 has scratches. I'm asking $550.00 NO trades. If you have questions, let me know and I will get back to you STAT. ALL SALES ARE FINAL... I know you will not have a problem with this guns performance at all."

CW pistols have a stainless steel slide that gives the pistol a rectangular slide profile and is finished with single-line slide markings. The striker-fired CW40 is a locked breech, passive striker block design with a Browning-style recoil lug. Despite the CW40's durable construction, it weighs only 16.8 ounces. A thin, textured polymer grip fits your hand comfortably while the drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and the pinned polymer blade front sight create a precise and accurate sighting profile. Each CW40 has a black polymer frame.""Looking to move to a 9mm so my loss is your gain at this price. I will only do a legal sale in NC with the original copy of your NC pistol purchase permit. Looking for cash only, but will consider a trade. I have a legal pistol purchase permit as well."

This is a &lt;0.25 moa rifle set up for 1,000-yard competitions.<br><br>This custom built rifle was built by one of the sports most decorated champions and has his signature chambering in 6mm BR. At the core of the rifle is a Savage dual port stainless steel action with a 30” Krieger barrel with a straight taper 1.25” diameter barrel at a 1-8 twist. A 20 moa rail sits on top to allow for long-range optics. An adjustable Rifle Basix trigger (4-ounce to 3-pound) set for an 8-ounce release with zero creep has been installed. The masters at Gre-Tan Rifles worked the bolt to insure the absolute most consistent primer strike. The entire package sits in an incredibly beautiful laminate real wood stock. I attached a cheek weld on the butt stock that insures consistent eye relief and height for the scope. The rifle will come with a hardshell rolling case and the custom Redding reloading dies.<br><br>I selected the Sightron SIII SS 10-50x60 Side Focus Long Range Riflescope with fine crosshairs and extended sunshade for the task of reaching out and touching that target for its quality and value.<br> <br>As I stated, I am leaving the hobby so I will be grouping everything to be sold individually or as a group, or as a 100% turnkey ready to compete setup.<br><br>I am one of those people who never scrimps when it comes to anything I do. F Class competition shooting was no exception. In the Competition Group, I am including everything you need to be competitive on the firing line. The flagship of this setup is the custom built front rest from Targetshooting. This is a 25-pound rest and is capable of micro-adjustments and is incredibly solid, matched with one of Bruno’s Shooting Supply/Edgewood leather rear bag that weighs in at about 10-pounds. This combination makes for an incredibly stable and repeatable shooting platform. Laying in the dirt or on a cement firing line is made much more comfortable with a padded trifold shooting mat. The one skill that separates good shooters from great shooters is their ability to read the wind. One of the most important methods of reading the winds is the ability to read the heat waves at intermediate ranges. To do this, most competitive shooters use a spotting scope on a tripod focused to these intermediate ranges.<br><br><b>Rifle Group</b><br>Custom Built Competition Rifle (Including Hardshell Rolling Case and custom Redding reloading dies) $2,300<br>Sightron SIII SS 10-50x60 Side Focus Long Range Riflescope with fine crosshairs and extended sunshade $1,000<br><b>Total Rifle Group $3,300 ($3,200 if purchased as a group)</b><br><br><br><b>Competition Group</b><br>Targetshooter custom front rest $700<br>Bruno’s Shooting Supply/Edgewood Leather Rear Bag $125<br>Padded Shooting Mat $75<br>Spotting Scope with height adjustable tripod stand $150<br><b>Total Competition Group $1,050 ($950 if purchased as a group)</b><br><br><br><b>Turnkey</b> <br>Rifle Group $3,300<br>Competition Group $1,050<br><b>Total Turnkey Option $4,350 ($4,000 if purchased as a group)</b>"
