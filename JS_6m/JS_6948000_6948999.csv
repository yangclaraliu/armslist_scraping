Comes with Hogue Rosewood grips and the original wood grips that the previous owner messed up trying to carve finger grooves in them. Also comes with case and two 13 round mags. The mag safety has been professionally removed so the trigger is much improved and there is no hangup with the mags dropping free.  It's in very good condition with just a tiny bit of holster wear on the edges and a couple small spots, barely notiecable on either. THis is probably the best Feg I've owned of the four that I""ve had, hate to sell but something has come up so need the cash, the price of 400 cash though is firm.

It was all I could afford).  I added a molded Blackhawk pistol grip, aluminum Blackhawk quadrail, and a base plate with a right handed single point carry loop.  I put a Vortex Strikefire 2 red/green dot sight with an optional Vortex VMX-3T magnifier on it a year or two back.  It also has flip up 45 degree back up iron sights.  And to top it off, I have an HFire green laser and light combo with a pressure switch on the foregrip.  I would sell it with seven (7) 30-round magazines (3 pmags, 4 aluminum) and approximately 150 rounds of .223.  I have the original pistol grip and plastic handguards if you want them.  It would also come with a Voodoo Tactical case. The hardware, optics, case, and ammunition are a large chunk of the value (over $800 brand new).  Everything is in perfect condition, with the exception of a few cosmetic scratches.  It has primarily served as a range and hunting weapon, and has seen a few 3-gun competitions.  Everything about the action is perfect, well-maintained, and clean.  I have never had it jam or misfire.  It would make a perfect starter AR, and I would recommend for anyone that wants an instantly ready and customizable AR."

The rifle still looks darn impressive for a 75 year old service rifle. The barrel is 26 3/4 inches to the end of the muzzle break. The bluing is in very nice condition and the bore is excellent with a shiny surface and sharp lands. The bolt has been refinished and has a nice bronze color finish. The front sight is a hooded post. The rear sight is a “U” notch blade assembly attached to a sliding elevator that is marked from 1 – 15. The magazine is a modern replacement. The LOP (Length of pull) measures 13 inches from the front of the trigger to the back of the butt plate. It comes with a stock butt plate. This type of rifle was featured on Season 1 Episode 1 of the History Channel’s Top Shot television show. The Tokarev SVT 40 rifle was used during the very first challenge the contestants were involved in. Here is a chance to own a piece of firearms history. The rifle was made during WWII by the Russians and was probably used to kill Nazis. Later it was captured by the Finnish Army during the Continuation War and was probably used to kill Russians. It was eventually imported to the United States where it was made a part of television history on the appropriately named History Channel... Mint rifle and don't miss you by. I would ship...

I have the family name and they lived in west Texas and had property in Columbus N.M. and were there during the Poncho Villa Raid and had picture of dead bandits and bullet pock marked walls in the town that I have somewhere.The fine old colt likely gave pretty good protection from the Mexican Bandits of that era! The pictures do the talking here and I do have the factory letter on this gun that shows the ""type of stocks"" as unlisted. But look close at the pictures these have been on the gun since new and are in fact stuck the back strap! I will not force them off to see if they are #ed, as the fit is too close and I just know something will chip or break if I start pushing and tapping on the wood to separate it from the back strap! all in all a historic old Single Action with beautiful salty looks and fine tight action and bore! ----- PLEASE ALLOW up to 7 days for shipment to occur after payment arrives to me"

This is a very nice model 81 in 300 Savage, the most powerful cartridge in this series of rifles. It has the RARE Kreiger magazine conversion that is highly desirable. It allows the magazine to be removed by the push of a button. These rifles originally had a fixed magazine that had to be loaded from the top. This is a takedown rifle. Remove the forend and unscrew the barrel assembly screw to separate the action and barrel assembly for compact storage or traveling. It has a set of Jaeger quick detachable sling swivels. They were one of the first to offer such an accessory and is period correct for this rifle. The rifle functions great and looks better. The blueing is excellent. The only wear is on the top of the barrel jacket just in front of the receiver. The buttstock has the serial number stamped on it under the top tang, so it is the factory wood. The checkering on the rifle appears to me to be aftermarket, but it is very well done. The pistol grip has a black cap with white line spacer. The wood is very solid. There is a chipped out piece on the upper tang where it meets the action tube. It does not effect function at all. Those are the two detractions from an otherwise wonderful and excellent example of a Kreiger Conversion Remington Model 81 in the powerful 300 Savage.WI'll include approximately 50 rounds of new factory ammo and some brass. I have a C&R license and Will require a bill of sale.Local sales only."

The heat sink barrel nut dissipates heat quicker than any system on the market. The Dictator 9-position adjustable gas block, with straight gas tube, let’s you tune this rifle to be as smooth and flat shooting as possible, no matter the ammo load out. At this price, and even well beyond it, you simply will not find features like this on any other rifle. The 14.5” Renegade rail with M-LOK compatibility and 4 integrated QD slots provides maximum comfort, hand placement, and accessory mounting options. Topped off with a 16.5” nitride heat treated barrel, you have a 1 MOA guaranteed rifle suited for any patriot."

I've put about 100 rounds through it. It's a great gun and easy for CCW but I've decided that I want to consolidate my calibers so I'm looking to move this one and a few others. This is a one owner gun. It has the factory laser with solid and strobe. Two magazines-one six round and one seven round (I still have the original guts to include if you want them.) Trigger and hammer have been upgraded with RTK from Galloway precision. Still have original trigger/hammer for you as well. Facotry case as well as a pocket holster and if I can find it, a pocket clip (for clipping onto your pocket like a knife.) Finally, I have 899 rounds of ammo to get rid of...assorted, hollow point, ball, etc. At this point, I'm only looking for trades and I'm really only interested in 45ACP. Keep in mind, I have a lot of ammo here and no, I won't trade the gun without the ammo as the ammo is useless to me without a gun to fire it. So your trade value should be on par with almost 900 rounds of ammo and a customized 380. If it isn't, I just won't reply. No need to be rude. But no-I won't trade for your M&P 45 since I can buy one new for under $300. Glock, Kimber, H&K, Springfield, etc. If you have something worth more, I can add cash. If yours is worth less, I'll take cash on top. I'm very easy to work with but I'm not desperate. Worst case scenario I'll keep it. VA residents only. VA DL/ID and CCP or I'm not doing business with you. I can meet in Alexandria, VA or near Mt. Jackson as I spend time in both locations."

The sights were over $200 installed with return shipping, but they're perfect. I do not have the original sights.  I have the original Kimber OEM USA Shooting Team grips, which have never been used.  It also has a EGW (Evolution Gun Works) barrel bushing & recoil spring plug. There have zero internal or mechanical modifications to the original firearm.  I run my own light ammo through this, and it is a very soft shooting 45. This pistol has less than 300 rounds through it, and was always cleaned after each use and kept in a climate controlled safe.  This is a 99.9% flawless example, and has been absolutely flawless in operation and accuracy.
