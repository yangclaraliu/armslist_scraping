I can text pictures of that if you'd like. .07 cents is the going rate for ammo so no I won't sell it cheaper. unless you want all 10,000+ rounds for $700 cash we may be able to make a deal.

I don't want to part with all of it but willing to part with a lot of it for .07 cents a round. Thats less than what I paid being most of it had to be shipped to me as well. I can text pictures of that if you'd like. .07 cents is the going rate for ammo so no I won't sell it cheaper. unless you want all 10,000+ rounds for $700 cash we may be able to make a deal.

It has served my wife well as a carry weapon but I would like to free up some space so it's time to sell it. It's a fun shooter and is in great shape minor holster wear. Always meticulously cleaned even after shooting even 20 rounds. Owned the gun for about 2 years and I would say we took it to the range four or five times.  so it's got plenty of life left in it. It comes with two seven round magazines and a holster. Because we live in Massachusetts  the LC9  comes from the factory with a magazine safety .  That safety has been disabled  on this particular  LC9 . I MAY still have the part on my work bench and could reinstall it  if necessary .  But just know that  in case it's a deal breaker for you. It's a very non intrusive modification. There are actually tons of YouTube videos on the subject if you wanted to get an idea of what who was done too the handgun.  I might be able to throw in a box of ammo if I have an extra .  I'm asking 375. I'm open to trades but it would have to be a mil surp of some sort. Not really interested in newer stuff. I don't think it would happen but  I'm also interested in a Beretta 92fs .  All local and federal laws will be followed must have class A LTC.  FTF okay. FFL at your expense
