Included: Several magazines, cleaning kit, original Cugir factory target from Romania from the test fire and brochure. The cleaning rod and short 3 round (?) rare magazine are still in the sealed plastic bag and paper wrap. No sales where prohibited, no trades. No sales to HI and AK must pay actual shipping. USPS money orders only for payment. Shipping with insurance fixed at $100.00 and I will pay the rest.
OK Keyboard cowboys: I have a real job with a security clearance. So I ship all of my guns 01 FFL to 01 FFL with insurance. Period. The shipping cost and insurance costs for $40-$50.00. These larger, heavy long guns in excess of $1000 cost me $125-175 to sell, ship and insure. I am paying these fees on every auction, whether its a $400 Maadi or the $2000 Colt SAA. When you guys actually own nice stuff and sell it maybe you will then be good at math. DO NOT bid if you don't like my shipping and insurance costs. Emailing me telling me how awesome you are and how cheap you can ship a gun you don't own really makes you look ignorant. Math, use it ! :o)"
