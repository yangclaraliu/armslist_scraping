This unit was stationed in an armory at FT Bragg, NC. The US ARMY used this unit for securing Rifles, Pistols, NVGs, Optics, and Ammunition Cans. It comes with a rifle and pistol support rack which with supports that can be moved around for different firearms heights as shown in the pictures below. Has two pistol rods to hang pistols on and 10 rifle holders. All Marvel Corp UWR units meet both OPNAVINST 5530.13C and AR190-11 security requirements. I have versions of this unit in my very own gun room. This unit is fully welded and measures 45""x42""x16"". Cabinet can be ganged from the top, bottom, sides, or rear of other cabinets. It has bi-fold retractable doors that prevent blocking aisles or neighboring racks and maximizes efficiency of the issuance of weapons and gear. The secure construction incorporates perforated doors sides and cabinet back to ensure visibility of items inside at all times. Great for doing inventory checks. Retractable locking bars exceed military requirements for arms security of conventional arms, ammunitions and explosives. All accessories that come into contact with the weapons are either powder-coated, vinyl dipped, rubber or thermoplastic-coated, or made from polymers to ensure that weapons are safe from damage in transportation.This unit was part of a auction that I drove down to FT Bragg to pick up. I had a few of these last year and they were very popular. I have 7 similar UWRs as well as a 61"" tall unit with a shelving combo listed on this very website as well as armslist and craigslist. There are minor scratches from being moved around in an armory but as you can tell from the pictures below they aren't noticeable and the units are in excellent shape. No dents, dings or broken parts. Completely operational. The US Army manifest states that this cabinet was over 1 thousand dollars brand new, I will include manifest in sale. MARVEL CORP DOES NOT SELL THESE UNITS TO CIVILLIANS. I am listing this UWR for $250. I travel quite often so I will include free delivery 50 miles within 23462. Further distances are possible and can be discussed. Feel free to PM me with any questions.

Disclaimer:
ALL EMAILS ASKING IF ITEM IS STILL AVAILABLE WILL BE IGNORED!!! I am meticulous about taking items off the website when they are sold. SO, if it is on here, it is either for sale or it is on its way out the door!
I do not have to sell these guns and accessories! This is not a fire sale. I just have too many guns and equipment sitting unused in gun safes and I want to downsize. No low ball offers will be accepted, nor even replied to!
I get my prices by shopping local stores and websites. So, I have priced my items fairly and you will get a good deal. You will NOT get a great deal! Refer to ""not a fire sale!""
Do not bother to email me and tell me you can buy it cheaper elsewhere, save us both some time and just go buy it then. I don’t care that your brother, uncle, cousin, girlfriend’s – sister’s- cousin twice removed bought the same thing last year at half the price. If that is so, they got a great deal – you will not!
I do not have an FFL, so all transactions are private party sales
Prefer local face to face buyer, have office in central Billings location to meet at.
I will ship, buyer pays ALL costs. All applicable laws will be followed to the letter.
Cash only – no checks, charges, credit cards, payments, cashier’s checks, or promises of riches from a Nigerian prince, nor will I ""hold-it"" so you can run home and get ""permission"". If you don’t have ""permission"" and cash, don’t waste my time.

ALL EMAILS ASKING IF ITEM IS STILL AVAILABLE WILL BE IGNORED!!! I am meticulous about taking items off the website when they are sold. SO, if it is on here, it is either for sale or it is on its way out the door!
I do not have to sell these guns and accessories! This is not a fire sale. I just have too many guns and equipment sitting unused in gun safes and I want to downsize. No low ball offers will be accepted, nor even replied to!
I get my prices by shopping local stores and websites. So, I have priced my items fairly and you will get a good deal. You will NOT get a great deal! Refer to ""not a fire sale!""
Do not bother to email me and tell me you can buy it cheaper elsewhere, save us both some time and just go buy it then. I don’t care that your brother, uncle, cousin, girlfriend’s – sister’s- cousin twice removed bought the same thing last year at half the price. If that is so, they got a great deal – you will not!
I do not have an FFL, so all transactions are private party sales
Prefer local face to face buyer, have office in central Billings location to meet at.
I will ship, buyer pays ALL costs. All applicable laws will be followed to the letter.

Bought for my wife - she wasn't interested!
Had big plans to shoot together but . . . . .
So it sat in my gun cabinet - time to let it go.
Check out my listing for 9MM ammunition and componets - AMAZING!!!
I am selling (2) 9MM pistols and I have a box of ammo with 12 rounds used!
So this pistol has less than 12 rounds out of it.
I don't believe it has ever been fired but I won't swear to it.
Nice pistol in hard case

ALL EMAILS ASKING IF ITEM IS STILL AVAILABLE WILL BE IGNORED!!! I am meticulous about taking items off the website when they are sold. SO, if it is on here, it is either for sale or it is on its way out the door!
I do not have to sell these guns and accessories! This is not a fire sale. I just have too many guns and equipment sitting unused in gun safes and I want to downsize. No low ball offers will be accepted, nor even replied to!
I get my prices by shopping local stores and websites. So, I have priced my items fairly and you will get a good deal. You will NOT get a great deal! Refer to ""not a fire sale!""
Do not bother to email me and tell me you can buy it cheaper elsewhere, save us both some time and just go buy it then. I don’t care that your brother, uncle, cousin, girlfriend’s – sister’s- cousin twice removed bought the same thing last year at half the price. If that is so, they got a great deal – you will not!
I do not have an FFL, so all transactions are private party sales
Prefer local face to face buyer, have office in central Billings location to meet at.
I will ship, buyer pays ALL costs. All applicable laws will be followed to the letter.
Cash only – no checks, charges, credit cards, payments, cashier’s checks, or promises of riches from a Nigerian prince, nor will I ""hold-it"" so you can run home and get ""permission"". If you don’t have ""permission"" and cash, don’t waste my time.

Do not bother to email me and tell me you can buy it cheaper elsewhere, save us both some time and just go buy it then.

Accuracy kind of surprised me on paper with Wolf 123? grain HPs and I would mess around and whack the 300 yard 12''x24"" plate I have pretty easily. Frankly its kind of obnoxiously loud even with the Omega and I find myself not hauling it to my range.It has been painted in Alumahyde II Coyote Tan, which is pretty durable paint but is also very easily removable with some commercial auto stripper.Located in Central Texas near Austin, would prefer face to face but would be willing to ship from my FFL to yours and probably split the shipping costs.May be interested in trades involving a CZ Scorpion EVO or a Glock 19 MOS plus a Jpoint but can't hurt to make me an offer[b]$900[/b]Paypal F&F preferred or +3%, MO also accepted and obviously cash"

It has a long-straight solid aluminum trigger that breaks at a glass smooth 3.8 lbs.  It is equipped with Trijicon/Novak 3-dot tritium sights.  The match grade bushing-less bull barrel has been cut and crowned flush.  It has perfectly blended VZ Operator grips in Hyena Brown and another perfectly blended VZ Operator II grips in black and the entire pistol has been finished in black Ion Bond.  It has been fired 50 times to ensure proper fit and to check function, otherwise the gun is as new.  This pistol comes with three Wilson Combat 8 round magazines, a hard case, and a Streamlight TLR-1 HL.  Essentially this is built exactly as a Ed Brown LW Kobra Carry but with a full rail and a couple of extras.  There is more than $2200 in this gun; I know that I will not get my full investment back but I think it's a good deal at $1500."

We BUY, SELL, TRADE and LOANS on firearms and more. Striker fired pistols are becoming an important segment worldwide for the Military & Law Enforcement sector. The Beretta APX, utilizing a removable, serialized chassis frame, can be easily modified with a replaceable grip frame housing and is simple to disassemble and maintain. The lightweight frame housing is made of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The APX’s extremely low profile and snag free design make it easy to carry and draw from a holster. Ease of use was the key driver in the development of the APX. A slide catch lever is located on both sides of the frame. The operating/locking system is based on a tilt-barrel, locked breech. Beretta APX pistols have a unique feature that allows the user to deactivate the internal striker mechanism prior to disassembly. This means the pistol can be field stripped without pulling the trigger. The Trigger Safety stops the trigger from traveling rearward through inertia, in the event the pistol is dropped. When the trigger is intentionally pulled, the Trigger Safety is instantly deactivated. The high-definition 3-dot sight system is designed for quick target acquisition. The new sight system, patented by Beretta, allows the user to adjust both front and rear sights. The sights can be removed for replacement with other types of sights. Thanks to a newly patented modular system, the pistol adapts to different hand sizes with interchangeable back-straps of different thickness and configuration for individualized performance. The pistol comes with a standard Picatinny rail (MIL STD 1913) under the barrel. Frame safety, magazine safety, and a loaded chamber indicator are available on request. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the APX’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. Specifications: Caliber: 9 x 19 mm ( 9mm ) Weight Unloaded: 27 ounces Barrel Length: 4.25 in.

Any planet. This inside the waistband holster, now available for both semi-automatics and revolvers, is the next evolution within the Cloak Tuck Series, providing concealed carriers with improved retention, enhanced flexibility and superior comfort. IWB concealed carry holsters have never felt this good. Engineers at Alien Gear Holsters have added an ultra-strong stainless spring-steel core into the Cloak Tuck 3.0. This advanced holster material delivers more retention and durability to this holster base, allowing for years of hard use without breakage. This, coupled with a new layer of ballistic nylon, provides more strength and support to the Cloak Tuck 3.0 inside the waistband holster. We have also evolved our surface material into an engineered thermo-elastomer 'Alien Skin' texture, which enhances holster retention, drag and durability. To enhance the comfort of this inside the waistband handgun holster, we have minimized the hardware by adding more neoprene to the Cloak Tuck 3.0. This ultra-soft material will form to your side, while dispersing the weight of your pistol across the entire concealed carry holster base. The flexible 'holster wings' will also mold perfectly to your side. To customize your holster comfort, we have made it easy for you to adjust your Cloak Tuck 3.0's cant (angle) and ride height by simply relocating the holster clips provided. Our engineers have also made it possible for you to customize the holster retention to your gun with the turn of a few screws. All holster shells within the Cloak Tuck Series are fully swappable. Our Cloak Tuck 3.0 inside the waistband holster is backed by an Iron-Clad Triple Guarantee. This includes a 30-Day Test Drive, free shell trades for life, and a Forever Warranty. If anything on your holster breaks for any reason, Alien Gear Holsters will repair or replace it for free. The award-winning Cloak Tuck 3.0 IWB Holster is now protected by an official United States patent. This comfortable and concealable inside the waistband gun holster earned its official patent by utilizing an original steel core insert within a multi-layered design. As of April 5, 2016, patent # US 9,301,595 B2 protects the “multi-layered holster,” which includes the usage of the supportive and innovative spring-steel core. WARNING Please do not wear your IWB holster at the 6:00 (small of back) position. This location could result in personal injury if you were to fall backwards..
