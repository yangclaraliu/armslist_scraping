The gun is a Remington R1 Enhanced that has been tuned and customized by Advanced Armament Corp (who makes some of the best silencers in the world). The slide has advanced armament branding, and has their skull and cross guns symbol laser engraved on the side. The grips are special edition AAC G10 Hogue, with the frag texture. This pistol is optimized for use with silencers. It comes with a threaded barrel and tall sights that extend above the silencer. This is one of the most accurate and reliable pistols I've ever shot. This one has just barely been broken in with about 350 rounds through it, not a single malfunction. 
This pistol comes with two 8 round magazines. I do not have a box, but I have a zippered padded pouch I'll throw in.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions whatsoever. Thanks for looking!
I am NOT interested in any trades. 
 
To cover all the features, here's an excerpt from a review of this gun from tactical-Life.Com:
 
""To set the R1 Enhanced Threaded Barrel apart from its siblings, it sports several refinements. The first differences you’ll notice when handling the pistol are the extra-high front and rear sights. These sights are well built and capable of maintaining their zero with hard use. The sights are set up in a two-stacked-dot configuration for fast targeting.

Also differing from a run-of-the-mill 1911 are the pistol’s front and rear slide serrations. These square-cut serrations have a forward slant that roughly matches the pistol’s grip angle. Care taken in the finishing process to not round off the edges of the broad serrations gives them a bold look and full functionality. The rear portion of the ejection port also has had some metal relieved to improve ejection, and a small port on top that, when viewed from above, allows shooters to see if the chambered is loaded.The grip safety is enhanced with a beavertail extension, and it has the nice added feature of what Remington calls a “checkered memory bump” that maintains the same 20-lines-per-inch (lpi) checkering on the mainspring housing. The frontstrap is serrated, and the wood laminate grip panels are checkered. The left-side panel features a thumb groove for a right-handed shooter. The R1 Enhanced Threaded Barrel pistol also has a beveled magazine well for fast reloads, and it comes from the factory with two 8-round magazines fitted with bumper pads.
The anodized aluminum, match trigger is the extended type, and it’s also skeletonized to reduce weight. From the factory, the trigger breaks at 3.5 pounds with a small amount of creep and overtravel. The thumb safety is upgraded with a little more length and width, and it functions well for those with larger hands. The pistol also features a lightweight, skeletonized hammer.
At the heart of every good pistol is a good barrel, and the R1 Enhanced Threaded Barrel features a match-grade, stainless steel barrel that is 5 inches long. It’s held in place with a stainless steel bushing. Again, the barrel is threaded, and it comes with a thread protector.

The fit and finish of the R1 Enhanced Threaded Barrel is on par with many custom Model 1911s I’ve tested. 
 
The R1 Enhanced Threaded Barrel boasts enough upgrades to satisfy most shooters, and the capability to attach suppressors promises quiet, fun shooting. Its accuracy is noteworthy, and it’s certainly worth the $1,140 price tag."""

The XD-S® Single Stack  from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.
The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.
The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use"
