The factory record of serial numbers were destroyed in the war, but all historical accounts put this revolver at either late-1915 or early-1916. This is not a replica. This is a WWI infantry-issued service pistol that's still 100% functional and actually in really good condition for being 101-102 years old. 
This is chambered in 8mm Lebel Revolver, and I'm including a bit of brass and the dies to go with it. The bullets are readily available on most large supply sites or directly from Fiochi. If you don't reload, the ammo itself is offered in limited runs every two years on Midway, Ammoseek, BuffaloArms, and GrafAmmo. The other option is to go with .32-20 rounds, which chamber and fire just fine, but aren't historically accurate. I'm including some .32-20 brass as well.

Product Description Falling somewhere between the Scorpion Pistol and Carbine is this oddity. Strange though it may be, it’s perfectly set up for those who desire a two-stamp gun. The extended forend from the Carbine will hide most 9mm and hybrid cans, while offering M-LOK attachment points and boosting the sight radius a good deal. Still using the 7.7” barrel of the standard Scorpion Pistol, a 5” KAK Flash Can extends the barrel to just a hair past the forend. Dual threads of 18×1 and 1/2×28 make fitting a suppressor simple, and adding an arm brace or cheek rest is as easy as can be with our accessory adapter kit. Even simpler is the addition of the factory folding stock, assuming you can stomach the ATF’s current wait times. Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4″ sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants. The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.     SPECIFICATIONS         CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol w/ Flash Can        Product Name  CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol w/ Flash Can   SKU  91353   Firearm Type  Handgun   Purpose  Home Defense   MSRP  $949.00   Chambering  9mm Luger   Magazine Capacity  20+1   Magazine Type  Double stack polymer   Frame  Fiber-reinforced polymer   Grips  Polymer, adjustable for reach to trigger   Trigger Mech  SA   Sights  Low-profile fully adjustable aperture and post, 4 rear aperture sizes   Barrel  Cold hammer forged, muzzle threaded 18x1 right-hand and 1/2x28   Barrel Length  7.72   Weight  5.7 lbs   Overall Length  20.4 in   Height  9.4 in   Safety  Ambidextrous thumb safety"
