Sometimes it works great other times it doesn't.  I had a new sear put in and that didn't fix it. Appears to be in the trigger group.  This is the FEG PJK-9HP model made in Hungary. It's supposed to be the closest clone to the original and use original Browning parts.  I'm tired of messing with it and don't want to put anymore into it.

There are several arsenal repaired cracks throughout the wood, but the unrepaired crack that really caught my attention is a crack that goes all the way through the stock and the recoil lug. The recoil lug is loose in the wood as a result so the crack is function impairing in my opinion. As such, a potential buyer should beware and not try to shoot with the stock before repairing the crack. Other than the cracking in the stock, what you see is what you get. It comes with two barrel bands, the spring metal that holds them to the wood, and the bayonet lug. Please email with any questions or potential trades."

This semi-auto rifle is built for long-range: heavy 24″ bull barrel and heavy, factory metal 13″ handguard. Most of the rifles now come stock with the plastic hand guards; these 24″ A2 style AR-10(T)s are no longer made and to find one in this condition is rare.
This rifle is in great condition, and is the best gun I’ve ever owned. Unfortunately, it sits in the safe most of the time – I’ve owned it for years and only taken it out a handful of times.
It also comes with six 20-round Armalite factory magazines. These currently list on Armalite’s website for $35, but are perpetually out of stock; the lowest I could find a single one of these on the web for sale is $45, so to grab 6 with this package is a steal.
The scope is a Leupold Vari-X III 6.5-20x40mm long-range optic, mounted with top-end NightForce scope ring mounts.
Bipod is a Harris Ultralight, high quality. Will also include a hardshell carrying/protective case.
Finally, I have several hundred rounds of ammo as well, if interested.

I am the original owner, and it has been well cared for as I spent over $3000 on it. It is a Feb-March of 2014 build and has seen 425 rounds fired through it (25-230gr golden saber, 50-federal 230gr HST, 350- American Eagle 230gr FMJ) and it is a smooth shooter. It does have some holster wear from carrying. It has all the orginal paperwork and the orginal grey nylon case. It will come with the 2 orginial magazines. The gun is still tight and the bushing can be taken down by hand which shows the build quality that these Wilson 1911's have. Upgrades I got on it were 3 dot night sights with orange rear and green front, tactial rail, and the barrel flush cut and crowned. I can only upload 3 pictures but will gladly email more if you are seriously interested.  Was $2550 now priced at $2350, serious buyers only, NO TRADES and no low ball offers. I would prefer a CCW or buyer be willing to sign a bill of sale. This is priced very well and has barely been used. Thank you for your time."
