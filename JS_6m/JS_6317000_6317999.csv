The Kel-Tec Sub-2000 GLK17 – 16.25″ Barrel .40SW is a semi-automatic rifle chambered for the 9mm Luger or .40 S&W cartridge. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000™ rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25 x 7 inches for ease of storage.
The polymer grip of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel. Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the SUB-2000™ forend for mounting compatible accessories. The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-LOK™ accessories.
The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter’s comfort. Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position. The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25″ wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories.
The SUB-2000™ features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into the cutout on the receiver. The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation."

It is the combo version that comes with the 28"" choke barrel and the 24"" rifled slug barrel. It is in very good condition and will include all the original accessories such as the choke tubes, choke removal tool, wooden dowel to limit magazine capacity for bird hunting, lock, and the original box as well. This was my very first firearm I purchased, and as a result it has been absolutely babied. It has seen VERY little use, which is also the reason I have decided to sell it.I have decided to sell it along with the custom case/bag I purchased from Bagmaster in St. Louis, MO. It opens like a book and has two pockets on the one side to hold the barrels, and a single larger pocket on the other side to hold the stock/receiver/magazine part of the shotgun. It has a pouch on the front of the case to hold misc. parts/tools/ammo/etc. It is really nice because it is much shorter in length than other cases which are designed for carrying the shotgun with the barrel attached, and it holds both barrels without them banging together.The choke barrel has the standard ""rib"" system for aiming, and the rifled slug barrel has adjustable sights for aiming. The top of the receiver is drilled and tapped for mounting a scope/red dot sight. This is nice because you can swap the barrels and not have to re-zero the scope. I have not personally mounted any kind of scope, but it could be easily done if you wanted to.I will also include 3 boxes of slugs (15 total slugs), I bought 5 boxes awhile ago and shot 2 of them for fun and then the remaining 3 boxes have just sat around since. So basically the rifled slug barrel has exactly 10 slugs shot through it. I am not sure exactly how many shells the choke barrel has, but I would guess somewhere around 300-400.Now on to the boring legal stuff:1. I will only sell to a person who has a valid FOID card. 2. Per new law, I will have to submit your FOID number to the ISP for validation prior to sale. They will issue an approval number confirming your FOID is valid.3. The 24 hour waiting period will be followed to the second.4. We will complete a comprehensive bill of sale that will include all the required information about buyer, seller, and the shotgun.5. I will accept cash only.Thank you for considering my listing and I look forward to speaking with you! Armslist limits each post to 3 pictures, however I would be happy to send more pictures via email upon request. Please no trade offers, I am looking to sell outright only at this time.- Kevin"

A lightweight, impact resistant polymer sporter stock and forend are checkered for comfortable control and include 3/4” sling mounts. Less than 100 rounds through it, used once and realized that I didn't really like it. Purchased in 2006, never got around to selling it, been collecting dust in my safe so I figured I'd give it a new home. Cycles reliably and cleanly on buckshot or slugs, doesn't seem to much like target loads. I've read that there are ways to make it take target loads, but as I never really liked the gun, I never put the money into it, nor have I wanted to put enough rounds through it to wear in the recoil spring.

It has a 22 rd magazine and is a very fun way to throw some holes in paper.Built to replicate one of the most popular and well-made 9mm submachine guns in the world, the GSG-522 has earned a loyal following of its own. Similar in appearance and function to the famous MP5, the 522 is prized for its reliability and compact size. The Carbine variant is even lighter than the typical 522, weighing in at less than seven pounds. The rifle's barrel shroud is removable and its safety is ambidextrous to accommodate right- or left-handed shooters. The trigger pull is light and smooth. The sighting system consists of a traditional post front with an adjustable rear sight. 10-round magazine.

While it’s a double stack design, it’s not too thick to carry like so many of our competitors’ models. Measuring just 1.2 inches wide, it is barely wider than single stack pistols with far lower capacity.A pistol with a healthy sight radius is easier to shoot under stress, and that’s why we’ve chosen to fit the Mod.2® Tactical Model with a full five-inch hammer forged carbon steel barrel. It’s treated with Melonite® to stand up to moisture, sweat, and other undesirable conditions over the long haul.The slide takes most of the day to day wear and tear, so we’ve made sure to construct that from Melonite®-treated carbon steel too. While we always recommend properly caring for your handgun, the Mod.2® Tactical isn’t one that will require babying. This combat-ready gun is designed to be used, not left in the safe.Fast and accurate shooting requires control, so we’ve included all of the Mod.2® enhancements. Springfield High Hand™ grip near the beavertail and below the trigger guard allow you to put support close to the bore line to minimize muzzle flip. The new GripZone® contours and texturing are specifically designed to provide maximum purchase at specific points where your hands and fingers require the most contact. Three different textures provide the friction needed without painful overkill.All firearms will be sold at Coast To Coast Pawn and require an ATF/FDLE background check for approval of the purchase.  There is tax and a $5 FDLE fee on top of the listed price.  Other rules and restriction will apply as required by ATF and the State of Florida.  For Example,  a manditory 3 Business Day Hold is required for Non CWP Holders purchasing a Hand Gun.
