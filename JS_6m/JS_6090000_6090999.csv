I am selling my 4.5"" barrel xdm 40sw with a powder river precision trigger, some upgraded internals, fiber optic front sight, 2 mags, and the nice box and other things that the xdm comes with. I want to buy a bolt action rifle so I am selling this to pay for one.This gun shoots amazingly. The xdm comes with a match grade barrel and is great for competitive shooting. The PRP trigger that has been installed has a very light trigger pul and has an overtravel stop on it. The original trigger and other internals that were replaced are included if you would rather have it stock, although I dont know why someone would. It has a talon grip on it which feels really nice, but can be removed if you dont like it. Im selling this for $500 face to face. Thats cheaper than it would cost to buy just the xdm without any of the upgrades. The trigger upgrade alone costs over $100.edit: The 9mm conversion barrel in the picture is not included, Im selling that separately with two 9mm mags for $125, but if you want the gun and the conversion barrel/mags Ill do it for $600 total"

This is my grab and go rig for my AR15. I picked it up in a trade deal, loaded it up with seven magazines and med kit and set it next to the gun safe. It's never been out of the house. It could pass as new but it is being listed as a used item. It comes with a matching Eagle Industries two cell magazine pouch that will accomodate two P mags per pouch for a total of four. There is also a velcro closed compartment built into the body of the rig that will accomodate three additional magazines. Also included is a matching Eagle Industries khaki canteen pouch that has been mounted to carry a medical kit. Everything is assembled and ready to go or you could remove the pouches, move them around or replace them with whatever MOLLE accessories you like. This is a great rig for carrying a basic ammo load for your carbine and some medical gear. It rides nice and flat through the shoulder area so when wearing a patrol pack or rucksack you don't even notice it's there.I like the rig and would be ok keeping it. I'm just feeling nostalgic and want to put together an ALICE rig like the one I carried in the Infantry in the eighties. I'll sell for $125 or will trade for the right ALICE rig ie belt, Y straps, four mag pouches, two canteen pouches with 2 cups and 2 canteens (bonus cool points for NBC caps), Butt pack and two field dressing/compass pouches. USGI issue gear only no china crap I'll know the difference. I'd have no issue shipping this rig anywhere in the US if a deal were struck.

Wood stock is nice condition, few slight dings here and there with age and use. Very accurate rifle, I can hit squirrel sized targets at 200yds easily. Cycles/ejects great. Will shoot as fast as you can pull the trigger. I inherited this rifle from my grandfather 13 years ago, he purchased it brand new. The Model 36 is a fairly scarce model, not to be confused with the much more common Model 30. JC Higgins is only a house-brand used by Sears Roebuck, the rifle was actually manufactured by High Standard Inc. It has a milled forged aluminum receiver, the first model of .22 rifle to have aluminum instead of steel. Much nicer gun than any modern-day cheapo. $300 or best offer."

It does include the blue box which is in good condition and the screwdriver. The revolver is probably at 85% and I'm pretty critical, so likely better than that. Just a hint of bluing thinning at the muzzle and a few spots on the cylinder. No rust inside or out! It's a 4"" barrel and highly polished blue with the goncalo alves checkered target grips, serial #d to the revolver. The forcing cone is perfect and the timing and lock-up is the best of all I own. The grips have a bit of finish thinning but no chunks missing or giant gouges, etc. I can provide pictures of both, but really you need to see it to truly appreciate. email or text REDACTED for pics or questions. Include a telephone # or I will assume its spam.  Sorry but I've gotten alot of that lately, people call for pics and never hear from them again.

This one is in 9mm and I am the 2nd owner. It has been used but never abused, probably has had 500 to 600 rounds through it and was always cleaned after shooting.  The first owner did his own home-done (I'm assuming) full stipple job on the pistol. It is pretty aggressive and is not perfectly even, but is very functional.  It covers the full grip, the mag release, and index points for your pointer fingers. It was stippled with the medium backstrap which unfortunately is the only one that comes with the pistol, he had lost the small and large backstraps before I got it. As this was my girlfriend's car gun, it currently has one of the Hogue grip sleeves on it because she didn't like the stippling. Comes with the pistol, the Hogue sleeve, 2 - 17 round mags, a Galco paddle holster, and the factory case. I also have an older, mid 80's, INA Tiger 3"" blued 32 S&W Long 6-shot revolver that is in pretty good shape and runs like a top and around 30-40 rounds of ammo that I can also include for the right trade.Email or text me.

The rifle has exactly 200 rounds of quality, brass cased FMJ ammo through it. It was cleaned, lubricated and maintained extremely meticulously. It has seen one trip to the range. It functions flawlessly. Zero malfunctions of any kind. The rest of the time, it was a safe queen. I bought it new in early January 2013. It has a Surefire flash hider (FH762K05) on it. It was professionally installed. It will also come with the factory PWS muzzle brake that comes stock on the rifle. The rifle will also come with 4 FDE FN SCAR 17 magazines. One of the magazines was used and is in very good condition, the other three are in unused, new condition. It will ship in the original FN box and come with the manual and the FN lock that came with it. The only wear is very minimal and hard to notice, but it is on the front sling attachment ring (See picture). I included some other pictures of the interals so you could see what pristine condition the rifle is in. I am asking $3000, I pay shipping Payment by USPS MO or Cashier's Check only."
