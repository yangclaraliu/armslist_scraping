Hold on to your hats because there's a list a mile long of extras this one comes with. The 9 41 in the name indicates the two calibers this gun can shoot. 9mm and .41 Action Express. In order to do that, you have to have a .41 AE barrel, magazines, recoil spring guide rod Assembly and ammo. The ammo is the hardest to come by. I happen to have 50 rounds of IMI marked .41 in the 210gr flavor. I also have the correct guide rod with recoil spring(it's captured. Think Glock but not plastic). I also have 3 .41 AE mags and 2 9mm mags. This will also include a die set set up to reload the .41 AE round. All you'll need is a set of pistol primers, and some .41 magnum bullets. To cap it all off, I installed a brand new set of Meprolight night sites!! The ultimate set for any Jericho lover. These are some of the most comfortable guns around. And a plain joy to shoot. Made in Israel. Come get it for $500 cash. I'm located in Lexington but can meet within reason. This is a Big Bang for your buck. Feel free to call or text me with any questions. 803-521-64two5."

The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.   Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.   Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.   Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul® PMAG®."

it is either a 1998 or 1999 ,I'll check registration, it is the 4656-S but back when Mirro had a 40 HP rating on the boats, the new ones are 25 HP max and stick with that IMO, I had a 40 hp on it  it was excellent but honestly TOO FAST, that's a lot of tiller to hang onto.
the 25 worked better and was perfectly fine with three people. No Motor on it right now.
the trailer is a bunk model Karavan, model 1250-56,  I have one spare tire for it brand new, it has been sitting since last year, needs a good power washing.
I'm really struggling to get photos to post today this is the mirrocraft stock photo online, its very similar boat BUT with three bench seats and 16 foot length.
max is 6 people or 1100pounds, Pickup in Bennington, Vermont has a 1 7/8"" hitch size on it. ready to go!  No motor unless we do a motor deal too.?
