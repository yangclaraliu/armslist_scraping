Both eyes open operation allows full use of your peripheral vision. This allows you to quickly identify and acquire targets without leaving your sight picture. The C-MORE uses a 29mm beam-splitter lens made of glass, not plastic. The lens is hard coated for maximum scratch resistance while the parallax free design enables targets to be acquired without the need to center the dot in the lens. Basically, the dot can be located anywhere in the lens and it will represent the point of impact, even if the lens is shattered or obstructed. Bought for my EAA, Witness, Elite, Stock II, decided to have an adapter made for a Reflex instead.Will ship."

It will definitely go back onto another gas tube very smoothly, and without cracking. (Hell, bring your rifle, I'll even install it for you, no risk to you!!) The stock has both mounting screws, the sling swivel, and no trapdoor in the butt (no jokes,please!) The lower handguard obviously has the palm swell.   The wood is pretty nice,as is, but it's prime for a nice refinish job in Bulgarian yellow or Russian red, both of which are cheap and easy to do (I've done a bunch of them, tutorial is free!!)It has a factory-applied light clear coat, that sands off very easily, allowing easy staining. (or just keep it like it is, nothing wrong with that,either).Looking for $70 cash, or possibly a favorable trade for some .45 ammo.Thanks for looking......"

If you crunch the numbers on these holsters, this is a pretty competitive price. No problems with the gun, just grudgingly have to switch to a G19 for work.Prefer to not separate - holsters being worthless without the gun and so on.

Mostly interested in semi-autos, will consider others, depending.  Stripped lowers, nice AR/AK triggers, quality lightweight 12""-15"" AR rail and 12""+/- AR-10 rail.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers.  
AR uppers in 9mm with 5""-8"" barrel, 5.56 with 8""-10"" barrel and 7.62x39 with 8""-10"" barrel.  9mm lower, Law Tactical Gen 3-M, KAK Shockwave kits, side-charging upper receivers for 5.56 & 9mm.  New factory Glock 9mm 30+ round normal capacity mags.  I can get complete PSA and similar uppers shipped really cheap, but want to try and trade for some first.  No BCG needed on the 5.56.
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 & 7.62x39 reticles, other similar 1-6+x and 1-4x with nice clear glass and true 1x, QD mounts are a plus and some longer range scopes in 4-16x, 6-24x etc., needs to have good eye relief and clear glass.  I have some Nikon M-308 and M-223 4-16x I've picked up for around $300 in excellent condition and a little more with quality mounts.  I've been pleased with these, but open to others like Vortex etc.  Maybe nice micro red dots.  Not interested in online retail prices.Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX, FTF or I can ship to a legal TX resident for $20 more.  No lowballers, flakes or POS scammers!
Thanks for looking!"

$950 firm in cash or better in trade value.  Lots of trade offers so far, but nothing I'd rather have yet over this one yet.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, will consider others, depending.  Stripped lowers, nice AR/AK triggers, quality lightweight 12""-15"" AR rail and 12""+/- AR-10 rail.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers.  
AR uppers in 9mm with 5""-8"" barrel, 5.56 with 8""-10"" barrel and 7.62x39 with 8""-10"" barrel.  9mm lower, Law Tactical Gen 3-M, KAK Shockwave kits, side-charging upper receivers for 5.56 & 9mm.  New factory Glock 9mm 30+ round normal capacity mags.  I can get complete PSA and similar uppers shipped really cheap, but want to try and trade for some first.  No BCG needed on the 5.56.
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 & 7.62x39 reticles, other similar 1-6+x and 1-4x with nice clear glass and true 1x, QD mounts are a plus and some longer range scopes in 4-16x, 6-24x etc., needs to have good eye relief and clear glass.  I have some Nikon M-308 and M-223 4-16x I've picked up for around $300 in excellent condition and a little more with quality mounts.  I've been pleased with these, but open to others like Vortex etc.  Maybe nice micro red dots.  Not interested in online retail prices.Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  No lowballers, flakes or POS scammers!

Let's play ""Who is the moron"".  Here are your options:1. the idiot that lists on Armslist a used version of this firearm for $$$$ more than what I am asking for BNIB;2. the guy that pays that for the used one; or3. me for selling brand new fireams at such incredibly low prices.My wife picks #3 (but for totally unrelated reasons).With both a .22lr and .22 magnum cylinder, its like having two guns in one.  Born of the Traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the Legendary Single Action Army Revolver, only in a scaled down version. The Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic laminated grips, or white grips,  makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome. Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting. Let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. PROUDLY MADE IN OUR USA. All Heritage revolvers combine quality and affordability ... an American tradition. This has consistantly been one of the top selling handguns in the United States for the last 2 decades. They look great, they work great and they are at a great price. This is the perfect glove box or field carry revolver and just tons of fun to shoot.   It's affordable to own and inexpensive to shoot. What are you waiting for.....   Free layaway option available. Here is a short video I put together on this revolver: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjuGXzchMx4 I sell new firearms with full manufacter's warranties for less then many dealers are asking for used guns. The name of the game is inventory turnover. I am not looking for customers stupid enough to pay a sucker's price. Check everyone else's price, and then if you are serious about buying, give me a call. I have the lowest prices in the Greater Tampa Bay Area. You might find lower, but only if you are willing to travel to PullmyChain, North Dakota. I even beat most of the National Internet dealers, and will save you the cost of paying shipping and a transfer fee (assumes you are a local buyer)."

So far this gun has been very reliable for me, it has done well feeding 230 grain ball and 185 grain hollowpoints. Metal and bore in great shape. I have also bought a higher power recoil spring and it has a Wilson shok-buff so it shoots softer. The heavy recoil spring is not installed, I bought it because my plan was to use .45 super for deer hunting, but it never happened. The frame and slide are both heat treated so they are approved (even though the manufacturer says no) for higher pressure loads. If you don't believe me, go to Rowland's website where it will show that the Citadel is acceptable to handle the EVEN HIGHER pressures of the .460 Rowland.  anyways, I am looking for another 9 preferably one with a steel frame like the CZ75, hi-power, 2nd gen S&W, or even a 9mm 1911. Comes with Blackhawk Serpa Holster, case, sticky holster, 4 mags, and 20 rounds of 45 super. I would put the trade value at $500. I would consider selling, but I'd rather trade. pics available on request"

Accuracy International bottom metal kit, and trigger work done by gunsmith Jim Felton in Eugene, OR. George from Willamette Valley Gunsmithing (Veneta, OR) threaded the barrel in 5/8""x24tpi. The legenday Todd Koonce did the custom bolt handle (Salem, OR). This a proud rifle with roots in our NW community. Comes with a 5-round, and 10-round AI magazine.

I could easily list it for $1600 with all the work done on it, and we could haggle back and forth, but I don't want to do that. It's tiring, and what I want might get away. That being said, $1300 gets you this thousand yard gun. Just needs your choice of glass.

Own Mossberg’s innovative modular shotgun platform that allows you to quickly change configurations so a single gun can perform a variety of shooting tasks. Shotguns in the Flex 500 line feature the patent-pending Tool-less Locking System (TLS™). Based on the time-tested Mossberg 500 platform, TLS lets you switch the stock on this base hunting model with other stocks, forends and recoil pads that are part of the Flex series. Switch barrels too and you can convert one Flex 500 shotgun into tactical, waterfowling, turkey-hunting, clays-shooting and slug-gun configurations (extra stocks, barrels and accessories sold separately). This Flex 500 Hunting Model 12-gauge comes with a 24"" olive-drab green vent-ribbed barrel with adjustable fiber-optic sights. The nearly indestructible, all-weather synthetic stock features the TLS system and is decked out in Mossy Oak® Break-Up® Infinity™"

The .22 Remington Jet was developed jointly by Remington and S&W using a .357 magnum as the parent case and a .222 inch bullet. Muzzle velocity with a 40 grain bullet was reported to approach 2460 FPS with factory test loads. Actual realized performance with the 8 3/8 inch barrel is closer to 2000 FPS. The .22 Remington Jet is relatively simple to reload using either original Remington brass or .357 magnum brass.To provide for low mounting and clear line of sight through the Bushnell Magnum Phantom scope, the front and rear sights are removed on this example. The Phantom Scope has a fine crosshair reticle. The optics are clear. The exit pupil is designed to accommodate viewing from 6 inches to 21 inches. The scope features micrometer reticle adjustments. Bushnell dust caps.The left side of the barrel is marked “Smith & Wesson”. The right sideplate has the large “S&W” logo. The right side of barrel is marked “22 MAGNUM”. The right side of the frame is marked with the four line Marcas Registradas address. The yoke cut is marked “4K48606” and “MOD.53-2”. The yoke is marked “92878” and over stamped “A1O”. The bottom of the grip frame repeats the serial “4K48606”. The left side of the grip frame is marked with the number “92878”, large alpha-numeric “A1O”,”A1”, “06” . On the right side of the grip frame is the letter “L” inside a triangle, the letter “P” in a circle and what appears to be a small “x”.The bore is bright, smooth and the rifling sharp and deep. This firearm has light marks from firing and a light imprint on the recoil shield and firing pin bushing. The bore rates an Excellent.This collectible handgun has the case colored, deeply checkered, .400” semi-target hammer and the case colored, wide, polished trigger. Double action is smooth and definite, and single action break is light with no discernible creep. Frame mounted trigger stop is in place. Cylinder lockup is tight with minimum play. Action functions correctly. Barrel is pinned. We did not test fire this revolver.This Jet is manufactured with dual, “switchable” frame mounted firing pins for either centerfire or rimfire function.Fitted with checkered walnut or coco-bola grips with silver S&W medallions. Includes a Hunter Model 1100R oiled brown leather holster with soft suede interior and Hunter snap hold down strap.This M53 comes with 5 boxes of factory original Remington 40 grain ammunition in the green and yellow box configuration.Overall condition of this package is Very Good to Excellent: the revolver at 97-98% with original blue finish, light areas of edge wear, a drag line on the cylinder, a tiny dimple on one cylinder arc (see photo) and general handling marks; the holster has seen some carry use but appears to have been stored more than used and has no damage; the scope appears new; the scope mount has one small ding on left side as shown in the photo. The grips are excellent with some light handling marks. Mechanically excellent. In our opinion, this package was put together, fired some few times, cleaned and put away ... waiting for you to claim it. These guns have tremendous value for any serious Smith & Wesson collector and have great appeal to varmint hunters and those who enjoy owning and shooting something different than a .22LR or .22 WMR."
