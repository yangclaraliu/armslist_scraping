The whole point of Armslist is private face-to-face transactions to avoid scams.- Trader/Buyer needs to be a FL resident and have a Florida CCW, or be willing to sign a bill of sale/trade. This is an excellent condition Smith and Wesson model 6906 with rounded trigger guard, forged steel parts, and Novak sights. Estimated round count is less than 1,000.

I do not have the original box, but this gun will come with a total of 6 hard to find factory mags, three of which are still new in the packaging. One of them is a collectible .356 TSW mag, which is the same magazine with different markings. One of them has had the basepad bobbed for better concealment. The pistol has a single-sided safety which gives it a slimmer overall slide profile for concealed carry. I have detailed pics of the inside of the gun for serious inquiries.

Some examples of weapons that this includes are M16 rifles, AR15 rifles, AC-556 machineguns, M-249 machineguns and other types of .223/5.56 weapons.Helpful Tips:The shorter the barrel, the more ""enhanced flash pattern"" there will be.It comes with one installation washer and installation instructions.Made of SteelNote: This product is a Flash ""Enhancer"" which enhances the flash into a bigger pattern. It does NOT produce ""flash"". Some ammunition on the market may have a flash ""reducer"" in it and you will not see much ""pattern"" at all. To test which ammo works better with our flash enhancer, you can remove the flash hider and see if you can see the flash pattern. If you can, then this product should create an even better ""muzzle flash"". Examples of ammunition with lots of flash would be Wolf .223 ammunition."

Ergonomic improvements include an ambidextrous manual safety and a redesigned bolt stop.Each new Ruger Mark IV is built with Ruger’s excellent one-piece barreled receiver and internal cylindrical bolt construction. The Mark IV drops magazines freely when they are released, and the guns utilize a newly designed magazine disconnect safety to prevent firing when the magazine is removed.

I then went and put a 20 moa rail to mount the scope on too, to maximize the most out of the elevation turret if needed. The scope also has a top cap bubble to make sure the gun is level before taking that shot ... I have a chart already made for they gun that is laminated and in the pouch so you can make long shots... the chart is matched with the ammo I shoot out of it which is 165 grain burger vld bullet ... I will give you the option to have the bullets I have for it already made with the load profile so you can copy them over and have the same results I had with this gun. The only reason I want to sell this gun is cause I want something that can push just a little bit bigger grain bullet without loosing a lot of volicity which is why I'm going with a 300 rum.  I have taken many elk, deer and two bears with this gun from any where between 100 and 760 yards being the farthest. This is an awesome gun ... if you have any question please feel free to give me a call at REDACTED or my email , thanks!P.S. I have many more pictures of the gun but armslist only allows you to upload one image for some reason, so if you want more pics just give me a holler!"
