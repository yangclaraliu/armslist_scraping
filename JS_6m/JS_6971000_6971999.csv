A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools.
The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa.This pistol Comes with (2) 15RD magazines, (2) replacable back straps also a safty that can be swaped out from the decoker.Black Rifle Firearms1326 Harding HWY EastMarion, Ohio 43302Store Hours:WED-FRI : 11am-7pmSAT: 10am-6pmSun: 12pm-6pmClosed: Monday-TuesdayPhone: 740.914.6652"

It has 240 rounds through it. I've shot the 165's when I first bought it, but it does prefer the 180's for sure. Groups are REAL tight; never had a failure.
Comes with 3 mags -- the finger groove, slim-fit and a 15-round for taking to the range. Because of it's size, magazine capacity and power, it is a great pistol to ride with in the car, on your person or in your gear."

And designed to take HK mags, reliable and cheap. Certainly overbuilt and designed for precision. You could use it for hunting, but would be too heavy for my preference. Cobb is the precursor to DRD Tactical.Note that scope, rings, and Harris bipod are not included for this price. The ladders and picatinny to Harris mount will be though.Upgrades and options:- Fab Defence stock with adjustable cheek and built in monopod. Can replace with the factory A2 stock, receiver extension and buffer/spring assembly and remove $50 from the price- ALG Act trigger. Can put in a factory mil spec trigger or POF 3.5 lb single stage trigger depending on trade/cash amount- JP Enterprises adjustable gas block. Can put on a standard stainless steel low profile block if preferred.Trades: bolt guns get my attention. No interest in hunting rifles though. 6.5 varients, 6 Creed, 6 br, 6 Dasher, 300 win mag, etc. I also like quality glass. No interest in cheap stuff though. Gen 2 Razor, kahles 624i, PMII, etc. Maybe an M1a. 4x4 ATV. Feel free to send offers. Trades plus cash ok with me. I will add cash for the right  trade as well. Handguns must be ready to go for a can. No 40, 380, wheel guns, shotguns, services. Not letting me upload pics, so respond to the listing and I will reply with pics. These were 3 grand new, so feel that this is a very good deal for someone, especially with the upgrades."
