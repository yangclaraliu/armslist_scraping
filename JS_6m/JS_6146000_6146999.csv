The 712 is a great dove and duck gun very smooth and light gun for a 12 gage. The 920 is the best 20 gage I have ever shot. Both have 28"" barrels and come with all five chokes. Both guns for $950 is less than you would up for one gun of this quality today."

Originally designed as a means for persons with limited mobility to operate and fire the AR-15 pistol, the custom adaptation of the Stabilizing Brace to the Galil ACE pistol takes the application of large frame pistol control and stabilization to a new level. With the IWI brace’s unique sidefolding feature, the Galil ACE SB can be fired with or without the brace extended depending on the shooters need. With the brace in the folded position, storage space required in your safe or range/rifle bag is minimized.  In all other respects, the Galil ACE GAP39SB is identical to the GAP39.    The modernized Galil ACE is based upon the reliable mechanism of the original Galil assault rifle first developed by IMI in the late 1960’s. Drawing inspiration from the legendary Russian AK-47 and the Finnish Valmet RK 62, the IWI Galil ACE has been continuously improved over the last 40+ years, resulting in today’s extremely reliable and highly accurate Galil ACE.     Improvements made since the original Galil was first developed include:  Charging handle (reciprocating) moved to the left side of the milled steel receiver allowing for weak hand operation Weight reduction with the use of modern polymers AKM/AK-47 magazine compatibility Full length 2-piece Picatinny top rail Picatinny tri-rail forearm with built in, slide on/ off rail covers with pressure switch access Fully adjustable iron sights with Tritium front post       Caliber 7.62x39mm      Action Semi-auto      Operating System Closed rotating bolt, long stroke gas piston      Magazine Type MAGPUL MOE AK/AKM PMAG      Magazine Capacity Includes Colorado Compliant Magazine      Barrel Material Cold hammer forged, CrMoV, chrome lined      Barrel Length 8.3""      Overall Length 26.75""      Weight 6.5 lbs w/out Magazine      Rifling Right Hand, 1:9.45 inch twist      Brace Color Black      Sights Adjustable with Tritium front post and 2-dot Tritium rear aperture.

Lower seems to be missing the sear and trigger spring. Gas tube is dinged up. But looks like most of it is there. Included a NOS Century Metric FAL receiver (not a casting, 100% finished and serialized). You'll need a locking shoulder once the appropriate size is determined. Should build into a decent shooter.

SOME HISTORY:  After the United States entered the war in December 1941, demand for military arms soared. By this time, the Marine Corps had followed the Army's lead in adopting the M1 as its standard battle rifle, but M1 production was initially unable to meet demand. In addition, much to the Marine Corps' chagrin, the Army had first priority on available supplies and on future output from Springfield Armory and Winchester, the two manufacturers of the M1 Rifle. As a result, the Johnson M1941 rifle was adopted by the Marines for issue to Marine Raiders and to newly-formed Para-Marine airborne units (because the barrel could be removed for ease of jumping the weapon), and these rifles saw action in the Solomons campaign of 1942. As M1s became available to Marine units, the Johnson rifles were withdrawn from combat use. Only a few thousand of these arms had been procured by the U.S. government before production ended in 1944, and, in addition to their limited use with the Marine Corps, some Johnson rifles were issued to clandestine O.S.S. operatives. Because the rifle was never officially adopted by the US military, and because WWII prevented any opportunity Johnson may have had for robust foreign sales, the total number of Johnson 1941 Rifles manufactured was very small, only about 30,000. Johnson Model 1941 Rifles were serial numbered in groups of 10,000, with the first 10,000 having no prefix, the second group with prefix ""A,"" third group with prefix ""B."""

And a shine to the stock, so must be refinished. But other wise all military. 
SOME HISTORY:  After the United States entered the war in December 1941, demand for military arms soared. By this time, the Marine Corps had followed the Army's lead in adopting the M1 as its standard battle rifle, but M1 production was initially unable to meet demand. In addition, much to the Marine Corps' chagrin, the Army had first priority on available supplies and on future output from Springfield Armory and Winchester, the two manufacturers of the M1 Rifle. As a result, the Johnson M1941 rifle was adopted by the Marines for issue to Marine Raiders and to newly-formed Para-Marine airborne units (because the barrel could be removed for ease of jumping the weapon), and these rifles saw action in the Solomons campaign of 1942. As M1s became available to Marine units, the Johnson rifles were withdrawn from combat use. Only a few thousand of these arms had been procured by the U.S. government before production ended in 1944, and, in addition to their limited use with the Marine Corps, some Johnson rifles were issued to clandestine O.S.S. operatives. Because the rifle was never officially adopted by the US military, and because WWII prevented any opportunity Johnson may have had for robust foreign sales, the total number of Johnson 1941 Rifles manufactured was very small, only about 30,000. Johnson Model 1941 Rifles were serial numbered in groups of 10,000, with the first 10,000 having no prefix, the second group with prefix ""A,"" third group with prefix"

She has some scars, which could have quite possibly been brought about by combat conditions. This rifle has very strong rifling. Bore is in great condition. I payed 350 for the rifle originally, I'm asking for 250. I would not like to go any lower, being that most of these rifles are going for more money. It is not a necessity that i sell it, but id like to have the money so that i can put it toward something i might be using more frequently. Bill of Sale will be written out upon purchase or trade. If you are interested, you can text me at REDACTED. Will entertain offers of equal value. Not looking for anything other than firearms. Sale price will be 250 dollars."
