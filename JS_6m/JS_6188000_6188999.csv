Originally bought it with the wood stock and all including the bayonet. All matching serial numbers. Since purchasing I've put an archangel stock on it with the 10 Rd box mag, comes with 2 scope mounts (paid 150 each) added a scope mount riser so I don't have to weld a bent bolt on. Additionally it has a military grade laser, a green/red red dot mounted on the side of a $300 variable zoom black/green/red scope. (3-9x40 EG). comes with close to 200 Rds. I've put about $2,000 on this rifle. I personally shoot long range competition and I was ranked 12th in nationals. had the rifle shooting a 4 inch spread at 2,000 yards. (that's over a mile. love the firearm but i have no need for it anymore. would consider trading for a pickup. preferably 4 cylinders. open to trades. Text or call REDACTED"

I had this rifle built two years ago and it is an absolute ong range killer. It is a 338 Lapua Magnum built off of a Stiller Tac 338 action. It has a 30"" MTU contour Brux 1-9.5"" twist barrel to stabilize the long 300 gr Lapua hybrid bullets. It also has a side port muzzle break. The Stock is a McMillan A5 with the sniper fill in a black grey marbled finish that looks amazing. It has a Jewell HVRT trigger set at 1/2 lb. The Rifle is fed by a Seekins Precision bottom metal with two CIP length 5 round AICS magazines. The Stock is precisioninletted for the bottom metal and bedded to the barreled action. The stock aslo has a Karsten adjustable cheek rest added. The metal is all cerakoted graphite black and only has one or two scratches. The Rifle has a Stiller 20 moa picatinny rail pinned to the action. Comes with Nightforce ultra light titamium series rings, and Nightforce NSX 12-42x56 scope. Also included will be reloading dies and a bunch of Brass and Bullets. The brass and bullets alone is worth over $500. If you are serious i will add up the bullets and brass and tell you exactly what is there. The rifle has only been fired about 150 times and is a sub MOA shooter out to 1000 yards. I've printed several sub 4"" groups at 1000 yards with less than 1"" vertical. My range only goes out to 1000 yards but i had the rifle built to shpot at a mile, which shouod not be a problem. If you are a serious long range shooter this rifle will not dissapoint. I paid $6,150 for the rifle with the scope mounted two years ago. Since then I've only shot it about 150 times and bought all the brass and dies and bullets tht come with it. Ive invested probably $7,000 into this set up. Ill sell everything for $4,250 or best offer. I am also willing to ship to your FFL.  I'll pay the shipping to the lower 48, and am willing to negotiate shipping to Alaska and Hawiaii. If you live in South Dakota and you are serious about bying, you can come and try it out at my place."

I got this gun as part of a trade and was told that it was unfired, new old stock, which would mean that it has been near new in the box for 16 years, and that finding a PA-63 in this good of condition is going to be near impossible. 
These guns have a cult following as very competent carry guns. They look very similar to the Walther PP/PPK. They shoot the 9x18 Makarov 92 to 95 grain shell, which is not the same as the standard 9mm (which is 19mm long).
This gun is registered to me and any buyer would have to go through standard paperwork at a FFL of your choice, even if traded. I will be specifically motivated to do something prior to Saturday, since I plan on shooting at the range then.I did take this gun to Wade's and shot a box through it.  I really like this gun so I don't have a desperate need to sell it. UPDATE: I dropped the price to 299 and will now include a nylon shoulder holster, along with most of a box of ammo."

$980 firm in cash or better in trade value.  Lots of trade offers so far, but nothing I'd rather have yet over this one.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? this makes it a lot easier when considering.
The only thing I am really looking for right now is a Sig P320 Compact or Carry model in 9mm + $500 with std. sights or + $450 with night sights, going by Bud's pricing.  This will be a gift, so having the box and ppwk etc. would be nice.Mostly interested in semi-autos(AR & AK rifles, maybe pistols), but will consider others firearms, depending, stripped AR lowers, nice triggers, maybe other parts.  FosTech Echo trigger or the Franklin BFS, Gen 3 only.  
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18"".
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.

Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? this makes it a lot easier when considering.
The only thing I am really looking for right now is a Sig P320 Compact or Carry model in 9mm + $500 with std. sights or + $450 with night sights, going by Bud's pricing.  This will be a gift, so having the box and ppwk etc. would be nice to have.Mostly interested in semi-autos(AR & AK rifles & pistols), but will consider others firearms, depending, stripped AR lowers, nice triggers, maybe other parts.  FosTech Echo trigger or the Franklin BFS, Gen 3 only.

This rifle was built with accuracy and high level performance in mind, and it does not disappoint. The rifle features an Ergo ambidextrous grip, Magpul PRS stock and Samson Evo rail for a top level furniture package. The stock is adjustable to the user both in height and length of pull. This allows the comfortable use of various scopes and optics in various shooting positions. In addition to being comfortable it is also rugged and durable even in unforgiving hunting, competition, or tactical environments. The 15 inch Samson Evo rail was made with modularity in mind, allowing the user to place accessories and rail sections where they want them. The long length of the rail also allows the user to use rests or sand bags with ease, and the option of mounting a bipod further away from the stock for exceptional balance and stability. Additional rail pieces and other mounting options are available as well. The rail also features anti rotational tabs making the rail that much more impressive, virtually eliminating the possibility of the rail loosing alignment even under hard use. The fire control group of this rifle features the amazing JP-EZ trigger system. This trigger provides a clean, crisp break at approximately 4.5 lbs. and a distinct strong reset. The performance of this single stage trigger is impressive as there is virtually no creep or take-up. The trigger also allows the user to configure the trigger to their needs by using different spring kits. This rifle also features an ambidextrous safety. The rifle-length direct impingement gas system is the original gas system of the M16/AR15 family of rifles and has been tried and true in all environments and has been in use by our armed forces for decades. The gas block is firmly secured under the Samson Evo rail with Unbrako set screws. By using a low profile gas block, the longer Samson Evo rail can be used allowing a longer sight radius if iron sights are used. The gas tube has been Melonite treated for extra corrosion resistance and reliability. The bolt carrier group is an M16 weight carrier made from 8620 steel and is finished inside and out with a new, cutting edge proprietary coating process by Adams Arms called Lifecoat™. The Lifecoat™ process offers multiple advantages over and above traditional current coating processes on the market today. These advantages include a harder surface level then hard chrome, superior lubricity properties, and excellent corrosion resistance, all superior to traditional Mil-Spec Parkerizing. The gas key is heat treated and finished with the same new coating process as the carrier, attached to the carrier with Grade 8 fasteners manufactured in the United States, and properly staked. The bolt is manufactured from proper Mil-Spec Carpenter No. 158 ® Steel, magnetic particle inspected (MPI), and has a carbine extractor spring, insert, and Crane O-ring. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical dimensions held within +-.001” and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil spec receiver extension/buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control."
