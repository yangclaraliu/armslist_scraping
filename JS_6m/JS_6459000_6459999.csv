Sometimes it’s a brand new idea – like the XD®. Other times innovation is the fine-tuning of a classic – like the EMP®.How could the enduring design that is the 1911 be improved? Springfield Armory® answered that question in 2007 with the introduction of the Enhanced Micro Pistol™. The EMP® changes what a compact 1911 can be.The action of the EMP® is 1/8 inch shorter than that of the original 1911. This translates into several concrete advantages for the shooter. The shorter grip radius produces a shockingly comfortable shooting experience. You have to shoot the EMP® to believe how controllable it is. The shorter dimensions also work to increase reliability – something that’s crucial in a concealed carry pistol. And of course, the overall dimensions are one of the smallest 1911s out there.The good news doesn’t stop with the innovative design. The EMP® comes loaded with all the features you expect in a 1911 of this class – like low profile 3-Dot tritium combat sights and a match grade fully supported and ramped barrel. And with 9+1 rounds of 9mm the EMP® packs an amazing amount of punch in one of the smallest 1911s ever.If you’re looking for a 1911 to carry with you every day, look no further than the Springfield Armory® EMP®. Sometimes innovation changes everything.This Gun comes with case and 3-9mm Mags No trading, Asking just $750 plus shipping"

After making contact with Wilson Combat, and sending them pics and the serial #, I was informed that it wasn't a Wilson Combat, but they did have record of the barrel being cut for choke tubes by them, but that was because I sent it to them and had them do it. Purchased in 2005, took possession of in 06, less than 50 rounds through it, sent barrel back to Wilson had it cut for Remington choke tubes, (Didn't like the pattern) with an extra full turkey choke it will keep all the pellets from OO buck on a USPSA target at 50 yards, at 40 it patterns like a softball."

This is a Model 84S AKM Rifle in .223/5.56 NATO Caliber. I bought this in 1988 and shot 60 rounds to check the mags (three 20 round boxes). It was cleaned and in climate controlled storage since. There are NO significant scratches, dents or anything on the wood or metal! Bluing is excellent with NO rust, pitting or scratches. A very few Gun Safe storage marks and that's it! There is a very slight line where the safety was put on a few times. See pics. The Magazines, Bayonet and Scabbard are the same. The Sling has never been unrolled and is in the original package. There are VERY FEW Pre-Ban AKs ESPECIALLY in 5.56mm, in LIKE NEW condition, in the Original Box! Even the box is in fairly good shape. Obviously the Bore, Bolt, Action, etc. are as new as well. See the pics. I am not the best photographer, so if you see something you question, please ask me. The flash will sometimes give a false impression. Except for the box, the rifle and equipment is as new. One last point. There are THREE (3) ORIGINAL 30 ROUND MAGS that come with the gun. Check the prices for these on GB in 5.56mm right now! You'll see up to $295 EACH for Original 30 Round Mags in New to Excellent condition PLUS S&H. Most of these particular Rifles are being sold with ONE MAG because of this! Most of the less expensive mags you'll see will not work/fit in these rifles! This is a Rare Gun! Collectors, don't let this one GET AWAY. This is a great price for this PACKAGE. Many Pre Ban AKMs in 5.56 NATO went for THOUSANDS MORE before the election but I don't know if they were in this condition and with ALL the Extras. Just a note, the Manual is also original to the gun No Trade asking for just $950 with shipping"
