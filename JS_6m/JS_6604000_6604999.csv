It is a Variant 1 which is the typical double/ single action with a safety lever that doubles as a de-cocking lever.The Heckler & Koch USP Compact was designed and is made in Germany with a quality of design, materials, fit and finish that is unequaled in my opinion. The USP Compact has a cold hammer forged barrel with polygonal rifling that in testing performed reliably in excess of 50,000 rounds. The HK USP's pedigree is rooted in the H&K Mark 23 that was developed as an ""Offensive Handgun Weapons System—Special Operations Peculiar"" for the US Special Operations Command. As commercial brothers of the Mark 23, the USP and the USP Compact are now among the most proven sidearms out there with a legacy of reliability and durability that few can match.One of the best qualities of the USP Compact is its ideal size. H&K struck a perfect balance in size in the USP Compact that makes it the ultimate all-around pistol that can be conceal-carried or used as a standard sidearm. Because of this, the Compact has surpassed the full size USP in popularity and desirability.
I am not interested in any trades and my price is firm- really. If you see this ad the gun is still available."

As you can tell from the pictures, the pistol is in excellent shape.In regards to trades, I am looking to keep the deal reasonable.  Where an imbalance in trade value exists the parties will have to make up the difference with cash or additional items.  So if you have something I want that is worth more than my HK VP9, I will add cash or items to make it fair for you.  If you are trading something that is worth less than my pistol, you will have to make up the difference to make it fair for me.  **Lowball offers will be rejected.**  I appreciate that everyone likes to get a deal and some people enjoy taking advantage of others, but please start from the premise that you and I both share an understanding of what the pistol is worth.  For those who might want to discuss their take on supply and demand and the free market in an attempt to justify a low offer, please resist that impulse.     Ideally, I'd like to add some cash to the VP9 and trade for a Walther Q5 Match in 9mm, a Walther P5 in 9mm, or a SIG P210 Legend Target in 9mm (the one with 1911 style controls).My preference is for a trade deal in the Kansas City area but I can travel a little.    Thank you for your interest."

It is a Gen 2.5 version of the pistol. For those who are unfamiliar with the Gen 2.5 version, it is the Gen 3 version without the accessory rail. The pistol comes with the “Tupperware” container, papers, two mags with the Pearce finger groove extension base plates, and the cleaning brush. The pistol has Trijicon night sights (Green Front, Yellow Rear), an extended Glock slide stop, a professional trigger job that includes the Lightning Strike Titanium Plunger and Ghost connector.  Additionally, the pistol comes with a Kydex holster for a 1.5 inch belt.  As you can tell from the pictures, everything is in excellent shape.I have six more magazines (also with the Pearce finger groove extension base plates) as well that can be added to the deal depending on the package. Although this is a trade, I am looking to keep the deal reasonable.  Where an imbalance in trade value exists the parties will have to make up the difference with cash or additional items.  So if you have something I want that is worth more than my Glock 30, I will add cash or items to make it fair for you.  If you are trading something that is worth less than my pistol, you will have to make up the difference to make it fair for me.  **Lowball offers will be rejected.**  I appreciate that everyone likes to get a deal and some people enjoy taking advantage of others, but please start from the premise that you and I both share an understanding of what the pistol is worth.  For those who might want to discuss their take on supply and demand and the free market in an attempt to justify a low offer, please resist that impulse.   Ideally, I'm looking to work a deal where I can trade towards a Walther Q5 Match in 9mm or a Walther PPQ 45.  Depending on the details (e.g. how much cash or what other items I would have to add) I'd also consider trades involving a Walther P5 in 9mm or a SIG P210 Legend Target in 9mm (the one with 1911 style controls).  My preference is for a trade deal in the Kansas City area but I can travel a little.  Thank you for your interest."

I bought the gun to use as my concealed carry because of its size and weight which makes it a great carry gun. Also customer reviews, solid build and design, and the quality. Before I even got to fire a round some things came up and we unfortunately need the money more than the gun right now. The gun comes with everything I got with it when it was purchased. It has a blue Bersa hard case, magazine, owners manual, trigger safety lock, and some safety paperwork. I am selling for $300, as I stated it's new in the box never fired. That's less than I paid, but I need the cash asap. Gander mountain is selling the same exact one for $350, so you would pay about $81 more at the store for the same new gun. Please contact Taylor @ REDACTED anytime day or night and I will meet within reason. Thank you, God bless!"

I found myself shooting the 50 less and less and more with my Creedmoor and 3 Gun so sold the used ones. I kept this hoping I'd make more time to shoot, but that has not happened so time for this safe queen to go. This is the MKIII upper and bolt assembly that functions flawlessly. The free floating, match grade barrel will shoot 1 MOA or better. It has a spare firing pin, bolt maintenance parts kit, and owner's manual. The lower is a matching milled steel single shot receiver with upgraded, heavy trigger spring. The extra weight of the receiver balances out the rifle perfectly so it's not so muzzle heavy like when used with a standard AR lower. Stock is a Magpul PRS in matching OD Green to the handguard.Scope is a Vortex Viper 6.5-20x50 with mil dot reticle. Rings are Burris Tactical. Both hold up to the recoil of a 50 while holding zero just fine. They have never been mounted and have experienced no rounds fired  They were only pseudo mounted for the photos. Package comes with 103 rounds of ammo in cans as follows:80 rounds of FMJ Ball 8 rounds of Hornady AMAX9 rounds of API6 rounds of AP These are competition worthy rifles that are a blast to shoot. Buy it for sport, buy it for fun, or buy it for your apocalypse prep. It will do the job for all and then some. I prefer to sell locally where we can do the FFL transfer. Norpoint is Arlington is my preferred location. Feel free to reach out with any questions.  More pics available by request.Thanks,Troy"

Just the perfect combination of what a battle rifle should be. It's built on an Anderson Aluminum lower with nickel boron polished trigger and speed hammer with Wolf springs. The trigger is smooth, crisp, a clean break just lighter than milspec tolerances. Milspec buffer tube with a 3.8 oz buffer and a 6 position stock. The upper is made by Colt with a 1:7 twist chrome lined 16"" barrel chambered in 5.56 nato, but will also shoot 223. Threaded muzzle with an A2 flash hider. The finish is parkerized with an A2 front sight post, chrome gas tube. Also has an AIM Nitride finish bolt carrier group with all premium components. The gun comes with rear flip up iron sites and a military surplus M4 30 round magazine. This gun is a steal, you simply can't build one equally for the same price if you can even get a Colt upper. Please call or text if interested Thanks for looking.Jon REDACTED Harleysville, PA Montgomery County"

Just a really sweet SxS double.

The SBE 3 features the Comfor Tech® 3 butt stock, with optimized chevron size and location; and a newly developed cheek pad, Combtech™, which greatly reduces facial impact and vibrations. An included shim kit allows up to 8 different cast and drop configurations; and a new stock and fore end design and rounded trigger give the SBE3 a smoother feel that allow you to shoulder the gun quickly and swing fluidly on passing targets. The enhanced SBE 3 is better adapted for hunters wearing gloves, with an oversized bolt release, an oversized safety, and an enlarged and beveled loading port. An improved breech-closing system eliminates the potential for shooter error when trying to close the bolt gently, and it prevents the bolt from slipping out of battery if the gun is handled roughly in the field. At the heart of the Super Black Eagle 3 is Benelli's ultra-reliable Inertia Driven™ operating system that cycles 2-3/4"", 3"", and 3-1/2"" shotgun shells interchangeably without adjustments. A Crio® treated barrel and Crio choke tubes produce tight, uniform shot patterns that down birds at maximum shotgun range. The matte finished Super Black Eagle 3 Semi-Auto Shotgun features a rugged, weather-resistant composite stock, and the entire gun is finished in non-reflective black, making it an ideal all-round shotgun for hunters who use a wide range of shotgun ammunition for multiple species"
