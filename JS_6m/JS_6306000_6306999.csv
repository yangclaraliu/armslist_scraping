I don't know what chokes it has and I don't have the gauges to measure it. One tube is 0.005"" bigger than the other. Shotgun was kept in those crappy old vinyl outside, soft lined cases, for years and not taken out much to be oiled. So it has a few small spots of rust on the bluing, but nothing terrible and nothing that effects function. Most of it will probably clean up fairly well. Other than the finish issues, this one is in good shape and locks up tight. I would guess that this is from the 60s / 70s era but I really don't know.From what I can find the ERA is the same manufacturer as a current Stoeger SxS, but I'm not sure if that is true. This is a fairly nice looking shotgun. Nice bluing and the wood is looks good with nice checkering. Wood has minimal wear, but does have some small dings from years of sitting around, but probably not much use. On the bottom is says ""Made in Brazil"", on the barrel is says ""Made in Brazil for F.I.E. Miama FL""Asking $350 oboemail for more pictures."

I imagine if you're looking at this you know what the 941 is... but in case you don't...Double/Single action with decocker. Some of the new Jericho's do not have a decocker. This is the 941 imported by KBI, before Magnum Research took over. Controls are well-placed and the gun fits your hand perfectly. If you're tired of plastic guns or just want something different, the 941 is awesome. The all-steel construction means it shoots so smoothly, so easily.Clays at 50 yards from a rest if you do your part! I've taken great care of this pistol; always kept clean. Never dropped, submerged, frozen, or otherwise tortured. It's lived in a soft holster. No modifications. The Jericho is a substantial pistol, made by IWI in Israel by people who need weapons that work. Some call it a cousin to the famous Desert Eagle 50 caliber. Magazines are in great condition and extras are easy to find. 9mm. Mags hold 15 rounds, 16 if you jam another one in."

What I want is the barrel shortened the 1/2 inch or so at the breech and rechambered in 308 winchester. The barrel is a new sporter contour, so there will be no issue cutting a new shoulder and continuing the threads on up. This should be easy for any good gunsmith.  I also have a scope base that I need installed. It clears the stripper clip guide so all it needs is the holes drilled and tapped. If you can perform this service for a reasonable price, please let me know.
