Chambered in 9mm Kurz (.380 ACP) made in Spain. Nazi Germany ordered these handguns in 1942-43 from Astra during the war. These were for the Waffen SS. This was a WW2 take home gun taken off a fallen soldier. On the back of the gun under the slide you can see the Nazi eagle and swastika  with the serial number WAa251. Gun itself does function but is in rough shape. All numbers match and has one factory magazine. Bore and barrel are cleaner then the outside of the gun. Magazine drops, slide racks and locks back on an empty magazine. Gun is 100% original and has never been modified since the day it came back to the states. Great starter piece for a collector or someone who would like to refinish and enjoy a piece of history. All mass laws will be followed. I in no way support or sympathize with any of the German views from this time period, this is simply a piece of history from a dark time in history and a rare collectible firearm.

Very quick to get on target with this rig, scope is super bright and clear and has 2 BDC rings for quick hold over at longer range. Also included is a Galco Safari Ching Sling, split down the middle, you put your arm through it, and it greatly decreases wobble when shooting off hand, or sitting, kneeling positions. These guns sell for $900 some dollars, scope is $300, rings $80 and sling $80.No scratches or dings on the gun at all, finish on the scope turret is not perfect as I had some FDE paint on it at one time, removing it caused some finish to come off ( turret only). Would sell the GSR without the scope or rings for $625.I also have around 400 rounds of the A-Max load that this carbine does so well with, will sell the ammo separately."

Robar NP3 coated slide, barrel, and all internal parts for superior corrosion resistance and the lubricity properties of NP3 make it one of the best coatings available. The Robar grip frame reduction gives you a better handling pistol with a more natural 'point of aim' grip angle, and the texture makes it easier to hang on to when wet. The frame has a lower accessory rail. This one has a very nice trigger, we had a new connector installed and it made the trigger pull very smooth. Comes with two 13 round magazines.i would ship.."

It has had about 200-250 rounds put through it. It is an SAR XV GLADIUS, (AR-15) ammunition type 5.56. It is a combo package because I'm including with it alot of accessories. I can only include 3 pics so I took pics of what I feel are most useful to sell. First off I'm including (ten) 30 round magazines, 7 of which are PMAGS which cost 12 dollars each, and 3 regular standard issue military magazines. Also I'm including 143 rounds of 5.56 ammunition, in good condition. In addition, I purchased an EOTECH reflex sight that I have mounted to the rifle, this ran me about 400 dollars alone, and it takes 2 AA batteries to run. Great condition as well, hardly used. Also, on the rail, I have mounted a TACLIGHT (pictures of everything will be here) with a pressure sensor. The brand name is POWERTAC, which ran me about a 100 dollars. The pressure sensor is mounted adhesively to the added monopod I threw on the rifle as well. I can't really remember the price of it so I wont charge for it. Overall I'm running this combo package for 1600$ The manufacturer is not listed for an SAR XV GLADIUS, that is why it's not chosen. If you are in the northern virginia area, I do NOT have a problem shipping/transporting the package to you myself, free of charge."

778,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6259778,For Sale:  ALG 6-Second Mount - RMR,"Simpson, Greenville, North Carolina",$ 150,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 27, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The ALG Defense 6-Second Mount was designed when a counter-terrorism unit approached ALG with a strict set of criteria. When entering a linear environment (such as an airplane or bus) the team’s primary weapon was their pistol and they were looking for a fast sighting method that was rugged and robust. Red dot scopes mounted directly to the pistol slides were showing a high failure rate due to the extreme acceleration and deceleration of the slide. Additionally, the balance of the pistol was thrown off from the rearward optic mounting position.
The name 6-Second Mount came from a description used by one of the operators: “The fight lasts 6 Seconds, either they’re dead or you’re dead and aggression saves the day.”
Mounting an optic to your weapon decreases engagement time allowing for faster and more accurate hits on target. By separating the sight from the reciprocating slide it allows the pistol to function properly without the added mass of the optic sight and improves the overall weight distribution. Also, by removing the sight from the slide, the slide’s integrity is not compromised by machining.

It is a pre-Model 36 version J-frame built in 1956. That's right...this classic snubnose revolver is sixty years old but you couldn't tell it by looking at or shooting it. Designed to be small and compact for easy carry conceal or small storage areas, this pre-Model 36 Flat Latch J-frame Chiefs Special has a pinned 1.875 inch (sometimes called a 2 inch) barrel. It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder and can be fired in single or double action. This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a blued finish and has the original diamond-type wood grips with serial numbers that match the round butt frame.This classic S&W revolver is in great condition for its age. There is some honest holster wear on the bottom front of the frame and muzzle and a small chip in the bottom of the upper portion of the right wood grip. This gun was carried some but only occasionally fired. Very clean and shiny bore and cylinders. I had the gun's side plate off and completely cleaned while intact the internals, then oiled them before replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to the accuracy of the gun.I have fired 50 problem-free rounds of factory .38 Special 130 grain factory ammunition through it since I acquired it. As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is fun and confidence-inspiring. This revolver is one that is of the age it could be put away in a collection to fondle and admire, but is also dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun.

It has a square butt K frame with a 4” tapered and pinned barrel. Dark rich wood S&W diamond-marked grips with S&W medallions complement this gorgeous gun. This revolver has a serrated ramp fixed front sight and a notched rear sight with the traditional sighting channel along the top of the gun. Very nice case hardened hammer and trigger with a clean and brilliantly shiny bore and cylinders. There are a few slight surface lines on the side panels from cleaning as are on any reflective nickel-plated surface and a couple of light handling and storage marks behind the cylinder release button, but they absolutely don't detract from the stunning beauty or integrity of this S&W revolver. While the stunning looks of this gun first attracted me to it, the buttery-smooth trigger and pin-point accuracy after firing it made this revolver the epitome of the marriage of form and function. I have fired 60 problem-free rounds of factory .38 Special 130 grain factory ammunition through it since I acquired it. While I have never had a bad shooting or feeling Smith & Wesson revolver, the Model 10 line has consistently provided the finest trigger pulls and shooting accuracy for me. As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is fun and confidence-inspiring. This revolver is so pretty it could be put away as a collector's item or displayed as a show piece, yet functional and accurate enough to be used as a house or carry gun, or all of the above. Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.I have received many inquiries, some offers, and a couple of ""I'll take it"" emails from folks who did not meet or were not able to verify the following criteria or weren't able to buy right now.

J. Fuller Collection last year. This is an early 1969 Smith & Wesson Model 10-5 .38 Special M&P (Military & Police) six-shot shot revolver. It has a square butt richly blued original finish K frame with a 4” tapered and pinned barrel. Dark rich S&W checkered walnut square-butt Magna grips with S&W medallions and serial numbers that match the frame complement this gorgeous gun. This revolver has a serrated ramp fixed front sight and a notched rear sight with the traditional sighting channel along the top of the gun. Very nice case hardened hammer and trigger with a clean and brilliantly shiny bore and cylinders. This beautiful revolver has light and smooth show holster wear at the sides of the very tip of the muzzle. There are a very few light freckles on the grip straps and a tiny handling mark at the right side of the top of the frame, but none of these time-expected items take away from the beauty or integrity of this S&W revolver. While the stunning looks of this gun first attracted me to it, the buttery-smooth trigger and pin-point accuracy after firing it made this revolver the epitome of the marriage of form and function. I have fired 30 problem-free rounds of factory .38 Special 130 grain factory ammunition through it since I acquired it. While I have never had a bad shooting or feeling Smith & Wesson revolver, the Model 10 line has consistently provided the finest trigger pulls and shooting accuracy for me. As mentioned above, the gun featured here is one of the premier Smith & Wesson revolvers that were sold from the Dr. C. J. Fuller Collection.

It's a great gun, but I just don't need it that much and would rather have a lever action for purely utilitarian purposes. Below you'll see the list of every part I used in the build, with links to where you can double check my prices listed. The prices aren't full retail; I used exilmachine.net for most of my prices. If you're building your own, I'd highly recommend that website, they have some of the best prices online, way below retail. The total price of everything in this rifle (with mags, case, sling etc. included) would run $2118.16 using the prices I quoted. Retail prices would make it run around $2500+, but I already did the shopping around for you. This rifle has slight wear in spots (see pictures) with less than 250 rounds fired. If you're interested in ammunition I can sell that as well. I'm asking $1600 OBO for the complete package. It comes with 5 30 round stippled PMAGs, 1 20 round stippled PMAG, a Drago case and all the extra spare parts I have left.
