(Which I would include).  The seller and myself knew nothing about this pistol and after doing extensive research, found out it's true value.  If you were to look at Gunbroker.com, GunsAmerica.com, the Blue Book or many of your on-line dealers, you would see these go for anywhere between $375-$600+ depending on condition.  The original mags alone cost $150-$200 now.  This pistol is now a fully authenticated 1941 Femaru 37M with the addition of the original mag.  The mag is probably going to need a new spring as the seller told me he broke off about 1"" of the spring when he was restoring it.  I would probably take the spring out of the aftermarket mag and install that spring into the original mag.  As a note, in 1941 mags had no serial #'s.I am a shooter, not a collector and I shoot regularly at my local range.  After finding out the value of this pistol, I do not take this to the range anymore.  Naturally, it has been test fired and broken down and cleaned & oiled extensively.  It is remarkably accurate given it's fixed sights.  I own a host of pistols and do not need this lying around.  I put the condition of this pistol on the high side of 'good'. I am mainly looking to get back out of this what I have put into it.The pistol was designed by Frommer, a prominent Hungarian gun manufactrer in Budapest, Hungary and produced weapons for the Hungarian Army.  In 1929 Frommer originally produced the 29M which was superceded in 1937 by the 37M.  It is styled after the proven design of the Colt 1911 as most manufacturers did and still do.  This pistol was made in Budapest, Hungary in 1941 and used by the Hungarian Army until Nazi Germany occupied Hungary and renamed it 'Pistole 37(u)', the lower case (u) was used to signify it's Hungarian origin.  This pistol has NO Nazi markings as it is 'pre-war'.As you can see from the photo's showing the serial # and the dates of manufacture, this pistol is over 75 years old.  The caliber is .380acp and was referred to as 9mm Kurz(European).The .380 barrel is interchangeable with the 7.65 (.32acp) barrel as is the mag.  The 7.65 was produced by Femaru for the German Luftwaffe after occupation and an additional safety was installed at the rear of the slide.  The only safety on an original Femaru 37M such as this is a grip safety.I could go on and on about the history of the manfacturer etc., but my space is limited.  I also have many more photo's, but I'm only allowed 3 here.  If you need further info, more photo's, a specifc photo, or more intense docmentation, you can contact me through 'contact seller' at the top of the page or text me at REDACTED.  I am located in Spring Hill, FL.I am asking $425 and may possibly entertain a reasonable offer.  Cashier's check only.  No CC.  I do not want trades.  Receipt will be issued.  You would be responsible for the cost of shipping, any FFL fees if necessary, etc.  (NOTE: AT TOP OF LISTING IT SHOWS SHIP AS 'NO'.  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT 'YES'.)  I do not ship to California."

This includes the trigger and spring, hardened sear, competition firing pin and sear springs, a competition firing pin block and spring, tactical reet assist, and a new striker.All the internals have been stoned and polished, and the trigger consistently breaks at 2 pounds, with less than 1/8-inch pre-travel, much like a good 1911 competition trigger.This gun is presently set up for 3-gun competition, as well as USPSA and IPSC competitions. All the action work has been done for you, and all you have to do is load it, shoot it and enjoy it.I have put 100 rounds through the gun to test the accuracy and trigger. The pistol comes with the case, 3-15 round mags, paperwork, all the stock parts, and 400 rounds of ammo.
I have almost $800 invested in this package. I'm just looking for something else to play with.Please do not ask for a cash price, as no price will be given. This is for trade only."

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour  16.1” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause ‘stringing’ in barrels with conventional linear fluting.The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

Is it possible for a pistol small enough to carry every day to have all the features and capacity that you’d expect in a larger pistol? If that pistol is the XD-S® from Springfield Armory®, the answer is yes. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack 9mm offers so much that you’ll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile.

Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there.
If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack  in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™."
