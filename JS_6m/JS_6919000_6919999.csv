I am selling it for $220 firm. When I purchased this, I personally inspected a batch of 10 Mosins and picked this one because the rifling is perfect and pristine with clear, defined lands and grooves. Although I've never shot it, it cycles ammunition just fine. While the finish on the trigger group and magazine is a bit rough because it's a 1943 wartime production, it's still in rearsenalled, storage condition (excellent). I removed pretty much all of the cosmoline, and it's just been sitting in my safe since I bought and cleaned it. Mosins are very hard to find nowadays with the current political situation with Russia. They've dried up, so if you want one, here's your chance. I live in Ruston, but I travel to Alexandria frequently or could meet halfway somewhere. $220 cash firm. Must be legally able to purchase a firearm and must be willing to fill out a Bill of Sale. If you'd like to purchase this rifle, feel free to send me a message and I'd be happy to text you more pictures.The rifle comes alone as-is, with no accessories.In-person, local private sale only."

The Renegade + embodies everything a direct impingement AR-15 can be. With improvements such as our roller cam pin and patented heat sink barrel nut, these upgrades go well above mere aesthetics often found in rifles today. Put simply, the Renegade + addresses all of the weak points of the direct impingement system. The Dictator 9-position adjustable gas block gives you ultimate control of your rifle, whether tuning for ammo load or suppressor use. The straight gas tube eliminates heat build up from the weak points of standard gas tubes. And the roller cam pin ensures a smooth and more reliable relationship with the upper receiver.The Renegade+ is built off of our Gen 4 billet lower receiver and Ultimate Bolt Carrier Group. This receiver is completely ambidextrous and includes our flat 3.5 lb match grade trigger with KNS Precision anti-walk pins. Competition ready right out of the box. The magic in the upper receiver is held within our Ultimate Bolt Carrier Group which is high phosphate nickel coated for maximum protection & reliability and features an integrated gas key (no screws required). Like the Renegade, the Renegade + comes with our M-LOK compatible Renegade rail, covering the 16.5” nitride heat treated barrel.IF THERE EVER WAS A DIRECT IMPINGEMENT RIFLE THAT EXCEEDS ALL EXPECTATIONS, THE RENEGADE + IS IT."

HCF raises funds for the Huntsman Cancer Institute which is one of the most cutting-edge cancer research facilities in the world. 100% of proceeds raised will go towards our $20,000 goal we set for philanthropy this year., all of which will be donated to HCF. The charity shoot event will be located at the Genesee Sportsman Club in Flushing, MI. It will be a 5-stand competition and there will be prizes for top shooters, food and raffle. We are currently looking for a shotgun to raffle off for our grand prize at the event. I have been searching on here for the past few months for something suitable but all the deals have fallen through thus far. I was wondering if anyone had a shotgun they would be willing to sell for cheap or would be willing to donate for our event. As I mentioned previously, 100% of the funds we will be raising from this event are going towards the Huntsman Cancer Foundation and help find a cure for this deadly disease that affects us and our loved ones. So, if you or someone you know might have a shotgun that fits the description above, feel free to shoot me a message. I'd be happy to tell you more about the event we are planning and can provide whatever proof you deem necessary. I can assure you this isn't a scam. Additionally, please also keep any negative comments to yourself. I'm just a college kid trying to make a difference in the world."

There's a lot of bad behavior on Armslist these days. Here are the top 5. 1.  If somebody sends you an email, reply. Many offers are legit. It's rude to ask folks to send offers and then not bother with a reply. 2.  If you tell folks to text offers, reply. Even if you don't like their offer, reply. A simple "" no thank you"" works. 3.  Stop with the silly FREE or $1 listings. You have no intention of giving your guns away and you're sure as hell not selling them for $1. And no, nobody is looking at your listing thinking you're selling a $500 gun for $1. 4.  Don't tell someone you're committed to trading or selling and then stop replying to emails or texts when you've changed your mind.  That's unprofessional. If your status has changed, just communicate. 5.  While this is very subjective, stop with over-valuing your guns and under-valuing the other person's guns.  It makes for a lousy exchange. Sincerely.

O1 is a carbon steel and will need to be cleaned and oiled to prevent rust. It lives in a humidity controlled safe and has been dry oiled.The knife is a full tang blade, built with black G10 scales (matte finish) with white G10 liners. Scales and liners are epoxied and then bolted to the blade tang using stainless steel corby bolts. The blade has a high saber grind with a machine finish (scotchbrite belt) on the primary grind and a hand rubbed satin finish on the flats. The handle portion of the blade is drilled out to create better balance and lighten the knife. Heat treated to Rockwell hardness 58-60. I have other knives by the same maker and his craftsmanship and fit and finish is fantastic.Knife basics:Overall length- 7.5"" (I have medium sized hands and its a perfect fit for me)Blade length- 3.5""Cutting Edge length- 3.4""Blade thickness (at ricasso)- 0.125""This knife comes with a handmade thermoformed Holstex sheath with a carbon fiber texture. The sheath has 1/4"" eyelets spaced at intervals that will allow for multiple carry options. It has an attached but removable webbing belt loop that can be switched around to allow the user to wear the knife on their left side. Sheath has drain holes molded in to allow water and dirt to escape. All screws loctited. The sheath provides very good retention. On other sheaths from the same maker, I put overhook clips on each side and carry it OWB but inside the belt. Works great that way and conceals perfectly.I designed it, and had a very talented knife maker build it. Its a great knife, perfect size for EDC and is very sharp. It has never been used or resharpened.I paid $150 for it and its worth every penny of that, and more in my opinion. I'll let it go for $130 shipped anywhere in the US, or $120 FTF in Bucks County, PA."
