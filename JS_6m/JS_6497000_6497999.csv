She comes with the original two mags that came with one 9 rounds and the other is 10 rounds. Awesome handgun but I just bought another so this got to go.

I have a Pro Mag Archangel M1A Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Stock that I want to go to a good home. I installed this stock on my Armscorp M14 but have decided to take the rifle back to a more historic look. Therefore I would like this stock to go to a good home where it will be used as intended, rather than sit in a closet for a few years. The stock was installed by a gunsmith locally. He shaved about 1/64th of an inch out of the interior to get the receiver to fit. Based on my understanding of the instructions, the archangel stock is built too small on purpose. You shave it to get it to fit. Even with the minor shaving, we had to lube the heck out of the receiver to get it to fit (insert whatever joke you have here for similar situations.) By contrast, the original GI stock I purchased to return the rifle back to the historic look allows the receiver to slide in and out without much effort at all. The Archangel stock is very snug, so don't be suprised if you have to shave it further to get your rifle to fit. However, the lugs where the rifle mates to the stock are unmodified, meaning the points where your receiver actually mates is quite snug, as it should be. The stock certainly improves the ergonomics of the rifle. I personally did not notice much of an accuracy increase (that being said, I'm new to shooting long range, so that may be my lack of skill showing.) That being said, I believe the primary philosophy of use for the stock is to improve the ergonomics. If you want something that will fix the cheek weld with a scope, this is your stock. The stock does have forward mounted polymer picatinny rails for accessory or bipod attachment. The rail does have a cover when not in use, which is also included. If you have any questions please let me know. Thanks for looking!"

The front sights are fixed (not changeable) on any of the Mustangs that Colt is now shipping. I had a gunsmith replace the original black sights with Tritium Night Sights because it is critical to be able to find sights quickly in a defensive situation at night. Other than the gunsmith firing a few rounds from a bench rest to double check the alignment of the sights, this pistol hasn’t been fired since it left the factory. I have night sights on all my pistols and find them very helpful at indoor ranges, as well.Below are a couple of reviews:http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/colt-mustang-xsp-review (I could not close the irritating popup in Chrome, but I could close it in Internet Explorer or Edge.

This is a commander sized 1911, 4.25"" barrel.  White dot front sight, all black serrated rear.  Short reach trigger, skeletonized commander hammer, flared bearvertail and black rubberized grips.  That's how the pistol came, now for the customizations, all of which were perfomed by a certified gunsmith.Slide work: Back end of slide is serrated to reduce glare, 11 degree target crown blended into barrel bushing, ejection port was lowered and flared, the extractor was tuned and the Marvel cut was added to smooth out the action.Frame work:The fronstrap was hand checkered to 30 LPI, as were the front of the trigger gaurd and the bump on the grip safety.  Also, the mainspring housing, mag catch and reciol spring plug were replaced with chekered ones.  Trigger job to about 4 pounds, minimal take up and breaks like a glass rod.  The trigger gaurd is undercut and the beavertail was raised, making it incredibly comfortable in the hand and also giving it great pointability.  The beavertail was radiused to give it a sleeker look, as was the the thumb safety.  Also, the thumb safety, grip safety and frame have been blended together to be one smooth curve.  Again, super comfortable in the hand.  Idiot proofed the slide stop (makes for easy installation and eliminates the chance for the infamous idiot scratch).  The magwell has been beveled as well.It was recently Cerakoted.  The Slide, frame and mainspring houseing are Tungsten (metallic dark grey), all other parts and pins are Cobalt (metallic black).  It's a pretty slick looking firearm.  It comes with 3 mags.  One Springfield 7 round that works great, an 8 round ACT mag that could use a new spring.  The first round tends to nose dive but cycles fine after that.  Also a 10 round promag that I picked up in a trade.  It looked like someone went at with some pliers and I was rather skeptical of it.  It worked surprising well though.  Sticks a bit on the release.  As you can see, quite a bit of work has been put into this little fella and I'm asking a more than fair price. So no lowball offers please.  I also have a pair of Crimson Trace Chainmail grips for sale for it for $150. I can text more photos with details if you're interested. Thanks for looking."

You can carry with empty chamber and rack a round when needed, carry with round in chamber and hammer down or half-way, or cocked and locked with an ambidextrous thumb safety. All methods are safe and easy. One of the reasons I favor this model over a P238 because it is very difficult and dangerous to let the hammer down on a P238.This is one of the very last Colt Mustangs made with dovetailed (changeable) front and rear sights. The front sights are fixed (not changeable) on any of the Mustangs that Colt is now shipping. I had a gunsmith replace the original black sights with Tritium Night Sights because it is critical to be able to find sights quickly in a defensive situation at night. Other than the gunsmith firing a few rounds from a bench rest to double check the alignment of the sights, this pistol hasn’t been fired since it left the factory. I have night sights on all my pistols and find them very helpful at indoor ranges, as well.Below are a couple of reviews:http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/colt-mustang-xsp-review (I could not close the irritating popup in Chrome, but I could close it in Internet Explorer or Edge.

I'm selling because I own two so now I'd like to have one and a snub nose instead. Extra info: taurus doesn't mess around when it comes to revolvers. I also like thier 1911. They get some stuff right! This revolver is proof. It holds 7 rounds which is a major deal Maker for most. Also unique to this revolver is the ported barrel. I'm one of those people that never notices recoil, but I noticed it on this gun, bc there is none. Anyone i go to the range with that asks if they can try this 357 are amazed at how different having a ported barrel is, it dramatically decreases recoil. So with all that said, this is a bad ass revolver and I'm only selling bc I have two. I've had this post going a little over a month now. If i dont find the deal im looking for the ad will just stay up till i give up, and ill just be that cool guy with matching 7 shot taurus 357s lol. PRICE FIRM. Ty. Also..... Just wanted to say thanks for all the trade offers but without sounding rude I'm just going to say straight up I probably won't reply. The perfect trade for me, and literally all I'll respond too, would be either cash, or a $350 357 snub with cash/ammo to go with it. Just a little 357 with a good grip, old but nice, something you'd see in the movies, any brand, Idc what kind of hammer.  only other thing I'd even remotely be interested in is a ak or ar. I guess id maybe trade it for a 92fs too, but really I don't need another one lol, that'd have to be a fancy trade on your part. Sorry guys this is all I'm looking for. I'm very picky and honestly I have to be, bc I really like this taurus!If the ad is up I still have it. REDACTED"

The XC1 has been owned for less than two months and still works fine! I like this set up, but level II holsters only seem to happen for the surefire x300.
