$880 firm in cash or best trade offer.  
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, will consider others, depending.  Stripped lowers, nice AR/AK triggers, quality lightweight 12""-15"" AR rail and 12""+/- AR-10 rail.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers.

1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 & 7.62x39 reticles, other similar 1-6+x and 1-4x with nice clear glass and true 1x, QD mounts are a plus and some longer range scopes in 4-16x, 6-24x etc., needs to have good eye relief and clear glass.  I have some Nikon M-308 and M-223 4-16x I've picked up for around $300 in excellent condition and a little more with quality mounts.  I've been pleased with these, but open to others like Vortex etc.  Maybe nice micro red dots.  Not interested in online retail prices.Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  No lowballers, flakes or POS scammers!

While its Full-auto ancestor was made famous in the Battle of Berlin in 1945; the New PPS50/22 is styled like the PPSh-41. It is Semi-Auto, Drum or Clip -fed, caliber .22LR, Solid Wood Stock, and the Barrel has a Full-length, Perforated Heat Shield, just like the Soviet PPSh-41.
The PPS50/22 looks like the Soviet PPSh-41, especially when equipped with the Quick-release Drum Magazine.Made in .22LR caliber, you can Shoot All Day Long, because .22LR ammunition is inexpensive and reliable. With its adjustable rear sight and sharp-blade front sight, it rivals far more expensive rifles in accuracy.
The PPS50/22 has a secure , semi-auto action, a smooth trigger, a high-quality and nicely-fitted stock, making Shooting All Day Long very comfortable and a lot of fun! The PPS50/22 is equipped with studs to accept swivels and a sling.

$980 firm in cash or best trade offer.  Bud's has this one for $1,160 right now, so after your FFL fee, you still save over $200 on a like new(except for being fired) pistol. 
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, will consider others, depending.  Stripped lowers, nice AR/AK triggers, quality lightweight 12""-15"" AR rail and 12""+/- AR-10 rail.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers.

1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 & 7.62x39 reticles, other similar 1-6+x and 1-4x with nice clear glass and true 1x, QD mounts are a plus and some longer range scopes in 4-16x, 6-24x etc., needs to have good eye relief and clear glass.  I have some Nikon M-308 and M-223 4-16x I've picked up for around $300 in excellent condition and a little more with quality mounts.  I've been pleased with these, but open to others like Vortex etc.  Maybe nice micro red dots.  Not interested in online retail prices.Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  No lowballers, flakes or POS scammers!

$950 firm in cash or better in trade value.  Lots of trade offers so far, but nothing I'd rather have yet over this one yet.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, will consider others, depending.  Stripped lowers, nice AR/AK triggers, quality lightweight 12""-15"" AR rail and 12""+/- AR-10 rail.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers.  
AR uppers in 9mm with 5""-8"" barrel, 5.56 with 8""-10"" barrel and 7.62x39 with 8""-10"" barrel.  9mm lower, Law Tactical Gen 3-M, KAK Shockwave kits, side-charging upper receivers for 5.56 & 9mm.  New factory Glock 9mm 30+ round normal capacity mags.  I can get complete PSA and similar uppers shipped really cheap, but want to try and trade for some first.  No BCG needed on the 5.56.
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.

The Cold Hammer Forging of barrels is accomplished through intense hydraulic pressure applied at opposing angles by carbide steel hammers. During the hammering process, a mandrel is inserted into the bore while the carbide steel hammers shape the barrel around the mandrel creating the chamber, the lands, and the grooves. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the Cold Hammer Forging process creates a defect free bore and the most consistent chamber possible."

Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, will consider others, depending.  Stripped lowers, nice AR/AK triggers, quality lightweight 12""-15"" AR rail and 12""+/- AR-10 rail.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers.

1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 & 7.62x39 reticles, other similar 1-6+x and 1-4x with nice clear glass and true 1x, QD mounts are a plus and some longer range scopes in 4-16x, 6-24x etc., needs to have good eye relief and clear glass.  I have some Nikon M-308 and M-223 4-16x I've picked up for around $300 in excellent condition and a little more with quality mounts.  I've been pleased with these, but open to others like Vortex etc.  Maybe nice micro red dots.  Not interested in online retail prices.Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  No lowballers, flakes or POS scammers!

It was designed using state of the art engineering techniques, utilizing CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and CAE (Computer Aided Engineering). This product is 100% CNC machined for optimal performance.
The VG6 GAMMA 556 is a muzzle brake and compensator hybrid. It virtually eliminates recoil and minimizes muzzle movement. The unique combination of both braking and compensating features inspire shooter confidence and allows the shooter to make very fast follow up shots. Its unique chamber geometries give it a very soft feel in the shoulder and the gas ports dimensions have been strenuously tested to give the utmost control to the muzzle.
The VG6 GAMMA 556 has been tuned for versatility. While it is perfect for SBR’s and AR pistols the brake has been optimized for 10.5"" to 18.5"" barrel lengths. The Gamma 556 will allow you to saturate the target no matter how fast you shoot.

Designed for the discriminating shooter and professional end-users, VG6 Precision's EPSILON 556 affords you the best muzzle control and recoil mitigation the industry has to offer. This is a true combination muzzle brake / compensator / flash hider. Its performance is matched only by the amazing look of this device. The VG6 Epsilon 556 carries many of the same characteristics as the Gamma 556 with a few exceptions. Extended flash hiding prongs and no ports at the 12 o’clock positions allow uninhibited view from flash through optics or sights. The difference in porting is also noticed on the underside of the device where it has 6 valve holes to allow the fastest gasses reaching the second chamber to exit. This creates very soft low energy recoil that allows for absolute control.

I'm selling for $400. From Walther site: The all new CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an ideal combination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability to conceal comfortably. The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. Comes with two 8-round mags."

Hardly ever. Very accurate, and not as much recoil as one might expect. It's very present and powerful but not wild and unpleasant. The reinforced frame, barrel length and Hogue ergonomic grip help out a lot with that. Its a joy to shoot! Just looking to get my money back. May or may not have some loose ammo to go with as a small bonus. Comes with scope rings and original case. We split FFL transfer"
