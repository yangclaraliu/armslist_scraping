By decreasing the overall sound signature, suppressors help to preserve the hearing of recreational shooters, hunters, and hunting dogs around the world. SAFER HUNTING Most hunters do not wear hearing protection in the field because they want to hear their surroundings. The trouble is, exposure to even a single unsuppressed gunshot can, and often does, lead to permanent hearing damage. Suppressors allow hunters to maintain full situational awareness, while still protecting their hearing. The result is a safer hunting experience for the hunter, and for those nearby. NOISE COMPLAINTS As urban developments advance into rural areas, shooting ranges and hunting preserves across the country are being closed due to noise complaints. ACCURACY One of the most common problems for shooters is decreased accuracy caused by flinching in anticipation of the firearms discharge and recoil. By containing the explosion of the gunpowder at the muzzle, suppressors reduce recoil, and help decrease muzzle flinch. These benefits lead to improved accuracy, better shot placement, and more humane hunts.---HOW IT WORKS---1. Purchase the legal Solvent Trap that attaches to the end of your barrel of your rifle or pistol. 2. Complete the Form 1 tax form and send the $200 tax to the ATF (https://johnpierceesq.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-new-form-1/) 3. Wait until you get your Form 1 Tax Stamp Approval back from the ATF (Last I was told about 100 days) 4. ONLY ONCE APPROVED - You can now modify and drill out the cone cups and the end cap to allow projectile to pass through the Solvent Trap (now legally a suppressor) 5. Go shoot and notice the difference in sound! *It should be noted that Trump has vowed to remove Suppressors from this list that requires the $200 tax stamp fee, once that is done buying a suppressor will be like buying a shotgun - No tax."

The bolster, rear of breech and forward part of the lock plate show typical evidence of firing with corrosion from the percussion caps.

Hold the trigger back and it fires as fast as you pump it.It comes with a 30"" barrel with full choke and bead sight.Barrel and bore are bright and shiny. Internally, the barrel is like a mirror. This shotgun has been well maintained.The stock and forearm look good with no cracks, chips or gouges.There is no rust present.There was some very light freckling in a few spots which has been completely arrested.$475  is a very reasonable price for this classic shotgun.Will ship in state.Email me with any questions.Email me if you want more pictures.

Shot less than 100 rounds through it. Still in brand new condition with no scratches or marks. The Benelli Nova® is an innovatively designed Pump-Action Shotgun made from hi-tech materials. The Nova is an ultra reliable, nearly indestructible pump shotgun that's ideal for all-round rugged use. This Nova is finished with the Realtree MAX-4® camo pattern, designed specifically for waterfowl hunting. Filled with cattails, swamp grasses, and cane, MAX-4 blends in with marshlands as well as corn stubble and other agricultural cropland. Benelli constructs the Nova with corrosion-proof polymer over-molded on a skeleton framework to form single-piece receiver and buttstock for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. The polymer forearm pushes a rotary-head bolt back with dual-action bars. Aggressive ribbing on the pistol grip and forearm provide a secure hold on the gun under any circumstances. A magazine disconnect button on the bottom of the forearm allows user to quickly unload the chamber without releasing another round from the magazine to quickly load another round via the ejection port in the event that a different shooting situation suddenly presents itself. The matte finished steel barrel features ventilated stepped rib with a mid bead and red-bar front sight. The Nova utilizes a magazine cap that doubles as a tool for pushing out the single pin that holds the trigger assembly in place, making fieldstripping fast and easy. The 12 gauge Nova has a 3-1/2"" chamber. The Benelli Nova Pump-Action Shotgun comes with 3 standard screw-in choke tubes (F, M, IC), and choke tool.Realtree MAX-4 finish matches waterfowl habitatInnovatively designed with hi-tech materials1-piece receiver and buttstockRotating bolt headDual-action barsMagazine disconnect buttonStepped vent rib barrelSimple fieldstripping"

This is a beautiful gun and has been officially graded excellent by gun pros. There is absolutely no rust at all on this gun. It was either in a very lightly used condition or the arsenal did a great job of refinishing the gun. It had a very light coating of cosmolene unlike others that I've had that look like they been immersed in a bath of vaseline. The stock is absulutely beautiful to be 60+ years old. There are no ""battle scars"" on this metal or stock and only has some light discoloration near the butt of the gun. The bore is very clean and very shiny and looks to have great rifling left, no pitting at all! This is one of the finest SKS rifles or I would say military rifles that you will find per the condition. There is all matching numbers on the items that have serial #'s. This gun is the M59/66 variant and therefore has the grenade launcher attachment.The history behind this gun from the lot that it was bought in was that is was manufactured by Zastava. The M59/66 was adopted in 1967 through 1972 and was quickly replaced by the AK. After getting their use they were put into storage in Slovenia and stayed there until they were deemed unneccesary and then entered into circulation for import. Can meet in the Lenoir City/ Kingston Area. IT comes with the leather mag ouch, oiler, oil mag pouch, sling, and accesory kit. No trades, No low ball offers!"

A wide range of combs can be purchased for it, to get a perfect personalized fit. The G2, with installation, was about $800.   The TM1 ""special"" also has the completely adjustable, sought after, P4 trigger. The entire trigger group is easily removed and swapped for another if desired. The trigger on this Perazzi is a ""release trigger"", but can be changed back to a ""pull trigger"" easily.Perazzi is the ultimate trap gun, it is top quality and will not disappoint.There are a couple minor wear spots, and a couple very small, light scratches. There is also a crack on the top of the comb (it won't show up in pictures). This gun functions flawlessly. The pictures do not do it justice.I know $2500 is a lot to spend this time of year, I would consider  $1000-$1500 cash + possible other firearms.In Vancouver, prefer a local, ftf sale.Thank you."

A single/double action gun that shoots straight and very smooth. I have additional pictures available upon request.  A hammer fired weapon similar to a 1911, but a lot more reliable in a 9mm package. These guns were the ""go-to"" firearms for law enforcement officials with their proven reliability. This particular gun was purchased new and lived in a safe since new and I acquired it from my father, so I know the history since new. Only fired about 50 times, and still has the original paint on the slide spring. Pistol is in mint condition, light for a fully metal gun, very accurate and reliable."

Put an XD® Mod.2® in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.
Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.
The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.
If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact 9mm."
