The only thing not factory besides the new wood is a Perazzi single trigger installed at great expense ($2500!). If you don't know, the Perazzi single trigger is the most reliable on the planet. You can buy this gun as it is, ready to shoot serious competitions, or you can have the AAHE engraving added to the barrels and action and have a fine Parker upgrade worth over $25,000. The engraving can be done at anytime and we work with a master engraver that can do the work to historical Parker perfection. To have it upgraded would be fantastic. They only made 185 AAHE 12 bores, and only 1 with vent rib or beavertail forend. You will never find an original AAHE with these features. Engraving and finishing can be done for less than $9000 to Parker perfection. You have choices on this one."

From the manufacturer:
Through an ingenious and simple arrangement we have solved the main disadvantage of Bullpup rifles; case ejection. Traditional side ejection is not ambidextrous and forward eject, like in the FN 2000 or the Kel-Tec RFB, is quite complex.
The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. Obviously, the bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower full auto rate (when applicable).
The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies. Bolt, bolt carrier, firing mechanism, ejector chute and bolt stop are identical for all variations. The short stroke gas operated piston is fully adjustable for different ammunitions and muzzle attachments."

A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Instore purchase will require a MN permit to acquire or carry license.$599   Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability, and pairs with the elevation adjustable front sight for a solid, reliable aiming system. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.   Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.     Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.   Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.

When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.             Loaded Chamber IndicatorTaurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms"

See full description and website link belowFrom their website: https://www.strikeindustries.com/shop/g4-slidecomp.html""Strike Industries presents the industry’s first slide mounted compensator for Glock Gen4 pistols, with the SIG4 SlideComp. By mounting the compensator to the slide, the SI-G4-SCOMP requires no permanent modification to the host platform, and eliminates the need for a threaded barrel. The profile of the compensator aligns with the slide for holster compatibility, while the internal geometry and ports work to reduce muzzle rise and perceived recoil. For one handed manipulations, the compensator can be used to push-wrack the slide against hard surfaces, to clear malfunctions or lock the slide back for a reload. Combine with the SI-GUM for ultimate gunsmith-free“go-fast” Glock that can still be reverted to stock configuration.""***Will not work with G42 and G43***"

Only 1,836 of these rifles were imported into the US from 1959 to 1963. ATF stopped import as the receivers are cut for the auto sear making conversion too easy. The 1,836 that made it in are exempt from all NFA laws and are consider a regular semi-auto rifle....just really rare! These are not only rare but are considered to be some of the best made FALs. A rare opportunity to add one to your collection!Also offered with this rare rifle is an equally rare OIP FAL scope and mount. From our research both the scope and mount are original FAL items. The scope's optics are clear, reticle is fine and both the windage and elevation knobs work fine. Exterior shows some wear, but no damage to the optics. This is a rare and clean original scope!Rifle is all matching. Lower receiver, upper receiver, carrier, bolt and barrel all match. The hand guards are believe to be original but have different numbers on the inside surfaces as shown in the pictures. We believe that the hand guards were not matched to these rifles on import. If this is true the gun can be called ""all matching"". From our research it appears that the hand guards do not match the rifles, but there is some question as to whether or not these are the original hand guards that this rifle was imported with as G Series FALs came with a mix of hand guards to include metal, wood and synthetic like this one. Please note the flash from the camera makes the hand guard's appear more discolored and non-matching then they are. They look uniform and nice on the rifle.This rifle comes with everything shown to include:1) Original OIP Scope and mount. The rifle's original top cover is also included as shown in the pictures.2) One (1) original 20 round metric magazineRifle's overall condition is estimated at 95% Condition. Bore looks perfect. We tried to take a pic of the bore but had no luck getting a usable image. Rest assured it is shiny and New looking. Wood butt stock looks New. Gun has been fired as there are some light spent casing marks on the right side. Exterior shows some minor wear but no rust, pitting or damage, just some light handling marks. Overall this is a fine looking rifle you will be proud to own!This is a true No Reserve auction, so this rare rifle is going home to someone once the bidding stops. Do not miss out!"

The barrel was cut down and crowned. The stock was carved down from its original configuration. I have shot this a few times and it is impressively accurate.

So I'd say the finish is at like 95%. However, with the finish it has, it's difficult to see anything unless you're up close in specific light.

To give you an idea on the color. It's dubbed Scorpion. In different lights it changes from Green to brown, to an almost gold/fde color. It's ONE OF A KIND.
