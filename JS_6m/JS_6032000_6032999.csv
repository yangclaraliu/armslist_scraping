This has been used and has some markings from the military owner. It does have some dings but no cracks or damage that would affect the preformance in any way. I never got the chance to fire it but the bluing and all is in fantastic condition and would be fine to shoot right out of the case. I cleaned her up as soon as I got her which wasn't too bad in cosmo but enough to cover and protect.    These(Imperial stampings) are no longer for sale and I believe I could easily get more for this but am selling fast  to cover  medical expenses. This is the first thing I ever owned that I truly enjoyed and would have held on to for a very long time if I could have. Anyone looking for one will be happy with this when they see her.Face to face, cash only. You must have valid drivers license or TN issued ID. No felonies and price is firm. Thank youI also have an unopened tin can of ammo for this 440 count for $125.00(looking for can opener)"

All of these kits are in like new condition and have just come out of the original cases. I have both single units as well as factory sealed 10 count case lots available.There is some conjecture on exactly what Naval component these were designed for but whoever it was put together a fantastic kit. These feature a two sided construction which can be separated without opening either module depending on the users needs. Within the outer wrapping each module is individual vacuum sealed allowing for a very rugged piece of gear with an indefinite shelf life. The two sides are separated and labeled as “Side A” and “Side B” with “A” consisting of items useful in shelter and food gathering activities and “B” including items designed for escape and evasion / rescue oriented activities. The contents of each side are as follows:Side A:Fishing Kit, Emergency Saw, Finger Ring Survival Blanket Plastic Bag, Zip-Lock       Candle         Snare Wire Side B: Fire Starter, Magnesium Knife, PocketSignalling MirrorCompass, Smoke Chaser (commercially made Brunton engineer type)Plastic Bag, Zip-LockWhistle, Extreme ColdWater Bag, Drinking Matches, waterproofThese kits offer the user everything needed for basic survival type activities making them ideal for a variety of applications. As a part of a disaster kit, get home bag, bug out kit, deer camp load out, or as a component of your car gear these are priceless (especially if you have the need to use them). From the collectors point of view these also offer a unique opportunity to add a rare USN related item to your collection. There is a great review as well as some detaled photos at the link below. http://www.donrearic.com/usmcskit.html-Price: $60.00 each or a sealed case of 10 for $500.00-Shipping: Available at actual cost**I have more detailed photos available.

I swapped the curved trigger in a while ago but found I was way more accurate with the flat trigger.    Front sight is fixed, rear is drift adj. side to side, shoots point of aim for me with 230gr ball.  Comes with 3 mags, all have +2 extensions and Wolff +5% springs.  I also added some grip tape and some newer EAA plastic grips as the wood ones the gun came with were really slick. Gun is in good condition and functions perfectly.  Will include a plastic case, original wood grips and original curved trigger as shown in the picture.
Located in Phoenix, NW Valley.  Need to see an AZ drivers license or CCW, can provide a bill of sale if you'd like. PM if interested. Thanks for looking."

Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position.  Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand"

There is some pitting on the bottom metal of the gun's action that leads me to wonder if some owner before me failed to clean it properly after shooting it. There is also a scratch that can be seen on the trigger guard. All of this is cosmetic but I want to make sure that you are aware of it. I endeavored to get good pictures from various angles so you could realistically see the gun's condition on all the main parts. I had the shotgun recently serviced by a gunsmith when I noticed some play in the moving part that holds the shells in the magazine tube. It turned out to be the 2-part threaded fastener that holds the shell stop to the inside of the gun. It was replaced, reassembled, and test fired multiple times and worked much better. I ran fifty 2-3/4"" shells through it after that and it shot very well.I'm not interested in trades as I need the cash. I am a NRA certified firearms instructor located in Siloam Springs, Ark.

I purchased it brand new a few months ago and have only taken it to the range 3 times. It has only 270-300 rounds through it, ie, I put maybe 9 or 10 mags through it, and that's all. The gun functions flawlessly, it looks brand new with barely a single scratch or smudge, and it shot anything I put through it without a single jam or FTF or FTE. It produces average 5 shot groups around 1.0 - 1.5 inches at 100 yards when scoped, and could probably do a bit better with a proper load work-up, as I was just using factory ammo. I have the Geissele SuperSCAR 2-stage trigger already installed, which breaks very nicely at around 4 pounds. I'm selling this gem simply because as cool as it is, and as flawless as it is for what it is, this is just not my type of thing... In terms of rifle shooting I'm really just an old school benchrest guy, but had thought I would try my hand at AR style shooting for the first time ever. And so I picked this up a few months ago to give it a whirl. But once a precision shooter, always a precision shooter...it just kinda hurts my eyes to look at paper groups bigger than 1/4 inch at 100 yards. I guess you gotta know who you are in life and stick with it: So when the zombie apocalypse comes, I'll be best utilized by my tribe standing off at distance, methodically taking out targets with my high-precision rigs :) ... others will be better utilized for the CQB spray and pray type of work. :) We gotta be who we are :) The gun will come with the Geissele trigger already installed, and the attached UTG bipod I'll just throw in."

I purchased it brand new a few months ago and have only taken it to the range 3 times. It has only 270-300 rounds through it, ie, I put maybe 9 or 10 mags through it, and that's all. The gun functions flawlessly, it looks brand new with barely a single scratch or smudge, and it shot anything I put through it without a single jam or FTF or FTE. It produces average 5 shot groups around 1.0 - 1.5 inches at 100 yards when scoped, and could probably do a bit better with a proper load work-up, as I was just using factory ammo. I have the Geissele SuperSCAR 2-stage trigger already installed, which breaks very nicely at around 4 pounds. I'm selling this gem simply because as cool as it is, and as flawless as it is for what it is, this is just not my type of thing... In terms of rifle shooting I'm really just an old school benchrest guy, but had thought I would try my hand at AR style shooting for the first time ever. And so I picked this up a few months ago to give it a whirl. But once a precision shooter, always a precision shooter...it just kinda hurts my eyes to look at paper groups bigger than 1/4 inch at 100 yards.

I purchased it brand new a few months ago and have only taken it to the range 3 times. It has only 270-300 rounds through it, ie, I put maybe 9 or 10 mags through it, and that's all. The gun functions flawlessly, it looks brand new with barely a single scratch or smudge, and it shot anything I put through it without a single jam or FTF or FTE. It produces average 5 shot groups around 1.0 - 1.5 inches at 100 yards when scoped, and could probably do a bit better with a proper load work-up, as I was just using factory ammo. I have the Geissele SuperSCAR 2-stage trigger already installed, which breaks very nicely at around 4 pounds. I'm selling this gem simply because as cool as it is, and as flawless as it is for what it is, this is just not my type of thing... In terms of rifle shooting I'm really just an old school benchrest guy, but had thought I would try my hand at AR style shooting for the first time ever. And so I picked this up a few months ago to give it a whirl. But once a precision shooter, always a precision shooter...it just kinda hurts my eyes to look at paper groups bigger than 1/4 inch at 100 yards. I guess you gotta know who you are in life and stick with it: So when the zombie apocalypse comes, I'll be best utilized by my tribe standing off at distance, methodically taking out targets with my high-precision rigs :) ... others will be better utilized for the CQB spray and pray type of work. :) We gotta be who we are :) The gun will come with the Geissele trigger already installed, and the attached UTG bipod I'll just throw in."

The smudge on the stock is from the cleaning rag that had barrel cleaner on it.  Price also includes the rifled and scoped barrel. Your getting 2 guns in one. Asking $200. I live in the Dacono/Erie area off of I25 & Exit 232."
