The Specialist is one of the newest additions to the Dan Wesson stable. When police departments approached us to build them a more reliable, durable 1911 to replace the ones they had been carrying, we developed a model just for them. The additions that made it ideal for law enforcement also make it perfect for home defense, so we gladly offer it for sale to the public.
A full-size 1911, the Specialist is chambered in .45 and loaded with features to satisfy a public servant’s special requirements. The forged stainless steel slide wears our popular Clark-style serrated rib with a single amber tritium dot in the rear sight and a green lamp with white target ring in front.
The frame sports an integral 1913 Picatinny, 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and recessed slide stop to enable the installation of laser grips. Equipped with an ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and detachable two-piece magwell, the Specialist is operator-friendly. It is finished off with a set of G10 VZ Operator II grips that force the hand into the beavertail and hold it there."

This rifle represents the first new innovation in the muzzleloading industry in many years. In development since 2008, this patent-pending rifle takes in-line muzzleloaders to the next level by removing the need for an external hammer and replacing it with an internal StrikerFire™ System. The StrikerFire system works on the same principal as modern center-fire rifle safeties. To cock the gun, simply slide the striker button forward until it locks, then fire. The recessed de-cocking button allows for quick and quiet de-cocking of the firearm. The gun also comes equipped with an automatic de-cocking mechanism, so when the gun is opened, it is automatically de-cocked. By eliminating the external hammer you get faster lock times, plus the ability to mount your scope closer to the bore allows the gun to operate with less weight. Traditions™ equipped the StrikerFire™ LDR with some additional features. The StrikerFire™ is outfitted with a TAC2™ two-stage trigger that is set at 2 pounds and is creep free. It comes equipped with the Stow-N-Go removable butt pad. This allows the butt pad to be removed with the press of a button for convenient storage inside the stock. The StrikerFire™ LDR also features a premium CeraKote finish, black composite stock, one-piece Accelerator Breech Plug™ that allows you to fire both loose or pelletized powder without changing the breech plug, a Dual Safety System, and Speed Load System that enables easier loading and more consistent groupings."

I changed jobs and had to move and I live in town now. I do not want to sell it very bad but I dont have a place to shoot more than 100 yds now and that is pointless with this rifle.

Made with the same materials and quality control as all GLOCK semi-automatic pistols, the G42 is a carry gun you can count on at the moment of truth. Internally, the GLOCK 42 employs the same striker, short-recoil operated, and locked-breech barrel as the larger framed GLOCK pistols, and uses a dual recoil spring assembly as the Gen4 pistols. The Safe-Action trigger system makes shooting in stressed situations infallible. The rough textured polymer grip provides a solid hold, and while quite concealable, it offers shooters enough surface area for ultimate control. The white-dot front sight and the white-bracket rear sight provide rapid acquisition in dim lighting situations. The length, shape, finger rest, and size of the trigger opening are the same as the larger pistols, and the trigger is same size and shape as the smooth-faced triggers used on the Gen4 pistols, making them all familiar to those who already use GLOCK pistols. The GLOCK 42 Semi-Auto Pistol is a reliable, easy to maintain firearm that's perfect for everyday carry. The G42 comes with 2 ultra-reliable single-stack 6-round magazines.Manufacturer: GlockModel: 42Caliber: .380 AutoBarrel: 3.25""Capacity: 6+1"

Experience one of the most innovative developments in modern firearms technology with the patented KRISS Vector Platform. At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.


The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.


The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½ barrel.
