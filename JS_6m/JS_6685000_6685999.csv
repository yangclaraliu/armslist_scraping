It's part of the fun in shooting, cleaning the equipment afterwords. That being said this Walther is in perfect order LNIB. It comes with two mags, and the factory case.

However, the Union arsenals had a million or more muzzleloading rifled muskets still on hand. How to modernize the weaponry without simply throwing away all those existing guns? The task was put to Springfield Arsenal master armorer Erskine Allin in 1864, and he devised a “trapdoor” style of conversion to turn an old Springfield muzzleloader into a breechloader. He had the benefit of having seen the previous year’s extensive trials of breechloaders, but the final product was his combination of what he judged to be the best elements of the ideas available. The result has long been known colloquially as the Trapdoor Springfield, and this 1864 model was the very first of them. It was still in .58 caliber, and used a rather complex extractor system. It would soon be revised to make improvements to it, and ultimately a .45-70 model became standard for US infantry and cavalry forces – and remained their standard until the adoption of the Krag-Jorgensen in the 1890s. 3% Surcharge on all Credit Card TransactionsNO CALIFORNIA SALES!"

Intended to be the new service rifle of the Soviet Red Army production was disrupted by the German invasion in 1941 resulting in a switch back to the older Mosin-Nagant bolt-action rifle for the duration of WWII. After the war new rifles were adopted by the Soviet, SKS and AK-47.
Developed from the earlier SVT-38, the SVT-40 became available to re-equip some Soviet units just in time for the German invasion.The increased firepower of these formations came as an unpleasant surprise for the invaders. It has been called the ""Soviet M1 Garand"" because it was to be the new battle rifle for the Soviets to replace the aging Mosin-Nagant."
