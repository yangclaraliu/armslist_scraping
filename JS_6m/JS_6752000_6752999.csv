The Spike’s Tactical Enhanced LPK was designed for the end user who demands the most longevity possible out of the parts in their rifles. The core of the Spike’s Enhanced LPK is the ST Battle Trigger which is a single stage Mil-Spec trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector that’s plated with Nickel Boron to give the Battle Trigger a very smooth and crisp trigger pull that gets even smoother the more you shoot it. The Battle Trigger is held in place via KNS Gen II Mod II Anti-Rotation pins which keep the hammer and trigger pins from walking out (a problem in some 9mm ARs and full auto M4/M16s) and keeps the pin holes from enlarging and “egg-holing” after years and years of use. And we’ve also included an Ambidextrous Safety Selector, our ST Billet Trigger guard with set screw, and our Ergo grip featuring our Spike’s Spider logo. The Spike’s Enhanced LPK also features a Mil-Spec bolt catch, mag catch, and mag catch button. As well as utilizing Mil-Spec detents, plungers, pins, and springs. We also include quality spiral roll pins for the trigger guard and bolt catch as well as a ¼” allen screw and washer for the Ergo grip.

That really has a ring to it eh?  And so does that Enblock clip when it ejects on the eight shot ""Pingggg!"" 

The Canadian born weapon designer John Garand really created a piece of American history when he came up with this rifle. (That is Garand not Grand)
 
This particular rifle (according to the serial number - 4308383), was built to fight Communism in the Korean Peninsula in 1959 at the National Armory at Springfield Massachusetts (not the same as the modern gun company of the same name). The Springfield Armory came out with the highest quality M1 Rifles every year since they started making them in 1937.
 
Stock
This rifle has solid lock up between the receiver-stock-trigger group. (very similar to it's relative the M14/M1a) You can see plenty of dings in the wood, this rifle may or may not have seen oversees service but if you have spent one day in the military or even just seen a war movie, you know that a wooden rifle stock will get banged up. This stock has a rich red color in the walnut as well as the typical dings from service in the field. Imagine, some of these dings could have been made right next door at Fort Bragg. Overall the stock is in great shape. The upper half of the wood has an oil finish and the lower half has been varnished. There is a circular area on the right side butt where the varnish was removed (probably to erase a rack number).  With a little de-greaser, fine steel wool, and a fresh coat of linseed oil (the original finish) the walnut stock will look beautiful. I have made many old military stocks look almost brand new with this method. Right now there is some cosmoline storage grease still left in some spots on the wood and steel (it has a brown and greenish tint in the photos). 

SteelThe finish is Pakerization (as all M1s are) and it is in excellent condition. All components (other than the butt plate) have minimal wear on the finish. The Gas Cylinder is stainless steel (as they all were), the Gas Cylinder is finished with the late war (it took a while for the Army to find a good high temp finish for Stainless Steel) Dichromemate Black. I could not get a good photo of the rifling, but it is there! The barrel is in used but good condition. The crown is quite sharp compared to most M1s I have seen. With a CMP gauge the muzzle reads a 1+ and the throat reads a 4+.
Included in these deal is an empty eight round Enblock clip, and a hard rifle case specially made for M1s by CMP.  
 
Remember, General Patton called the M1 the, ""greatest battle implement ever devised."" 
 
""This is my M1 Garand Rifle, there are many like it, but this one is mine.""Email me for more photos. Sorry, not interested in trades. I will ship from and to an FFL."

I’d like to stay away from .380 but haven’t ruled them out totally. Not interested in Black Powder, Pump shotguns, archery, or anything in rough condition. Money can go either way. There is no tax or background check. But this is on my C&R. That means Federal law requires me to record your name, address, phone number, Driver license number (or whatever you use for ID), and get a signed bill of sale. So if you aren’t okay with full disclosure; this isn’t for you.  If you need more pictures, I have some, let me know."

There is no tax or background check. But this is on my C&R. That means Federal law requires me to record your name, address, phone number, Driver license number (or whatever you use for ID), and get a signed bill of sale. So if you aren’t okay with full disclosure; this isn’t for you.
