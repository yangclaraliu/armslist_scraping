There was some question of this on HKPro, but I contacted HKUSA and had them research the serial # for me to confirm it is in fact a SR9T, and not a re-marked SR9. I will provide the email to the buyer, so you can see it is legit. I have shot roughly 250 rounds through it since buying it. I upgraded the rear sight to the ten 4 1200M sight. I still have the original drum rear and it too will go with the rifle. I added the excellent Spuhr handguard, which feels lighter than the original plastic handguard (which I do not have). The Spuhr unit is rock solid. I also upgraded the stock to a PSG1 stock as it allows you to use both an optic and the iron sights with ease"

This is the more desirable heel stamped model (like an M1 Garand). It is in a synthetic stock but comes with an extra wood (walnut?) stock. It comes with 8 20 round magazines: 4 USGI marked BRW S-I (correct weld spots and latch plate holes as far as I can tell) and 4 unknown manufacturer (I looked these up and they look like Norinco mags but IDK for sure). Also included is a 1st gen (I think) Springfield Armory scope mount. The internals are in excellent shape and the chrome-lined barrel is shiny as it should be. It is a great shooter as it sits or it would make an excellent base for a clone build or match rifle given the correct forged receiver. I have put less than 100 rounds through it but I am not the original owner so I don't know the actual round count. It functioned as it should through the few rounds I've put through it. It doesn't have any USGI parts other than the stock as far as I can tell. The M14 itself is valued at $1000 given that it is the more desirable heel stamped model, not side stamped. The mags are $35 each for the USGI (4x35=$140) and $20 each for the Norinco (4x20=$80). The Springfield Armory scope mount is valued at $60. The extra wood (walnut?) stock is around $40. Total trade value is $1320. I will not separate this package.  Communication through Email is preferred. I can text if necessary. Absolutely no calls. I generally respond pretty quickly to Emails, unless it's at night when I'm sleeping.You must be willing to meet me in the Tri-Cities area.I will not ship. Please don't ask.

I fired 150 rounds through it without incident. However, the rear sight could stand to be replaced. The one on it is a little wobbly. Not sure, but I think it may be off a 92 model. Included is everything pictured; three factory 15 round mags, ambidextrious holster, and a dual mag pouch. I paid $250 for it plus $20 for the mag release repair.

Also have 38 special for 45 per 1000+ local pick up and 60 per 1000+ ground. Also 357 mag for 50 per 1000+ Locally and 65 per 1000+ ground. These are great to work with and save a ton of work for single stage loaders and are a breeze to run through the progressive by removing the decapping pin stage 1.

Target Sports USA carries the entire line of Remington ammunition for sale online with free shipping on bulk ammo including this Remington Golden Saber 357 Magnum Ammo 125 Grain Brass Jacketed Hollow Point.Remington Golden Saber 357 Magnum Ammo 125 Grain Brass Jacketed Hollow Point ammo review offers the following information; Remington puts their all into the Golden Saber line and this 357 Magnum cartridge shines like the rest! In developing the Golden Saber line, Remington demanded that it would meet four precarious fundamentals; match-type accuracy, deep penetration, maximum expansion and virtually 100% weight retention. Remington Golden Saber also features mouth and primer waterproofing for longevity of the rounds, they are treated with powder for a low muzzle flash and primers that must go through three (3) inspections before being on the market. Remington's Gold Saber 357 Magnum was designed specially for law enforcement and self defense applications. Remington 357 Magnum is loaded with a 125 grain brass Jacketed Hollow Point. Dead serious innovation, a superior bullet for when stakes are high, this high performance jacket handgun ammunition was built around revolutionary hollow point design. The bullet jacket is made of brass, which releases energy over longer distance while mushrooming and a spiral nose cut feature allows mushrooming at a lower velocity without sacrificing penetration or terminal performance. The precise hollow point cavity design also increases penetration by minimizing lead core deformation. Remington Golden Saber is new production, non-corrosive ammunition in boxer primer and re-loadable brass cases."
