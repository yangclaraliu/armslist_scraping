It's time to let this jewel go to someone who will actually use it and hopefully pass it down to the next generations. It is in immaculate condition for what it is, in my opinion but please definitely come on by and check it out for yourself.This is a Winchester Model 70, built to perfection (in my humble opinion) in 1952 (true Pre-64 w/ Controlled Feed Action), chambered in the trusty ol' All-American 30-06 -- and has been cared for very well in my family since it was purchased by my grandfather back in 1953 (or so he told me, many...many times lol). Seriously though, I've kept good care of this rifle for so long but without getting any use for so many years it's time for it to go to a good person who will use it well. Bore is in excellent condition, finish is great, and comes as is (without optics), but with the leopold mount as pictured.$700Photos: http://imgur.com/a/xu2Vcemail me at REDACTED for the quickest response since I check that most often.

It is as close to an HK91 as you can come without spening $2000 or more. I've already set the price to my lowest consideration, but I will negotiate. Only trading I'll consider regarding this firearm is $1000 cash and partial trade. Optics, pistols, ammo (9mm, .45, .223, 300 blk) etc. No hunting gear or ""antique"" stuff. Otherwise I'm definitely not interested in your trade. Amazing rifle, pings targets at 300-400 yards, no problem, utlizling iron sights. GA date code on HK components. Has the integrated bipod, extremely easy to deploy and maintain while shooting. Package includes 16 mags, 5 still boxed in german labeled container, and a 30 rd extended mag that has been cerakoted. All mags are marked Rheinmetall. I have an HK paratrooper stock as well; I can throw it in for $100. $150 for just the paratrooper stock. Price for the whole package is negotiable. Low ballers will be ignored. Email for photos or any questions you may have. Thanks for looking."

Although they are all 3/8"" AR500 steel and can take high power fire, each one is designated for a different caliber so it flips correctly. The small one will flip with .22 lr, medium is for 9mm, .40, .45, etc, and the big one is for 556, 7.62x39, .308, etc.These are great for just throwing them down and shooting. The flipping is great feedback as well, there's never a doubt if you made the shot."

As great as this pistol is I just don't shoot it enough to justify keeping it.This firearm was an unissued LE gun so it was purchased by a department, placed in a safe and never fired. I put 200 problem-free rounds through it so the frame, slide and barrel are in very nice shape. It is the NTS version so there is no external thumb safety. This pistol has Ameriglo I-Dot Pro Night Sights installed (single tritium dot in the rear and a tritium dot in front with bright orange outline) which are some of the best self-defense sights on the market. Pictures will be posted later today and I can email more upon request.This deal includes the following:-M&P 40 Full Size pistol (no thumb safety)-Two 15-round magazines-Original case-3 Backstraps (small, medium & large)-Ameriglo I-Dot Pro Night Sights installedMy price is $360 and is by far the best deal you will find on this pistol with night sights considering you pay no sales tax, shipping, credit card fees or FFL fees.I have bought and sold many guns through Armslist with no issues and want to keep it that way. I only deal with responsible adults over the age of 21 with a valid Indiana Driver’s License.

This Daniel Defense has had a total of only 100 rounds of 55gr. FMJ fired through it total and I am the original owner who purchsed this package deal directly from Daniel Defense through my employer. I purchased this rifle about 4 years ago to use as a duty rifle but just havent carried it as it was just too nice to carry to me. If you know anything about Daniel Defense the company advertises their rifles as Mil-Spec Plus and I agree as this is the finest built rifle I have ever owned.This version has the lightweight barrel which makes a significant difference in weight and has 1/7 twist to accomdate any variety of ammo that you wish to use. Has free floated quad rail for any attachment that you would like to add to it but i never had any other attachments other than the factory vertical grip. Will come with all Daniel Defense furniture (sights, vertical grip, multi position stock) and also an Aimpoint Pro Red Dot optic that has the flip up lens covers and quick detatch base. The Aimpoint Optic is worth 400 dollars by itself.  The Aimpont Pro guarantees a 3yr battery life as well and lenses have great clarity. Will also include 3 30rd Gen2 Pmags for it as well. Their are some great reviews on youtube of this rifle if you are interested. This version also has removable front and rear sights so the front sight isnt fixed as it is on some of their rifle versions. Rifle also has plate attchment behind receiver that came from factory for use of a quick detatch single point sling but never used it.

Aquaterra finish. Suppressor height sights for cowitness with RMR. Used but good condition - storage/handling wear shown in pictures. Shipped only to US addresses where no legal restrictions apply, or FTF in Indianapolis area.SUAREZ V3 SI-319 RMR SLIDE - AQUATERRASuarez International has been making red dot ready slides for the Glock platform since 2011 with tighter tolerances to increase accuracy, reliability, and performance. The new Version 3 Suarez International Slide is made from the same 17-4 aerospace steel we have used since the beginning. It is heat treated to perfection and precision manufactured to more exact tolerances. The front of the slide is angled and contoured for ease of holstering and comfortable carry. The front serrations are ergonomically angled for best use either over or under in adverse conditions without being overdone or ostentatious.The barrel locking areas at the front and rear of the ejection port are manufactured with greater attention to detail and more exact tolerances for a greater accuracy over the OEM model while still using the factory barrel. When used with a match-quality barrel, accuracy will be increased over what is possible with the same barrel in an OEM factory slide. As well, the smooth internal finish will improve the trigger and feel of the action.The ejection port on the Suarez Match Slide has been lowered by .100"", and contoured to increase the reliable and predictable ejection of spent cases. The ""brass to the face"" seen in some factory OEM slides is eliminated 100%. Brass is ejected forward and to the side in a repeatable and reliable manner. In fact, in our tests, all ejected brass landed within a 26"" circle to the shooters 2 o'clock.As always, the dovetail for the Trijicon RMR is cut in exacting detail during the manufacturing process. The RMR sits tight in the dovetail, and secured solidly at a center zero point on the slide. To insure reliability, the material removed is a close equivalent in weight to a Trijicon RMR. Thus an RMR-equipped Suarez Slide weighs virtually the same as a standard factory slide, enhancing the reliability factor.The Suarez Match Slide comes finished in Aqua Terra Nickel. This finish is designed specifically to withstand any hostile environment an operator could possibly find on this earth. Whether you need to fight in the searing heat and weapon-grinding sand of a middle eastern desert, in the salty gun-rusting cold of a North Sea oil rig, or in the rotting green mass of a tropical jungle, the AquaTerra™ system will withstand anything you could possibly encounter and deliver the reliability and accuracy that has become hallmark for Suarez products."

The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.

Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.

The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.   Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.

It is an ATI OMNI-Hybrid Multi-Cal AR-15 model, chambered in .223/5.56, with a Troy Industries Barrel.Rifle is fully functional, sold as is in picture. I bought it used with general wear and tear, fired a hundred rounds or so, and then put it away deep into the dark depths of my gun storage. I'm not using it, so here it is.Things to know about this purchase:- This model features metal-reinforced polymer recievers to cut down on weight. No change from a normal AR in functionality.- The FDE color was done to achieve a battle-scarred appearrance.- Most parts are original.- Sights are worn-out TROY Industries flip ups, the $180 M4 version. They work but need some TLC.- Barrel is NOT original: it is a TROY Industries 16"" 5.56 NATO 1-7 twist barrel, on the higher spectrum of AR parts.- Random basic bipod included, I don't need it.- The pictured Optic is an FM Optics 4x32 Prismatic Sight with mounted picatinny rails. I have also had it around, still in box, never used. Please take it for $50 with the rifle (it is $80 new).Price is firm! No trades... unless you have a milspec AR-15 (A2 post, collapsible stock, as A2 as possible, I can negotiate)I can meet at an FFL of your choice, just have it be lower in Denver, in the Springs, or somewhere in between. Castle Rock has a good one too. If you see this ad, it is available.Rifle, build, semi, painted"
