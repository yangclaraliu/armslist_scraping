This one is the new model introduced just last year. I bought it brand new and took it to the range once, and it shot great, but my health just doesn't allow me to get out to shoot that much anymore. So this fine pistol needs a home. It is 100% stock, and comes with the original factory box and papers as well as an additional Colt 8 round magazine. This gun features Novak sights, a crisp 4.5 pound trigger, and Colt's new recoil spring system developed for the U.S. Marine Corps which reduces recoil and has a longer service life than the original design. This pistol weighs 29.6 ounces empty, making it perfect for concealed carry. But, due to the recoil system, it feels like an all-steel gun when you fire it. I know, because I have an all-steel Commander as well.
This is a really nice pistol for the shooter who knows the difference between an actual Colt and a 1911 ""clone"". It is a bit more expensive than some other guns, but worth the difference.
You can make an appointment to see the pistol at my office just outside of Homestead. I will consider reasonable best offers on this gun, or consider partial trades of other high quality firearms toward the purchase. All laws will be complied with. Thanks for looking at my listing."

It could have been a training gun because it was originally marked as modified choke. This could have been done by Remington or by the Army when converted. Only a few known example exist that remain in the Trench gun configuration and the most worn out example These shotguns were used by the Army and the Marines post WW1 and were also used by the Treasury Dept against Bootleggers and also the Post Office as well. According to Springfield Research an example made two guns before this one went to the US Post Office in 1921. This one stayed in Service probably through the end of WW2, although by that time they were worn out and withdrawn from service."

WE ONLY HAVE One LEFT!!   Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability, and pairs with the elevation adjustable front sight for a solid, reliable aiming system. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.   Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.   Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.   Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul® PMAG®."

This is an excellent 6-shot pocket revolver that you can be proud to pass down to future generations.
The revolver comes with its factory box and papers, the original black rubber Colt grips that shipped with it, and a set of beautiful factory Colt wood grips I added to it later (they were not cheap). Not shown in the picture is an HKS speed loader that I will throw in with the deal. This is a beautiful revolver that has not been made in more than 20 years, and is for the Colt enthusiast who wants quality and will not settle for less.

This is a Century Arms JW-2000 12 Gauge Coach Gun with 20 inch barrels. This shotgun shoots 2 3/4 inch and 3 inch shells, and unlike most Coach Gun styles, which are cylinder bore, this one has chokes, making it much more useful for a wider variety of tasks. The right barrel is Modified Choke, and the left barrel is Full Choke. This means the gun will pattern better out to longer distances with shot loads. The gun has a decent blue finish, and a very nice looking wood stock. This is a solid gun and weighs in at about 8 pounds, so it won't beat you to death when you shoot it. It is very short and handy.
You can use this shotgun for home defense if you like. Its external hammers mean that it can safely be stored loaded, but un-cocked until needed, which you cannot do with an internal hammer gun. The chokes make it a great choice for a survival, camp, or hunting gun, in any role where you need a firearm but don't want to tie up a lot of money.
I've priced this gun so that it is easy to buy, but I will also listen to reasonable offers and consider trades. It never hurts to ask. You can see the gun by appointment at my office just outside of Homestead. All laws complied with. Thanks for looking at my listing.P.S. I listed this as a Stoeger, because that is the closest thing to the right brand. Century Arms is not a choice in the Armslist menu."

It seems everyone is these days. But, are you not sure what brand to buy? Or worse, are you tired of seeing people try to palm off their ""Frankenturd"" parts guns, put together on their kitchen table as ""Custom Built""? I know I am. So why not just start out with what you will ultimately end up with if you are serious about the AR platform, and that is a 100% genuine factory built Colt? Specifically the Colt LE6920 Law Enforcement Carbine.
This rifle has been fired a total of 18 rounds to sight it in.. It comes with the factory box and papers, as well as two (2) unopened Gen 2 30 round P-Mags. It is ready to use, as is, with the Mag Pul MBUS rear sight, and I've added an Elzetta flashlight mount with Streamlight white light on the front.
I bought this gun from a law enforcement distributor at a good price and never got around to using it, and now I need some cash for a project. I have an M1A for anything that needs to be shot with a rifle, so I will let this one go. I even have a little bit of ammo around for the Colt and some magazines if you need some.
So, if you are in the market for a 100% Mil-Spec gun (if you don't know what that means, just ask me) that you will never have quality questions about, make an appointment to see this rifle at my office just outside of Homestead. Price is fair and is pretty firm, but I will listen to offers. May be able to add extra mags or some ammo.
Thanks for looking at my listing."

It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels, accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol's grip also instinctively position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. A unique VP feature is HK's patented charging supports, simple components mounted on each side of the rear of the slide to provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating VP pistols easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. This pistol has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. It ships with two 15-round magazines.
