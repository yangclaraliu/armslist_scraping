This firearm features a delayed gas blowback system to allow it to be a very flat shooter, it is claimed to shoot 30% flater than its modern semi auto pistols counterparts. The CCP's slide works off of a gas piston that propels the slide forward when shot, allowing for Walther to implement a lighter recoil spring. This spring is so light you could rack it with 2 fingers and it still very reliable because of the gas system. For comparison, its the same as a glock 19 but, its a single stack. This is one of the best single stack 9 mm on the market. This firearm comes with a thumb safty, 2 magazines, gas port brush case, paperwork, holster, ect. It features a stainless steel slide which allows for a nice 2 tone effect.Looking to sell for $350 firm. Under 100 rds fired. Feel free to offer up a trade, I am willing to add cash too.

This slide gives a 4lbs trigger without changing any springs. A 1 week old covert frame package done by Landers Wepons system. This is a perfect blend of an edc stipple with finger guard removal,recon thumb ledges and a Jarvis tactical trigger undercut a zev magazine release.  To finish off this work of polymer art is an Overwatch precision DAT trigger. This flat trigger keeps all factory safety's in place.  This is a project gun I did and am selling it for another project gun. I am not in a hurry to sell this one and this gun and it was not a  Dremel and wood burner frame job. This is one of the best in the industry and was milled. This frame job has a 8 to 10 week wait time. Must have CCW and permit to purchase.Sig,Ruger,colt,Springfield,Smith and Wesson"

The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target.
This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which ensures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With a 2"" barrel and a red fiber optic front sight, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. This version of the 2"" Rhino is double action only, and does not have an external hammer. All 2"" barrel Rhino revolvers are supplied with a beautiful leather holster included."

It comes with the 45acp barrel and a KKM precision 10mm conversion barrel threaded with .578x28 to fit suppressors. 10mm is an approved handgun hunting caliber in unit M and the hearing protection act passed at the state level so now is your chance to use your 45ACP suppressor while hunting. It is pretty quiet even with supersonic loads. It works great without a supressor too and comes with a thread protector. The 10mm uses the same spring setup as the 45acp and cycles great."

I do not have the original box, as I bought it while on a motocycle ride about 4 years ago, and only used the included (and attached) sling to wear it home under my jacket. This was when they were difficult to find, and my price was the higher retail cost. It is wearing a Nikko Sterling red/green dot sight, and has a flip up iron sight with BDC that could be used on an M-4 variant.  The mini shotgun shells can fit 25 between the two tubes. They don't cycle well, but tons of fun to shoot them anyway!! It holds 15 rounds of the 2 inch shells. I've not had any feeding problems at all, which are known to be due to thw short-stroking of the shooter. The fraying of the sling is from it swinging in front of the barrel during a rapid buck shot sequence. It still holds plenty of weight. There is one buckle with a break, but no problems holding the strap together.I'm the only owner of this shotgun.I'm not interested in trades, and I don't HAVE to sell this gun. I'm looking to offload a few of my lerrer-used weapons to fund the cost of a dream rifle."

This is an M16A1 clone AR-15. I tried to keep the exterior aesthetics authentic to the early Vietnam era. You can see that it has a snap ring instead of the angled delta ring. The forward assist is teardrop shaped. Also, there is no brass deflector (lefties may want to pass on this one). The upper and lower are the contract run that Nodak Spud did for Brownells. The carry handle is an authentic A1 sight assembly with no elevation control. The furniture is all geniune USGI surplus, and shows scuffs, scratches, and battle wear appropriate to its age. Triangle handguards are cool. Three prong flash hiders are cool. I will also include a straight 20 round mag to complete the ensemble.I've shot a few hundred rounds through this with no failures. It's a real joy to shoot- the rifle length gas system and rifle buffer make it extremely controllable.Where does it differ from historical authenticity?1) It has a Geiselle G2S two-stage trigger. Sorry, I am spoiled by modern fire control groups and just can't stand the mil-spec grit and slop.2) The barrel is a 20"" Windham Weaponry chrome-lined 1:7 twist. Actual M16A1 barrels were 1:12 twist, which worked fine for varmint rounds and 55 grain ball, but sucked for anything heavier. I figured nobody would notice if I upgraded it to a moden twist rate that can actually shoot match ammo.Anyway, someone buy this cool gun from me.Looking for $800 for everything OBO.

Its 12-1/2 quart bowl capacity will allow you to polish up to 1,300 .38/.357 or 550 .30-06 cases per hour. Not only is our capacity greater, but our motor is larger in horse power, internally cooled, thermally protected, and turns on precision ball bearings. This is no ""hobby"" machine! The bowl and base are constructed of 7/32"" thick injection molded high-strength polypropylene which is impact and abrasion resistant.After we sold thousands of our famous first-generation FL-2000 case cleaners, customers who had purchased them began asking us to address the problem of separating the cleaned and polished brass from the cleaning media. We knew from the beginning that the simplest method of separating would be a rotating squirrel cage, but we had to find a design we could manufacture economically. Our problem was that it had to be BIG -- big enough to handle the entire load of the FL-2000-series case cleaners. The solution was an injection molded reversible part. Simple, and it works great. The CM-2000 Case/Media Separator is large, 10"" x 14"", and will hold more than 1,600 .38 Special cases. It sits on a large media collection tub that measures 18"" x 22"". The tub keeps the mess off the floor and bench. It's fast -- so fast it will remove media from 1500 rounds of .223 brass in a matter of seconds."

A Smith and Wesson M&P 40 Shield Performance Center. It's in excellent condition with no holster wear as I did not carry it often. I'm not sure of the round count, but it's fairly low (less than 500 rounds) and it cycles flawlessly. This is the model with the upgraded trigger, fiber optic sights, and ported barrel. Everything that came with the pistol is included, box, paperwork, 6 round and 7 round magazines, trigger lock, etc. I purchased this pistol new from Dick Harder at Harder Auto Parts in Clinton Twp last April 2016. The reason I am selling it is that I recently bought this same pistol in 45ACP to use the same ammo as my 1911. I don't need them both. I would rather sell this pistol outright, but I may entertain interesting trades (preferably hunting weapons). Take a look at the pictures and contact me with any questions. Buyer must have a purchase permit or CPL and a valid driver's license. Thank you for your time."
