The FiveseveN MKII by FN Herstal. This pistol may use small bullets but let me tell you it paks a punch!!!I have only had the opportunity to take this to the range a SINGLE TIME, and fired 1 box of 50 rounds. This Gun looks and feels 100% BRAND NEW. You wouldn't be able to tell it's even been fired. Absolutelty NO blemishes of ANY KIND, whatsoever. This pistol has a lot of PRO's for sure.Very little recoil compared to any other pistol caliber except .22lrExtrememly lightweightHigh-capacity 20-round mags comes standardVery high muzzle velocityHas better flight path than any other pistol caliberIncredibly accurateDoes severe damage to organic matter upon entry (8"" blast expansion inside organic matter)This package somes with 2,140 rounds (just shy of 43 boxes) of 40gr V-MAX blue tip (DANG THAT'S A TON OF AMMO!)5 total 20-round mags. 2 of which are still btand new in the boxand the MKII pistol of course.I paid $1,325  for the psitol after FFL Fee, $80 for the 2 extra mags. And $25 PER box so $1,070 for the ammo.$2,475 is what I spent on all of this. I'm looking for REASONABLE cash offers. No low ballers. Oddly enough this is one of only a handful of weapons that doesnt depreciate unless it's damaged. I know the market and i know this weapon. If you're interested please TEXT ONLY at 210TWO68513ONE.NO TIMEWASTERS! I may be open to trades but its doubtful. I am selling this because i need to free up some cash, not because i want your homemade AR. NOT desperate to sell so please make a serious offer. I will not be accepting pennines on the dollar.I AM NOT SPLITTING THIS PACKAGE UP!!!No i will NOT just sell the mags or just the ammo or just the pistol. You either buy it all or nothing. I am not trying to be rude but some people apparently cannot read and will STILL try and get me sell pieces separately even though i have clearly stated my terms. If you ask me to split this up, YOU WILL BE IGNORED."

Been kept in safe, less than a box of amp fed through it in 10 years.Colt series 80, or mk. iv series 80, are a line of firearms introduced in 1983 by Colt’s Manufacturing Company. The main difference between this guns and the previous Colt series 70 is that the former incorporate a new firing pin block safety system, consisting of a series of internal levers and a plunger positively blocking the firing pin from moving until the trigger is pressed, hence eliminating the possibility of the gun going of if dropped onto a hard surface or struck hard. Other than that, the Colt series 70 and the 80 series do not differ too much from one another. On the other hand, there is really no difference between the Colt 1911 series 80 and the M1991A1, which is mechanically the same as the colt 1911. Read more about the 1911 here at allaboutseries80.com.The Colt 1911 is a single-action, semi-automatic, magazine-fed, and recoil-operated handgun chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. The Colt series 80 was designed by John M. Browning and is still carried by some U.S. forces. It had widespread use during World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Currently, several law enforcing agencies and military organizations still use the colt 1911, such as the Marine Corps Special Operations Command, Los Angeles Police Department S.W.A.T. and L.A.P.D. S.I.S., the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, F.B.I. regional S.W.A.T. teams, and 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment—Delta and The Tacoma, Washington Police Department, in the United States alone. Other countries which have also used it at one point or another include Argentina, Bangladesh, Bolivia, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Fiji, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Indonesia, Liberia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Spain, and others.One of the reasons that the Colt 1911 is so popular is because it is easy to customize, allowing modifications such as changing the external finish, checkering the frame, and hand fitting custom hammers, triggers, and sears, as well as installing compensators and adding accessories like tactical lights and scopes. This property has made the series 80 a highly sought after item, not only by the military and police forces, but also by the general public. Most people use it either for target shooting or for protection. The name Colt has also been ingrained in popular culture since the days of the Wild West. For instance, legendary characters Wild Bill Hickok, John Henry “Doc” Holliday, Richard Francis Burton, Ned Kelly, and Robert E. Lee used to carry a Colt Navy, a predecessor of the 1911. Other vintage pistols are the Colt Army Model 1860, the Colt Dragoon Revolve and the Colt Single Action Army.

The trade would be well over $1,000 in your favor, but i dont really care, i just want a good 1903. I already have two 03A3's so dont even bother with those, i don't give a damn if its a smith corona, i neither want nor need one, an 03A4 however is a different story. I only want a genuine 1903 or 1903 Mark 1 and i would very much also be interested in an 03A4 sniper, looks and functions well, and is in good, working condition.

The rifle does have significant wear on the steel with most bluing worn off as with the bore being worn down some. I have used the rifle for hunting and for target shooting with decent accuracy if you use standard surplus ammo. One interesting feature for this rifle is that it was built on a Chatellerault Receiver thus the rifle is considered to an be Antique according to BATF standards. Chatellerault was only in production of the Mosin Nagants from 1892-1895 and this rifle has a receiver from during that time. The tang date was scrubbed however it still retains the factory stamps. I'm asking $500 for this rifle as no more are coming into the USA on top of this rifle being much harder to find. Price is negotiable. Those interested can contact me through email or text REDACTED

Barrel has been shortened to about 22.5 inches, stock cut down, bolt handle bent, and a black enamel type finish applied to most of the blued parts.Stock has a pretty decent crack behind the receiver tang as pictured. There's also a chip off the top of the stock next to the bolt handle (also pictured) Mechanically fine, feeds and cycles rounds alright, but I have never fired it. Would make a nice project, basically needs refinished and a stock repair (or new stock)I have another sporterized stock available that is a little longer than this one (still not full length), but not cracked and in decent shape that I'll include for another $40. Would probably require some minor fitting. let me know if you want pics of it.Prefer to meet at Field & Stream Easton or somewhere near thereAsking $175 cash or best offer."
