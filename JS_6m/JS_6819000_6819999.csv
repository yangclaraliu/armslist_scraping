If you’re really interested, send me a phone number, and I’ll call. Then I can send you pictures.
What I have is a purpose built, 6.5 Grendel match rifle. Design to be used on a 1000-yard range. It’s one step up from the last rifle I built, which was a tack driver at 300 yards. Muzzle velocity with a 123 grain slug is over 2700FPS, and still supersonic at 1200 yards.
Parts list.
Match upper/lower set from Anderson, squared then anodized.
Tool craft bolt carrier group from Cryptic Coatings in Mystic Black.
Krieger 26 inch varmatch barrel, 1-9 twist, .936 gas block, .920 muzzle diameter.
JP enterprises .936 adjustable gas block.
16.5 inch free-float key-mod handguard from Vector with key-mod bipod lug, and 6-9inch bipod.
Sniper grip with palm shelf
1/2inch, 20moa riser with quick-detach 30mm one-piece scope mount with Neewer 6-25x56 scope
Magpul MAG400 stock. Two new 10 round magazines that have never been loaded.
Rifle has never been fired, not even at the factory, which in the case of the barrel, is Krieger themselves.
Barrel is currently at Apache Gun works in LA, being chambered 6.5 Grendel and threaded 3/4-24 for a muzzle brake or suppressor. I have a custom muzzle brake to go on it that is nothing short of awesome, but if you would rather have a can, so be it.
If you wanted to build this rifle from scratch, the barrel alone would take a year to get. This one will be ready in time to take it to Ohio, and Indiana. If you know what I mean, then you need to consider this rifle. I’m only selling it to fund a new lathe, and If you have a decent size gunsmith lathe for trade, shoot me a number.This rifle shoots more like a Creedmore, than a Grendel. So its going to be someone's babydoll. A little load development, and I beleave 1/3MOA at 1k yards is possible.
I must not have made myself clear. The only person interested in this rifle will be a hunter or competitive shooter. All I need is your phone number, and I can answer your questions on the phone. Price is 2000 dollars, no less. If you know anything about competition rifles, you know this is a good buy. The barrel and BCG alone are over a thousand dollars."

This grip is manufactured from a soft durable rubber and features a lightweight, synthetic skeleton making the rigid interior of the grip. The synthetic insert is chemically bonded to the exterior rubber grip insuring that the grip won't de-laminate or come apart. Hogue uses a cobblestone (stippled) surface on this grip instead of traditional checkering for a modern feel and excellent grip control in any condition. The finger grooves on the front of the grip are an affordable alternative to front strap checkering and are preferred by many competition shooters for rapid, accurate shooting. The material is solvent and oil resistant which means it will not deteriorate or dissolve due to cleaning your firearm. Specifications: - Fits: Sig Sauer P238 with Finger Grooves - Color: Black"
