237,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6635237,For Sale:  LaRue Tactical PredatOBR 260,"Merritt Island, Orlando, Florida","$ 3,600","Listed On: Sunday, March 26, 2017",Rifles,Larue Tactical                                                                                ,260 Remington                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Selling my newly purchased LaRue Tactical PredatOBR 260 with 22"" barrel The rifle just arrived at my FFL yesterday. I haven't transferred the rifle yet. It is in the unopened UPS box from LaRue. Will come with all swag and 2 boxes of prime ammo. I will let it go for $3600 shipped and insured.  Avoid months of waiting!The PredatOBR 260 Remington is the ultimate lightweight long distance rifle. The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely “broken down” and stored into the optional Rollup Bag and Toolbox. The PredatOBR handguard has a locking stainless steel QD Lever system on each side. Once the levers are released, the handguard slides off of the upper assembly in seconds. The PredatOBR's barrel can easily be removed with the supplied PredatOBR Barrel Wrench, unscrew the Barrel Nut from Receiver and pull the Barrel Assembly free from Receiver. No need to remove the gas tube, gas block or muzzle device. Reverse the process to reinstall. Hand-tighten Barrel Nut and torque approximately 1/8-turn past hand-tight (Approximately 40-50 foot pounds). Once reassembled correctly, the point of impact (POI) shift will be 0.0 to 0.5 MOA of the original.Barrels are chambered in 260 Remington, and feature rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24. Like the OBR and PredatAR riles, LaRue has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true “free-float” barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in for structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable/detachable using a supplied tool (Torx® T-15 wrench). The rail sections are CNC-machined from billet aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods.The PredatOBR's Port Selector Technology™ (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor.The LaRue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T.) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o’clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system.Specifications:Caliber: .260 Remington Barrel Length: 18"" and 22""Rifling Twist Rate: 1/8Barrel Life: 10,000 (approx) Gas System: Direct Impingement with LaRue PST™ port selector Trigger: LaRue MBTAccessories: 2ea, 20-Round LaRue Magazines3ea 3” Rail SectionsOperators ManualBarrel WrenchAbout LaRue Firearm Accuracy:LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results."

Bushmaster later stopped making rifles there and their quality largely suffered after, but 2005 was during the golden period. Rifle shows lots of external wear but from the state of the internals, I'd say this gun was shot pretty rarely and sat in a patrol car, gathering dust.
Rifle is a heavy barrel profile 1:9 twist. This sucker is HEAVY barrel profiled. Would do great with a bumpfire stock. I can include either a Magpul polymer handguard or the stock BM ones, but on the Magpul furniture the barrel profile is so thick you can't really mount any M-LOK stuff on the side slots. Rear sight is from UTG, the rail is an MOE rail section attached directly to the handguard with some generic pistol grip.
Rifle shoots fine. I've heard older Bushmaster rifles don't like PMAGs but I haven't had any issues yet. 
Front sight post is a little bent. I was able to zero it fine, but I know that would bother some people.
No trades for anything other than a Star Megastar, cash only no money order or paypal, meet face to face anywhere within reason. Please recognize if you live in another part of Virginia I can meet you but I will ask for gas money. 
I ask that you include some additional contact info in your armlist message; I've had problems with messages not going through recently."

The smallest of Steyr’s pistol line, the S9A1 has a 3.6” (91mm) barrel and the same short overall length as the C-A1 but features a short grip for ultra-concealment. As with each model in the Steyr A1 line of products, the pistol features a low bore-axis which minimizes recoil and improves control while the ergonomic grip offers optimal control for a variety of hand sizes. The lower frame of the gun offers a standard slide-lock thumb tab, right-handed magazine ejection button and pivoting break-down lever. A key-operated manual safety feature is located next to the break-down lever and 2 keys are provided with each pistol. An integrated Picatinny rail allows for simple mounting of a laser or light and slide-racking grooves on the back of the slide allow for a firm grip when manually operating the action.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.  Buy this pistol online at www.copgunshop.net"

I don't have the original box for this, but I have a few boxes laying around I can give you.It's the usual Mike situation, buy a few guns, test them out, end up not liking some and sell them at a loss.

Brief History of the Double Nine:  The Double-Nine, a double-action nine shot Western style revolver, first appeared in 1958. It had an aluminum frame, a rebounding hammer, and a 5½ inch barrel. They were available in both blue and nickel finish. Early grips were white or black plastic, and later fake stag was available. A few rare guns have checkered black plastic grips. Sears sold the gun as the J.C. Higgins Ranger or Model 90, and later also as the Ranger De Luxe. High Standard also made western style revolvers for Western Auto and Kroydon Arms.

I have a Zeiss HD 5-25x50 Rapid Z 1000 scope looking to trade or sale. I mounted it and shot 3 boxes of shells and decided it is not what I am looking for. I have the box and Zeiss paper work showing this is a real one. Its a great scope, just not what I need at the moment. 

I can send pictures of it if needed. I am looking at $1100.00 on this scope as that is what I have in it. I can include some quick detack rings for it as well. Again, this scope is 1 month old from the factory directly.

The X-Bolt Hunter features a satin finished walnut stock that looks great and won't spook game, while the detailed checkering provides a solid non-slip grip. A low-luster, blued finish on the barrel and receiver also reduces glare. The Inflex Technology™ recoil pad reduces recoil and ensures the butt won't slip off the shooter's shoulder. Browning's Feather Trigger™ also enhances potential accuracy by providing a clean, crisp pull with no take-up and a minimal overtravel (a screw adjusts trigger from 3 to 5 lbs.). A free-floated, target-crowned barrel delivers precision accuracy. The X-Bolt also features a glass bedded, matte finished steel receiver that's drilled and tapped with a 4 screw per base design to ensure a secure and stable placement of the optic sight. 3 locking lugs provide exceptional strength and a short 60° bolt lift that cycles smooth and fast, while keeping a wide margin of space between your hand and the scope sight. A detachable rotary magazine feeds cartridges directly in-line with the bolt instead of feeding offset as with conventional magazines. The Browning X-Bolt Hunter Bolt-Action Rifle also features a top-tang safety with bolt unlock button that allows you to open the bolt for loading or inspection with the tang safety in the safe position.

I have been trying to find a few items for them to learn better aiming skills. First off is a .22 bolt action rifle, at a decent price, preferably with a threaded barrel for the form 4 we are waiting on to pass. Second is a lever action .22 rifle for the youngest since he is into the cowboy policeman shows (his wording). Third would be a ruger bearcat, that way they all can learn how to handle and aim a sude arm without burning thru ammo as fast as they can pull the trigger. I am on a buget but can trade or cash as needed. Thanks in advance for helping bring a new generation into the shooting lifestyle."

I have the original packaging and manual for it. It is flawless and in brand new condition.These generally run in the $250 range depending on where you look. I paid $250 for it at GT Distributors this last November.If you are interested, please call or text me at REDACTED.DESCRIPTION:The game-changing XC1, SureFire’s smallest and lightest weight WeaponLight, was specially developed to equip compact railed handguns with white light, which is absolutely critical for concealed-carry and other applications. It features a high-performance LED whose light output is shaped by a special multifaceted reflector into a wide, smooth 200-lumen MaxVision Beam™ perfect for maintaining situational awareness and identifying threats at close range. The XC1’s evenly distributed beam pattern—with no bright center—was optimized for human vision.The XC1’s robust, compact body is constructed of lightweight but strong aerospace aluminum that’s hard anodized with a tough Mil-Spec finish, making the XC1 rugged enough for everyday carry. And measuring less than 2.5 inches long and weighing under two ounces, the AAA-powered XC1 won’t weigh down your handgun.The XC1 also features ambidextrous switching that provides both momentary- and constant-on activation options:Momentary-on activation is achieved by placing your support hand thumb on top of either of the two rear downward-activated switches and pushing down. Or you can position your support thumb against the same switch and push forward until the switch toggles down. Simply remove pressure and the light will turn off. NOTE: To avoid unintended activation, the light will not activate when the rear switches are pushed up or side-to-side.Constant-on activation is achieved by using your support hand to push the center crossbar switch from left to right. To turn the light off, simply press the switch right to left. The crossbar switch is countersunk to prevent inadvertent activation. The XC1’s incomparable beam pattern, military-grade quality, intuitive switching, and highly concealable size put it in a class all by itself. There is nothing else like it.
