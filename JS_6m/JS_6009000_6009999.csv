This is serious fire power. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included."

The plate carriers are adjustable from Small up to XX-Large MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs. The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs. This particular armor is made to military spec and it is designed to withstand higher caliber rounds. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail as this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up.

If you are comfortable with 1911-style cocked & locked carry, this is the perfect carry gun for you. It is extremely small, lightweight, holds 7+1 rounds of 9mm and shoots like a dream. It comes with one magazine from the factory and all the goodies in the hard case (all unused!). This gun oozes quality with its all-metal constuction and the rubber grip feels amazing in the hand.

This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

The Model 1870, of which only 12,000 examples were manufactured between 1870 and 1873, was the precursor to the better known Springfield 1873 45-70 caliber, of which over 700,000 examples were manufactured. The very short service duration and the very small numbers produced, make the Model 1870 very scarce and highly soughet after.The 1870 Springfield was manfactured using a 50-70 caliber muzzle loading barrel from the Civil War, as was the Lock Plate which is date stamped 1863.The rifle is in very good condition and makes a beutiful and unique display. We have had it hanging over the fireplace in our living room (see photo) and almost every visitor has wanted it taken down so they could examine it more carefully. It is 52 inches long and weighs 9 pounds.Trying to determine a fair asking price, I came across another 1870 Trapdoor which was rated in excellent conditeion by New Market Arms, and it sold for $2,200 in 1963. Based on this, I think $1,600 would be a fair asking price, but I will consider reasonable offers."

The package includes a Harris bipod, a SLIK tripod with Hog mount, cosine indicator, sling, custom drag bag, shooting bag, and P3 ultimate monopod. This package has let me continually make 1/2 moa shots out to 700 yards if you have the right ammo, if you can not reload then I would suggest FGGM 168 gr BTHP. The rifle has had 250 rounds through it (barrel life is guranteed by FN to last more than 10,000 rounds) and none of these were hot loads. Also, the scope is not included in the package but if you want a great scope I do have a vortex viper pst 6-24x50 FFP that I can add for 800 dollars or a Bushnell XRS (what I used on this rifle until a few months ago) that I can add with badger rings for 1700, it is like new.

The glass is very good, my Schmidt is only a tad better. The recticle is the bees knees though, I love it and would keep the scope if it wasnt so heavy. This scope is retailing around 2300 so 1800 with the great rings is a good deal, but I do not have the box. Plus you get the lifetime warranty, no questions asked and fully transferable. If you want an indestructable scope with a huge power magnification, this is your scope. Feel free to message me with any questions REDACTED, am open to trades but only is they are in my favor."
