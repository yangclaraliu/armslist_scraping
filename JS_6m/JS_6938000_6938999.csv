I built it for the experiance and to try out the AR platform. It runs flawlessly, I have never had any issues with the rifle. It has an EoTech and a knock off 3X multiplier on it(works great though). I have three mags for it, a Magpul with the window, a Magpul without the window, and a regular steel mag. I am asking $1100 for the rifle, but I would be more than willing to trade it for a couple good duty pistols, or a nice AK, maybe a precision rifle. I used to own an AK and I really liked that rifle platform. If you are looking to trade for the rifle, it should be a close trade value or the difference made up with cash."

The metal is just fine but the grip is chipped in two places on one side and cracked on the other sidebut it does seem that the gun is in good working order. From my basic research it is a Third Variation which was produced between 1913-1915, but I could be wrong on that ( google is not always as helpful as I want it to be).

Rifle comes with the Ruger soft carrying case and 2 20 round magpul magazines and one 25 round mag. This rifle has a couple upgrades: Raptor ambi charging handle by AXTS $90Magpul ACS stock $90 Leupold LCO Red dot $699Leupold Devo scope $699Also has had the trigger gone over and polished. The gritty and heavy feel of the stock trigger is gone. The trigger is now a smooth and consistent pull to the clean break. I estimate the trigger to break at around 7lbs.At 100yds I find it shoots about a 1.5 moa group with most quality factory ammo.The devo and lco combo let's you switch from a red dot for short range shots to 6x magnification for long range shots with no head movement just a quick look down is all you need.This setup runs about 3000 dollars to put together.I am only asking 2500
