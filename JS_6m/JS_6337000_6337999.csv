The serialization section has also been expanded, allowing more dates of manufacture to be determined.  This is a great reference book to own and one that most dealers and collectors also refer to, especially when looking at the uniqie and antigue firearms.  This is a great comprehensive manual for knowing what all guns are worth in the condition that you are looking at, it's much like Kelly Blue Book for cars, but for guns.  I bought this book new and it has only been used a few times, and has been taken well care of, as you can see in the picture."

I just don't like Glocks, more power to those who do! But I just don't enjoy the weapon. So, it sits in the closet and never gets used. I want it to have a happy home. It is stock, except for the slide catch. That was miserable, you won't miss it. It comes with cleaning kit, 2 mags, all the grip attatchments, pic rail, etc. The hard case got some love from the TSA, but functionally the weapon is in perfect shape. Plus, it's a Glock, so it will always work! Hopefully, it goes to a good home or is used as a duty carry."

I also have an aimpoint 3x magnifier and a sightmark red dot that we could do some trading on as well. If you have any version of an mp5 clone in .22LR that you are looking to get rid of, please let me know.
