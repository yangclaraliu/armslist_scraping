Includes original box and one magazine. This is the later P9M model with the S&W style lockup, extended controls, and improved sights, but normal Hi-Power trigger and general operation. It's compatible with all Hi-Power parts except for the barrel, slide and frame. I've installed a full set of Wolff standard weight springs (Service Pak Type 1) and a Browning extractor and roll pin. Includes all the original springs, the extractor, and the extractor roll pin.THIS PISTOL IS IN NEED OF MINOR REPAIR. I'm selling because I believe it's having a problem with the sear. I was a sucker and bought this from the last owner without much inspection.When I got the P9M it was in rough shape, so I cleaned it up and replaced all the springs and the extractor. I've put ~300 rounds through it and it feeds and cycles fine, but in the last 150 rounds I got three ""bursts"" of two rounds. From reading up it sounds like the sear is either worn or the last owner messed with it.It's possible that the ""bursts"" were not the sear slipping but bump fires, as the trigger lever has been shortened to shorten the reset (at the cost of added takeup). Reset is currently very short, similar to a 1911. That's an $8 part to replace and takes 30 seconds to change. I just don't want to deal with it anymore so I'm selling the pistol cheap with full disclosure. With an $8 trigger lever and $30 sear and (maybe) some minor fitting, this pistol will be returned to factory spec and should work 100%. There are no other functional issues apart from what I describe.Asking $300 OBO. Would also consider a trade for other 9mm handguns. Can add a little cash for a more expensive trade.If you have any questions at all, or want more pictures, please call or text me at REDACTED."

The Daniel Defense 16” 300 Blackout S2W® barrel is designed with a strength to weight profile (Daniel Defense's Heavy Barrel), a 1:8"" twist rate, and a Carbine-Length gas system.
Cold Hammer Forging of barrels has been known for decades to produce the most accurate, longest lasting rifle barrels obtainable. The Cold Hammer Forging of barrels is accomplished through intense hydraulic pressure applied at opposing angles by carbide steel hammers. During the hammering process, a mandrel is inserted into the bore while the carbide steel hammers shape the barrel around the mandrel creating the chamber, the lands, and the grooves. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the Cold Hammer Forging process creates a defect free bore and the most consistent chamber possible.
The Daniel Defense MFR 12.0 is a 12"" CNC Machined Modular Free Float Handguard. It is specifically designed to adequately cover a low profile gas block on a carbine or mid-length gas system barrel. The MFR 12.0 has been engineered to provide each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run ""slick"" with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rails is accomplished with little effort. This allows you to have rails anywhere you need them and nowhere you don't. The slim profile of the MFR 12.0 keeps the shooter's support hand close to the bore which aids in firearm manipulation, and the design and construction allow for the attachment of Picatinny Rail Sections at standard 90 degree or offset angles."

It is made using powdered metallurgy technology. The process allows for 3% of the steel’s structure to be made of pure carbon. Spyderco offers high-performance exotic steels, like ZDP-189, on a number of everyday-carry working folders including the Manbug. It is sized for carry on a keychain, but the Manbug packs exceptional and surprising cutting power into a small ergonomic package. Jimping located on the blade’s spine generates a slip-resistant purchase point where the pad of the thumb sits to keep the folder steadily rooted in the hand. The handle is made of British Racing Green FRN (fiberglass reinforced nylon) with a mid-spine positioned back-lock that features a David Boye Dent. Manbugs are clipless, designed for carry inside a pocket or affixed to a key chain threaded through the lined lanyard hole.Overall Length: 4.47"" (114 mm)Blade Length: 1.97"" (50 mm)Steel: ZDP-189Closed Length: 2.50"" (64 mm)Edge Length: 1.75"" (44 mm)Weight: .7 oz (20 g)Blade Thickness: .098"" (2.5 mm)Handle:FRNOrigin: Japan"
