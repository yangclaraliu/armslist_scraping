It was not made by Beretta USA for the Army M9 or 92FS civilian market. The Army adopted the 92FS in 1985, after changes were made to the 92F to make it safer after the Navy used machine gun bullets during testing causing the slide to fail, and reissued it as the M9. So, this is an early to mid 80's, used Italian Beretta 92F 9mm with factory walnut checkered grips with Beretta logo inserts. Serial # starts with 'C'. But, since this is an Italian gun, you won't find the serial # on Beretta USA. You have to go to ""Catalogo Nazionale Armi"" which is the records of all Beretta Italian produced guns. The Italian bank proof marks the gun somewhere, in this case on the right side trigger guard, and puts a Date Code. The date code on this is AN which equals 1985, before the Army gave them the contract and they changed to the 92FS in 1985. So, basically this is the last issue of the Beretta 92F. There are three handguns in the world that combine, quality, beauty, and reliability making them the finest handguns in the world today. They are: Colt Python .357, Colt 1991A1 Commander .45 acp, and the Beretta 92F 9mm. This is your chance to own one of them as they have rolled off of the CA Gun Roster. Comes with two 15 rd. magazines, and original plastic box. I would rate the pistol finish at 98% as there is no holster wear, scratches, etc. The only finish wear is some slight wear around the safety/decocker. It has had about 500 rounds through it and then kept in climate controlled safe after I stopped shooting. Comes with two Magblocks to make the mags 10 rd capacity to meet CA compliance in July. No paperwork or cardboard box as I left them along with several others in the attic during a move many years back. :-( This is a very nice shooter that's just getting broken in. Smooth trigger pull, accurate, and a pleasure to handle. I like this almost as much as my Colt Python. But, the Colt's not for sale. lol I have two of these. I picked up a second one while I was living in Denver for work, but still had my house here. Just don't need two of them anymore. Would consider a trade with my gun plus money for a Sig Sauer P225A1 9mm or a Beretta 85FS Cheetah .380. Not interested in any other guns... Thanks for looking. NO SHIPPING! Private party transactions must take place face to face at a current FFL dealer per CA law and in my area. I am totally disabled and will not travel outside of Sacramento, CA.  SERIOUS offers only. Don't lowball me because it's your 'birthday' or offer me a used XBOX to trade. If you can't make the deal by providing money or the guns I mentioned above, then don't bother me.

Some people worry about wearing out a stainless barrel but when it comes to a noveske barrel I'm sure it'll outlive you. Also is capable of holding an inch group with 77bthp out at 100 if you're worried about accuracy. Some things that have been changed out are the charging handle which is now a BCM ambi and the stock which is the EMOD instead of the IMOD Vltor. She's also currently wearing a bad lever.

This is a 16 gauge semi-automatic shotgun. This is a made in Belgium Browning, so it is becoming even harder to find every day!!! Featuring a 27 ½ inch barrel, a nice finished wooden stock and front grip, and engraving in the receiver, this is a great gun to add to any collection, or just to have a good time shooting! The barrel is special steel and takes 2 ¾ inch shells. It should hold 4 in the tube, and 1 in the chamber, making a total of 5. Overall, this gun is in good condition. There are some ‘usage’ marks here and there. The whole gun has some scratches and dings, but nothing to drastic. The front grip has almost like some cracking in the finish, but it appears to be just in the gloss finish. You can tell by the end of the barrel, this gun has fired some shots. This in my opinion would be a quality gun to actually take out in the field and shoot, rather than hang above the fireplace as your showpiece. It is a ‘sweet’ gun, so do not be afraid to use it! Overall length is about 46 ¾ inches. Length of pull would be around 14 inches."

IMPORTANT NOTE: From now until June 30th, Springfield is running their Gear UP Magazine Madness Promo. With the purchase of any Springfield XDS, you can get 4 extra magazines, a magazine holster, and a holster for your gun, for FREE! This pistol comes with 3 mags already (one 7-RD, one 8-RD, one 9-RD), so with this promo, you will get a total of 6 magazines! Click here to learn more. This Springfield XDS 9mm 3.3 comes from the factory equipped with a Crimson Trace Red Laserguard laser. Attached firmly to the trigger guard, the laser’s slim profile matches that of the pistol, and features Crimson Trace’s trademark Instinctive Activation™. The laser sight is user-installed in minutes and is adjustable for windage and elevation. The Springfield XDS™ 9mm offers all of the quality and safety features you expect from the XD® line. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator and grip safety. In addition, the XDS™ 9mm offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability. Every carefully crafted design element of the XDS™ is engineered to deliver an unmatched shooting experience that’s as simple and intuitive as using your own hand. Springfield XD-S Features: Superior design features give the Springfield XDS™ capabilities that not all pistols of its size can claim. Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip. Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Trigger System™: The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. Loaded Chamber Indicator: The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Picatinny Rail System: A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice. Snag Free Sights: The rear sight on the XD-S™ is low-profile and holster friendly. Easier and faster target acquisition is achieved with a fiber optic front sight. Secure Grip Texture: The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure. Mould-Tru Backstraps: With two interchangeable backstraps, Springfield Armory® has stayed true to their focus on providing the user with the most comfortable, and easy to point pistol possible by allowing you to custom fit your grip. Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case: To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, Springfield added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, the rugged case you get is as durable as the XDS™ it carries.

Asking $50, can meet in the Green Bay areaA great tool that securely holds an upper receiver assembly for maintenance and assembly work. The removal and installation of barrels, flash hiders, gas blocks and hand guards is made much easier and simpler.Designed to be gripped in a bench vise so that the rod is either horizontal or vertical. The upper receiver is then slid onto the rod and the rod’s integral splines enter the barrel extension and secure the barrel extension from turning.This allows all the torque from barrel nut wrenches to go directly into the barrel extension. The receiver vise blocks transmit the turning force into the aluminum receiver, a good part of which passes through the small, easily distorted receiver index pin. With the Barrel Spline Socket Rod, marring of an upper receiver’s finish by gripping and twisting inside vise blocks is eliminated and so is the need to remove sights and mounts from the receiver’s M1913 rail."
