Cash only...Thank youBeretta is the oldest gun maker on the planet and they dominate the shotgun market for good reason. Their shotguns are elegant, well-made, and reliable. The A300 is Beretta’s basic auto but it doesn’t skimp on fit and finish or reliability. The A300 Outlander is the evolution of the wildly popular model 391 and uses a self-compensating gas valve system to ensure reliability with a wide range of loads. And there’s a reason for their popularity: unbeatable performance as well as great value out of the box. With its 3” chamber, Mobilchoke barrel and self-cleaning piston, the A300 is there to get the job done with Beretta-style quality and reliability--whether it is upland hunting, waterfowling or at the sporting clays range.  The A300 is made of the proprietary steel blends that have made Beretta shotguns famous for their durability. The Mobilchoke barrel is designed to shrug off the pounding of heavy hunting loads, giving you a long-lasting tool that will work as hard as you need it to. But in spite of its toughness, the A300 is light, feels lively in the hands and easily follows your eyes to the target, thanks to the low-profile action. And its impeccable balance make it feel even lighter than its 7.25 lbs.  E-mail...call or text Antonio for an imediate response.Respectfully Yours,
Antonio & Nina Giordano

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more. One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America’s most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole! The Mark 23 is available in .45 ACP We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

It is the carry model which means it has the 3.9"" barrel. I bought it brand new towards the end of last year, and I never had the chance to take it to the range. I understand most will say that there is never any real need to sell a firearm, but I don't have the time for it to be honest as well as I could use the money, and it's not like it's my only firearm. It has never been fired since I've owned it. It is a modular handgun which means that it can be changed to another caliber in less than a minute. I bought the caliber X-Change kit for it which would change it from the .40S&W I bought to the new 9mm that the kit is. I have two .40 magazines as well as two 9mm magazines. It comes with a plastic, Kydex, paddle type holster. It's very basic, but it does the job. I also have approximately 250 target rounds that come with it. All offers will be considered, but I am fairly firm on the price. I can send pictures if need be, but only serious inquiries please. I don't need to know what I should have bought instead, or this or that. Only email me if you are interested."

Everything is matching, and the PU scope and mount are authentic. Rifle includes the bayonet and cleaning kit. The rifle was arsenal-refurbished after WWII and is in excellent shape - one of the nicer looking stocks I've seen on a Mosin, with one very shallow gouge in the wood near the trigger guard. It's a nice, reliable shooter, and hasn't had any trouble firing any surplus ammo that I've fed through it. IMPORTANT: The reason the price is so low compared to most Mosin snipers is that the scope needs to be repaired. The rifle fell out of its rack and the interior lens was either cracked or knocked loose - the outer lenses are still in perfect shape and the scope tube itself is undamaged. I simply wasn't getting enough use out of this rifle to justify spending time and money trying to get it repaired or replaced."

The P220 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function.

The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.
