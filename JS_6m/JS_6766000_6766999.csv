It was a Carry package when purchased, that means it has holsters, mags, mag holster, backstraps, and some other stuff that all fits down into the case. I have purchased other stuff for it overtime so I'll give an exact list of what is included; 7 15 round mags, 4 have black butt plates and 3 have FDE butt plates, a double mag holster, 2 OWB holsters, and I've also got the .357 Sig conversion barrel that goes with it so you can run .40 cal or swap the barrels and you can run .357 Sig. All 7 mags are .40/.357 so you do not have to have separate magazines. Nor do you have to change any parts. All you do is pull the slide off, pick which caliber you wanna run and put that barrel in it. The gun is in immaculate condition. I'm asking $650 OBO or $700 trade value.

This is model # DEF-3712-20-SB. Black matte finish, synthetic stocks, 20"" barrel. This is a rare, ""Breacher"" model with the factory muzzle breach attached. I purchased this a few years back from a dealer who was closing his shop and selling off all the old inventory. I attempted to find some info. on this particular model, but couldn't even find a picture on line. I called The Ithaca Gun Company REDACTED) in an attempt to learn more about it. I was told by one of their managers that this was a very limited production run in 2013, and he estimated that less than 75 were made in this configuration. So, rare piece. Shotgun is brand new (never fired) in box with everything that came with it. No marks or damage. MSRP for this model was in 2013 was $849.95. A new 20"" tactical model retails for close to that without the Breacher.  I'm asking $750 firm. All laws followed. I'm listing this on Armslist to see if I can sell/trade local. If no luck, I'll post on GunBroker. Not desperate to sell, just a gun taking up space that needs to go to someone who'll enjoy it. I own a couple of older Ithacas, and think they are wonderful shotguns. Extremely rugged and reliable. If curious about their reliability, read, ""Pointman"" by Jim Watson, plank owner of seal team two. He carried a very similar setup in Vietnam. Interested in trades, so long as they are firearm related. Please no vacuum cleaners, paint sprayers, or anything crazy like that. I may be interested in cutom knives or edged weapons, so long as they are quality. Would prefer: Glock 40 10mm, Kel Tec ksg in any color but tan, old 3rd gen S&W autos, pre lock S&W Revolves, older Brigadier Berettas, Trijicon TA01 or other decent reflex type optic, quality optics,  10mm, 41 Magnum, NATO 5.56 or 7.62, 7.62x39 ammo. Be willing to entertain multi gun trades, could add cash on my end towards a trade of yours.

All stock, only fired 100 rounds through it. It is my current CCW, but I've had it for 2 years now and I'm just bored with it. Comes with everything pictured. I DON'T HAVE TO SELL IT. Firearm has been torn down, cleaned and inspected once about every 3 months to get rid of any dirt or dust that comes with carrying it every day. Holds 7+1 rounds and has 6 round magazine. Also included is 120 rounds (100 Win + 20 Hornady hollow points 40 S&W). If you want a 9mm, buy a Shield 9mm barrel and boom now you have a 9mm. You can make the .40 to a 9mm but you can't make the 9mm to a .40 which is why I got it. .40 mags will work with 9mm but last round sometimes doesn't feed. How do you fix that? Buy a shield 9mm mag. I don't care if you can get it cheaper somewhere else, no it's too old for the rebate, by the time you buy the rounds, pay for tax and transfer fees you'd be $350+. Functions flawlessly. I won't leave Statesboro to meet. You contacted me, you come get it. I've wasted too much time and money for no shows. E-mail or text me @ 561-972-zero86zero.

Used sparingly for 2 seasons and has been sitting in a gun safe ever since. Excellent condition with only a couple of minor scratches on the stock. The micro hunter is a great rifle for anyone, but excels in the hands of a younger, smaller hunter. However, don't let the ""micro"" designation fool you. I'm 6'2"" 220lbs and the size of the gun has never been an issue for me. It's actually quite nice if you have to walk a long distance to get to your stand because of the lower weight of the rifle.Though not legally required for long guns in NC, I'd rather sell to someone who has a concealed carry license, or at least a pistol purchase permit. That way I know a background check has been run on you at some point in the recent past. Additional pictures available upon request."

Right up until I got hurt and am not doing any running and gunning for a while. The barrel is a super light weight Faxon 16"" (weighs less than carbon fiber barrels) with at titanium gas block and tube, and Fortis RED muzzle device. It is lapped and bedded to an F1 billet upper running a lightweight NibX coated skeletonized BCG with JP bolt. The lower is a Ghost Industies Skeletonized lower built with Titanium internals (castle nut, back plate, take down pins, buffer pin, etc) and a POF 3.5lb pull Skeleton trigger unit. The grip is a Houge lightweight unit that still gives great feel, with a BCM polymer trigger guard. The buffer spring is JP and the buffer is a low mass unit. Also has Seekins enhanced bolt and mage release, and ambex safety. This awesome rifle weighs under 5lbs unloaded and shoots around or under MOA with about every decent ammo I have ran through it. It was originally a sub 4 1/2 pound rifle, but I decided I would trade a few ounces for some livability. However to get it back to just over 4lbs is a simple swap of 3 components. A few questions I always get on this (and it will draw attention at the range):Q: Don't you get gas in your face? A: No, it has a properly regulated gas system and the cuts on the upper are angled away from the shooter.Q: Is the recoil horrible? A: It is probably the lightest shooting AR I have ever owned. This is due to the well regulated gas system, low reciprocating mass and muzzle device. It feels more like a 22 that a 5.56. Q: Does it get dirty quickly or jam? A: In a word, no. The internals are all NP3 or Titatnium, so you just have to wipe them down every thousand rounds or so, and  that is mainly to keep them shiny. You can literally clean it with a garden hose and canned air it dry.Q: Is it ammunition sensitive? A: Nope. I have fired everything from Wolf steel case to 77 grain premium defense with zero issues or failures.Q: How much do you have wrapped up in it? A: I stopped counting at $1800, so north of that. F2F with VA resident non-felons withing 45 minutes of Charlottesville. Not interested in trades at this time unless you have a Tanfoglio Limited or Stock II/III or a Czech Mate in 9mm or .40."

The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.
TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most.Not sure on round count - 500 to 1,000 rounds, but this baby doesn't show it.  The front Tritium sight was replaced with a red Fiber Optic sight.  I have the original front sight and will include it with the sale.  The package includes the box, the Springfield Holster and Mag Pouch, a Comp-Tac Minotaur IWB Holster, manual and other documents.  There are also a total of 8 magazines included along with the original factory grips.If you are not sure what this pistol is, please look it up online.  I am not looking to trade at all, cash only.  Must be done F2F at a local FFL.If the ad is still up, it's still available.  Thank you for looking!"
