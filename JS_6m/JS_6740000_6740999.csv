The guy I bought it from didn't fire it, it looked like the guy he bought it from didn't either. I only put 10 rounds through her, and it's in absolutely amazing condition. Barely has the race mark from the safety on the frame, and internals look brand new. I don't think this thing has had more than 50 rounds through it since it was made, honestly.This is a ban-era AKM, that was made with the thum bhole stock, the muzzle thread removed & the muzzle device taken off like all of the rest of the rifles imported around that time. This gun shoots AWESOME. It's extremely smooth. ONLY reason I'm selling it, is due to an old shoulder injury heavier rifles are harder for me to hold up and fire comfortably. Something this nice deserves to be enjoyed and taken to the range, not sitting in my safe and only coming out every few months eh.This rifle comes with gorgeous (and expensive) red Timber Wolf furniture installed and a Tapco trigger installed, the original thumb hole furniture and original trigger, 2 magazines (Brand new 30 round P-Mag and brand new 20 round P-mag), 30 rounds of PPU 123gr PSP copper ammo (no steel, good to shoot at any range), a standard military style sling, and a soft case.I'm asking $800 FIRM for this. These things usually sell beat up for $850, but for this price you're getting a near mint MAK-90 with a brand new set of $160 furniture, mags, ammo, and an upgraded trigger. This deal is priced low to sell fast.FIRM means if you text/email me with a lower offer you will be ignored. I'm not new to this, don't insult me with a lowball. Not looking for trades on this one, cash is king. Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time or shooting me a PM on here.Face to face deals only, must be 18+. Located in Northville, willing to travel but nothing too far. I WILL NOT SHIP. I keep getting offers from out of state, if you're going to ask me to ship it to you...save yourself the time and don't contact me. This is not negotiable. Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

The reason I am selling so cheap is because when I shot this (around 100 rounds) in 2014 with some cheap ammo it wasn't feeding/functioning well so I took it apart to polish it up and clean/oil it and I lost the assembly pin for the action (costs like $8 and the hole is pictured below). Never got around to buying the cheap pin, so now I am just selling at loss because I didn't like it much and it's missing a part. I think it still functions without the pin because I can still reassemble it and cycle round through it. $75 cash takes it as is.Several different links to the one missing part: http://www.brownells.com/rifle-parts/receiver-parts/receiver-hardware/receiver-posts/assembly-post-prod8656.aspx?avs%7cMake~~Model_1=Marlin__60http://www.ebay.com/itm/Marlin-Glenfield-Model-60-Rifle-Plastic-Assembly-Post-With-Steel-Pin-/REDACTED01?hash=item4661df972d:g:8bwAAOSwIWVY-E8Q"

This is a very in-demand pistol right now, with good reason, and most dealers have a waiting list for them... I should know, I waited 6 weeks for these two. I paid $979 for this plus the $50 transfer fee and that's really what I'd like to get back... being that it's brand new and you won't have to pay tax, transfer fee etc. I also have the voucher for Springfield's ""Gear Up"" promotion which entitles you to 4 free magazines, mag holder and a holster as well. I'm open to reasonable offers but before you send your lowball offer, please remember these are basically sold out nationwide they're so popular...Skip the wait. Save a few bucks. This gun truly is deserving of all the praise its been getting lately. Hit me up. Absolutely NO TRADES. None. No matter how much you think I might like your Hi-Point if I just gave it a chance, no matter how much questionable reload ammo you have to trade.... no trades!!"

The serial number is 421xx M8.
I bought this gun some time ago for an elk hunt that never happened, took it to the range once and had fun ringing the gong at 200 yards and now I would rather have the cash than the gun.
The gun has a steel receiver, 24"" barrel with factory iron sights as well as see through scope mounts, a hinged floorplate that holds a 3 shot detachable magazine, wood stock with factory recoil pad, wood forend and sling swivel studs.
A spare 3 shot magazine is also included.
Shortly after purchasing the gun, I disassembled and cleaned the gas piston assembly, replaced the recoil buffer and replaced the recoil spring with a Wolff Extra Power spring.
There are some areas where the bluing has been worn down in the last 48 years. I have included pictures of the right side of the receiver where it meets the forend and an area near the muzzle where the bluing has thinned.
The bore is clean, bright and shiny.
There are some rubs and scratches in the stock and forend from use but no cracks or evidence of abuse.
This gun is not a showpiece but is a nice, solid, classic Browning rifle.Please go to Gunbroker.com and search BAR 300 Win Mag to find my listing and see more pictures.
$40 insured shipping in the lower 47 states.
No Kalifornia sales.

It comes with three factory magazines worth $80 to $100 each, which means you are getting over $240 in magazines alone.   This is your opportunity to own a perfect specimen that is no logner made and this safe queen hasn't seen daylight since it was purchased new, until now.  The 1006 is one of the most robust, sturdy 10mm guns ever produced.  It was made for only three years, with a production run of only 26,978 units, wich makes it a desirable collectible on sheer numbers alone.   This is a cash only deal and I am not interested in any trades.  You must be a Tennessee resident who can legally own a firearm and willing to sign a bill of sale.  If the post is still up, I still have it."
