It shoots 45 Colt, 45 Auto, and .410 shotgun shells. You can mix and match any combination of these at the same time. It has a scandium frame and a tritium night sight. It does have some holster wear on the side of the cylinder, my finger is pointing at it in one of the pictures. Other than that, it is in excellent conditon and appears to have been shot very little.It comes with what you see in the picture... a full box of 45 Colt, a full box of .410 OOO buck, 30 rounds of 45 Auto JHP, 6 rounds of .410 PDX1 rounds, and 8 moon clips (4 6-round and 4 2-round). No box, no holster, only what's in the picture. This pistol is $700 plus tax at Buds as of today, and that's without any ammunition. I'm valuing my trade, with over 100 rounds of expensive ammunition, at $700. Let me know what you have to trade, mainly interested in pistols and revolvers (especially S&W) or possibly an AR, but I'll look at anything.

Used Tetra grease on sear, trigger is very nice I would guess about 4 lbs. After reassembly I fired a few rounds at arms length for a function test then put 2 into target (shown in pic) at 25 yards. Protected bore and all surfaces with Corrosion X. Rifle has a Redfield Tracker 3-9x40 scope on a Weaver tip-up mount for iron sight use. Also has a nice old ""Torel"" brand padded leather sling on Uncle Mike's QD swivels. A similar sling sold on Ebay for $75 by itself. Pleasant to shoot, much less felt recoil than a bolt '06."

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.Manufacturer: Taurus 1809041Specifications and features:Taurus Model 809 Semi Automatic Handgun9mm4"" barrel17 round magazineAmbidextrous 3-position thumb safety and decockerAmbidextrous magazine releaseLoaded chamber indicatorSingle/double actionExternal hammer for ""strike two"" capabilityBlack, medium polymer frameIncludes small, medium, and large backstrapsBlack Tennifer finishFixed Novak 3-dot sights8.25"" overall length30.2 ozTaurus 809 PistolTaurus 809 Pistol, 9mm Caliber, Single/Double Action, Hard Rubber Grips, Fixed Three-Dot Sights, 4 inch Barrel Length, 17 round Magazine Capacity, Blue, 1809041Taurus Handguns (Pistols)This gun will sell at a great price of only $249.99.Available at two very conienient locations.-Forsyth-15262 US HWY 160Forsyth, Mo 65653REDACTED-Ozark-737 N 20th StOzark, Mo 65721REDACTED"

When Springfield Armory in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant - the M1A - available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past.The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability.You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A is ready for its next mission.

When Springfield Armory in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A is ready for its next mission.

When Springfield Armory in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant - the M1A - available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past.The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability.You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A is ready for its next mission.
