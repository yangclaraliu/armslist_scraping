The AR-18 is a gas operated, selective fire assault rifle chambered for 5.56x45mm ammunition. The AR-180 was designed at ArmaLite in California by Arthur Miller, George Sullivan, and Charles Dorchester in 1963 as an improved alternative to the AR-15 design, which had just been selected by the U.S. military as the M16. While the AR-18 was never adopted as the standard service rifle of any nation, its production licence was sold to companies in Japan and England, and it is said to have influenced many later weapons such as the British SA80, the Singaporean SAR-80 and SR-88, the Austrian Steyr AUG, and the Heckler and Koch G36. It gained some notoriety through its use by the Provisional IRA, which allegedly christened it the ""Widowmaker"" This is the Howa Manufactured weapon (Nagoya, Japan which also made the WW2 Japanese Arisaka rifles) which was made from 1972-73 making it the most desireable of the 3 manufacturers. This particular weapon is in very good condition with a great bore and is missing nothing and needs nothing. The finish is original and there has been no refinishing or cold blue applied to this fine piece. This weapon will not be shipped to California. The rifle comes with one original factory 20 round magazine and three modified AR 30 rounders.  It also is a folding stock. 719-649-306one"

Was used on my AR before I decided to step up to 2.5-10 PST to get a little more range. No issues at all, tracks perfectly on the exposed turrets (not capped model). Illumination works great, really helps in low light. Comes in a Aero Precision 30mm AR mount. I'm very particular and have mounted this with the recommend torque settings. Comes with factory box. Lifetime warranty should you ever have an issue, with no questions asked.  Like new condition, overall great optic.Asking 400 for the scope and mount.   Will consider trades toward a concealed carry pistol or revolver (I have valid NE purchase permit).  I will ship for $15 extra anywhere in the lower 48.   If you have other trades, please let me know."

It was originally built as a long range hunting rifle, but unfortunately I won't be able to do much hunting in the next few years.  It's chambered in 28 Nosler and shoots the 195 VLD's at 3110fps - that's 5.5 mils to 1K….. If you're looking to buy an ELR rig, this is the caliber! Build specs below:
Surgeon 1086 action w/tactical bolt handle
Timney 510 factory set at 2.5lbs
Bartlein #14 contour, 5R, 8 twist, 26"", threaded 3/4x24
Manners TF1A Elite (Carbon Fiber) stock, MCS-BDL mini chassis, dark forest camo
APA fat bastard Gen II brake
O.D. green cerakote to match stock
I got lucky quick, with load development. At mag length, we went under 1/2"" with several different powder charges (RE33). Settled at 87.5gr and 3110fps, E.S. @ 12. Have shot groups at 300, 800 and verified drop at 1200. Groups at 300 were right at an inch, 800 not as impressive cause I suck at reading wind but vertical was great. Great rifle as is, with a better shooter and a little load tweaking, would be an absolute hammer. 81 rounds fired.Very fun rifle to shoot, the brake is very effective and doesn't feel like a big magnum. Shot a bull elk with it here in Colorado at 680 yds this November, both lungs, and it went about 10 ft so I believe in the 195 Berger. Comes with Redding competition micrometer dies, new box of 100ct 195 Berger VLD's, 36 twice fired, 9 once fired pieces of Nosler brass. Scope/rings not included. Asking $3,600 shipped to your FFL. I'll sell the Vortex Razor and Nightforce rings shown in the pictures to the buyer for an additional $2,000 (a steal)."

My Dad recently left me all his guns and the wife is pissed that I have so many weapons now. This has been called ""The indestructable semi-automatic rifle,""  has been used world wide. Purchased new and took it out target shooting and its very accurate - unlike the fabled AK-47s. Very little kick back and its fast without jams. This SKS includes 20 pounds of 7.62×39mm rounds, a case and an extra stock which could be sold separately.Please don't send me low-ball offers - its a waste of your time and mine. Send your phone number and email if seriously interested."
