The M1 was revered for its light weight, lighter ammunition, and rugged reliability.

The rifle currently shoots around 350 fps to comply with local cqb fields but the FPS can be adjusted by the user.
As seen in the pictures the FCU and battery fit into the buffer tube.   This makes the rifle more streamlined and low drag.

It is chambered in 556 so it will run both that and 223. The rifle is MIL SPEC The barrel is a 16"" heavy duty 1/7 or 1/9 twist.

There is no pitting on the metal, and the bore is in good condition. The wood shows more handling marks, mostly from riding in a scabbard. The rifle has very good character and would make a great hunting companion. I also have dies and a decent amount of brass, should be enough to get someone through until Winchester gears up to make another run late this year (I emailed them).

I have a P320 SC and the shield for carry but i figure i need a pocket size for those days in shorts or sweats. I would not sell/trade the Shield without having this need.I polished the sides to look like chrome in spots and left a lot black. The black in the lettering stands out and looks real good. You can see in the picture that the top, sites, front, back and barrel are untouched. I Chrome faded the sides where it gets scratched from holster ware and button/clip hits. This polished surface does NOT scratch like the Melonite does.I am looking to trade or sell this pistol for something pocket worthy. This pistol as well as my last Shield 9 funtion flawlessly with all ammo i have tried! My last Shield 9 saw 1000+ rounds. I will accept a small 380 if it is the right deal, must be fair for both people involved. This is a very nice, well taken care of pistol that will shoot everything you feed it, including reloads. THE RELOADS I USE ARE FMJ AND NOT JUST LEAD.. I have shot 200 reloads through this without any issues! Zombie Green back site dots and neon orange front.

It does NOT get scrathed like the Melonite did and i feel it is probably very well protected with the polish. Rough surfaces are pouris which leaves space for moisture where polished, smooth surfaces are less likely to hold moisture.I did not alter the serations so it is still the same to rack the slide. These guns are tanks!This Shield is real nice.$350 OBO or TRADESorry i will not ship this item! Must be face to face meeting with a person who has a CPL ONLY!NO SHIPPING..."
