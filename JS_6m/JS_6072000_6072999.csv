The Trophy Hunter features Savage's AccuTrigger® that is easily adjustable by user to get a light, crisp release with no creep; while a lever mounted within the trigger body blocks the sear unless the trigger is intentionally pressed in the center, virtually minimizing the risk of accidental discharge. The basic bolt design assures that the locking lugs fully contact the receiver, holding the headspace to a minimum every time the bolt is locked. The tight headspace and a free floated barrel contribute to the excellent accuracy Savage rifles are known for. The Trophy Hunter XP combo comes with a Nikon® 3–9 x 40mm scope with a BDC (Bullet Drop Compensation) reticle that gives hold-over points for precision long range shooting. The synthetic stock, barrel, and receiver are finished in matte black that won't spook game, and sling swivel studs and a soft rubber butt pad are standard. A 3-position receiver tang safety is easy to reach with the shooter's thumb, and allows the rifle to be loaded and unloaded in the safe position. A detachable magazine provides quick and safe reloading and unloading of the rifle.

Got it for squirrel and other small game. Took down a few things last year (squirrel, rabbit, and groundhogs) with it but i got a new job and had another kid so I have less time for small game hunting on top of deer and bird hunting. Love the rifle, but I like having guns I use. Found myself coming to prefer 17HMR as a caliber over 22LR, as it is more accurate out past 100 yards. I'm no great marksman and could reliably hit a sub-2"" group at 200 yards. I'm willing to trade it for a few kinds of guns: •an affordable subcompact handgun like SCCY, Kel-Tec, Bersa, something else decent in that $200-300 range. •FEG hi-power clones•Historical firearm that is both cheap and reliable. Preferably a mosin or a makarov.•a decent 10, 12, or 20 gauge shotgun for deer or bird hunting.•surplus 7.62-54r ammo. 2-3 spam cans. Bougt this new for $300, so trades should be about in the same price range. I am willing to put in cash for something in a higher range if it's the right gun. Sale price is $225 if there's no trade.Also throwing in about 80 rounds of ammunition. The official description:The Savage® 93R17 FXP comes ready to take into the field with a factory mounted and bore sighted 3-9 x 40mm scope, and a non-reflective matte black synthetic stock and matte finished barrel and receiver won't spook game. The Savage 93R17 is an adult-sized bolt-action rimfire rifle that provides superb accuracy and reliability. Savage's AccuTrigger® enables shooters to obtain exceptional accuracy with the Savage 93R17 FXP, by allowing you to easily adjust it to your desired weight of pull for a light, crisp release with no creep. A lever mounted within the trigger body blocks the sear unless the trigger is intentionally pressed in the center, virtually minimizing the risk of accidental discharge. The 93R17 FXP bolt features dual extractors for positive extraction of spent cases, and a 5-round, detachable magazine facilitates loading and unloading the rifle.

How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel.  This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case. Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology  It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round. Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols. Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.  Size & Features With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. The CCP comes in stylish stainless or Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols.  It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation. This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block.

NPZ PSO scopes with illuminated reticles are made from magnesium alloy and come with fully multicoated optics. Considered the higher end of military side mount scopes, the quality is claimed to be higher than POSP scopes, mostly because of the higher quality control proceedures in place to be certified as ""milspec"". The PSO-1M2 features a red illuminated reticle with light provided by a simple light-emitting diode. It has professionally ground optics, a baked enamel finish for scratch protection, and an attached, quick-deploy, extendable sunshade.
The scope mount is adjustable for tension on the rifle's mounting rail. There is a castle nut that screws into the bottom of the locking lever. Press the spring-loaded portion of the clamp down and either tighten or loosen the castle nut as needed."

He did not care about much except he the wanted deal done ASAP...had to have this pistol...first red flag. Check was to be sent overnight via Fed Ex...took a week - second red flag. Finally received a Fed Ex link for the shipping...actually showed it came from Georgia. When it arrived was not a cashiers check, was for 3 times price of gun/shipping/FFL fees, was made out to someone else, ""signature"" was a name not matching buyer's name, check was supposedly drawn on a credit union in NY, address on shipping label did not match address on drivers license...basically a fake check that someone generated/printed on their computer. I contacted the 'buyer' and the story was that to speed things up he just mailed a check he just received for payment of a job ( even though not made out to him ) rather than take time to go get a cashiers check. Instructions were to have my bank deposit it and I should send the excess funds back to him. Needless to say that is not going to happen. My communications with this person are over. I have contacted my local PD and retained all communications. Detective told me that they have actually made two arrests/apprehensions in similar cases but odds are person is not in US."

It is designed to be the most refined and functional inside-the-waistband holster on the market. At the core of the Eidolon is the holster shell. The shell is precisely fitted to the weapon on the inside and is smooth on the outside to work in conjunction with the body, belt, and clothing -in nearly any carry position- to maximize comfort and concealment. At the same time, the shell provides attachment points for a host of accessories to allow the user to tailor the holster for their specific carry needs.The holster shells feature an innovative, adjustable retention feature that isolates the tension solely on the front of the trigger guard. This provides for an extremely clean “feel” when drawing and holstering - unlike other companies’ adjustable retention holsters which simply compress the holster body along the entire trigger guard and/or frame, resulting in a mushy feel as the pistol drags against the inside of the holster.All Eidolon holster shells are fully compatible with most extended controls, factory and after-market sights of any height (including suppressor sights), any type of RDS mounted behind the ejection port, and most extended/threaded barrels.Full KitThe Eidolon Full Kit gives you all the accessories needed to optimize your holster for either AIWB or IWB carry on nearly any body type. The Eidolon Full kit is a tuckable, versatile, and comprehensive IWB/AIWB holster package that can be used with one or both belt attachments and give you hundreds of potential configuration options. The Full Kit includes: One holster shell of your specification One pair of belt attachments of your choice One Tall Spacer for mounting the belt attachment below the trigger guard One 8-hole Extension Wing One 10-hole Extension Wing One Short Spacer for mounting the Extension Wing below the trigger guard, angled up toward the belt line. One set of Belt Loops One Holster Wedge for right or left hand configurations All needed hardware and full instruction manualShell Models The Glock 26/19/Universal model has a pass-through open bottom design and will fit any 3rd or 4th Gen. Glock 9mm/.40cal double stack pistol. The holster shell itself is equal in length to a Glock 19 pistol. The Glock 17 model has a closed bottom design equal in length to a Glock 17 pistol, but will fit any Glock 26/27/19/23/17/22 3rd or 4th Gen.Included Accessories Tuckable Overhook Set: Choose between Overhooks for 1.5"" or 1.75"" belts. Can be used as a pair or individually mounted to the holster shell or the Offset Wings (also included). Overhooks offer two ride height positons 5/8” up or down, and approximately 15 degrees of cant adjustment, forward or back. -OR- Tuckable Soft Loop Set: Can be used as a pair or individually mounted to the holster shell or Offset Wings. The polymer struts provide two ride height positions 5/8” up or down and approximately 15 degrees of cant adjustment forward or back. Soft Loops are adjustable, and will fit 1.25”, 1.5”, and 1.75” belts. The soft loop itself mounts in a slot to allow infinite ride height adjustment within the slot envelope. The loop itself can be rotated to allow infinite cant adjustments forward and back. Once tightened down, little nibs in the strut face lock the loop in place and prevent movement. Tuckable Soft Loop sets are a $5.00 upgrade to the Eidolon Full Kit. -Plus- Tall Spacer Block: Used to mount the Overhook below the trigger guard to allow the Overhook to clear the holster shell and adjust for cant. 8-hole and 10-hole Extension Wings: Allows one or both belt attachments to be offset from the holster body. This allows for a thinner, but wider (and thus more rotationally stable) system. It also provides alternate cant- and ride-depth options. Lastly, the wings can interact with the belt to provide different leverage effects on the holster shell. They can be mounted on the inside or outside face of the holster shell to further vary the way they lever the shell toward or away from the body. If you choose the Tuckable Soft Loop belt attachments, you can remove the soft loops from the struts and mount them directly to the Extension Wings for yet more options. The Extension Wings can even be used without a belt attachment, mounted vertically or horizontally anywhere they will fit, to apply a range of leverage points to the holster shell. Short Spacer Block: Used for mounting an Extension Wing below the trigger guard with the wing angled up toward the grip of the pistol. This allows the wing to clear the profile of the holster shell. It can also be mounted to Extension Wings or other places on the holster to lever the shell or belt attachments in or away from the body. Belt Claw Set: This accessory sets the Eidolon apart from all other AIWB holsters on the market. The Belt Claw mounts to the side of the trigger guard area and juts out toward the belt line. As the belt is tightened, it pushes against the Claw and levers the grip of the weapon into the body. The shape of the Claw is designed to blend into the lines of the holster shell for comfort. It also works in conjunction with the angled sight-channel area to allow the holster to conform to the waistline and virtually disappear under cover garments. The serrations on the face of the Claw are meant to “grab” the pants material to minimize holster movement, but are blunted to prevent damage to clothing. Belt Claws come in sets and can be mounted angled up or down to best make contact with the belt line in any cant or configuration for both right and left handed shooters. Holster Wedge: Designed to mount to the inside face of the holster shell toward the muzzle end, the Wedge will help lever the top and grip of the weapon into the body and maximize concealment especially in an AIWB configuration. The Eidolon Holster Wedge is optional, and can be removed if not needed. It is made from a special polymer which is soft enough for all day comfort, yet durable to last the lifetime of the holster."
