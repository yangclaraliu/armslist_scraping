It was manufactured post WWII (1945) in Czechoslovakia and sold to the Israelis thereafter. Originally in 7.92x57 (8mm Mauser) it was rechambered to 7.62NATO by the Israelis sometime in the 1950's. Sometime between the late 1950's and early 1980's Israeli sold thousands of these rifles to the Guatamalans where they were used until the early 1990's and finally taken out of service. There is a wordpress write up online that goes into greater detail. On to this rifle.I purchased this rifle less than a year ago with the intent of collecting it and nothing more. That being the case I've only fired about 30 rounds through it, total. Some rounds fired were M80 ball, some were Federal gold metal match. It shoots well but is no tack driver, I was able to accomplish about a 3 inch group at 100 yards with match ammo. It shot about the same with surplus radway green 7.62 which leads me to believe that the rifle does not care much about bullet weight. It is indeed safe to use either 7.62NATO or .308 Win. The bore is dark and the rifling is pretty strong and as I said, it shoots pretty well. It has an Israeli beech stock on it that was installed when they rechambered it. None of the numbers match which is typical of these rifles. I checked the headspace on clymer gauges when I first received it and it passed, just fine. The original Israeli sling will be included. There are a couple German waffenamts on the rifle but only on the firing pin, safety lever and bottom metal. I am not interested in trades so please do not ask, your email will only be left ignored. Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you for looking.Price is 500 OBO"

Description is as follows from website I bought from.
The CMMG 300 AAC Blackout Barrel features 1 in 7"" twist rifling and a pistol length gas system. The muzzle is threaded 5/8""-24 for use with muzzle brakes, flash suppressors, or sound suppressors. Gas block and gas tube not included.
CMMG's durable salt bath nitride finish is a unique protective coating applied to the barrel that surface-hardens the metal, extending barrel service life by reducing friction in the bore and lessening bore surface wear. This treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, making for easier cleaning and maintenance. Nitriding converts the steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering from the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore.

This is a Kahr CT380 with FACTORY Tungsten Cerakote slide (NOT a coating added later). This makes the slide less reflective and gives it a very cool gray look, different than most of the shiny slide Kahrs you see. This pistol is a Limited Edition model and the other important thing that is different about it is that Kahr ships this model with TWO magazines, unlike all the other C-Series pistols which ony get one.
This is a neat little pocket pistol that only weighs 12.5 ounces unloaded with an empty magazine installed, and is only 3/4 inch thick, but yet sports a full 3-inch barrel and great sights. It offers 7+1 capacity. I have found this size to be just large enough to be really shootable while still being ultra-concealable and reliable. I got this pistol for a review project. It has been test fired only, and was 100% reliable with FMJ ammo and also Speer Gold Dot hollow points we used to test it with. It was really very accurate, turining in 2.5 inch groups free-hand at 10 yards.
The gun comes with box and papers and all accesories plus two factory 7 round magazines as shown in the photos. Asking price is $350 but I'm open to reasonable best offers. You can see and purchase the gun at my office just outside of Homestead. You will need proper ID and to sign a bill of sale. All laws complied with. Thanks for looking at my listing."

Description: The Beretta 92 series is an undeniable classic, and its intriguing story goes back much further than simply its adoption by the U.S. military in 1985. In fact, the 92 has a lineage that goes back directly to 1951 and the introduction of Beretta’s Model 951. The 92S magazine release is located at the rear base of the left-side grip panel. While this location was common on many of Beretta’s pistols, it is unique to many American shooters. Rather than using the thumb of the shooting hand to operate the magazine release behind the trigger guard, on the 92S you would be best off bringing up your support hand and using its thumb to press the release while cupping that hand around the magazine to catch it as it is released (or let it drop free if so desired). We are told that these are Police trade-ins from assorted Italian Law Enforcement Agencies."
