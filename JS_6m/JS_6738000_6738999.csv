The BladeTech WRS II holster will hold the M&P9L with or without a Trijicon RMR installed.  It will also hold the shorter 4.25 M&P9 with Surefire X300 equipped.  The holster is a Level 2 retention holster.  It has an automatic releasing hood that will open when the thumb break on the holster is released while gaining a master grip on the handgun.  There is a Level 1 retention that can be adjusted with the two bolts located on the outside of the holster.

The Duty D/OS Tek-Lok is a 3” Drop plate used to attach the holster on to either 1.5” or 2” belt.  The Tek-Lok is a clip mechanism that can be opened, placed on to the belt and closed.  This allows the Tek-Lok to be equipped without having to unbuckle the belt.  The Tek-Lok can be installed on the Duty D/OS , TMMS outer plate or directly to the holster.
The TMMS kit includes two outer plates and one inner plate.  The outer plates can be installed onto the Duty D/OS, Tek-Lok, or Drop leg platform.  The TMMS inner plates slides and locks into the TMMS outer plates.  The TMMS kit allows for quick change from drop leg platform to belt platform.  The TMMS can also be bolt anywhere necessary where the holster may need to be stored or used.
The holster is currently configured to be moved from the drop leg platform to the belt platform quickly.  The holster can be configured to work in number of ways with the Duty D/OS, Tek-Lok, and TMMS accessories that are included.  Extra hardware is included for that purpose as well.  Thank you."

An early semi-automatic for Walther, this design was close to both the Model 2 and Model 5, with the Model 7 having a slightly larger frame than the Model 5. Never intended for military use, it was nevertheless a popular weapon with German officers during the Great War and lacking an import or export mark, this may be one such example. Only produced for a short time with an estimated total production of just 45,000 pistols, the Model 7 is a difficult pistol for the Walther aficionado to obtain. In original condition and retaining fine mechanical function, this scarce Walther would be a superb addition to any pocket pistol collection."

Featuring the distinctive 6"" barrel, two-setting adjustable rear sight and properly marked with Reichsmarine proofs on the frame and barrel, the pistol is in its original service configuration. Apart from the rear sight, barrel, and sear, the pistol is matching. Additionally, there are no Weimar markings, nor any rework markings. There are British proof marks on the underside of the barrel, as well as London House proofs on the toggle. It is surmised that the pistol was in British possession prior to the end of the First World War, and judging by the post-1954 BNP/Tonnage marks, sold as government surplus and(lacking import mark), imported to the US prior to 1968. There are no Broad Arrows, but the pistol may have been retained by the British MOD for training, research, emergency issue, or clandestine use. The other possibility is that the pistol was imported by a British collector, but the finish, looking very similar to standard British Arsenal ""Satin Blue"" as seen on WWI 1911s, suggests the former. Undoubtedly having seen a colorful history, this fine example of a desirable Reichsmarine Luger would be an excellent addition to the advanced collection."

The M2 operates with Benelli's Inertia-Driven® System that has proven itself in the field to be ultra-reliable, cycling both 2-3/4"" field loads and 3"" magnums interchangeably without adjustments. The recoil operated Inertia-Driven System is the epitome of simplicity, with just 3 main parts, that operates cleaner than gas operated semi-automatic shotguns. The smaller mass of parts in the action, and no heavy gas operating components housed inside the forend, make the Montefeltro an extremely lightweight, fast handling upland bird gun made to shoulder in an instant and point naturally. Though the Montefeltro is lightweight, the rotating bolt head features steel locking lugs that lock into the steel barrel extension creating a steel-to-steel lock that becomes even tighter during firing. The Benelli Montefeltro is known to withstand hundreds of thousands of rounds with no failures, and is famous as an ultra-reliable semi-auto shotgun for high volume shooting sports. The M2's weather resistant synthetic stock together with a dimpled checkering pattern on the pistol grip and fore-end, provide an incredibly secure grip in wet or dry conditions. The buttstock utilizes Benelli's Comfor Tech® recoil reduction system that reduces recoil by as much as 48%, enabling shooters to stay on target for fast follow up shots. Benelli uses Crio® System barrels on their M2's that feature cryogenically treated barrels with an even-grained, slick surface that minimizes pellet deformation. The Crio® choke tubes are also cryogenically treated and extend into the barrel deeper than standard tubes, producing tight, uniform shot patterns that down birds at maximum shotgun range. The M2 Field has a matte black finished barrel with a lightweight ventilated stepped rib, and a red bar front sight and mid bead. The Benelli M2 Field is an outstanding Semi-Auto Shotgun for duck hunting, upland game hunting, or shooting anything that flies. Comes with 5 Crio choke tubes (C, IC, M, IM, F), wrench, and a hard gun case.Strong and simple inertia operationCycles both 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells without adjustmentsComfor Tech recoil reduction systemCrio System barrel and choke tubesLightweight and fast handlingIncludes 5 choke tubes and hard gun case"

With a maximum capacity of 15 rounds, the Beretta 92FS holds an average amount compared to other pistols of the same caliber. Beretta suggests a retail price of $650, which is less than the average 9mm Luger pistol.The average 9mm Luger bullet has 338 ft-lbs. of energy at the muzzle, which is comparable to the average pistol's round 338 ft-lbs. On average, this round has a muzzle velocity of 1,104 fps , which is about average compared to other pistol rounds.Suitability for concealed carry is highly subjective and difficult to quantify. Smaller handguns will be easier to conceal but may be more difficult to handle. More powerful ammunition may have greater stopping power but will often be more difficult to fire accurately."

It was developed by Howa and has some minor modifications made by Smith & Wesson engineers.As usual with gas-operated shotguns, the gas mechanism of the Model 1000 is in the front of the magazine tube, which is concealed by the fore-end. The barrel is fixed during firing, but can be removed easily without use of tools. This facilitates cleaning and permits changing of barrels. Spare interchangeable barrels with various lengths and chokes are available. As with most semi-automatic shotguns, shells are loaded into the magazine through a port in the receiver bottom. A magazine capacity pin extending laterally through the magazine tube reduces total capacity of the gun to three shots as required by Federal Migratory Bird Regulations. Removing this pin increases the magazine capacity to three shells or total capacity of the gun to four. The gas system at the front of the magazine limits its capacity to three rounds although the total length of the tube and fore-end are quite long.The crossbolt safety in the rear of the trigger guard has a red band that is exposed when the safety is disengaged. It can easily be reversed for left-handed use.A ventilated barrel rib fitted with front and mid-rib metal beads is a standard feature of the Model 1000. The rib is 5/16” wide and is finely checkered to reduce glare. The receiver top in line with the rib is finely grooved.The gun has pleasing lines and a generally attractive appearance. Both stock and fore-end are well-figured, dark brown walnut with a high-gloss polyurethane finish. Cut checkering on the pistol grip and fore-end is about 20 lines per inch and of generally excellent quality. Fitted to the stock are a black plastic buttplate and grip cap separate from the wood by white plastic spacers. A round plastic inlay in the grip cap bears the Smith & Wesson monogram in silver-color letters on a blue field.Made of aluminum alloy, the receiver and trigger guard have a black-anodized finish. The steel barrel is finished in a high-luster blue. The breechbolt assembly, trigger, and carrier are chrome plated. Both sides of the receiver are scroll engraved by an acid-etching process.The Model 1000 shotgun has a 28” modified-choke barrel. This gun shows generally excellent workmanship and finish. Well proportioned, this gun points naturally, is easy to carry, and can be brought into action quickly. Point of balance is 7” forward of the trigger which makes the weight well distributed between the hands. Loading and unloading is easy, and the gun is convenient to use as a single-loader. The trigger pull weighs 4 ½ to 5 lbs. The gun weighs only 6 ¾ lbs. which is light for a 12-ga. shotgun, especially for an autoloader. This is an advantage for an upland field gun where the gun is carried for long periods, but the lightness increases recoil. The recoil is not very great with light loads, and can be endured even in prolonged firing. It is much more pronounced, however, with heavy loads such as 3 ¾-dram equivalent. With magnum loads, recoil is severe. In firing 2 ¾” magnum loads, the heaviest for use in this gun, the computed recoil energy is 45 ft. lbs."
