I fired 65-70 shots to test it and it fed and functioned perfectly. Accuracy was also good even though the ammo was cheap. I installed an extended Strike Industries charging handle latch but otherwise all parts are original. It comes with everything from the factory including a 20rd magazine, magpul sights, and an AAC muzzle brake. This rifle is close in size and weight to a standard AR but being in 308 has a big boost in range and power. PRICE LOWEREDThe price started at 1300 but i have lowered that to 1200 which I think is fair since the same rifle costs 1500 from Cabelas.I will consider partial trades, especially i you are offering reloading components. I can include some extra magpul mags for a little more. Any buyer will need to be willing to sign a bill of sale and show a WI DL or carry card.More pictures are available on request. You can contact me though armslist or by texting at eight four seven-212-seven four four eight.The reason I am selling this rifle is that when I took it home I saw the handguard had been improperly installed and there was no spring on the ejector port cover. I have since reinstalled the handguard properly but DPMS really ticked me off with their response so I decided to sell the rifle. Because they used rocksett to secure the handguard it got scratched up a bit during removal. Cosmetic only, but the DPMS handguard is not the greatest so I would recommend replacing it anyway. THis is reflected in the price. I can send pictures of the cosmetic damage to anyone interested."

In short, the Model 11 is the perfect firearm for hunting anything from small game to whitetail in the mid-west to elk above a granite basin out west, or, a dark bruin along a misty beach somewhere. It is a rifle for all hunters, from those wanting a firearm that is lightweight and elegant to those seeking a firearm that exemplifies their personal passion for hunting and the outdoors."

Firearm is in excellent condition and comes with a Tague holster that cost $40. The Judge is a great self defense weapon for anyone simply because it can chamber the 410 shotgun shell and 45 Colt. The 45 Colt is a 200-300 grain chunk of lead cabable of long distance shooting. 410, especially buckshot, would be the perfect round for self defense as there is enough force and spray to stop any intruder while minimizing collatoral damage from over penetration. Another option would be to use 410 slugs which can travel up to 1600FPS and carry quite a bit of mass. I have shot this gun up to 25 yards with surprising accuracy, but I can not say I have tried any further. The double action trigger is superb and something I was not expecting from Taurus. The overall quality is very good. Not interested in trades right now, CASH ONLY, and I do prefer a bill of sale. This model costs $520 retail plus tax, I am asking only $450 and that includes the $40 holster. Let me know if you are interested. Will trade for 22lr pistol, 9mm Luger ammo, 22lr ammo, or 45 Colt ammo. Let me know what you have to trade."

Since I can only upload one picture, please pardon me and email for more; I will get to you after my classes.
 
It has an import stamp on barrel by the cleaning rod, and has matching serials on receiver and barrel.
Bolt is an 1891 type, with a reserialzed handle and nonmatching serialized cocking nob.
The floorplate is tight fitting and also a different serial.
Buttplate is also of the same catigory - mismatched but pre WW2.
The stock and recevier are not marked with any known rearsenal marks.
Stock has the round soviet mark on every 91/30 izhevesk, but is also circle-MA marked and overall has battle gouges and scratches, errr, character.
The barrel is counterbored, the rifling is very good compared to my other mosins, and the bolt had yet to be cleaned of cosmoline when I bought it.
 
It is my theory that the bolt, magazine, and buttplate were either battlefeild replacements or salvaged from the Winter War in 1939 for reuse in new production 91/30s.
How it got counterbored without a rearsenalling is unknow to me, unless either it isn't truely nonrefurbished or counterboring was done in the feild or in the war.
If you have further knowledge about this rifle, or desire pictures, do not hesitate to contact me.
Thank you for your time, (and hope the text isn't a jumbled mess)!"

Model) I am the original owner.  I bought it back in 2013 and since then put about 1,000 rounds through it.  For me that's like 2 or 3 times to the range and then there is sat basically for the next 2 years untouched.  I meticulously care for my firearms and it was cleaned and oiled after each use.  It's all original except for some VZ grips I added, I still have the OEM grips as well. The gun comes with all the stuff it did the day I bought it, even the 2 spent casings from the factory. This gun looks and feels brand new.  I paid 800 for it not including the grips and extra mags.  All I am looking for is a gun that has a similar retail value.  NOT A USED VALUE! So basically a gun that when it was bought new was worth $800 bucks.  I don't want to go back and forth with people about the price of my gun and/or your gun.  So this seems like a simple way to do it.  I would be open to any 9mm or 45. I am also open to rifles as well.  Basically I am bored with my STI and want to switch it up.   What do you have? Let me know!! Also if you have any optics... just thought I would toss that out there!email me for pictures."
