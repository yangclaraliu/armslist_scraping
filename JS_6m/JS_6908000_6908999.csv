The only thing 'wrong' with this example is that there is a very faint number on the left side of the slide, which is barely visible in the photograph. Other than that it looks and functions like any other Glock.I am looking to trade for a CZ P07/P09 or a Sig P320.

Curt 405-six-six4-114nine......Below are the specs......From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past.The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability.You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck.

As expected once the parts ran out the Abilene disappeared.The blued 4 5/8” Packin’ Pistol with a heavy bull barrel is one of the best looking, best balanced .44 Magnums I had ever encountered and the heavy bull barrel did a lot to help dampen felt recoil.

This upper assembly features a gas piston operating system, which prevents hot gas and debris from being directed back into the action upon firing. The result is a rifle that runs cooler, cleaner and more reliably than those utilizing a standard direct gas impingement system of operation. The bolt carrier's solid steel, 1-piece construction incorporates an integral piston strike face to maintain integrity over time, while the bolt assembly is spring loaded for proper lock-up and to help reduce bolt bounce and cam pin wear. The complete upper assembly, includes a flattop receiver, and 16″ M4 profile chrome lined barrel. The M&P15 PSX also features an A2 birdcage compensator, complete bolt carrier group with chrome-lined carrier, staked, chrome lined gas key and charging handle. In addition, the PSX includes a 7"" Troy Quad Rail, allowing the shooter to mount a vertical grip, lights, or any other popular accessory to the handguard.

The rifles wood has been re finished and looks great.The PSL has been in service in Romania since the 1970s and is widely sold on the world market. They are frequently encountered in Iraq where they appear to be quite popular. The simplicity of the rifle makes it ideal for soldiers to use and maintain. The action, being a variant of the AKM's, is extremely reliable despite lack of maintenance, and is particularly forgiving of sand and other debris. The scope's reticle pattern is easy to use and makes range estimation quick and reasonably accurate without any mathematical calculations necessary. With some simple instruction an average individual can be issued a PSL and successfully engage targets at ranges that far exceed the accurate capabilities of non-scoped assault rifles like the AKM, AK-47, etc. Accuracy varies greatly, however, between individual rifles to a greater extent to other rifles in its class, probably due to insufficient quality control during the manufacturing process. In the hands of a capable shooter and with quality ammunition such as 7N1 and 7N14 a PSL is capable of 1 Minute of angle (approximately 1"" at 100 yards) or less while the rifles on the other end of the spectrum are only capable of about 3 MOA. Complete with original military scope. These rifles are also known as a Romak-3 PSL and SSG-97 and are extremely accurate/reliable. This gun  is the Romanian version (PSL). This is a great Riffle for many reasons. The PSL rifle's primary purpose is to be used by a platoon level designated marksman to engage targets at ranges beyond the capabilities of the standard issue AKM carbines. The PSL's operation is the same long stroke piston action of the Kalashnikov family of weapons. Its appearance is similar to the Dragunov sniper rifle yet not one single part interchanges between the rifles. It's semi-automatic and it uses very powerful 7.62x54R caliber ammo. which is a Very Large round. Bigger than .308! The PSL is chambered for the same venerable 7.62x54mmR (rimmed) cartridge as the Dragunov, and feeds from a ten-round detachable box magazine. The magazine used on the PSL differs from that of Dragunov models in that it is stamped with an X shaped pattern on the side, rather than the waffle style stamp found on the Russian and Chinese magazines. The magazines, though they are similar in shape and size, are not interchangeable between the Dragunov and PSL without modification. The size of this round (7.62x54R) and the long barrel of the rifle allow shooting out to 1000yds plus. These features make the perfect long range Rifle for any situation. Comes with Two 10 round mags and a cleaning kit and sling. This rifle comes complete with scope that has a built in range finder reticle which was originally lit with radioactive Tritium and is still going strong! Numbers of these rifles are very limited and are very hard to find.This rifle is a valuable investment and a great collector's piece and a very fun gun to shoot."
