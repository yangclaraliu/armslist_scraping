The Patriot Holster was specially made for the XDs to fit with a Viridian C5L attached and currently has the ECR installed on it. I am not including the viridian C5L in this purchase. Its single stack magazine, slim profile and light weight makes it easy and comfortable to carry while still giving more than adequate fire power. The barrel and slide have a flat black corrosion-resistant Melonite finish that is tough and durable. The XDs comes with 2 interchangeable backstraps giving you the ability to customize your grip to best suit your needs. The custom holsers cost over $200 plus $100 in the CT laser.
The sighting system on the XDs is a white 2 dot rear and a red fiber optic front sight that can be changed to green if you desire with the extra Litepipes that come with the gun. This sighting system is a huge advantage over standard sighting systems when acquiring targets in low light conditions. The XDs has both a grip safety and a Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Trigger System as well as a loaded chamber indicator which makes the XDs one of the safest pistols on the market today. Feel free to ask any questions, if buyer chooses to use a personal check, check must be cashed and cleared before shipping. Buyer pays for 2 day air (fed reg on all handguns) and I can provide an estimate if desired."

So Matrix went in a partnership with Aerospace to make AR rifles. They originally sold weapons to the goverment. They are also tied to Aero precision from what i gathered from my research. Matrix Aerospace makes parts for a bunch of companies a major one is Ruger. This rifle is the DPMS pattern Upper and lower. It has an IMI buttstock. Lords nickel boron BCG. Hougue Ar10 grip. The scope is a Bushnel Bone collector 3-9×40 the scope and Leupold riser rings can be added for an additional $100. The scope is very clear and has bullet drop comp for .308. The barrel is a little bit over 18 inches the HFDF flash hider is 3.5 inches making the barrel alone roughly 21.5 inches. I am the second owner the guy who assembled it said the twist was 1/9 which is pretty low for .308. This gun could easily become a DMR. I believe this gun is 38 inches overall with the butt stock in the shortest position so long range shots are not hard at all for this firearm. The free float is octagonal with endless future options. The picitinny rail is 20 in. It has 50 rails slots that are numbered from T1 to T50 so your options are literally endless. It has a small abberations below the dust cover (as seen in pic) i have no idea what it is but it doesnt effect peformance. Bluing is 98% almost perfect. The original owner had over 1250 in it and im looking to mainly sell to fund an ak project but will entertain trade offers. I took it to the range once and that was it the scope may need to be adjusted a bit. I will sell it w/ scope 1200 without scope 1100. I have 180 in scope and rings but my loss is your gain. It will come with 1 dpms magazine. Buyer must be willing to sign bill of sale.

I bought a couple other subcompacts around the same time and just never ended up favoring the G27, so it has turned into a safe queen. I have brought it to the range a couple times but never ended up carrying it. It has roughly 500 rounds through it. It comes with all the original materials (case, cleaning rod & brush, paperwork, lock and speed loader). It comes with glock factory night sights, Apex Tactical flat faced trigger, Ghost Elite connector, Ghost HD trigger spring, Zev 3lb trigger spring, Apex Ultimate Saftey Plunger, extended slide lock lever and mag release (with American Flag on opposite side), rounded Ghost slide release, ""27"" slide back plate, ""27"" grip plug, 4x .40s&w mags (3x 9rd, 1x 10rd), fluted Lone Wolf Alpha Wolf 9mm conversion barrel, 2x ETS 9mm mags. I believe I still have most of the stock parts in a drawer that I can include with the gun. Looking to either trade this whole package for something that I have been wanting, or just sell it all as a package. Priced out individually this package comes out over $1k, but I know I would never get close to that. I am willing to accept all offers, just please don't low ball me because I know what it's worth, it's like new and I know how hard it is to get a newer glock in MA, especially since our libtard AG started cracking down the last few months on stores that were still willing to transfer Glocks."

I put 100 + steel case Tulammo rounds thru the barrel in one shooting session just to see how it functions w/cheap Russian Ammo & not a single hick up. Lots of Safety features, It's a striker fire, Glock style trigger, unlike Glock it has a manual ambidextrous safety, same with the mag release, high profile sights, rear sight is adjustable. Great reliable gun that won't break your bank. I'd rather trade for another pistol within similar price range but obviously won't say no to cash. I can add quality 3 eye lid black thumb break leather holster & Pelican 1170 Pistol case for the right trade.Thanks for looking."

So I'm looking to either sell it or trade it for something I'll use more often. This is a completely dedicated .22LR upper. These uppers go for $625 new. It connects to a regular AR15 lower.

I had a custom ""AR22"" ""22LR"" ejection port cover made for it. I will also include the OD green buttstock (buffer not included), the OD green ergo pistol grip & the OD green front grip.

Please pay attention to their descriptions! My prices are flexible, but I am not in a rush to get rid of these so no lowball offers. Thanks for looking and feel free to email me if you have any questions. Remington 1100 (Ilion Ny Mfg) $150    This is a gunsmith special. It's been in my family for about 40 years but the thing is shot out. The bolt is locked to the rear and won't travel forward any longer. The finish has some light surface rust in a few spots. She's seen better days but if you know how to replace a few springs or are looking for a cheap fixer upper, she is perfect for you. Rossi .357 Magnum Revolver $300    LNIB, I have never shot this firearm. It has pulled nightstand duty for a very brief stint but has since collected dust. I have the original box included with it. IF you are looking for  a budget priced carry gun or even a backpacking/truck gun this would make a great choice. Thompson Center Hawkins replica rifle $450    This thompson center replica is very well made and an awesome collection to any historian or deer hunters collection. It is .50 caliber and believe it or not is very accurate. I haven't shot it in years but have kept up on the maintenance. This rifle can use modern black powders like pyrodex so if you are looking for a deer gun/wall hanger this could be the gun for you. I also have a small shooting bag that I acquired when I bought this. AK Mags   I have 5 AK mags for sale. I have 3 com bloc surplus mags, 1 tap (faux bakelite) tapco mag, and 1 pmag. I am asking $10 a piece for the steel and $8 a piece on the plastic mags. $40 could buy it all."

The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.  The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.  Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero."

Serial Number shows Rifle was manufactured in 1990 (purchased in 1992) and had a box shot through it and put away in a safe until recently. I put a Nikon 4x12x40 BDC scope on it and Custom made Warne Return to Zero rings and bases (These are over $150 by themselves). This gun has recently been sighted in with Hornady Lite 120 grain ammo at 100 yards and BDC verified out to almost 500 yards. As you can see in pictures, gun is in great condition cosmetically and in it's function. (I have more pictures to send someone who is serious and wants close-up shots) It has very little issues on wood or blueing. Bright action and works flawlessly! Detachable 4 round magazine in perfect shape also. Includes 2 boxes of Hornady Lite 120 grain ammo. (40 rounds) and a hard case. For those reloaders out there: A bonus of 7mm-08 set of Dies, 2 types of powder (each can about half full), 2 packs of rifle primers, 15 rounds already reloaded and a box (18) of Hornady 162 grain bullets.  Yes, this gun looks as good in person as it does in the pictures. Has the steel reciever (not alloy as newer ones have) , wth the 6 locking lugs in the reciever (not in the barrel as in newer BLRs.) Don't miss out on this gun, as they do not come up in this condition very often. If it doesn't sell by new year, it will go back in the safe and be put up on an auction site and the reserve will be higher than $850. Also, comes with original owners manual. Everything will be sold together. No ""I just want the rifle for $650"" emails please. This package deal is worth over $1000 and even if you do get a ""new"" rifle like this one from say a Budsgunshop online, you still will be paying around $800 and your not getting the gun with the steel reciever, ammo, case, scope, rings and mounts, reloading stuff. Get the picture? I am selling all this at a fair price, but for those looking to ""steal"" a gun, move on. I am ex-military and police and don't have time for those games. Please be local to Woodbridge, 18 or over and willing to sign a BOS. ""IF AD IS UP, GUN IS STILL AVAILABLE."" NOT TRADING, JUST SELLING.

Buy It Now!! The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

This allows for the lower and upper to be tighter. The bolt and carrier also stays aligned much better.Both items sold together as a combo."

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring reduces the recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish, and of course, the entire product is backed by the H&K lifetime warranty."
