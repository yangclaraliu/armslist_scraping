I bought the complete pistol lower second hand but built the upper so it's brand new.  It's a semi automatic AR Pistol, but I've listed it as Single Action as I had to pick something in the menu of choices.  As of the first of January it will not be legal to buy or sell an AR pistol, so now would be the time to buy if you wanted one.  I'll be in Los Angeles during the week of November 21 and could do a transfer at an FFL in the area.The pistol lower is multi-caliber, so you could choose to modify it to build whatever you want, but I've built it with a Hahn 9mm mag block. It includes 2 Colt style 9mm mags.  If you wanted to convert it to any other caliber you would just remove the mag block and swap out the upper.Specs:Lower - Rock River Arms complete Pistol Lower (marked and registered as such), Rock River Arms 2-Stage National Match trigger, Magpul BAD Lever, Hahn 9mm mag block, Spikes Tactical enhanced 9mm bolt catch, JP Enterprises 9mm Silent Captured Spring, Phase 5 Pistol buffer assembly, Sig Sauer SBX braceUpper - 9mm forged upper with 9mm deflector and 1/2 door, NFA 8"" premium barrel - nitride coated, 1:12 twist, 9mm Kaw Valley Linear Compensator, BCM KMR Alpha Keymod 7"" Rail, JP Enterprises Enhanced 9mm BCG, BCM Gunfighter charging handlePrice is $1,400 and I'd also trade for an HK45 Compact (not USP) pistol.Please send any questions or offers via PM, not posted in this listing.

The Model 586 uses S & W's L (medium) revolver frame, with a K-Frame sized grip mated to a larger diameter cylinder. During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson developed its L-Frame line of .357 Magnums: the Model 581, Model 586, Model 681 and Model 686. The Model 581 had a fixed notch type rear sight, whereas the 586 used a target style adjustable rear sight. These handguns had a major effect on both law enforcement and sporting markets. The 586 was introduced in 1980 and the 581 was discontinued in 1988.This weapon in in amazing condition and a good investment. . this is a rare mod 581 no dash and original paperwork. .Please text me at REDACTED .

During WWII the R.F. Sedgley Company accepted and completed a contract to manufacture M1903 barrels for the U.S. Marine Corps. These were stamped behind the front sight with USMC over a date and an encircled ""S"" (the SedgleyMark). This barrel is dated 9-42 with front sight cover. The rifle was originally a late WWI Rock Island Arsenal M1903 service rifle in the Marine Corps hands. The WWII rebuild was most likely completed at a Marine Corps Ordance Facility between late 1942 and mid 1943. The Marine Corps rebuilt rifles do not have stock cartouches. The scant stock appears near new and is straight grained American black walnut marked with a small ""c"" in the cut off recess. It has a nickel steel receiver and double heat treated straight bolt. Rear sight leafs are polished bright. Trigger is early WWI ""Krag"" type. Butt plate is the smothed milled type. Black parkerized finish. Marine Corps care and field maintenance of rifles is exceptional and it shows in this piece. The bore is bright with sharp lands and grooves. Rifle shows only moderate service wear and is at least NRA Very Good. Head space is correct. Appearance and function is exceptional with exceptionaly smooth action. Metal and wood on this rifle is about 95% and the overall condition is outstanding!"

Do you want a 12g that will spit out 8 rounds in 6 seconds all while keeping a tight pattern and still controllable? Look not further as I am selling an amazing fire breathing, freedom shooting Mossberg 930 spx with a black aces tactical quad rail. This beauty has been restrained to a bedside it's entire life except for a couple of range days where it does what it does best, killing targets and clays. This is the second generation so there is no worries about it cycling heavy or light loads, It will eat everything you throw at it. As with all used guns that spew freedom and hate, there are minor scuffs but none to worry too much about. Worst scuff is on the end of the tube when despensing bald eagles became too much for the shooter and she dropped it as the clouds split and the heavens smiled upon her. Comes with all the gear to swap it back out to stock if your a commie and dont like the quad rail. (Main Rail, bolts and rear sight). If you have any questions or want more pics just shoot me an email. Low round count, always cleaned after use and taken care of. Asking 750obo and willing to drive to meet you if you want it."

The bluing is Colt’s earlier bright bluing and retains 95%+ of its original finish with no pitting. The sights, bolt, and buttplate appear to all be original as well. These little rifles are difficult to find in this condition and this one would make a good collectors piece of simply just a fun little rifle for shooting squirrels. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks for looking!Dustin REDACTED"

This is a used but like new Romanian PSL-54C rifle, complete with the original Romanian scope and (7) 10 round magazines, which is a $490.00 value just for the magazines.  These rifles, also known as a Romak-3, SSG-97, and PSL, are extremely accurate and reliable. The Dragunov design has been in use since the mid 60's, and is still the official design of Russia and other Com-bloc countries. This is the Romanian version, which improved on the Russian design as far as reliability goes. It uses the same type of action that an AK-47 uses. This rifle uses the powerful 7.62x54R caliber bullet. The large size of the round and the long barrel of the rifle combine to allow shooting out to 1000 yds. These rifles are getting harder and harder to find.  This rifle is a valuable investment, a great collector's piece, and fun to shoot."

There are very few wear marks on the gun, but the base of the bolt handle has some of the blue worn away and there are a few various marks on the barrel. 
Just in aftermarket parts, the stock, brake and base are over $300 new.  The thread service cost $150, so for a rifle with less than 300 rounds down the tube, you really have a GREAT and very accurate gun.  Ive attached pics of some of the groups ive done with handloads.  let me know if you have any questions"

The upper was bought brand new & completed from Stag Arms and is a limited edition left-side ejecting upper with a carbine-length gas system on a 16.5"" double chrome lined cold hammer forged barrel completed with a ""Live Free or Die"" pig cone muzzle device which is designed to project sound 90% straight forward, which dramatically reduces sound for the operator and reduces muzzle flip. The forend is Bravo Company USA rail on top, 7 sided keymod (octagon rail) with off brand rail covers on top and Bravo Company USA GUNFIGHTER keymod covers on the rest. Underneath the forend is a Magpul stubby foregrip. On top of the rifle is a Rhino Reflex Scope, with 2 colors (red & green) with 3 brightness levels for each color and 2 off-points on the dial, with flip-up lenses covers. This scope is rated up to shotguns recoil and performs flawlessly and holds zero on this AR. I currently have scope zeroed to 25 yards. On top/left side are canted iron sights zeroed to 25 yards. The BCG is Stag Arms Teflon chromed NicB rated to full auto. The charging handle is Bravo Company USA medium sized ambidextrous.The buttstock and pistol grip are Hogue overmolded and there is no rattle in the buttstock as is common with carbines. Buffer tube system is carbine and is mil-spec (not commercial).The lower receiver is a Palmetto State Armory stripped receiver, with a CMMG lower parts kit installed professionally and engraved curved trigger guard to make it more ergonomic for the operator wearing gloves.Mag release is engraved with Punisher for OUT OF STATE SALES (releases) and will be installed by FFL before shipping to you, but (not pictured) the rifle is currently pinned with a solid black colored magazine pin to make the rifle NYS SAFE ACT legal. I don't agree with the law, but I WILL follow it. There is no play/wiggle between upper/lower and it lines up perfectly and shoots flawlessly every time. Meticulously maintained.A new 1 point black Fox Tactical sling is also included.Also included in sale are at least 6 30-rd pmags (half with windows) fully loaded with ammo, and a couple hundred more rounds of ammo in a Fox Tactical dump pouch. A lot of the ammo IS green tip. I also have 1 5-rd hunting magazine by Remington included.Also included, Barska load bearing plate carrier with 5 mag pouches, and radio pouch with Velcro name holder top center (black color, brand new) and it holds large AR500 plates (plates not included)..I also have the original birdcage muzzle device, OD green camo buttstock, OD green forend and OD green 30 round pmag, to accompany sale; in addition to other various rifle parts (example: original charging handle) that I'll toss your way. Overall, this is an excellent value for the price.
