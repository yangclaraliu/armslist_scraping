Not a garage drillpress hack-job. I work in a machine shop and I have done a dozen or more of these lowers over the years following mil-spec dimensions. If you're curious, ATF allows pistols to be converted into rifles, and back again. So you can legally put your rifle length barrel on this lower or build a rifle off it in the future if you choose. This is also an excellent candidate for a future SBR build. Upgrades on the pistol:Sig braceTroy Free Float tubeTroy Claymore Linear CompMagpul AFGMagpul ASAP sling mountBCM Gunfighter Medium latch charging handleRainier Arms barrelHogue pistol gripThe second upper is a Palmetto State Armory 5.56 upper with Magpul MBUS sights and an aluminum skeleton angled foregrip.Please contact me via email or text for more pictures. 6one2seven5zero2five3nine"

Finally available for public consumption is the much anticipated Scorpion sub-gun. Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.  Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4″ sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants. The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.https://youtu.be/8XAYsYwZGxISorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this handgun online at www.copsgunshop.net;"

It's such a pretty firearm that I didn't want to ruin it with a matte scope so I had it boiled down to either of two Leupolds, and FX-1 or VX-2 but just never sealed the deal. I inherited my father's Remington pump-action .22 Model 12 since then so all this is for sale. Everything here is genuine Browning. Also have a Browning SA-22 case that I paid $249 for that I will include for $200.
A living tribute to John Moses Browning! Few autoloading rimfire rifles have endured the test of time and the marketplace like the Browning Semi Automatic-22. The SA-22 is one of the first autoloading rimfire rifles ever made, and one of the most desirable. One of John M, Browning's final designs, his genius shines through in every detail. The slim, forged steel receiver and slender barrel take down into two compact units without tools."

NOTE NOTE if you are farsighted you typically cannot see iron sights properly as they are blurred; not anymore! RMR is on the same focal plane as the target; as long as you can see the target the dot will be in focus! Second advantage? Faster to use.

The top of the line most expensive loaded RMR is this one the RM06. LED sight powered by a standard CR2032 battery. Adjusters with audible clicks allow for quick windage and elevation adjustments. The eight available brightness settings can be manually adjusted by pressing the plus or minus buttons. Switch to auto adjust press both buttons simultaneously.
