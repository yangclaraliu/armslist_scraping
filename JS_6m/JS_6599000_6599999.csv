EAA SAR B6P Sarsilmaz Compact 9mm Semi-automatic Handgun. ""No wall flowers at EAA."" That's one of EAA's mottos, and we think it's a good one. So what does it mean? It's simple. It means that EAA builds workhorses that are meant to take abuse and keep on shooting - at a price that makes sense. They make everyday shooters, not expensive ""wall flowers"" or wall-hangers.That's the case with the SAR B6P, an updated take on the iconic CZ75 that's built first and foremost to shoot. First, EAA took the frame and recreated it in polymer. Then, they improved the ergonomics... resulting in a pistol that feels as good in the hand as anything out there. And it's all yours for an amazingly low price. If you want an affordable CZ clone, and if you're looking to stretch your budget to the absolute max, this is your best bet.EAA SAR B6P Sarsilmaz 9mm Semi-automatic Pistol special features:   Made by Sarsilmaz Armory, imported by European American Armory Ergonomic grip fits the hand beautifully Auto firing pin block safety and manual safety  Specifications:   Caliber: 9mm Action: Semi-automatic (single action / double action) Capacity: 13+1 Barrel length: 3.8"" Frame: Polymer Grips: Polymer Sights: Fixed 3-dot Overall length: 7.5"" Overall weight: 25.6 ozs."

Sticker says Made in USA. Guitar comes with a nice strap, hard lined case, A-440 tuning fork, and tuning manual. This would make a super first guitar for someone just learning, as it comes with everything you need. If I remember correctly, the strings have been replaced recently and seem to still have a lot of life in them. Near as I can tell, this is ready to be played.There are no condition issues with the guitar itself. The hard case has a few scuffs from age, but nothing major. There's a little piece of foam inside the hard case that could stand to be replaced due to age, but it's not really an issue. All in all, it's remarkably well preserved."

Newcon Optik makes Military application optics.It has maybe an hour on it total, will come with everything as you would expect from the manufacture except it's lightly used.I have used this to range Flourescent fullsize targets up to passed 1100yds.I upgraded so this one had been in the safe.Text me at REDACTED if you're interested.$650 for it.ThanksHere's the info from where I got it, which is BHPhotovideo.comThe LRM 2200SI 7x25 Rangefinder Monocular from Newcon Optik is a handheld electro-optical device built for measuring distances up to 2200 meters away. A three channel rangefinder system (fully multicoated optic, infrared laser emitter, pulse wave receiver) produces readings that are accurate to within one meter. This rangefinder utilizes an eye-safe Class 1 IR laser, proprietary circuitry, and an in-view LCD to deliver reliable and user-friendly operation.In addition to the laser rangefinder, the LRM 2200SI also uses a built-in digital compass and inclinometer to calculate useful data about your target, including direction, elevation, and actual distance. Several measurement modes enable the operator to set the function best for their task, allowing for a single data measurement (linear distance, elevation, direction, speed) or integrated calculations from multiple data sources (actual distance, actual speed). Using Gating Mode, the operator can also use this versatile rangefinder to reject measurements below a user-defined threshold. By ignoring objects that can lead to incorrect measurements, Gating Mode helps the operator pinpoint their target when it is set among several other objects within the visual scene.The LRM 2200SI includes a speed detection feature that is especially useful for border patrol and surveillance applications. The speed detector is activated with the same interface button as the rangefinder and displays the target's speed alongside the distance measurement in the display overlay. Two selectable reticle options, measurement memory recall, and target measurement reliability indicator also equip the LRM 2200SI with features unique to a consumer-level laser rangefinder.A rubber armored housing and oversized interface buttons provides the LRM 2200SI with a non-slip grip that will come in handy while wearing gloves or when conditions are cold or wet. Further enhancing the construction features, this rangefinder is water-resistant and built to operate in freezing temperatures. Fully multicoated optics, built-in tripod mounting thread, and a battery-saving auto-off function make the LRM 2200SI a full-featured rangefinder for a wide range of recreational activities.Optical Performance7x magnification, 25mm objectiveFully multicoated opticsEye-safe 905nm Class 1 infrared laserThree channel rangefinder system11-2406 yd (10-2200m) range with ±3.3 ft (1m) accuracy3-249 mph (5-400 km/h) speed detector with ±1.24 mph (2 km/h) accuracy 1.1 yd (1m) measurement resolution, 0.5 sec estimated measurement time8° field of view, 56° apparent viewing angle±4 diopter adjustment rangeUse and HandlingCompass with 360° range and ±2° accuracyInclinometer with 80° range and ±1° accuracyFirst/Last logic for foreground/background target selectionGating mode for setting the minimum target range10 measurement memory recallSelectable crosshair/square reticleMeasurement reliability indicators (Low/Med/High)In-view LCD display with overlaid system iconsScan mode for continuous measurementMeasurement display in yards/meters, mph/kmhLow-battery indicatorSingle 9V battery operation1/4"" tripod mounting threadConstruction FeaturesWater-resistant housing with rubber armoring-13 to 122°F (-25 to 50°C) operating temperature5x5x2.4"" (13x12.5x6 cm) dimensions15.7 oz (445 g) weight"

Xtras include an attache padded soft case (worth $125) that carries the pistol and mags/accessories, the factory HK rear-mounted nylon single-point sling ($75), 3 magazines ($150), and factory original instruction manual. All parts on it are 100% original German HK date stamped. I bought it from an older gentleman who purchased it brand new in 1990 and only fired a couple mags thru it and then put it in his safe for the last 26 years until I bought it last year. Since I acquired it, the pistol's remained in my safe and I've never fired a single round out of it, as I have several MP5-type firearms and don't have much time to make it out to the range with my hectic work schedule. When he shipped it to me, he put the mags in the same case as the pistol so there are some minor wear marks (none of which go down to bare meteal) on the right side of the receiver. Other than that, its a really clean pistol, especially for its age, and as evident by the minimal bolt carrier wear, and has seen very little use in the last 27 years.  I got a quote from TPM Outfitters out of Carrollton, TX to completely strip and refinish it for $175 if you wanted a perfect and pristine SP89. TPM built a HK94 and MP5K clone that I bought and they do absolutely flawless work and have a finish that looks better and is more durable than the factory HK finish. With it being refinished and flawless, and the very low round count, this pistol would be worth $5000-5500 all day long, as I've seen them sell in that range over the last couple years. These gems only continue to go up in value, especially in pristine condition, as they were only imported in limited numbers between 1989 and 1994 and many remain in private collections never to be seen again. But if you're someone who isn't so particular about having a pristine safe queen and just enjoys taking your firearms out to the range or throwing it in the nightstand as the ultimate Personal Defense Weapon in your home, it would be perfect for that as-is. Paid $5000, my loss is your gain.Also have a LNIB original OEM HK Pulse Beam Model 100 Laser Sight available that fits the SP89, MP5, HK33, HK53, G3, HK94, HK93, and HK91 rifles and pistols.WARNING! Don't be fooled by other low priced listings on Armslist or elsewhere for genuine SP89s for $2500-$3000. THESE ARE SCAMS! Over the last 5 years I have not seen a single genuine German SP89 go for under $3500-$4000 and those had a tons of rounds thru them and were beat to hell. Most in good to NIB range from $4500-$6500.

It is barely used, just cleaned and lubricated, and has no major scratches, no wear, tear, finsh marring, or damage. There are only 3-4 tiny scratches on the slide from normal handling that are only visible in bright sunlight and no longer than 1/2"" in length. The barrel has usual wear on the top of the slide from use. All of the parts are factory, except for the night sites. I have included the original plastic Glock sights that came with it and the receipt for the night sites so that you can enjoy the 12 year warranty. The night sights are also Fiber-Optic and glow a bright green in bright lighting to make them easy to see during the day, and the tritium allows for use at night. I am asking $600 firm. Buyer must pay cash and $35 DROS and processing fees. We can meet at Turner's Outdoorsman in Kearny Mesa to legally transfer the gun.

Very rare Remington Sportsman 58D Tournament 20 gauge shotgun, manufactured in 1962. Acquired at an estate sale from an avid gun collector who passed away. Appears to have been fired very little and is in absolutely amazing condition for a 55 year shotgun, a true safe queen. Features an upgraded Pachmayr White Line recoil buttpad. Came from the factory with a gorgeous custom shop-engraved receiver, trigger guard, and barrel, as well as beautiful wood checkering on the pistol grip buttstock and forearm. Also has a polished bolt and loading port. 15"" LOP (14"" w/o Pachmayr recoil pad), 25"" skeet barrel, 20 gauge, 2 3/4"" chamber. These are very rare, in fact the last one I could find sold way back in 2008 on Gun Auction.com for $1956 with 37 total bids on it from numerous buyers bidding it up to that total. With inflation, that puts the shotgun at $2239 in today's dollar and the one I have is in better condition than the one that sold! In addition, according to Remington and other sources I've checked, far fewer 20 gauge 58D Tournaments were produced than 12 gauges, so that makes this one much more rare and valuable than the 12 gauge that sold in that auction!!! Don't miss out, this would make an excellent addition to your collection and would make a great investment, as these will only continue to go up in value! I recently had a qualified gunsmith inspect it and test fire it with multiple load types in rapid fire succession to ensure proper function; it cycled perfectly, with not a single hiccup, and ate up every round he fed it. So rest assured that it's ready to take down whatever you shoot at. Willing to accept credit card payment thru discreet Paypal transaction with buyer to cover any PP fees. Private sale, no FFL fees or paperwork to hassle with. If a face to face meet isn't possible, buyer to pay actual shipping fees to the FFL of their choice.

In addition, the gun performed better than most after exposure to rain, dirt, and mud.The selective-fire (semi- or fully automatic) Thompson fires from the ""open bolt"" position, in which the bolt is held fully to rearward by the sear when cocked. When the trigger is depressed, the bolt is released, traveling forward to chamber and simultaneously fire the first and subsequent rounds until either the trigger is released or the ammunition is exhausted. This eliminates the risk of ""cook-off"", which can sometimes occur in closed-bolt automatic weapons....Shipping is $150, Payments could be made by usps money order, cashier checks, western union or moneygram.
