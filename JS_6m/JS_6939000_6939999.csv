The gun started as a police issue double action only. It has an incredibly smooth DAO trigger pull right at 8lbs. The gun comes equipped with night sights (about 20% life left, very dim) that can be sent in to have new tritium vials put in or the front sight drilled out for a fiber optic rod. I have also installed the factory sear and seat spring so that with the swap of a hammer you can turn the pistol into ""slick slide"" double/single action (no saftey/decocker so the hammer has to be thumbed down to decock) With the standard hammer the trigger pulls become DA ~8.3 lbs SA ~4 lbs with the beretta D spring (common aftermarket swap on all berettas) the gun is incredibly accurate and very fun too shoot in both configurations with a slide action that's ball bearing smooth with no rattle. The gun was carried as a duty gun for armed security and will come with three 11rnd mags and a two mag carrier. Also included all internal parts to covnert from DAO to DA/SA (I will set up the gun in either configuration per buyers request and show process to chancge it over which is incredibly simple) a soft case, and 50 rounds of 180 grain target ammo. I have thouroughly enjoyed this gun and am letting it go to invest in other projects. This will make an amazing firearm for home defense, ""truck gun"", range shooter, or serve as a duty weapon again. The only flaw she has at the moment is the rubber grips began to dry rot and crumble so the gun currently has only non skid metal plates as place holders for grips. Factory grips can be ordered online for about $20 or you could choose to upgrade to some VZ or Wilson combat grips for a bit more. I'm not particularly interested in any trades as I have a few to many guns to begin with but I'll entertain reasonable offers. She's priced to seek and I think a great bargain for a great firearmIf you have any questions or would like to contact me please text or me at REDACTED. If I don't answer please leave me a voicemail and I'll get back to you as quickly as possible. I'm also willing to meet people within a reasonable distance to sell.

With the intuitive operation of a 1911-style thumb safety, the Micro Bel Air gets on target quickly, when fractions of a second count. The aluminum frame keeps weight down for comfortable carry and resists corrosion from carrying the pistol close to the body. Low profile sights provide quick sight acquisition and interfere minimally when drawing the weapon from a holster or purse. A match-grade aluminum trigger offers a consistently crisp pull for accurate shot placement. The Kimber Micro Bel Air is an extremely lightweight and compact semi-auto pistol that conceals easily and deploys instantly."

A 16"" barreled upper assembly which is designed for short to medium range engagement distances, and a 20"" barreled upper assembly designed to give you maximum velocity for long range target engagements. The REPR is designed around a self-regulating short stroke gas piston operating system providing you with unparalleled reliability in the harshest environments. The non-reciprocating side charging handle allows you to reload the rifle without having to come off the scope taking your eyes off the target.

This is for a progressive 5 stage press, like the ammo planet but does not have the bullet feeder which makes it the ""ammo planet"" (easy to feed with your hand vs cases are not so I bought the case feeder). The case feeder has a plate for large rifle and only requires 4 plates if you want to reload all calibers. They're less than $30 on amazon. It's a great press if you read the reviews online, and probably the best press with the most bang for the buck no pun intended. I am getting rid of it because I have not used it in SUCH a long time, and do not have the patience to swap between calibers. Instead my buddy and I split the cost on his press so he could afford and will just reload together over a some beers. Ammo is getting much harder to get nowadays, and will be harder to buy complete but you can always make it... for much cheaper.
 
Average example of cost
Case of QUALITY accurate hunting/ match grade 168grain .308 
bullet = 31 cents
primer = 3-4 cents
powder (42grns) = 17.4 cents
(powder 7000grns per LB @ $29.00lb (much cheaper if you buy 8lbs @ about $170)
 
Comes out to 51.4 cents per round or $10.28 per 20 round case. You could do better as the cheapest I have made is 42 cents a round ($8.40 case). Please note this is not for cheap Walmart mass produced 140,150 grain lead soft tip bullets, this is based off the 168grn Hornady A-Max I used to shoot. Great savings on other calibers.
 
What it comes with:
Reloading book
Nosler load data book
Custom riser mount
Shell plates for: 308, 223 Rem, 9 mm, 40 SW, 45 acp 
40 SW dies

Lee Ergo hand priming tool
Extra springs
Multiple powde r plungers/ metering insert for large and small loads (makes switching calibers easier)
Cop die (for checking under overload)

I get it, some uppers go for $150 that were built on Anderson parts and are put together by guys that have no idea what they are doing. These uppers are factory built by Del Ton and have properly matched barrels to uppers receiver. Both rifle and carbine uppers have M4 feed ramps and are perfectly mated. The 20in is 1:9 and the 16in is 1:8. Both are NOT chrome lined. If you are looking to do your first AR build, these are great, they are NOT low parts bin grade materials. You will have built a dependable accucate and durable rifle using these components. Lowballers will continue to get ignored and if you do not offer first you will get ignored.

Constructed entirely from welded 300 series stainless steel, the 8.38"" Lg x 1.50"" diameter CYCLONE is the most compact and durable .30cal rifle silencer on the market. The computer optimized baffle stack of the CYCLONE delivers a substantial frequency shift, and the resulting muzzle report is indistinguishable from the ballistic crack of the projectile in flight. The weapon's flash signature is completely eliminated, and recoil is reduced to the extent the shooter can actually see bullet impact through the scope. The slight added weight of the CYCLONE will assist in reducing barrel harmonics which can equate to a significant increase in accuracy with many host-weapons. Delivered with standard 5/8-24 threads. Technical InformationCaliber 7.62mm O.A.
