These were a limited run to experiment with CZ-75 B features. This firearm, used in the active defense of the state of Israel, was purchased as part of a LEO turn-in program, and was imported by CDI Imports - I am the first owner in the US. The only reason I am selling this is I thought it would be a cool project with the menorah, but before I did anything to it other than change the recoil spring for a new one, I contacted Scott at Cajun Gun Works, who builds custom CZs. He told me this one was too cool to customize - he hadn't seen one with B features made this early, nor one of these Israeli market special editions (Please feel free to verify independently, he'll remember the guy who asked him about the massada recoil springs) I would be able to provide you with the receipt and documentation (they sell a lot of Israeli stuff on Gunbroker) from the importer, showing the direct chain of custody from Israel. Since this gun lacks an import stamp, that will certainly be useful to maintain the provenance. Comes with 3 14 round Mec-Gar mags. FTF only."

Built from the ground up, this rifle has been engineered to help you harvest that trophy with the precision and dependability you expect from Daniel Defense. At its core is a free-floating, 18” Cold Hammer Forged barrel, which comes standard with the DD Superior Suppression Device Extended, for reduced muzzle-flash. This top-quality barrel connects directly to the upper receiver through a robust 4-Bolt Connection System with a patent pending barrel extension resulting in increased stability, better accuracy, and reduced weight.   Ambidextrous controls make operating the .308 Ambush comfortable and convenient for both right- and left-handed shooters. You can easily drop the magazine, release the bolt, or operate the safety selector from either side of the receiver. The charging handle is ambidextrous as well and also user-configurable—you can set up either side of the charging handle with a larger or smaller handle to accommodate magnified optics or iron sights for a snag-free setup. The water-transfer printing process (also known as hydro-graphics) of this finish makes for a durable, uniform coating that holds up to and resists even the harshest environments...please contact on REDACTED"

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
 
 
 
The CZ 97 B is the big-bore brother to the CZ 75 B, the first CZ pistol produced in .45 ACP. It is operationally identical to the 75 B (SA/DA, firing pin block safety and magazine brake). Features include a screw-in barrel bushing, loaded chamber indicator and a double-stack magazine holding 10 rounds.
 
Thin aluminum scales slim the grip down to make it comfortable for even those with smaller hands, and the fiber optic front sight and two-dot rear make it great at the range."

This stock is one of our most accurate stocks, the current version is guaranteed for ½ MOA accuracy. It also takes Accuracy International magazines. The bolt and the receiver are nitrided too.""Further according to them, ""it was made before we converted to our new ERP system so we cant track back that far. It was made approx. 4-5 years ago, which is when we had changed over to the new system and when we stopped using Remington actions in our rifles.""The TFM™ designation stands for ""Tactical Force Multiplier"". For those in the know, this rifle is aptly named. Over the last two years, the TFM has gained some quiet traction with the tactical world. The price tag is expensive. However, this truly tactical rifle performs to the very highest of standards.There is simply nothing like the TFM™out there. The full-length integral rail, with 20 MOA taper offers the operator the ability to dial any number, for any ""long distance"" call. Lighter weight for faster deployment and extraction. The design of this rifle is unparalled. HALF MOA accuracy is guaranteed. The machined bottom metal accepts AI magazines, and others. Many manufacturers might call a modified hunting rifle a tactical rifle. But we know the difference. The TFM™ is a purpose-built tactical rifle; built for the world of uncertainty that's out there.Bolt-Action: based on Remington 700. Bolt and receiver are nitride coated.    Barrel Length: 28""Adjustable Trigger: 3-WayBottom Metal: Christensen's machined bottom metal, w/ detachable metal magazine (AI magazine compliant)Match-Grade Button-Rifled Barrel-Type and Contour: Carbon fiber-wrapped, targetRate of Twist 1 in ""x"" Inches: 10Muzzle Treatment: Threaded, w/Ti side port brakeStock Type and Finish: Aerograde®carbon fiber TFM - Natural carbon fiber finishWeight: 7.6lbGG&G BipodCondition: Excellent - UnfiredI am not interested in trades.***WARNING: If you are a scammer and contact me, I will forward all of your contact info to the FBI Internet Crimes division***"
