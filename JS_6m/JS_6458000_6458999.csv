The gun comes with a 16"" barrel and faux suppressor which is removeable, 2 thirty round stick magazines, 3 point sling, original wire stock, spare HK push pins, and the original springs. I've replaced the hammer, all the springs on the lower which improved the trigger pull greatly. Added a  new SS firing pin since the originals can break and new fixed stock from an MP5. The original wire frame stock is included.It's a nice shooting little rifle that I had plans to SBR and just never did. Works well and wasn't used much at all. There are maybe 300 rounds through it as it was very new and unused when I bought it."

THIS IS A NO RESERVE PENNY AUCTION! EXCELLENT PLUS CONDITION REMINGTON MODEL 7600 PUMP ACTION RIFLE CHAMBERED IN .35 WHELEN. COMES WITH 4 POWER LEUPOLD SCOPE. THIS MODEL MADE IN .35 WHELEN FROM 1981 UNTIL 1996 ONLY. GREAT FOR ELK, MOOSE AND GRIZZLY BEAR. If you like pump guns, here’s the perfect one for you! The Remington Model 7600 is a high quality pump rifle that has proved its reliability and accuracy over the years. This one has seen little use. The former owner bought it new and took it deer hunting 3 times and never fired a shot. It has sat in his gun closet for many years. The 22 inch barrel retains about 99% of its original blue and the bore is bright and shiny with sharp rifling. The receiver blue is about 96% with a couple of light handling marks and a few miniscule freckles about the size of pin point. The stock and forend have just two or three slight scratches and the wood is particularly well figured with nice dark streaks running through the deep honey colored background. The Leupold scope has perfect optics and has a few light rubs. The .35 Whelen is a classic, older round with excellent stopping power that can take down any game in the Americas, possibly excepting the largest brown bear species."

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.  This rifle is finished in Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™.

This has been upgraded with a Stainless Steel SVI Infinty Signature Standard Micro Pocket Grip, Signature Stainless Steel Non-Pivoting Grip Safety, Stainless Steel Micropocket Magwell, SVI Short Flat Trigger, and SVI Grip Screw Set. The parts cost alone for these upgrades was $988, before having fit and coated.Grip and mainspring housing are PVD coated black. Gun runs great and only has about 1,200 rounds through it. This gun weighs in at 49oz unloaded meaning very little recoil. Decided to build my own so selling to fund this project.Had the gunsmith do some trigger work with the grip change and this now has a 15lb mainspring and the trigger is incredibly crisp with minimal pre and over travel and breaks cleanly at 2lbs with almost no reset. Everyone that tries it loves the trigger. Initially had some extraction issues so dropped in a Brazos Custom Pro Tuned Extractor and she's run great ever since. I do not have any of the factory or spare parts form this beyond what has been mentioned in this posting.There is some holster wear on the slide in the cerakoted area. Discussed cleaning it up with a local cerakote shop who said it could be done or sand blast the slide for a stainless steel look as the slide is stainless on these. Figured I would leave that up to the new owner. STI may refinsh as well, just haven't tried them yet. Includes the factory 126mm flush 17rd magazine, STI box, takedown tool, paperwork, etc."
