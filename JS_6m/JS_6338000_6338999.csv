In addition, the rear sight also bears the Russian proof mark, the lightening cut on the bolt has the classic heavy swirl marks, indicative of a Russian bolt as opposed to the smooth surface inside the lightening cut on the Chinese bolt. The Russian-made barrel, is indicated by the extra long shoulder in front of the wrench lug where the barrel meets the receiver.  The stock with a two hole butt plate is a modification resulting from China's trade agreement with Albania in the early 70's.  Albania had specified the requirement for an extra hole in the butt plate to hold a separate oiler in addition to the cleaning kit. This is a first year Sino-Soviet SKS that was later modified by the Chinese for export to Albania. Excellent Plus Condition, probably unissued.  Has been meticulously cleaned and test fired, then re-cleaned. Also treated with Z-max Gun Metal Lubricant and Preservative.

Condition: New, in box, with Taurus' industry-leading life-time warranty. Notes: ""Destined to become the standard that all 1911 pistols are compared against, the Taurus 1911 offers you the most accurate and feature-laden model on the market today. Starting with our own hammer-forged, not cast, ordnance grade steel frames, slides, and barrels, we machine each and every part to tolerance levels that surpass even today's industry standards. Our skilled workers hand fit and tune each gun using quality parts built in our state-of-the-art factory. Then they mark the slide, barrel, and frame with matching serial numbers. This rock-solid firearm is ready to go right out of the box. The Taurus 1911 is an unbeatable gun that is also an unbeatable value. ""The Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides 'instant-ready' defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage, simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage, simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.""
