Includes the original box, manual and 50 rds of PMC Bronze HP ammo, a round recommend by the factory. Also includes a leather wallet/pocket holster. This is a tiny gun and it disappears in a pocket. Older gun made in the original Milford, CT factory, which in my opinion are superior to the newer guns made after another company bought Seecamp. Asking $500 cash or $550 trade value."

Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
                Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

This particular model costs $470 new with the long mag tube. The add-ons and gun would cost you $755 with tax and shipping to build. I'll sell it for $500 for everything.

The Walther CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm has the perfect combination of style, ergonomics, and accuracy, with the ability to conceal comfortably.  The Walther SOFTCOIL gas-delayed blowback technology makes this pistol a dream to shoot with minimal recoil and very easy to rack the slide.  I liked this pistol so much I own three of them but don't need all which is why I am selling one.
From my personal collection this fantastic pistol is in excellent condition.  Everything is as it came new in the box.  Comes with two magazines.  This is definitely one of my favorite pistols to shoot due to the limited recoil but I have my eye on something else so someone has the opportunity to own this pistol. Must meet all legal requirements, be over 21 and an Ohio resident for Ohio Private Sale.  I keep records of all my firearm transactions so be prepared to provide a copy of your driver's license or CCW.
NO Trades Considered at this time."
