BUY THIS PISTOL BEFORE JUNE 30, 2017 AND RECEIVE FOUR FREE MAGAZINES, MAG POUCH, AND HOLSTER DIRECT FROM SPRINGFIELD ARMORY! In the post-War years, as 1911s became increasingly common in the civilian market, shooters and custom shops found new ways to upgrade their .45s. Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have. Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application. If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series.

In the post-War years, as 1911s became increasingly common in the civilian market, shooters and custom shops found new ways to upgrade their .45s. Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have. Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application. If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series.  Specs   Caliber .45ACP Recoil System 2 Piece N.M.

If you want a competition grade 1911 that conceals better than a full-sized pistol, the Range Officer® Compact from Springfield Armory® offers finely tuned performance in a smaller package. The Range Officer® Compact brings the precision of a competition pistol in a small and straightforward configuration. Back in 1985, we started manufacturing new 1911 pistols for the consumer market. We’ve been working hard to make the best 1911s ever since. Making them perform on a consistent basis is part of the mission, but identifying the needs and wants of shooters makes up the rest. For that reason, we offer a broad array of models for just about any application. The Range Officer® Compact models offer similar benefits to the Range Officer® Full-size line, but in a smaller package. Whatever your reason for wanting a smaller, lighter and easier to handle 1911, the Range Officer® Compact might be right for you. Like it’s big brother, we make the Compact in both 9MM and .45ACP. Even with its half-inch reduced height, you can still fit eight rounds of 9MM in the magazine plus one in the chamber. The .45ACP version holds six rounds in each of its two included magazines. While smaller on the outside, the Range Officer® Compact is all business on the inside. The Range Officer® Compact has the same quality forged national match frame and slide as the TRP™ 1911s and gets the same amount of attention when it comes to precision fitting slide, frame, and barrel. The four-inch stainless steel ramped bull barrel locks up exactly as intended – every time – because accuracy counts. The Parkerized finish will stand up to daily carry or training days at the range. The sights are sleek and fast, with a fiber optic up front and a low profile combat sight in the rear that won’t snag during the draw.

This is a very accurate example, and is perhaps one of the smoothest shooting .44 magnums I've ever fired. The cylinder length was originally intended for .454 Casull, so there is plenty of room for 300gr+ Hardcast rounds, if desired.
The revolver comes with everything shown below, plus an aluminum hardcase, cleaning brush and jag, and Bushnell Trophy 2-6x scope. Unfortunately, the scope shifted in the rings during its first outing, so there is surface damage to it. The scope is still fully functional, but the rings should be lapped correctly prior to reinstallation. 
.44 Magnum handloading equipment is also available for extra charge on request, including shotshells and plastic practice bullets.

Built around our newest 18” Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel, this platform delivers the speed, controllability, and precision required to engage the most difficult multi-gun stages. The V7 Pro comes standard with the new MFR XS 15.0 M-LOK® rail, which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. An uninterrupted Picatinny rail on top and M-LOK attachment points ensure plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allow for the maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The long 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and it prevents over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnifed optics. The newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb. A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset. Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle-length gas system, this allows for shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue. The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Original owner sent the Hi-Cap Milspec gun to Springfield's Custom Shop in 2007 where the TRP upgrade package was installed and slide stamped with TRP designation. The Custom Shop was still marking slides with the TRP lettering at completion of upgrade. They still offer the TRP upgrade but do not mark slides TRP in the Custom Shop any longer. Gun is Springfield Armory High-Capacity 1911-A1 with all upgrade work done at SA Custom Shop. The pistol was refurbished with the Tactical Response Package (TRP) upgrades to include: Match grade barrel & bushing; Factory skeletonized delta hammer; Extended Kings 201A ambidextrous thumb safety; Beavertail grip safety; Adjustable lightweight match grade aluminum trigger; Two piece full length guide rod with heavy duty recoil spring; Flat checkered mainspring housing; Polished feed ramp; Throated barrel; Tuned & polished extractor; De-burring of internal pistol components; Beveling of pistol sharp edges; Machine checkered front strap (20LPI); Trigger pull tuned to 4.0 lb. The only rounds since SA Custom Shop upgraded the pistol were test fire rounds when returned from custom shop and around 120 rounds at my range. Custom TRP upgrade package alone is worth $1450— plus value of gun itself. Included is the original 10 round double stack magazine and 9 new or slightly used 13 and 14 round double stack magazines. I bought it in 2013, sent slide to Alchemy and had 10-8 rear and Novak fiber optic sights installed, took it to the range a couple times and now it languishes in my safe. Price dropped to $1,450 Cash sorry no trades."
