Type 14 Nambu Service Pistol; December, 1942 Nambu Chuo Kogyo Kokubunji Factory(Nagoya Supervision) Production/Imperial Japanese Service; 8mm Nambu

Superb, matching, large-trigger guard Type 14 Nambue with holster, attachments, capture paper and small archive attributed to PFC S. Reidl...this example of Japan's stadard sidearm during the Second World War, saw production at the Kokubunji arsenal in December of 1942. A relatively early-war pistol, the gun shows little of the rushed finish seen on later-war models and despite its relatively long service life, has managed to retain excellent condition. Lacking import marks, the pistol is accompanied by a virtual archive that was the personal property of PFC Reidl, along with the original rubberized clamshell holster, shoulder rig and cleaning rod. In addition to the original, signed and dated capture paper identifying the pistol by serial number, accompanying documents include: offical service writing tablet with personal addresses written on the pages; a wartime, Division-produced newspaper with stories of the Okinawa invasion and aftermath; various Japanese and Pacific-occupation notes of currency, with Japanese government Philippino Pesos among them; and a War Department-produced ""You are now in the 77th Division"" orientation booklet. Importantly, all visible numbers are matching, to include the correct wooden grips. A Kokubunji Nambu with holster in this condition would be an excellent find for even the advanced collector. With accompanying documents, this pistol should be viewed as a sound investment that will not only hold its value, but appreciate, likely in short order.

Condition:

Is excellent-the pistol retains better than 95% arsenal blue finish, with no rust or pitting, and only expected scrapes around the safety lever. Markings are crisp, clear and serial numbers are matching(apart from the magazine), with the wooden grips being pencil-matched to the gun; firing pin and guide are unnumbered. As stated, no import mark is present on the pistol. Grips rate as very good with mild wear and a small chip missing from the upper corner of the left grip. Mechanical function appears very strong, and the bore is excellent-clean and bright with no rust, pitting or frost visible. Included holster is excellent with kanji marking on the inside of the flap; Cleaning rod is in excellent condition. Documents are rather fragile from being stored folded, but are complete and in good shape."

From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness P offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use.

On top of that most had a $25.00 shipping fee and most would have incurred some sort of FFL transfer fee pushing the price of this gun up towards $700.00. This sale includes a used, but in good condition, Boyt Rifle Case. I beleive it is a Boyt Harness Deluxe Plantation Ps56 soft case as best I can tell and from the research I've done online.

This exceptional performance is accomplished in 2 simultaneous steps. First, the redirection of gas to a 30 degree rearward angle actually pulls the barrel forward, reducing felt recoil. Second, the redirection of gas vertically provides a genuine reduction in muzzle rise. The result allows the shooters sights to remain on target or realigned quickly providing faster accurate follow up shots.Fits standard LWD 40 S&W threaded barrels 9/16 x 24 ALSO TO VEIW MY OTHER LISTINGS, SEARCH SONOMAGOLD"

I bought this AR after reading and seeing really good things about it online. And I have to say, as a basic AR-15, it's got everything you could want for the price. 16 inch barrel, 1:8 twist, forward assist, dust cover. I've taken it out about 3 times over the last few months since the purchase and put about 300 rounds through it. It's a great shooter, runs perfectly, and hasn't malfunctioned yet.  Basically, I've decided to sell it because I simply can't justify another AR-15 in my collection at this point. I don't have a need for this, as I've got a couple higher-end rifles already. If you're looking for your first AR or are looking for a nice starter rifle as a Christmas gift for someone else, you really can't go wrong with this one. I'm hoping to get $650 for it, and I'm hoping to have it sold before the new background check law goes into effect in January."

This is a 17 round capacity striker fired handgun made in Austria and is similar to your glock 19 in size and function. The story behind this gun is the guy that created this series of pistols left steyr and went to work for Glock helping them design there newer 2nd generation Glocks. If you haven't heard of the gun i suggest you do some reading up because these are fantastic guns for the money. It has a really low bore axis which makes recoil impulse smooth and easy for follow up shots. Take down is in my opinion easier than a Glock and much faster. This gun is very accurate and smooth shooter, I bought it new never fired sometime ago and just dont really shoot it much and looking to get rid of it for some cash for other projects. The gun comes with original hard case, two mags, keys for locking mechanism on the gun and original owners manual and warranty card never filled out. This gun is in perfect shape with roughly 150 rounds through it. If you have been looking to pick on of these up now is your chance. Please cash only no trades 475 OBO"

To make that happen, I am going to part with one of my 7.62x39 rifles, the CMMG Mutant MK47 KM2. This is the loaded rifle with the Geissele SSA trigger that breaks like glass, shortened free-float forearm that reduces weight by 11%, 1-10 twist barrel to stabilize boat-tail heavy bullet loads, Magpul furniture, and a 30rd Magpul M3 steel reinforced magazine. Mag release is ambidextrous. Bore is mint. Finish is like new.I will include the QD sling mount for the Keymod rails as well as some lubricant free of charge. Everything else in the photos is not for sale. If you have any questions, let me know. Thanks for helping get my fiance into shooting sports!Cheapest CMMG Factory Geissele Mk47 online!
