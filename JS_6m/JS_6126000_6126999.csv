The reason I say plinkers might not want this gun is that I had Volquartsen install their trigger upgrade.  This was not a cheap upgrade but I compete a lot and I understand what a huge effect a good trigger has on your scores.  If you are interested in enjoying this level of the Mark III Target grade .22, please familiarize yourself with Volquartsen.com and their products and pricing.  They are not cheap but what you get is an unbelievable trigger.  The standard trigger pull weight on these guns is about 5 to 6 pounds.  It is hard to shoot a tight group with that weight.  My groups and my scores, as well as my number of wins, went up dramatically after having this trigger installed.  I use a digital Lyman Trigger Pull Weight Gauge to check all my triggers.  This one consistently reads two pounds or LESS every time.  You really need to feel it to be able to appreciate the difference.  So, if you are already a good shooter who is ready to take your game to the next level with this incredible package, you owe it to yourself to check it out.  The gun is in immaculate condition, not a scratch or blemish anywhere.  Of course I include the original box and paperwork as well as all the factory parts that Volquartsen removed and replaced. You would be basically buying a very slightly used Mk III with the Volquartsen trigger upgrade for the same price as the gun sold for new.  As for trades, I am really not looking for anything in particular but I would be happy to hear about what you have if it is not just plain boring.  :-)    Feel free to respond to the ad directly or call or text with your questions, offers, etc during reasonable hours.  The ad automatically states that shipping is not an option.  That is not correct.  If you would like the gun shipped, I can work with you on that.  Thanks for looking! 864-363-49 fifty"

The barrel came threaded from the factory, with a protective ""barrel nut"" fitted. This made this pistol line perfect for use with a suppressor with an aftermarket adapter since the sights could still be utilized.
The bolt assembly, which comprised the top rearward portion of the pistol, moved behind as well as above the axis of the barrel and resembled an L shape. The recoil spring was contained in the portion above the bolt, which also housed the firing pin. Above the barrel was a large frame lug, which gave the gun a pleasing look of constant width and depth from the trigger guard forward to the muzzle.This also served as a solid block for the bolt to hit against when the recoil spring returned the bolt to battery. The low bore axis served to greatly reduce muzzle jump, and served to allow the fitting of a suppressor without losing the use of the factory sights.
The Model 422 was introduced with a 12-round detachable box magazine, but was later shipped with a 10-round magazine. The 1992 high-capacity magazine ban in California outlawed the sale of magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds.""Call or TEXT REDACTED"

Enosa VNP-009EE Night Vision scope, scope has a STANAG mount for mounting on rifles and is a GEN II night vision device. I'm including a STANAG to picatinny adapter for mounting on flatop ARs, etc. The night vision scope has an inverted ""V"" aiming reticle that can be brightened/darkened or turned off completely, and can be replaced with an AN/PVS-4 reticle diode assembly if you want a different reticle pattern, a replacement reticle is about $40 on the other auction site and they easily drop in by the end user. The included reticle has small scratches on the surface that show when you turn up the brightness, but don't affect the function of the scope. Includes manual in Spanish, green nylon case and accessories. All Spanish military issue. The VNP-009 EE is a ""product improved"" U.S. AN/PVS-4, but is shorter and weighs less, with many parts in common. I replaced the original simple rubber cap for the night scope with a daytime cap used for the AN/PVS-4, so the scope can be tested in daylight, etc. Scope uses AA batteries. Scratches, etc, one battery compartment has a minor crack in the plastic of the battery compartment cap. All the controls on the scope are marked in English. Please feel free to ask any questions or requests for specific pictures, I'll do my best to answer them. Scope works well but item is surplus and is sold as-is. The picture showing the image through the scope is from the actual scope up for sale, best I could get using my cell phone. I have others I can send if you'd like more, just ask. Local pick up is welcome of course. Shipping will be $25.00 via USPS Priority Mail insured to continental US, unless you specifically request UPS. Thanks for looking!"

Get it while you can *,"30 Minutes West of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida","$ 1,000","Listed On: Friday, December 9, 2016",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Selling my gently used Sig Sauer 556R that includes everything that was originally on the gun from the factory including the factory Sig red dot and it is spot on! ( nothing has been changed out ) This is not the easy to find 5.56 / .223 version it is chambered in 7.62x39 ( but an awesome feature is that with the lower or upper of a 5.56 model will fit onto the same frame and you can create a complete new platform and it will shoot the other caliber. Look up SiGalil for more info on that ) If you are unfamiliar with this gun it is basically an AK built on an AR platform for convenience, ( 2 pins ) easy field stripping, and accuracy for the AK47 round which it does amazingly well. Also has an adjustable gas system for anyone running a suppressor. The rifle uses AK mags, runs flawless, and built brilliantly just as you would expect from a Sig, but I have no need for it at the moment as I'm more focused on getting extra income to give my family a good Christmas. Speaking of that, this would make an excellent gift to any AK enthusiast! These are extremely hard to find in this configuration with the adjustable stock and have proven to be more reliable in most cases. As seen here.( It's not letting me post a link so I can text it to you if interested in seeing it )THIS GUN WILL STAND TOE TO TOE WITH ALMOST ANY AK AND WILL ALWAYS HAVE BETTER ACCURACY and TYPICALLY BE JUST AS RELIABLE, IF NOT MORE SO IN MY OPINION, AS IT IS BASICALLY AN AK47 THAT HAS NO HOLES FOR DEBRIS TO GET IN AS WELL AS A GAS REGULATOR. Not only are these no longer produced, but it will be very hard to beat the accuracy and reliability of this compared to ANY AK-47. Looking at some of the higher end AK's these days, you just can't beat it in my opinion.I've only seen about 5 similar to it on gunbroker over the months and most of these models sell for around  $1500 easy. It's in excellent condition besides a couple scuff marks from pulling it in and out of the range bag to shoot ( and a couple dings on the ejection shield, but not bad at all ) , fully functional, never had a jam in any of the rounds I have put through it ( although it's only been about 100-200 ) and has been well maintained.Price is FIRM at $1000 Will come with the 40rd mag in the pics or the metal magazine that is beat up that I originally shot in it. Your choice.I also have one tin of 7.62x39 ammo I will include for a little extra if you want it.Please don't try to haggle( some people are asking almost $2k for these on gunforums because they don't show up often )** Not interested in trades unless it's .308 ammo, MCX barrel kit ( 300 blackout or the 7.62x39 kit ) or a short home defense 12ga + at least $500+ cash ( will throw in the extra ammo free if it's an MCX barrel kit ). Serious inquiries only.You can CONTACT me through email on here, but *The best thing to do would be to text me at 904-5zero9-0517 if interested as I'm usually at work and can't answer so texting works out better during the day.*I'm located in about 30-45 minutes west of Jacksonville in Macclenny, Fl, but work in Jacksonville everyday.You must have a valid FL license and be willing to sign a firearms bill of sale.

My intent was to use this firearm for police work, however, my department went with a different gun for duty use. It was ""used"" but it was never shot. The store owner said that someone's wife bought it for their husband for Christmas but he didn't want it so he traded it for a Springfield XDm. I have put a few hundred rounds through it. 350 at most. The gun still feels stiff and new, unlike my M&P9 that is smooth as butter. It has factory installed Trijicon night sights. The front sight is dated 2010 and the rear sight is 2009. I have all the factory contents: case, papers, etc. The only thing missing is the gun-lock key. I suppose that the first owner removed it and misplaced it. I bought an extra magazine for $40.00 so there is a total of 3. All in excellent condition.I want $400 cash for it.

The recoil is reduced to that of a .556 which makes this 308 a joy to shoot. If you have not tried a compensator on your 308, you will be amazed at the difference. I find myself enjoying this rifle more than any of my others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Recommended option: a compensator/muzzle brake as shown in pictures is also being offered with barrel threading service for an additional $95.00. This includes threading of your barrel, the compensator and jam nut. 2-day shop turn around and return shipping is also included. All you do is ship your receiver and barrel assembly to me (receiver does not have to be removed from barrel), that simple.
