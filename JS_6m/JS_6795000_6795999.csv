This is the first time I am attempting to sell my reloads. Just putting this out there to see if anyone would be interested in buying reloaded ammo. Comes with a guarantee - if any one round does not fire, it will be replace with 10 rounds.I also would like to do custom loads for customers. Meaning, shooter will be about to choose from various loads to see what is best for that shooterRight now i will be starting with 9mm 115GR Hornady XTP loads. In my opinion, they are the best multi-purpose round out. Hunting, self-defense, and competitive shooting.Soon, i will be selling 40cal, .45, .223 and .308Will update this post as different ammo comes available$12 for 50rds$200 for 1000rdsCall or txt REDACTED"

Vintage 1949 (second year of production), F code. JM stamp. Very good condition. Here's a rundown of the highs and lows. Forearm and stock have been drilled for sling studs, but not through the bullseye, which is still present and intact. Stock also has a series of small holes filled on the right side. Aside from that, the stocks look nice and well cared-for. The metal is fantastic on the right side, but the left has some discoloration. But, other than the barrel band, there is no rust on this rifle, just a nice patina in the few small spots where the bluing has been worn away. The Williams peep sight looks period-correct and is attached via factory screws in the receiver. The rear sight is missing, but has been replaced by a Marble blank. Ballard rifling too, so you reloaders can shoot lead reloads with no fear. In all, very good condition with just a few blemishes. It's still perfectly functional, and is a cool piece of American firearms history. Hunt with style and class this fall! $450/offer/tradeMadison area only. No shipping. If the listing is still active, it's still available."
