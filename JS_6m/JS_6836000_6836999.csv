The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs. This particular armor is made to military spec and it is designed to withstand higher caliber rounds. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail as this is one of the best quality steel out there. I have personally shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up.

I have shot many other 1911's and I would compare this one mostly to the functionality of a Kimber Stainless II. The trigger is great and the recoil is extremely managable, whereas cheaper made 1911's are spuratic and unreliable. This gun has only jammed once or twice on me in all my days shooting it. Great pistol overall and impressive accuracy downrange, especially for a bulky 1911. Contact me through email, text, or call with inquiries.

Its one drawback has always been cost and availability. Not anymore! You found Mid America Munitions! We thrive to make a high quality superior product at an affordable price.
 
Mid America Munitions 300 Blackout rounds are manufactured with new projectiles and re-manufactured, once fired, military brass, built to the highest quality, extensively inspected and tested. Guaranteed to exceed your expectations! Our QC process is one of the best in the industry. First, our loaded ammunition is run through a specially designed weigh machine that is capable of weighing within 1/10 of a grain. This ensures our ammo is consistent and safe. After being weighed the ammo is then run through a visual inspection system that uses high speed cameras and lasers to ensure all rounds are within SAAMI specs, have no cosmetic blemishes and that the primer is properly seated. Our entire process brings you a high quality superior product that you can count on for safety and consistency with every shot.

Wanting to pack heat, but have the hands of an under developed 5 year old? Does .45 have too much kick, but think .380 is for women and small children? Friend, I have the deal for you. The SMith and Wesson shield was specifically designed for those with tiny hand syndrome, so it will fit like a glove in your small, but girlish hands. The recoil on this puppy is as tame as my 13 year old lab drugged up on benedryl, and with an 8+1 capacity, you're guaranteed to make that critical shot to the cerebral cortex in a defensive situation, because as we all know, shot placement trumps stopping power, which is exactly what you'll be lacking in this sleek, 9mm hand cannon. And don't worry, this gun is accurate out to 10 yards. Past that, well, you're f***ed. But shoot at em anyway, it'll scare the SH** out of em. I'm also including an extra 6 round mag, giving you a total of 15 rounds of your favorite 9 mil pills to keep on you. That's enough to drop even the most drugged up meth head. BUT WAIT, THERE'S more! This handy dandly little pistol also includes some pre-applied Talon grip tape, so you can man handle your piece even if you've got you're d*** beaters all lubed up with your favorite oil for a fun Friday night.    Bottom Line, you need this gun. It's a great gun, the only reason I'm selling it is because I have another, and dual weilding isn't really practical in Texas summer attire. Side effects for not buying this gun include but are not limited to:  Nausea, head-ache, shortness of breath, muscle aches, rapid heartbeat,veganism, crossfit syndrome, an innate affection for Gary Bussey, restless leg syndrome, terminal toe jam, feminism, an aversion to the letter I, an affinity for people named Tim, and hemroids.  Men can expect painful urination while sitting, especially if the penis is caught between the toilet seat and the bowl. That's not a side effect, that's just true. Buy my gun, damnit.   If there were any stereotypes that I forgot to offend, Please email me directly and I'll make sure to reply with an overly rude and brash statement, specifically tailored to your sensitive heart."
