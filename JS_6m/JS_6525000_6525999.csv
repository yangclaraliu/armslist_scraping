As far as I know, she spent her entire life working on a farm in Gainesville, Georgia. In 1978, the farmer who owned her decided to take her apart, perhaps to restore her after 25 years of service. Something must have happened because the farmer never did put her back together and she sat in the barn from 1978 until 2010, when the barn caught fire and burned to the ground. Fortunately, Jolene was saved as she was rolled out of the barn before she herself caught fire. In 2011, a fireman named ""Kyle"" bought the farm and moved onto the property. Jolene was included and he decided it would be best to find a new home for her. By chance he drove by the Village Garage shop in the East Village of Atlanta and spotted a very similar 1951 Dodge on the property, so he went in to talk to the owner of the shop, ""Mike"". Mike was into vintage cars and 2 months later, they had Jolene trucked over to his shop."

The defects that I noticed would include minor rust (a bodyman looked at the 4 main spots and told me they could be easily repaired) but I would think that the color matching may be difficult and so the whole truck may need to be painted. This truck has some really interesting options including the FORD spot lights on each side (with Ford logos on them) and a premium interior (including carpet and lots of chrome) and the outside chrome package. It also comes with the nice turbine mags and tires with approx. 70% tread left on them. Mechanically the truck starts and runs and shifts well through the gears. One of the brakes are leaking a bit of fluid but as long as this is topped up there are no issues.

Behind the big FE motor is a factory original NP (New Process) 4spd manual transmission and a big 9' rear end with 4.10 gears. As for original mileage, I don't know. Judging on looks alone, I would guess the heads were rebuilt at some time in the past, probably to add hardened valve seats, but that's just my guess. I believe the distributor was also replaced.Good Clutch, Manual Brakes, Manual Steering... as all F-250's were. A nice Stereo/ CD player was added and mounted overhead in the truck.

The telestock, pistol grip, and two-piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters.
