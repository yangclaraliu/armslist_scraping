The revolver is chambered for .357 / 38 Special and has the coveted recessed cylinder and pinned barrel all in an N frame package. There is some minor surface staining on the gun. There is no rust under the grips the surface staining is limited to the area above the Smith & Wesson logo and above the trigger all of which has been removed carefully using 0000 steel wool and Kroll oil. There is a small place on the target grips where a repair has been made. The lock-up on the cylinder is fantastic and this firearm is very accurate with either 357 or 38 Special cartridges.

I've shot about 100 rounds through it. The idea was that using this gun would keep me in the groove practice wise so I'd still be able to shoot my .45 xd efficiently when needed, but I didn't find that to be the case. I have however shot rabbits, coons, and armordillers with it easily, so it's definitely good for killing small game. I'm selling now because I just no longer use it. Because we have lots of hogs where I hunt, I just carry a 12 gauge when squirrel and rabbit hunting in case I get charged, to be safe, but if you don't have that problem you're good.besides the 100 or so rounds put through it, the gun has a small scuff to the bluing near the place where the empty cartridge gets ejected, but besides that it's in very good condition."

If care is not used in assembling ammunition, a “slam-fire” can occur before the bolt locks. The military arsenals accomplish this using different techniques and components—including different primer sensitivity specifications—from their commercial counterparts. CCI makes rifle primers for commercial sale that matches military sensitivity specs that reduce the chance of a slam-fire when other factors go out of control*. If you’re reloading for a military semi-auto, look to CCI Military primers.*Effective slam-fire prevention requires more than special primers. Headspace, chamber condition, firing pin shape and protrusion, bolt velocity, cartridge case condition, and other factors can affect slam-fire potential."

I took it on trade for a debt. The original owner only put 20-30 rounds through the gun. He planed to carry it in a pocket so he remove the sights. I have no use for the pistol and only want to get back what I am owed in cash. I ordered new sights from Kel Tec(it cost me a whopping $10). So if you buy the pistol before they come I will make sure they are delivered to the buyer. At my cost. I am asking $220 or best offer(I will also add in some top of the line 9mm self defense ammo and a holster if the price is right). As someone who knows guns I can attest to the fact that this is the only pistol I trust under $300. And that's especially true for a pistol for concealed carry(that you can trust with your life). I will only consider face to face transactions in the North end of Columbus. Buyer must have valid Ohio ID. I will only take cash NO TRADES AT ALL! If you have any questions pleas ask.
