The wood stock has been refinished, but is free from cracks or splits. As with most re-arsenaled import Garands, this rifle has a mixture of parts from different manufacturers, some wartime and some post war. The following parts are Springfield Armory manufacture: Trigger housing, receiver, operating rod (radius cut), and the barrel. The hammer is Winchester. The safety is Harrington & Richardson, and the bolt is International Harvester. We have not attempted to identify the rest of the parts. This is a solid, affordable, Garand rifle, which is becoming harder and harder to find. Should be a nice shooter."

Regarding the transfer procedure, there is a pawnshop a few miles from my home that will handle the background check and paperwork for $20 which includes the state fee. If you decide to purchase the firearm, we can arrange to meet there and you will pay me for the firearm and then make payment arrangements with him for the transfer.   Send an email thru Armslist and I will respond as soon as I can.  Emails without phone numbers won't be responded to because of spammers.  I do not put listings on hold while you wait for a payday, wife’s permission or rich aunt to die. I will not ship firearms because of a couple of deadbeats who agreed to purchase firearms and then never supplied payment and a FFL to ship to. Lowball offers will not be responded to.  Please, no offers for trades as I prefer cash. I have several firearms I am trying to clean out of my gun closet."
