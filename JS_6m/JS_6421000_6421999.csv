This bolt is extremely nice and doesn't rattle around during cycling like some competitors. It's truly nice to operate. The trigger is probably the best I've felt in a long time. Little to no take up very crisp and estimating 3# or less. Absolutely awesome. TC's patented recoil damping strips in the butt stock along with rubber recoil pad makes this an all day shooter. Rubber Hogue grip panels ensure your hands never slip regardless of the conditions. They're very nice. Action and Barrel Lug are bedded to the stock to ensure the perfect no slip fit everytime with factory free floated barrel.Integrated Weaver scope bases allow for mounting scope of your choice. I'd rather sell as a complete package with Vortex Scope, But will consider offers. Two 3rd Box magazines makes reloading a snapBeartooth cheek comb riser for the perfect cheek weld. Have several foam inserts you can adjust to fit as you need. Vortex HS-T 4-16 MRAD reticle SFP scope is absolutely awesome with lifetime warranty and original box. You can't find better glass for the price. Turret adjustments are accurate with solid clicks and include the zero stop resets so you never lose your zero after dialing your come ups for those long range shots. I easily make first round hits out past 600 with this scope and rifle every time. I reload, but have shot many factory loads out of the gun. I can provide good reload data to get you the best groups possible quick if you happen to reload. TC promises 1 MOA accuracy out of the box, but it easily shoots better than that with 3/4 MOA groups the norm. I use this gun from the range to hunting coyotes and it's awesome. You can take it to the field now and start shooting. Interested in Cash, AR'S, AR parts and maybe some handguns, but mostly cash or AR's. Let me know Maybe we can work a deal.Have more pictures upon requestCall or text REDACTED Bruce"

There may be no slimmer, lighter, smaller or more ergonomic pocket pistol available today. The DB9 is easily one of the smallest 9mm semi-auto pistols you can get, and at 11 ounces one of the lightest.
NEW IN BOX – never fired.
Includes plastic case with original padding, owner’s manual, all paperwork, etc.
 
FEATURE LOADED:
Very clean lines and nothing to snag on. The only external controls are the trigger, magazine release, and takedown lever. The steel magazine latch is set at a very low profile to prevent accidentally depressing it and ejecting the magazine, something to consider in a pocket gun.
The magazine features a polymer finger extension base pad to help the shooter acquire a secure hold.
Slide: aggressively scalloped with forward and rear grasping grooves in a fish-scale type of pattern, for easy slide.
Frame provides as high a grip angle as possible and provides far greater control, reducing muzzle flip and perceived recoil. This design also provides more grip to hold onto in a very small package. Even with largish hands, you can place two full fingers on the front strap, and the back of the grip filled most of your palm.
The sights are easy to use and feature a low-profile, snag-free design. The white two-dot rear sight is dovetailed into the slide, and it is windage adjustable.
Striker-fired, locked breech, recoil operated.
Capacity: 6+1 round capacity.
Barrel and slide are made from billet 4140 through-hardened steel machined out of a solid block of chrome-moly.
Patent pending “Zero-Energy” striker firing system, which produces a clean and exceptionally smooth trigger squeeze with no stacking. The steel trigger with dual connecting bars has a 0.5-inch length of pull. The Zero-Energy striker system is one of the built-in safety features of the pistol and bears some explaining. It differs significantly from other striker systems in that the Diamondback does not preload the striker at all, allowing the trigger to do all the work. Other safety features include a firing pin block, which blocks the firing pin from going forward unless the trigger is fully depressed and helps prevents accidental discharges.
Finishes: The magazine catch, trigger and rails are all chrome-moly steel and black oxide coated. The trigger parts and the standard black-colored slide are Melonite coated for extra hardness, durability and corrosion resistance. This is a process that leaves a nitride finish directly on the metal that is much thicker and tougher than other finishes. The black color is applied on top of the Melonite finish.
Grip features a distinctive diamondback-pattern checkering on the sides, aggressive checkering on the front strap and a slightly extended palm swell on the back strap with its own distinct checkering pattern. Slight right and left thumb rests molded into the grip provide good memory pads for the hands. A beavertail at the top of the grip helps protect the web of the shooter’s hand from slide bite.
Diamondback pistols include a full lifetime warranty."

Ive killed many a squirrel and other small game with this rifle. The reason i bought it, was because i live in a neighborhood where you cant shoot in your backyard. Their was a ton of squirrel in my yard and this was the solution, Its quiet enough to not bother neighbors and powerful enough to take small game(ive seen videos of this exact rifle take down a hog, i dont reccomend trying that). 1 Round dropped a squirrel, regardless of shot placement. Isnt one of those cheap, pump it 20 times and shoot it rifles. Its a break action, single shot, one pump, and youre all set. The barrel breaks and that is how you load and pump it. It shoots 22 Cal pellets, and i have a couple hundred hollow point pellets i will include. a tin of ammo at walmart is under $10 and gets you a couple hundred. It comes with a decent scope, the gun hasnt been abused, so i cant say how well it will hold a zero, but the recoil of this gun doesnt affect the zero. Its a beautiful walnut stock, and if you dont want to use the scope, it has a fiber optic front sight, and adjustable back sight. The gun isnt light, cheap, or in bad shape. As soon as you see it youll know it was made with quality. I paid around $150 for this gun, and i am the original owner.Text Rob at REDACTED for faster responseLooking to trade for ammo, 9mm 223/556 22LR 12 gauge.

Style: CompactCaliber:  40 Smith & Wesson
 
Springfield compact carry. A practical carry gun upon which you can bet your life on.
Built with Springfield’s legendary reliability and workmanship!
 
FEATURES:
Proven 3-dot sights.  These are TRIJICON Nights Sights.  They were professionally installed by a qualified gunsmith (not a hack job).  Fully Supported Ramp Sights. Front and rear sights are dovetailed into the steel of the slide.
Springfield’s famous comfortable ergonomics and grip angle.
TWO factory magazines: There is one a finger grip extension that holds 12 rounds. A second mag that holds 9 rounds makes the pistol smaller and is flush with frame.
In the accuracy department, the Springfield Sub-Compact is tremendous! As good as a Glock Or better.
Safeties: Grip safety, the gun can only be fired when the hand firmly depresses the safety located at the rear of the handle.  Patented Ultra Safety Assurance trigger system, which guards against accidental discharge. The USA only allows the gun to be fired when direct rearward pressure is applied to the trigger, eliminating the possibility of an accidental discharge if the gun is dropped or bumped. The XD has a striker status indicator that protrudes from the rear of the steel slide when the striker mechanism is cocked. In addition, it has a loaded chamber indicator, which is a thin piece of metal that pops up when a round is in the chamber.
Picatinny rail for mounting a laser, light, and other accessories.
Dual spring and guide rod system - less torque is placed upon the guide rod and spring.
Weighing a little more than the Glock, the Springfield Sub-Compact manages recoil more confidently than the Glock, enabling accurate “follow-up” shots."

I have anoriginal PVS-7B night vision goggles. I also have an actual issued magnifier that is extremely rare. These alone sell for $1000-1500... this is not the cheap $300 magnifier u can get online, this is the real deal with actual handwritten issued numbers on it. I also have an original manual with everything in it from basic functions to how to destroy it incase of enemy capture. I have the original green carry bag and the original case they used to carry it in planes that kept it pressurized. A few extra gadgets i have are some night vision beacons that attach to a D battery and can only be seen by night vision, and some headwear mounts. The beacons are great because u can put them on dogs if u hog hunt or you can set them out as markers to tell distances. Or you can put them on buddies so u can all see eachother. The night vision alone sells for $3500 brand new. The magnifiers and extras add another 1500. Just make me an offer and lets sell this in a cash deal tonight.Everything youre getting here is in great shape and is original. Feel free to text me at any time at REDACTEDI am happy to try to answer any questions and to send more pictures if u ask for specific pictures. I didnt list an asking price because i don't have one.

I also have an original manual with everything in it from basic functions to how to destroy it incase of enemy capture. I have the original green carry bag and the original case they used to carry it in planes that kept it pressurized. A few extra gadgets i have are some night vision beacons that attach to a D battery and can only be seen by night vision, and some headwear mounts. The beacons are great because u can put them on dogs if u hog hunt or you can set them out as markers to tell distances. Or you can put them on buddies so u can all see eachother. The night vision alone sells for $3500 brand new. The magnifiers and extras add another 1500. Just make me an offer and lets sell this in a cash deal tonight.Everything youre getting here is in great shape and is original. Feel free to text me at any time at 2818138750I am happy to try to answer any questions and to send more pictures if u ask for specific pictures. I didnt list an asking price because i don't have one. I explained what the items are worth new and i don't expect retail value. With that said, all reasonable offers are appreciated and considered.
