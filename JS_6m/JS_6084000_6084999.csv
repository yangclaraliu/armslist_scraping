The only reason I am selling is because I purchased it spontaneosly in wake of political uncertainty and need the cash rather now, but is still a great investment. Very accurate, smooth trigger and traditional AK iron sites. It came prefitted with Magpul furniture and Zhukov adjustable/collapsable stock. Great looking firearm that is very accurate. It is the newest century model and have had it inspected by FFL in the area for any defects and it checked out nicely. Very well put together all-around."

Idaho. But would also sell outright for $925.00.  Will ship to your FFL for an additional $50.00E-mail works fine, i'm not online every day and don't have internet up at our cabin, so it might take me a day to get back to you.

I'm selling my NY Compliant pinned mag top loader ar15. It's a PSA upper chambered in 5.56 with 1/8 twist. It has a spikes lower. It's fully loaded with mag pul accesories, bipod and flip down site. The gun has a pinned 10/20 magazine in it. It only holds 10 but with the look of the 20. I built this gun strictly for looks. I never even fired it yet. To load the gun all you do is pull the rear pin, pivot the upper and load the rounds into the magazine from the top. It really isn't to bad. And this allows you to keep all the so called ""evil features"" on the gun. This is totally NY Compliant and we will transfer the gun at any FFL of your choice. Ffl fees are on the buyer. Just so you know if the law ever changes or if you move to a free state this is easily reversible. It's a bullet button that's epoxied. All you would have to do is drill the piece out and replace it with the original mag release. AGAIN DOING SO MAKES THE GUN ILLEGAL AS OF NOW IN NY. I WOULD ONLY RECOMEND DOING THIS IF YOU MOVE TO A STATE WHERE DETACHABLE MAGS ARE ALLOWED. OR IF THE SAFE ACT EVER GETS REPEALED. I'm asking $1000 firm. Thank you."

Price is firm. Nevada ID required/CCW or Old Blue Card preferred. We will complete a bill of sale for my records. Let me know if you have any quetsions or want to see additional photos.

I got 17 replies to the ad but none of them ever called me. Don't waste my time if you are not interesed in this gun. Hi point 40 in the box with everything that came with it. 1 magazine.  Bought it less than six months ago and only shot 1 box of 185 grain Blazer Brass through it so it is hardly broken in. I cleaned it and oiled it before and after I used it. Walked into a gun store and had cash in my pocket. Enough said. Gun shot 100% of all 50 rounds with no jams or misfires. Very heavy but fun to use in the yard for shooting steel targets. Includes 1 box of Blazer Brass 165 grain. $140 for both the gun and the ammo. Don't reply if you don't really want it.

My only reason for selling is to fund a M1A DMR build.The rifle is left handed, and i gave 600$ for it. the scope was 325$ when i purchased it new.Both purchased at same time about 8 years ago.I have going with it is my entire set up,180ct. 120 grain positive expanding rounds. silver boxes (20 round boxes, 9 boxes that currently go for over 50$ a box)57ct. 110 grain ballistic silvertip.

(around 50$ value.)some boxes are in rough shape from undergoing two moves, but all rounds are in perfect shape, except about 20 rounds show some tarnish on the brass. still perfectly functional ammo.price is or best offer.the only item i migh consider selling seperate is the ballistic silvertip ammo. i will not divide the grey boxes, rifle, or scope.the only trade i would be interested in would be a springfield M1A socom, long range rifle cambered in .308 or larger, high end pistols. ie, a ar10, high end ar15s, ak, bolt action sniper rifles, but primarily a M1A.thank you"
