Comes with a throw lever and all original packaging, manuals and even stickers. This was my first venture into variable power optics and the only reason I am selling is because after doing some dry practice with it for a couple hours, I realized that I prefer a red dot for my rifle and it's purposes and I only own one rifle. The optic itself has an msrp of 579 from Steiner and the mount has an msrp of 189 from ADM. I'm asking 575 OBO for both. Willing to part out. I can disassemble the optic and mount and ship them in their original packaging or leave as one unit and put the manuals and other paperwork for both in one box, whichever the buyer prefers. Mounted to rifle once and never even fired and the only markings on the mount and optic are markings I made with a paint pen to use as witness marks before I had made the decision to sell. Both the mount and the scope are like brand new as if they had come from the factory. Can provide more pictures or information if needed. Willing to travel some or willing to ship. Prices negotiable.

I'm looking to sell or trade my gen 4 Glock 26. $425 cash or trade for a nice gen 3 or 4 19. The gun has extensive frame modification and is stippled. I know this isn't everyone's preference, hence the low price. Glock will exchange the frame for $100 with a brand new one, and you would still come out cheaper than buying a new one. But, the gun does feel very nice in the hand and the stipple job is better than the typical hobbyist job. Functions and fires as new, and has had 50 rounds fired through it. 3 mags and box, paperwork, etc. included. Feel free to text me at REDACTED with any questions. Thanks!"

LAM provides a fixed stock. It is threaded through with a customized Allen screw designed and patented by us. This screw is designed to fit into the d-tents of your buffer tube, locking it into place and making you compliant with the first part of the California featureless law.  No pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously below the action of the weapon.  LAM’s 40 degree angle rifle grip keeps the web of your hand (the skin between your thumb and your forefinger) is above that trigger line  No Flash Suppressor/ hider  LAM provides in our kits a compensator or a thread protector. With these three features, you will not have to register your weapon as an assault weapon in 2017 and since it is converted into a featureless sporting rifle you are free to drop the magazine with a standard mag button. We offer 2 calibers of comps 308 and 223/556, depending on what caliber gun they have is what comp. For example 762X39 gets a 308 comp and 556 gets 223.

One of the nicest features of the firearm is the updated designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor.Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Specifications:- Trigger Mechanism: SA- Caliber: 9mm Luger - Barrel Length: 16.20"" (Faux Suppressor)- Capacity: 20 Rounds- Magazine Type: Double Stack Polymer- Frame: Fiber Reinforced Polymer- Grips: Polymer, Adjustable for Reach to Trigger - Sights: Low Profile Fully Adjustable Aperture and Post, 4 Rear Aperture Sizes - Barrel: Cold Hammer Forged, Muzzle Threaded 1/2x28 - Safety: Ambidextrous Thumb- Length: 34 3/4""- Weight: 6.10 lbs CASH PRCE LISTED.

This screw is designed to fit into the d-tents of your buffer tube, locking it into place and making you compliant with the first part of the California featureless law.  No pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously below the action of the weapon.  LAM’s 40 degree angle rifle grip keeps the web of your hand (the skin between your thumb and your forefinger) is above that trigger line  No Flash Suppressor/ hider  LAM provides in our kits a compensator or a thread protector.

We offer 2 calibers of comps 308 and 223/556, depending on what caliber gun they have is what comp. For example 762X39 gets a 308 comp and 556 gets 223. The grip is a rifle grip not a pistol grip!

LAM provides a fixed stock. It is threaded through with a customized Allen screw designed and patented by us. This screw is designed to fit into the d-tents of your buffer tube, locking it into place and making you compliant with the first part of the California featureless law.  No pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously below the action of the weapon.  LAM’s 40 degree angle rifle grip keeps the web of your hand (the skin between your thumb and your forefinger) is above that trigger line  No Flash Suppressor/ hider  LAM provides in our kits a compensator or a thread protector. With these three features, you will not have to register your weapon as an assault weapon in 2017 and since it is converted into a featureless sporting rifle you are free to drop the magazine with a standard mag button. We offer 2 calibers of comps 308 and 223/556, depending on what caliber gun they have is what comp. For example 762X39 gets a 308 comp and 556 gets 223. The grip is a rifle grip not a pistol grip!

Weighs only 22oz, double strike capability, manual safety, two 10 round magazines, box, manuals and Taurus lifetime warranty. These are great pistols and have loads of rave reviews. The feel of the pistol is amazing with aggressive factory stippling on the frame.  Due to dozens of emails that border on flat humorous, I guess I need to clarify a few things.  There have been a total of 5 rounds fired through the pistol.  I bought it brand new.  I will NOT sell it to someone without proper ID regardless of how much you offer.  Even though I almost always ignore all listings when it states ""PRICE IS FIRM"" (those generally are considerably higher than the cost of a new one, which baffles me), I will list my flat bottom line to the penny right now; $225.  As to not be rude, I simply will not respond to ""offers"" below that.  The buyer MUST have valid Indiana ID, be legally able to purchase a firearm and preferably have a valid carry permit.  Finally, I absolutely will NOT drive 5 hours to meet anyone to sell this pistol.  Sorry if these conditions offend people, but I've probably had 2 dozen emails this week alone from people I highly suspect are not legally able to purchase a handgun and people who say they will take it and then disappear.  If you want a great budget priced .40 semi-auto pistol with a lifetime warranty that has great reviews, this is for you.  If you want a $150 pistol and are able to throw the firearm at someone really hard when it doesn't fire, look for the likes of a Jennings, Cobra, Hi-Point, Bryco or Jimenez.   Thanks!"

This rifle is a perfect brush gun for you hunters, the 44 mag is very heavy, very powerful, and is just fun to shoot.

$720 firm in cash or higher in trade.  Or $780 with the Raven Concealment Magwell($95+ new) included, cost for this pistol and parts/work new would be well over $1,000.  Pics included both ways.  Just let me know if wanting the RC Magwell if offering a trade.  If not wanted, I will just use it on another Glock.
Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending on the deal.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other item(s) either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.

The B-GRF is a fast-shooting, smooth trigger ideal for 3 Gun competition and recreational shooting alike. It pulls like a single-stage, but resets like a two-stage. Two trigger springs are included so the B-GRF can be set up with a pull of either 4 lbs or 3.2 lbs. Does NOT convert semiautomatic rifles to automatic; however, short/light reset lends itself to bump fire if ‘feathering’ the trigger.* Elftmann AR-15/AR-10 Ambidextrous Push-Type Speed Safety, unless you have a select-fire this is all that’s needed for a safety, smooth/crisp engagement, less moving parts, lighter and faster than traditional safety selectors.* Battle Arms Development enhanced mag-release, concave V-Groove button face offers excellent ergonomic feel and self-centers the index finger as pressure is applied.* Strike Industries AR-15 Enhanced Steel Bolt Catch, the over-sized bottom locking half works nicely above the Norgon ambidextrous magazine release * Norgon Mil-Spec “drop-in” ambidextrous magazine release mechanism.  Steel construction and phosphate finish.  Design properties reduce the possibility of inadvertent release.  Can be disassembled for cleaning and maintenance.* Battle Arms Development Enhanced Pin set, provides extra texture to the takedown and pivot, without extra protrusion to snag* Seekins Precision billet trigger guard, decent shape and very strong* ERGO Tactical Deluxe Grip fits AR/M4 rifles and features an ambidextrous palm swell provides shooters with proper trigger finger placement, A2 sized inner cavity that is capable of storing many kit systems available on the retail market* Magpul UBR Stock Assembly (includes extension tube, mounting nut, and stock), also includes optional strike plate, four QD mounts, and Magpul Enhanced Butt plate extension.* JP Enterprises Silent Captured Adjustable Spring, optional Auxiliary Spring Rate Kit for the JP Silent Captured Spring sold separately, however, not necessary due to adjustable gas block, offering redundant methods to tune to your favorite loads or for suppressed fire.Upper-Receiver:* Aero Precision forged M4E1 Enhanced flat-top Upper Receiver - Anodized Black. Features M4 feed ramps and handguard mounting platform. The rail mounting surface and barrel nut area provide a much stiffer system than a standard receiver, custom barrel nut included . The M4E1 (5.56) upper receivers are a one-piece design combining the rail's mounting surface with the upper itself. By machining the rail's mounting surface into the upper itself they have condensed the parts needed to mount a free-floated rail to a mere 8 screws. Since it is of the same forging as the upper not only is it a stronger system, but we are able to make even more lightening cuts to save weight and allow for more efficient cooling. * Aero Precision Enhanced (E1) 15” forged KeyMod Handguard offers full length Keymod at the 3, 6, and 9:00, and picatiny on top. The E1 design removes the human element margin of error when it comes to not only installation, but also correct alignment and removing any gap between the upper and the rail. The Enhanced Series M4E1 upper paired with E1 Handguard delivers monolithic accuracy in a rock solid, lightweight package.* Blackhole Weaponry AR-15 16"" Mid-Length Stainless Steel 5.56 1:8 Polygonal rifling Barrel…Black Hole barrels are made from match grade 416R stainless steel featuring Caudle 3 land polygonal rifling, which consists of a series of arcs, instead of traditional 90 degree corners for a smoother bore and superior performance. Black Hole Weaponry has been using state-of-the-art technology to produce some of the finest custom barrels on the market for years. All Black Hole barrels are manufactured in St. Helens, Oregon.* Wilson Combat Adjustable Lo-Profile Gas Block, .750"", Mid-Length Straight Gas Tube, straight tube makes for easier and more thorough cleaning. A Stainless set screw removes with a few turns to expose the adjustment screw. Adjustment instructions included.* VOODOO INNOVATIONS - M16 LIFECOAT INTEGRAL BOLT CARRIER, VDI direct impingement full auto rated bolt carriers are compatible with mil-spec and non mil-sped upper receivers and associated components. This bolt carrier is machined to meet all MIL TDP specifications and is enhanced using LifeCoat treatment providing superior Durability, Lubricity, Corrosive Resistance, Carbon Resistance. New Integral D.I. Carrier was designed from conception to improve the service life and durability of the direct impingement carrier. The VDI Integral DI Carrier eliminates the potential for carrier to key separation due to carrier key screws stripping, fracturing, or becoming un-staked. The new Integral carrier has an improved gas flow path with no obstructions or shelves for carbon to deposit and build on eliminating the potential for gas obstruction to seize the operation of your carrier.* JP Enterprise EnhancedBolt™ with standard extractor, .223/5.56 caliber. The .223 version of the bolt is compatible with any AR-15 platform using a Mil-spec bolt carrier and subcomponents. It’s made from SAE 9310 high-grade steel. This material makes for an extremely hard surface with a tough, ductile core resistant to structural failure and a life expectancy far exceeding Mil-spec 8620-type bolts. SAE 9310 is the same type of steel used in the transmission gears of Formula One racecars, and the high-load application of a bolt assembly is ideal for this state-of-the-art material.* WMD Guns AR15 Nickel Boron NiB-X Cam Pin* WMD Guns AR15 Nickel Boron NiB-X Firing Pin* Bravo Company Manufacturing BCMGUNFIGHTER Ambidextrous Charging Handle w/ Mod A44* Bravo Company Manufacturing BCMGUNFIGHTER Compensator Mod 0-5.56 - Exterior dimensions consistent with Mil-specs for mounting flash hider mounted suppressors; Tuned slots and interior cone offer maximum in recoil mitigations, compensation of muzzle-rise, and flash reduction; Designed to have much less side blast and noise associated with typical compensators; Stainless Steel construction for maximum corrosion resistance."

No doubt many a local gunsmith has made a decent amount of money off of folks who show up at their doors with a bunch of Ruger .22 bits in a bag and a defeated look on their faces.Well, it only took Ruger a few decades but with the new Mark IV series of pistols, they've directly addressed those complaints. What used to take a thorough reading of the manual, followed by cursing, followed by YouTube videos, followed by more cursing, now takes about ten seconds and can be done blindfolded. The Mark IV also features a CNC machined frame and ambidextrous safety. Comes with two magazines.
