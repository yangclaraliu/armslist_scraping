PRICE COMPARE with Bolthorn Chassis without action here on ARMSLIST from EuroOptics for $2,133.00. Basically, you're getting my brand new barreled action for free and saving $180 on a brand new Bolthorn GRS. *STOCK ONLY $1599.00*NOTE* This rifle has not been shot. All parts were/are boxed. During assembly I noticed that the magazine does not fully seat into the action. I contacted GRS directly and they responded that all HOWA actions must be modified to work with any chassis system. Basically a bit needs to be trimmed off of the action to allow the magazine to seat a bit deeper into the action. I haven't done this as this is a brand new set up. If you are interested please know that you'll need to do a bit of work. I can get more details for the buyer. This is a Howa 6.5 Creedmoor in a GRS Bolthorn chassis.  My wife's F150 died over the weekend so we had to buy a car over the weekend so I have to sell some of my toys.The GRS Bolthorn has an adjustable LOP, Cheekriser, and grip for the perfect fit. This stock has the folder. EuroOptic has these for sale at $2133 currently on their website. Do a search here in Armslist and you'll find their listing for just the chasssi. I am taking a loss on the Howas and you are just paying for the GRS. Take a look at GRS's website for better photos and details. I paid over $2700 for the chassis, folder, and Howa. I'm keeping the Atlas bipod. It's in the pictures but not included. Wife will never know! If you had to have it I will sell it for retail wich is $279.00Let me know if you have questions or would like additonal photos. Thanks,"

The internal hammer of the 442 eliminates the risk of the hammer getting snagged on clothing, holsters, or purses when drawing the weapon in a self-defense situation. The low profile, ramp front sight and the fixed notch rear sight also aid in snag-free presentation of the weapon. The 442 is double-action only, making it an extremely fast personal-defensive handgun to deploy in stressful situations, as there is nothing to remember to do except point and pull the trigger. The lockwork of the 442 is completely enclosed to keep dirt and pocket lint from interfering with the gun's action. The synthetic grips and inherently ergonomic design afford natural pointability. The Model 442 is built on Smith & Wesson's famous J-Frame, it has a 5-shot cylinder rated for +P .38 Special ammunition. The barrel and cylinder are constructed from carbon steel, and the mainframe is made of lightweight aluminum alloy. All the exterior metal parts are finished with a matte black coating that resists corrosion caused by humidity and perspiration when the revolver is carried close to the body. The Smith & Wesson 442 Airweight Double-Action Revolver carries easily, deploys rapidly, and has enough firepower to handle any self-defense scenario.Manuafacturer: Smith & Wesson Model: 442-1 Airweight Caliber: .38 S&WAction: Double-ActionCapacity: 5Barrel: 2"""

I'm the original owner. I've put less than 25 rounds through it. In ""Like New"" condition. Other than taking it out of the holster and keeping it clean, it's never been in a glove box, trunk, etc. I've kept it in a leather holster in a drawer (other than shooting it at the range when I got it). I have everything. I'm meticulous about my guns, keeping them clean, and complete. It comes with all the original packaging, literature, CA gun lock with keys, 2 extra magazines with the collapsible extension, and a leather holster specifically molded for this model. I've taken a look at what these are going for (and no where near as nice as mine) and priced it to sell. I WILL ONLY SHIP THROUGH AN FFL AND NOT OUTSIDE OF THE USA. Below is a standard description of the gun:The Beretta Px4 Storm Sub-Compact pistol delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower. The Px4 series is built around a modular concept so these pistols can be adapted to different needs. The Px4 Storm Sub-Compact uses a locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more compact and lighter weight system. The stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant. An ambidextrous manual safety lever, reversible magazine release button and interchangeable back straps make shooting the Px4 Sub-Compact easy for all shooters. The light frame employs a durable fiberglass-reinforced polymer with a milstd-1913 picatinny rail for an array of aftermarket accessories. The Bruniton non-reflective black coating is offer superior resistance against corrosion and wear.

The rifle offers all the signature Kimber action features including a two-lug bolt, a Mauser-style non-rotating claw extractor, a mechanical blade ejector, a pivoting left-side bolt release and a recessed recoil lug between the receiver and barrel. Also retained is the Winchester 70-type three-position swinging safety lever located on the bolt shroud.The Advanced Tactical Rifle utilizes Kimber’s bottom metal and feeds from a non-detachable 5-round steel box magazine. Emptying the magazine is accomplished by depressing a button inside the front of the triggerguard, which drops the hinged floorplate. This rifle also has Kimber’s gunsmith-adjustable trigger, which on my sample was set at 3 pounds.Although similar in components and design to other models in the company’s long-gun line, the rifle also offers unique features for tactical shooters, such as an oversize tactical bolt knob and a steel 20-minute Picatinny scope rail mounted with 8-40 screws. The match-grade barrel features a tight match chamber, a recessed crown and a 1:12-inch twist.The stock is the popular McMillan A-5 model, fitted with an adjustable comb and length-of-pull spacers. The Advanced Tactical Rifle is further modified for tactical use through the addition of four flush-mounted quick-detachable mounting points for sling attachment. There’s two on the left side of the stock and two on the bottom of the stock. Accuracy is enhanced by both the glass bedding and a free-floating barrel."

SFx comes with many new features as modular for the shooter to enjoy more in target shooting. Equipped with front serrations, extended magazine catch and extended slide stop, the shooter’s control of the pistol is enhanced and sighting is improved thanks to the fiber-optic front sight. The tolerances are tightened; the trigger stroke is shortened therefore allowing for quicker firing rates with integrated trigger safety, an optic mount slot is introduced to facilitate the mounting of popular Red-Dot optical sights by installing interfaces that also enables cocking lever for smooth loading. Thanks to the weight reducing cuts on the slide, the weight of SFx is similar to the standard size TP Series Pistols."
