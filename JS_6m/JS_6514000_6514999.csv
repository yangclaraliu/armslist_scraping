Purchased new last year, and only has 5 boxes (100rds) through it.  This was originally an ADL model, that I purchased for $500 solely for the 700 action.  I installed a fully bedded, Hogue Ghillie stock with bottom metal (polymer). This isn't the cheap pillar bedded stock, but has the full aluminum bedding throughout the forend for stiffness and to keep the barrel free-floated on the bipod.  Passes the ""dollar bill"" test with ease.  The bottom ""metal"" is made by Legacy Sports, and includes both a 5rd and 10rd magazine. 26"" varmint barrel with 1/12 twist rate.  I sent out the bolt to have a tactical knob professionaly installed.  Picatinny scope mount with 20moa cant for reaching far out there.  RAZOR SCOPE IS NOT INCLUDED.  I was banging steel at 800yards with 175gr Federal, but havent gone further yet due to shooting range limitations. This rifle loves the 168gr+ loads. Included in the sale is the 9""-13"" bipod (Harris knockoff) and cheek riser/butt cuff.  No sling and no scope.  The rifle has been kept in a Pelican case when stored, and is pristine.     Will meet at a local FFL in Palmdale for the transfer. Asking $750 which is more than fair for all the installed items.  Tim"

Actually, I just won't have a need for this any longer and I don't care to pile guns up any more. I'm looking for an FN Five seveN as a trade with cash added on my end.If you are unfamiliar, this is a subcompact polymer framed 1911 chambered in 45acp. It has a brushed stainless slide which is in excellent shape. The frame itself is without any wear or damage either. I replaced almost all of the springs in the gun because any subcompact 1911 is hard on springs and they are relatively cheap and easy to replace as a scheduled maintenance service.The gun has tritium lamp night sights installed and are still bright with plenty of life left. It will come with 2 magazines, each holding 10 rounds (the same capacity as a full-size P227). Everything functions as new and the gun runs perfectly. Beware that these guns can be finicky about ammo (mostly JHP bullets) as can any 1911 but everything I've put through it has been flawless.I will include a Bianchi open top OWB leather holster for the gun. I will also include a small variety of ammo including a box of 50 fmj rounds, 35-40 rounds of federal JHP, and 20 Hornady Critical Duty 180g +P rounds. All of this ammo has been run through the gun before with no problems. I am asking for $700 for all of this. I am not really looking for trades but I suppose if you have something interesting (not some plain jane XDs or crap like that), you can ask. I am looking to buy an FN Five Seven which is the reason for me selling this. I DO NOT WANT TO GET SOME LOWBALL OFFERS SAYING YOU'LL GIVE ME 400 OR SOMETHING RIDICULOUS. This isn't some dumpy, run-down heap. It's been well-maintained, shot very little, and includes some nice stuff. It's insulting to me and to you so just don't bother.Asking for $700 cash or best offer. If you have a FiveseveN you would be willing to trade, I will add cash on my end to make up the difference."

SN indicates 1976 manufacture date. 
Upgraded Trijicon night sights with strong light. Slide and frame have been melted for better conceal carry.  Upgraded trigger. 
Finish is about 85-90% with only blemishes being one small idiot scratch and around rear sight.  Evidently whoever installed the sights was not very careful.  I have other pics that show these that I can provide, and the price reflects less than flawless finish.
Gun would be great conceal carry or range shooter.  Comes with one Colt magazine, no case.  I picked this up in trade and have no history on it.
Price is $925.  Pretty firm but open to serious offers.  No trades unless you have something of equal or near value.  I prefer Colts, Sigs and SA handguns, mostly .45 and 9mm.  Don't really need any more rifles or shotguns and have my own set of AR's. 
This is FTF only within a reasonble driving distance of North Texas (Denton).  Please be eligible to purchase a handgun in the State of Texas - over 21, have TX DL and prefer CHL/LTC holders.  A bill of sale will be executed.  This is cross-listed and subject to prior sale.  More pics available upon request."
