The custom work intended to improve the rifles mechanically, to equip them with new Creedmoor sights, or simply to vary the aesthetics of the rifle with inlays, engravings or customized work to the stock. The new 1874 Sharps Old West gets the inspiration from a rifle made by Henry Slotterbeck, a gunsmith from Württemberg emigrated to the States around the 1850 who, after having worked for some years for Henry Deringer in Philadelphia, founded the Slotter & Co. The stock has brass parts for both the “Walnut” and ""Maple"" versions. On the right side of the butt stock there is a plate that can be personalized with some engraving of choice. The forend has wedge plates. The pistol grip cap is made of case hardened steel.

Since the imposition of sanctions against Concern Kalashnikov in Russia on July 16, 2014, we are working to transform our company and staff from an importer and 922(r) compliant conversion specialist, to a full-fledged manufacturer. We are very proud of the results shown in the following pages and we hope you will appreciate our efforts. We started with the proven AK-47 design, utilizing the Russian Heritage of the long stroke, gas piston, rotating bolt design. Starting with a firearm that is simple to operate, easy to maintain and built to last for years, this reliable and durable firearm has all the stopping power of a .30 caliber round. To this legendary firearm, we added the American Innovation. First, thru the use of CNC design and manufacturing, all of the parts that were formerly cast, are now CNC manufactured, meaning the tolerances of the parts can be tighter, resulting in an improved fit and finish. Less space and play between the moving parts results in smoother operation, a crisper trigger and more accurate shot placement. Depending on the material, all parts are now finished in phosphate or black oxide, for longer and better anti-corrosion resistance. The barrels and chambers are nitrocarburized case hardened for a long life with superior corrosion resistance. Nitrocarburization is a more environmentally friendly process than chrome lining a barrel. The superiority of the autoloader. Shotguns based on the AK design have reached a level of such popularity in the USA because of the same Russian Heritage as the AK rifles, the same design, the same operation and the same reliability as the AK rifles. We are using the same American Innovation on the shotguns, including CNC production, and improved coatings. We are also applying our experience doing 922(r) shotgun conversions to improving the shotgun cycling.   Shotgun Models We are proud to present an affordable autoloader with pistol grip and AK type stock. Two tactical shotgun models, one with a folding steel stock and aluminum quad rail for home defense or Law Enforcement use, and a three gun competition shotgun.   Our goal at Kalashnikov USA is to maintain the quality, durability and reliability of the past, while using the best production methods of today, to produce the finest firearms in the world. Kalashnikov USA KS-12T  x  12 Gauge  × 922(r) compliant  × Nitrocarburized case hardened barrel and chamber for extended life and corrosion resistance  × Safety selector lever notch to hold operating handle and bolt open position  × Includes one polymer standard capacity magazine (10 rounds)  × All cast parts are now CNC machined for tighter tolerances  × Polymer hand guard, skeletonized buttstock and pistol grip  × Pistol grip with interchangeable finger grooves and back straps [UPG47]  × Factory modified vented forend  × Enlarged gas port and block"

Since the imposition of sanctions against Concern Kalashnikov in Russia on July 16, 2014, we are working to transform our company and staff from an importer and 922(r) compliant conversion specialist, to a full-fledged manufacturer. We are very proud of the results shown in the following pages and we hope you will appreciate our efforts. We started with the proven AK-47 design, utilizing the Russian Heritage of the long stroke, gas piston, rotating bolt design. Starting with a firearm that is simple to operate, easy to maintain and built to last for years, this reliable and durable firearm has all the stopping power of a .30 caliber round. To this legendary firearm, we added the American Innovation. First, thru the use of CNC design and manufacturing, all of the parts that were formerly cast, are now CNC manufactured, meaning the tolerances of the parts can be tighter, resulting in an improved fit and finish. Less space and play between the moving parts results in smoother operation, a crisper trigger and more accurate shot placement. Depending on the material, all parts are now finished in phosphate or black oxide, for longer and better anti-corrosion resistance. The barrels and chambers are nitrocarburized case hardened for a long life with superior corrosion resistance. Nitrocarburization is a more environmentally friendly process than chrome lining a barrel. The superiority of the autoloader. Shotguns based on the AK design have reached a level of such popularity in the USA because of the same Russian Heritage as the AK rifles, the same design, the same operation and the same reliability as the AK rifles. We are using the same American Innovation on the shotguns, including CNC production, and improved coatings. We are also applying our experience doing 922(r) shotgun conversions to improving the shotgun cycling.   Shotgun Models We are proud to present an affordable autoloader with pistol grip and AK type stock. Two tactical shotgun models, one with a folding steel stock and aluminum quad rail for home defense or Law Enforcement use, and a three gun competition shotgun.   Our goal at Kalashnikov USA is to maintain the quality, durability and reliability of the past, while using the best production methods of today, to produce the finest firearms in the world.

If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—?the kind of reliability that you can count on—?your search is over. As the original 3-1/2 inch semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4 inch, 3 inch and even 3-1/2 inch magnum ammunition without adjustments. The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech® system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever.

They utilize their tactical/limited conversion, which allows it to run low recoil loads for faster followup shots due to the limited recoil. It truely is the softest shooting semi I have shot, and I have owned numerous Benelli, Beretta, and Browning models. As you can see, it has their extended charging handle, extended shoe, extended mag (8+1), fiberoptic sights, Speedfeed stock, sling swivels, and railed barrel clamp. This is the perfect setup for 3 gun, as it is very quick to target, well balanced, and comfortable to use. This one has all the bells and whistles, and the new owner will love it. I also have a lot of reduced recoil slugs and shot, and we can discuss that if you want it. May travel for a serious buyer. Check my other posts, as I am clearing out some space and selling some quality items."
