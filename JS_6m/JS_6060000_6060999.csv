It comes with the original magazine and a sling on swivel mounts. The 303 British round keeps this as a 200 yard rifle, but it sure is fun too shoot. Action is tight and cycles smoothly. I have nearly a box of ammo to go with it, so you can get out and shoot right away. Scope mount has not been drilled for mounting - you can restore this weapon to original configuration with the wood parts and it will have no holes in the top. It has a small crack at the left front of the forestock. I can email additional pics."

By employing billet technology, its designers were able to cleanly design-in every feature that was previously applied as an external add on. With the use of self lubricating coatings, and heat-sync technology, the ST Compressor represents the digital upgrading of the analog rifle.

I say LIKE NEW, because I put less than 25 rounds through the chamber and only carried it for a short time as my everyday carry. I have the original box it came in at the time of purchase, both magazines, and the gun lock.**Also included in the purchase of the handgun/magazines is a leather Desantis in-the-waistband holster and a plastic Plano gun case**"

Hey guys,
 I have a very good condition Mosin Nagant PU Sniper with scope, straight from Mother Russia! This gun is in very good condition, I had a gunsmith check it out before I bought it and the bolt lock up is solid, bore is clean and I've only ever shot commercial ammunition through it, no corrosive surplus! The scope is in great condition, no perceivable scratches on the lens and it's very clear. A pretty crude scope by today's standards, but still very capable for hunting or range shooting! These rifles are getting harder and harder to find, so don't wait."

No box/papers.  Got in a trade a little over a month ago, and have more of an itching for full size.  Not sure of the exact value/collectability of these, but know there is some desireability of the early 80's pistols prior to changes that occured during the late 80's/early 90s with Colt's QC.  See similar ones going in the $800 ball park on gunbroker, so figure I'll go with $800 trade value, $750 cash or best reasonable offers."
