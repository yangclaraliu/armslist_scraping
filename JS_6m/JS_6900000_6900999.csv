SoftCoil system significantly reduced recoil but maintains a recoil spring that is soft for easy manipulation of the slide. SoftCoil system reroutes gas pressures which allows for the light spring and uses a non-tilting barrel instead of a tilting barrel which is typical to a Browning-type system used in many modern handguns. Striker-fired pistol and it has a 5.5 pound trigger pull. Manual thumb safety. Black polymer frame. Slide serrations front and rear.
