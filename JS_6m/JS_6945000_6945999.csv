When police departments approached us to build them a more reliable, durable 1911 to replace the ones they had been carrying, we developed a model just for them. The additions that made it ideal for law enforcement also make it perfect for home defense, so we gladly offer it for sale to the public. A full-size 1911, the Specialist is chambered in .45 or 9mm and loaded with features to satisfy a public servant’s special requirements. The forged stainless steel slide wears our popular Clark-style serrated rib with a single amber tritium dot in the rear sight and a green lamp with white target ring in front. The frame sports an integral 1913 Picatinny, 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and recessed slide stop to enable the installation of laser grips. Equipped with an ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and detachable two-piece magwell, the Specialist is operator-friendly. It is finished off with a set of G10 VZ Operator II grips that force the hand into the beavertail and hold it there. The Specialist ships with two 8-round magazines with bump pads (10 rounds in 9mm) and is available in either a matte stainless finish or our Duty Black finish, which makes for an especially hardy pistol that scoffs at everyday wear and tear.

NIB will not crack and chip like hard chrome • Temperature resistant to 1100*F • Four times the wear resistance of electroless nickel phosphorus • Plating thickness range: 0.0003 to 0.010 inch • Excellent adhesion to most alloys including titanium and aluminum. NIB is not intended for carbide or tungsten. • Improved impact resistance • Best performance is achieved when both mating components are plated with NIB • Plated parts can run lubrication free, reducing the cleaning, care, and maintenance without sacrificing reliability • All final thickness measured with XRF instrumentation technology The color of NIB BATTLEWORN™ is a dark shade of gray with an aesthetically distressed, modern “battle” finish. NIB BATTLEWORN™ creates a smooth and uniform plating barrier without adding significant dimension to the metal part, increases the surface hardness of the plated part, and produces a product that is superior to competing plating systems.  - See more at: https://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/719013658/Firearms/Handguns/Glock/Glock+19+Gen3+9MM+USA+NibONE+Battle+Worn+%26+Relief+cut+slide#sthash.HNOL08kf.dpuf"

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.

I never cared for shooting .40 and this is the only one I ever owned. You seriously won't find a nicer G22 on Armslist. There isn't a spec of carbon or the tiniest of scratch on the entire gun and has been sitting in my Liberty since 2014. I am the original owner.The gun has the original box, paperwork, cleaning rod, 2 backstraps (before they included 4), six magazines with Pearce Gen 4 textured extensions on all of them (they were $11 each but if that isn't your thing baseplates are dirt cheap to swap), factory mag loader, Pearce grip plug ($6), Glock extended slide release ($15), and a Ghost 3.5 connector ($20). The gun has not been modified or tampered with in any way aside from the connector swap. Again, if the lighter connector isn't your thing a new one can be had for as low as $15. As it sits everything would be around $750 retail.The gun is mint. If you were to purchase it from a shop in its current conditon you would pay around $30 less than the price of a brand new one. Probably a lot more with all of the mags and features.I am after $475. I will not respond to low-balls. No trades at this time.Buyer must be an Ohio resident or pay $35 in shipping to an FFL.I live in Central Ohio but travel to Toledo often. I would be willing to drive 30 minutes outside of my way to meet up.Thanks for looking!"

This has the more expensive matte blackened stainless slide vs the normal stainless slide.  It also comes with the original factory 5 and 6 round magazines and is equipped with rare Heinie straight 8 night sights which Heinie unfortunately no longer produces.  Additionally, this pistol comes with a leather IWB holster and its factory box and its contents.
I just checked and this is still the smallest and lightest .40 S&W pistol in the world.  It is even small enough for pocket carry in larger jacket or pants pockets.  This pistol is ideal for someone that is looking for CC pistol with the power of .40 S&W and especially for someone who mainly carries .40 S&W so you can economize your ammunition.  I am selling because I am switching to 9mm and economizing towards that cartridge.

I need help with $200 and I'm losing hope, I never lose my faith in God but I wont have a roof over our heads for my 2 year old if we don't come up with the money by tonight and this has broken me down more than you will ever know, we have been sleeping in my truck and I dont get paid till Thursday morning to pay the rest of the rent, my number is 615-439-8899, I would be more than glad to talk with someone and tell them our story and how we got here or please pray for me and my family as I'm just needing some help or a loan and anything that points me in the right direction, I dont care what it takes to save my family and will write a contract and sign it, let you hold my bank card or the registration to my truck I would do it or help would be something I would never forget, I'm really scared and have prayed and prayed and prayed and ask God to take care of this thank you and God Bless ANYTHING HELPS I'm only doing this for my 2 year old, if you can't help just please send me a message saying you will pray for me and my son thank you so much, I don't care what I have to do to keep this roof over our heads, if its a loan then I can give some collateral to hold, or I can do whatever to work it off I just need help, if its not the full $200 then anything helps even if its a little!
