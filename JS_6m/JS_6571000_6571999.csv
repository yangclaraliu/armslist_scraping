I had to trim 1.5 coils out of the recoil spring on the bolt assembly to get it to function right with my suppressor and 22LR Federal Automatch. After that, it ran like a top. Should work well with most setups, but you can by an additional spring for $7 if you need to tune it to your suppressor or favorite ammo. Tim at Taccom was INCREDIBLY helpful when I talked to him, so know you have good backing there. Mags are 25 round Blackdog 22LR smoke mags. Selling this as a complete package, so please do not ask about splitting it up. Both the mags and bolt assembly are out of stock, so this is a great way to get to shooting 22LR without the wait.

If you're looking for a comfortable concealed carry gun in 9mm look no further. I really like this gun and the only reason I'm trading is that I just bought another CCP in all black. This gun is basically brand new as I've only put 150 rounds down the barrel. If you're not familiar with the Walther CCP basically its a single stacked 8+1 9mm that has an awesome grip (similar to other Walther or HK grips). The size makes it very comfortable to carry since it's a slightly bigger than your subcompact M&P Shield but it's definitely smaller than other compact handguns like the Glock 19. It also has an interesting barrel port and gas piston system to reduce recoil. Due to the reduced recoil the recoil spring is not as heavy as other handguns making it easier to rack the slide. (This can be a positive for women who are new to concealed carry and have trouble racking the slide of other handguns).Please send me your trade offers through email or text REDACTED but just know I am leaning more toward Glocks and XD's in .45 or 9mm.

Rock Island Arsenal made Model 1903 rifles from 1906 to 1913, and 1917 to1919. Later, all unfinished parts were shipped to Springfield. Among these parts were about 2,000 receivers that were nearly finished, and had already been marked "" ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL"" but not serial numbered or heat treated. About 1928 Springfield finished these parts, and made them into complete rifles, but left the Rock Island markings in place. Clearly marked ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, but Rock Island only made rifles up into the low 400,000 range.
