They feature a stamped receiver, 10 1/2 in. chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture. Comes with one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. Arsenal discountinued the whole 106 series so these will only become harder to find. This was supposed to be my first Bulgarian SBR but I had the oppertunity to purchase another already done. Whats nice is being able to consolidate ammo sizes and switch between  this and an AR5.56/223. The cardboard box is a little rough but everything from the factory is included. Never loaded a a mag, or chambered a round. I lowered the price, this is priced to sell or comparable trade."

I have owned this rifle for over 20 years, and it came out of another long-term collection when I purchased it. It is unmessed with.
Per several sources, based on the serial number of 9475, this one was initially manufactured as a M1892 around 1895 and at some point soon thereafter recalled and altered to the M1896 configuration, as most of the M1892’s were.
There are no other modifications or alterations.
It retains the original wood finish and reddish brown Springfield Arsenal color. While the wood is sound, it clearly shows signs of use.
The original Inspector’s cartouche is gone, probably a function of the period alteration. The ‘circle P’ proof is present on the underside of the stock, rear of the triggerguard.
On the top of the comb, near the buttplate, is stamped (I think) “121”. That’s probably a rack number.
On the right side of the buttstock, near the buttplate is stamped “WI”. I would speculate that this indicates a Wisconsin connection.
The barrel blue is good, thinning at the muzzle.
I see no pitting.
Marked ‘1894 Springfield Armory 9475’ on the receiver.
No reblue or stock alterations.
Included with the rifle:
1.Original M1887 leather sling. Surface cracking evident. Still very flexible.
2.Original brass front sight / muzzle cover.
3.Complete set of cleaning rods and nickel-plated oiler.
Think about this for a minute; this rifle is coming with over $300 worth of very hard to find accoutrements. It’s a complete package and you don’t need to hunt for a year to find these rare accessories.
Many more photos (35 presently) can be seen here:
http://s214.photobucket.com/user/R_S_Hubbard/li brary/Krag%20M1892_96
Note the photo of the bore/action/chamber show what looks like rust; it’s not – just preservative grease. It’s very clean.
Questions are welcome; PLEASE ask if you have any."

I also have an IWB kydex holster that I'll toss in for $35 (it originally cost $60 and was used once). I am not currently looking for trades. I would prefer to meet face to face at a local FFL, but I am willing to ship from my FFL to your FFL on your dime (shipping is usually $35-45). I will not budge any lower on the posted price (these sell for around $400-450 new).Feel free to contact me for any additional info."

The rear has a speed mono pod that has the ability to fine adjust or speed adjust by the push of a button. Front Bi pod is a push button activated style.

Willing to accept credit card payment thru discreet Paypal transaction with buyer to cover all fees. Trijicon’s longest-range AccuPoint scope, it gives tactical shooters, varmint hunters and law enforcement snipers the ability to accurately extend their range in any light. *Advanced fiber-optics and tritium aiming-point illumination speeds target acquisition and extends available shooting hours. *Dual-illumination system automatically adjusts aiming-point brightness to existing lighting conditions. *Manual brightness override allows shooters to easily adjust the reticle to suit their preferences. *30mm tube offers a greater range of mounting options. *Rugged, aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum body offers all- weather protection. *Unmatched long eye relief protects against the recoil of higher caliber rifles. *Easy-to-use external turret controls for windage and elevation adjustment. *Side parallax adjuster for enhanced accuracy at long range.

Many of the long shots made by our military are done with a Barrett. Effective range is 600 meters for individual / point targets and 800 meters for area targets. I have owned these for many years and kept them in my climate controlled safe. This set comes with lots of extra's. Included are 10 Barrett 30 round mags, and 2 Barrett factory / Law Enforcement soft cases. This set comes complete with all the Barrett original packaging, manuals, slings, and Hopps cleaning kits. You can bet these are on the AWB list. I can several more pictures to interested buyers just hit me up,i hope they can help answer any questions you may have. Please feel free to e-mail me with any questions. Please note that the barrels are threaded so make sure you can own this firearm in your state. I cannot ship these to CA,Mexico,and Canada. Bottom line just make sure you can own them and that I can ship them to your state. I only ship directly to your FFL. I'm not a dealer so I don't know every states laws.

The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.Note- Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package. From time to time you may find a P-07 with an extended barrel, tactical light, tritium sights or safety levers only. There are a number of special versions we ship throughout the year.Features: Caliber: 40 S&WCapacity: 12Number of Magazines: 2Barrel Length: 3.8""Finish: BlackFrame: Black PolymerGrip: StippledAction: Double/SingleWeight: 1.7 lbsOverall Length: 7.2""Height: 5.3""Width: 1.46""Safety: Interchangeable, Ambidextrous, Decocker/Manual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, and Firing Pin Block Safety"
