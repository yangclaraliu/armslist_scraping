I am the original owner.  This P30L has the luminescent sights, not night sights. I got this one cuz I love my P30 so much, but I just never really use it. I'm pretty sure this gun has been to the range twice, and sat at the house since then. I am hoping to trade for a similarly good condition used VP9.  Being that P30L's and VP9's dont tend to cost exactly the same, ifnight sights on the VP9 would be appreciated. Yes, I594 sucks, yes it applies. Having a CPL helps a lot.  You pay for your transfer fee, I pay for mine.$700 cash is king."
