The ATF were confiscating them by the hundreds in Miami from narcos who converted them to full auto for use in the Miami drug wars against law enforcement and rival gangs. THIS IS A SEMI AUTO PISTOL. Not an MG. The ATF said that the ones in circulation are grandfathered in, however, any new ones produced in the same design are considered to be machine guns. So there will never be anymore than the ones out there already. These guns were produced for only three years so they are getting really hard to find. It utilizes U.S. Grease Gun magazines which are in plentiful supply. (around 10$)RPB SAP in .45 ACP.Original vented barrel shroud.Four 30 round magazines."

I will not sell to anyone from any other state and I will not sell to anyone without a valid Indiana Drivers License as well as one who is legally able to own and purchase a firearm in the State of Indiana.This rifle is one heck of a shooter. I built it for Steel Challenge matches but I have decided to move into a new platform. This specific 10\22 began it's life is a standard 20"" ruger 10\22 in a wood stock. I have shot a few Steel Challenge matches with this rifle and enjoy shooting it. I would estimate that this 10\22 has only had approximately 600 rounds through it.Modifications:-Barrel cut to exactly 16.625"" with a 1\2""-28 thread on with end for suppressors or flash hiders. (Will come with thread protector)-The action was tore down, cleaned, polished, and optimized-No last round bolt hold open-Extended Rimfire Sports and Custom Mag release-Nordic Components AR-15 Chassis Kit-Magpul CTR stock in OD Green-Magpul Angled Forward grip in FDE I believe-BCI defense buffer tube-Monstrum Tactical 7"" Free Floating one piece quad rail-Monstrum Tactical dual-ring sling mount-Monstrum Tactical Barrel Locking Nut-Hogue OD Green AR15 Pistol Grip-3 Brand New Ruger Original BX-25 MagazinesThe rifle will come with the original wood stock, the 10 rd factory magazine, as well as the 3 brand new Original Ruger BX-25 magazines. The rifle will also come with all of the factory parts to return it to the original functioning condition. One word of warning is that in the factory condition (not in the Nordic Components chassis kit) the rifle has no front or rear sights as it was the model for a scope and will come with the factory picitanny rail to attach to the ruger upper reciever. Note about the pictures:In the pictures, the rifle is shown with an optic on it. This optic is a 6MOA all aluminum C-More Sight Systems Railway. This optic worked very very well for steel challenge and most any .22LR match I ever shot this rifle in. The optic will be included for the right price ($360 optic). Price with optic can be had at 850, price for everything listed above without the optic is $500 OBO, but I am pretty close to $500 on bottom dollar as I know what I have in this rifle and I know what it would cost to have a real gunsmith build a comparable platform. This gun is perfect for suppressed squirrel hunting, plinking, rifle training, steel challenge, etc. etc. No lowballers, no Trades, no Lawnmowers, No criminals, No bullsh**, etc. I can be reached at REDACTED, personally I prefer text first because I work some goofy hours.

Selling my Nighthawk Custom GRP Recon 1911 made by RWA ** Airsoft Pistol ** , this is an extremely limited production and very high-end build…anyone that wants an elite Airsoft or Training Pistol this is fantastic…I had a professional gunsmith mill three top vents into the mill, this give a quicker cycling and also allows for more shots per magazine.

I can give more pictures and more details to anyone that would like them.
 
It comes in a custom wooden display box with the certificate of authenticity…I also have a custom Pelican 1490 case made for this…the foam was cut with a waterjet for a perfect fit. I also have a custom battle-belt made for this setup that holds the pistol, a Cold Steel practice knife, and 6 total magazines. It is made with very strong carbon fiber style Kydex, really well made!

In order to get more velocity in the past shooters have used a brute force approach large charge weights of a slow burning powder in a larger cartridge case. Ultimately this leads to more recoil and muzzle blast. The Superformance solution is an elegant approach that utilizes specialized powders at NORMAL charge weights that impart all usable energy to the bullet reducing the Rocket Nozzle Effect at the muzzle while still increasing velocity.

You have now flagged my $650 Colt and had it removed 32 times. You must have nothing better to do in your life. I have asked you to email me and tell me what you find in my as to be a ""scam"" and you did not respond. I have asked you to be a fair human being and please stop flagging my post so that I can handle my family issue. You kept flagging. I have asked you to text me, call me, email me, or meet me in person so we can settle this rediculoislessness once and for all. Instead you sit in your mom and dads basement and wait for my repost so you can flag again. I hope nobody has ever sold you a firearm as you are obviously too immature to own one. Please remove your tampon and email me so that I can find out where your major malfunction lies. Did your mother not hold you enough? Perhaps daddy stuck his ""gun"" in your mouth so many times that you can't stand the thought of a firearm ejaculating down your throat.

All parts are new, never assembled and never used other than the Bushmaster parts, which I swapped out on another rifle because I decided to use the Magpul furniture that came on it. The only things you need to finish this rifle and start shooting are the lower receiver, magazine and rear sight. All of this would run you around $100 total if you're building on a budget. These are easy to put together with common tools, even if you've never assembled one before. Great for a first time builder. $360 cash or may trade ($400 trade value). I can add cash for the right trades. Feel free to send offers, worst I'll say is no thanks. Thanks for looking!"

Four civilian mags in the civilian package are typically the Mec made in Italy units and are shiny. These real units are matte, marked Sig Sauer, and are US made. Civilian TACOPS are a black painted finish versus these waterproof/salt resistant versions. Factory zeroed 25'."
