Sorry, but not interested in trades at this time.For sale is a like new IWI Tavor X95 Bullpup rifle in 5.56 NATO and is FDE in color.  The rifle comes in its origional box as new and has only been fired on one occasion in order to test upgraded components that were installed.  All told, this rifle has just under $800 improvements and upgrades, the most significant of which is the Trigger assembly, which has been upgraded to the Timney 680 Gen II Assembly.  The combination of the Timney 680 and the user adjustable Geissele Super Sabre Lightening Bow all but eliminated any overtravel the trigger had, minimized pre-travel, and resulted in a trigger with a crisp and clean breaking trigger with a significantly reduced pull weight and ultimately a trigger that feels very much like a standard 2-stage match or competition trigger that you might find in an M4.  The rifle's trigger pull-weight is currently measuring at just over 3.7 lbs.  A list of the major upgrades that have been added to this X95 rifle and a description of each of them and their function may be found below:Timney 680 IWI Tavor Trigger Assembly Gen II -   Self-contained lightweight 6061 CNC machined aluminum 2-stage trigger.  Wire EDM cut, heat treated, Teflon nickel coated hammer to guarantee lifetime service and functionality. Geissele Super Sabre Lightening Bow Trigger - Precision machined from precipitation hardened 17-4 and replaces the standard trigger that comes in the stock Tavor and X95 rifles.  The trigger bow is flatter and changes the angle at which your finger touches the trigger bow, reducing the pull weight modestly.  The Geissele Lightening Bow Trigger is adjustable via a set screw, which removes ""slack"" inherent in the trigger mechanism used within these unique bullpup rifles.  By removing this ""slack"" trigger pull is transformed into feeling much more familiar to that of an M4 match trigger, with a clean and crisp break and user adjustable travel.Manticore Tavor/X95 Gasketed Port Cover - Significantly reduces the amount of gas expelled from the rear of the rifle.  While this is not a significant issue when shooting the rifle normally, it becomes an annoyance when shooting suppressed as gas is discharged from the port, which is positioned very near the shooter's face when firing the rifle.  This gasketed port cover provides the greatest seal of any port cover on the market due to its design and the use of a gasket.Muzzle brake/Compensator - Reduces felt recoil and minimizes muzzle rise improving accuracy and your ability to place follow-on second and third shots directly on top of your first shot."

I cast them by hand and inspect each one myself so you can be assured you're not getting something screwy from someone not paying attention. Just to emphasize, these are only the bullet TIPS (often called boolits). You can use these to load your own cartidges. I use these in my own bullets I load and have better results than off-the-shelf walmart ammo. Obviously it will also depend on what powder, etc. you use, but that's not hard to figure out if you don't already have a preferred formula.I do have written confirmation from the Program Manager (IOI) at the Firearms Industry Programs Branch here in MO that these are perfectly legal to make and sell without an FFL, so there are no laws being broken here (always a plus).The basic ""package"", per se, would be simply cast and sold. I can however size and lube if you'd like. I powder coat mine for my own personal use, so I don't keep a lot of lube on hand, but I can order it without an issue if you can't provide it. Sizing & Lubing adds a very minor amount extra. Pricing is as follows..356, 100ct. - $7.00(Round nose, 124gr. mold - weighs roughly 131gr. with my alloy).356, 1,000ct. - $60.00(Round nose, 124gr. mold - weighs roughly 131gr. with my alloy).356, 100ct. sized & lubed - $8.00(Round nose, 124gr. mold - weighs roughly 131gr. with my alloy).356, 1,000ct. sized & lubed - $70.00(Round nose, 124gr. mold - weighs roughly 131gr. with my alloy).401, 100ct. - $8.50(Truncated cone, 175gr. mold - weighs roughly 185gr. with my alloy).401, 1,000ct. - $75.00(Truncated cone, 175gr. mold - weighs roughly 185gr. with my alloy).401, 100ct. sized & lubed - $9.50(Truncated cone, 175gr. mold - weighs roughly 185gr. with my alloy).401 1,000ct. sized & lubed - $85.00(Truncated cone, 175gr. mold - weighs roughly 185gr. with my alloy).451, 100ct. sized & lubed - $10.50(Round nose, 230gr. mold - weighs roughly 240gr. with my alloy).451, 1,000ct. sized & lubed - $95.00(Round nose, 230gr. mold - weighs roughly 240gr. with my alloy).452, 100ct. - $9.50(Round nose, 230gr. mold - weighs roughly 243gr. with my alloy).452, 1,000ct. - $85.00(Round nose, 230gr. mold - weighs roughly 243gr. with my alloy).452, 100ct. sized & lubed - $10.50(Round nose, 230gr. mold - weighs roughly 243gr. with my alloy).452, 1,000ct. sized & lubed - $95.00(Round nose, 230gr. mold - weighs roughly 243gr. with my alloy)Please note: The more you buy the more you will save.If you are looking for other amounts, 500ct, 10,000ct. etc. let me know and I should be able to work with you and still keep your cost down.I am located in St. Robert, MO and can meet anyone for sales, etc. However, if you'd like me to ship, I can do that also (at cost). I have talked with just about every person in California (yes, the state) and as long as it's just the lead tips they don't mind the shipping across state lines. Other states may vary, but generally speaking CA is the hardest to work with.Shipping can be had for roughly $6-7. The amount that will fit in the box will vary depending on bullet size. .356 is roughly 900 per box, .452 is roughly 600 per box.Please note, if you are looking for a different bullet size, let me know. I may be able to work something out for you (I have for others).Please contact me at REDACTED. Text or call.Thank you!-Joseph"

Includes 2 19 rnd. mags, 2 back straps, to get a more custom fit to your hand, cleaning brush, cleaning swab holder and cable lock. The CZ P series pistols are SA/DA that offer the Omega trigger system which minimizes the parts in the trigger group. This significantly reduces the pull weight in DA and SA. The Omega system also affords the shooter the ability to choose between de-cocker or manual safety. A very easy to see 3 dot sight system helps in quickly aquiring targets. Slide has cocking serations on the front and back of the slide. This all comes in a fire molded hard case with the custom fit foam padded interior. The case is lockable with the included cable lock. CZ pistols have a huge aftermarket parts selection available so the shooter can truly customize the pistol for the type of shooting of their choice. The steel slide rides down into the polymer frame reducing the bore height. This unique feature reduces muzzle flip for faster follow up shots. Whether just a range gun or used for various competions, you will not be disapointed with the CZ P09. Shipping to an FFL add $20.00."

It has been mounted to my .223 bolt rifle and has seen target use only. Mechanically and cosmetically perfect. No scratches, dings, or other marks. It is a fantastic scope and the only reason I'm selling it is because I'm going to a higher magnification. I originally thought I would use this for hunting too and the 4.5-14 was perfect, but this has been become a dedicated target rifle. Optics are very clear and the reticle is wonderful for wind hold off. As the it gets darker outside you can see more light through the scope than without it. The eye relief is great and it is very easy to look through at all magnifications. The focus works perfectly and when set properly there is 0 parallax. I've had other scopes where that where the focus didn't remove the parallax, but this one works well. I have the original MOA turret and a custom turret with the windmap set to generic and common trajectory. Very similar to .270 win, .30-06, etc. The yardage has been very close although not perfect. Additional turrets can be purchased from Burris very reasonably, although anymore I prefer the MOA turret. This scope also comes with the Butler Creek caps, sunshade, and the Burris Signature Zee rings seen in the photo. The Signature rings are the best always hold without leaving marks and allowing adjustments within the rings. I also have a set of inserts for the rings so you can decide your own level of adjustment, it is currently set for a 20 MOA slant. This is a fantastic scope and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another for a hunting or or combo rifle. Email or text Kris with any questions."

These carbines were manufactured shortly after the Russian government sold the plans, material and tooling for the SKS rifle to China.
 
The first manufactured carbines were called Soviet-Sino the serial number contained a Russian Cryllic as the first character of the serial number as well as  a Tula star on the left of receiver in line with the serial number.
 
The Ghost was the next batch of carbines manufactured under semi direct Soviet supervision, before adopting the a Arsenal 26 triangle with the 3 Chinese characters denoting a type 56 military grade carbine in the later part of 1956. 
 
Ghost guns have Soviet QC/Proof stamps in several locations on the weapon and stock.
 
This SKS is 100% matching including the stock. No cleaning kit or sling.
 
The bore is bright, with sharp rifling, the action is tight, trigger is crisp.
 
Excellent piece of history. Not exactly pretty, but very interesting a great shooter to add to your collection.
 
The SKS is a robust over built weapon for its caliber. Proven in combat in several conflicts, and will outlast most other carbines in its class.
 
Thanks for looking.
