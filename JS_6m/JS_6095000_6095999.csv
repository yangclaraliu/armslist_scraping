It weighs in at 12oz with the barrel nut (which is included but not pictured). If your current AR 15 is feeling a bit front heavy, this would make a HUGE difference, and would make your current build a lot more maneuverable.The Muzzle Brake is also brand new and comes with a crush washer. It has a crowned front end for breaching purposes as well and gives any AR 15 build a rugged but aesthetically pleasing look to it. Only reason I am selling is because I ended up going with a stainless Muzzle Brake to match my current AR 15 barrel.Price:The Hera Arms rail goes for $150 brand new but I'll be generous and sell both the rail and the brake for $105 FIRM.Possible Trade:400 rounds of .45 AmmoIf interested you may contact me at559-7zero9-3242.Text is preferred, but if you must call, leave a voicemail so I know it is not a scam call.Will not ship."

Three magazines included (one 5rd and two 6rd), as well as a Minotaur tuckable leather/Kydex CCW holster and the original Kahr case. If you are looking for a compact, easy-to-carry concealed handgun in an effective caliber, this may be a good choice. I purchased it due to its light weight, small size, potent caliber, narrow width, wind age adjustable night sights, and fantastic trigger (wide, smooth, steel, and breaks like a glass rod).The PM40 is a very light handgun (17.7 oz), chambered in a powerful caliber (.40 S&W).  As a result, it is a fantastic concealed carry weapon. However, keep in mind that this same combination of features can make it challenging for new shooters to handle well. When I purchased the PM40 a few years ago, there was some 'holster shine' (wear) on the right side of the slide near the muzzle, and on the slide release lever. This is the only issue I am aware of with the handgun.Thanks for looking. Please call or text with any questions, REDACTED.MSRP for a new PM40 is $800. Typical retail seems to be about $550-650. With the extra mag ($25) and holster ($30), I am asking $500. I'm open to trades, but am ideally looking for a Glock 43 (or similar compact CCW 9mm)."
