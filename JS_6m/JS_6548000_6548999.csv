Not sure why the last photo is upside down, as that is not how it was uploaded.  Less than 200 rounds through it.  I am the original owner.  It is about 3 years old and was professionally cleaned a few months ago.  Am willing to meet in Cass and surrounding ""donut"" counties and am also potentially willing to meet in Tippicanoe County or Indianapolis if you are flexible on dates.  MUST provide a license to carry a handgun and matching ID.  It is in good condition.  I carried it for a while, but have recently purchased a different handgun that is currently being customized.  The .44 Tracker is a bit tricky to conceal (if you care about that), but it also can make for a nice backpacking gun, home defense gun, or backup gun while hunting.  It has a ported barrel to help with recoil.  Like most Taurus revolvers (in my experience), it shoots well.  Not very interested in trading.  Would consider a short or medium sized .45 acp suppressor, but would likely have to consult with an attorney who specializes in NFA trusts before committing.  Thanks!"

Gun doesnt have a mark on it. Total rounds fired is 8.  The gun is great but no matter how hard I try,I am just not a Glock guy.  The first thing I did was upgrade Glock terrible sights. These are the ameriglo cap sights and the front is tritium. Just that alone made a world of difference.Next I added a talon grip. I'm not totally sold on stippling and I know it's not for everyone so this was an easy add-on to make it easier to control the gun. It can easily be removed if you do want to stipple it.I then added the ghost 3.5 pound connector. Kind of a no-brainer with Glocks.I then got another magazine and added two of the +2 hyve Technologies base plates and one +1 base. Also as you can see in the pictures I added the hyve Technologies trigger, magazine release, and rear slide plate. I also purchased two brand new Alien Gear Holsters. 1 iwb and 1 owb. I have actually carried each of them two times. The iwb was very comfortable but I obviously don't need the holsters anymore if I don't plan on keeping the gun. I'll provide more pics if necessary.I'm in Ozark and not looking to travel too terribly far unless the trade is worth it or it's an all-cash deal. I can also accept credit and debit cards for a 3% fee. I am not a dealer and I do not collect tax. This is a private party sale"

Haven't kept a round count on this weapon but I am estimating around or just shy of 1000.  Had the intentions of doing IDPA/USPSA but interests, work schedule, location, then ultimately health changed.  It would just be too much for me to go out and do any sort of competing.
 
Pistol has the flat Apex forward facing seer installed with a competition spring on the trigger and the factory seer spring installed.  The originally trigger, Apex competition seer and striker spring, Apex RAM system all are included in a bag not shown that you can install yourself.
Pistol is reliable and does not experience a dead trigger with the factory seer spring – the light competition seer spring produced some dead triggers when installed – I never bothered to send this in to apex for tuning or try to tune the trigger bar reset loop as I could not tell the pull difference between the factory and competition seer spring and the factory seer spring works perfectly.
Installed is a Trijicon RMR06, I still have the original paperwork and box for.  Gun also comes with 5 magazines and a Blade-Tech Pro-Series competition holster.Willing to sell RMR seperately from pistol.Located in the North Port / Venice Area."

$900 firm in cash or higher in trade.  
Prefer cash right now, but might consider trades, depending on the deal.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other item(s) either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others, depending on the deal.  Items I could use or use more of, AR FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger & Law Tactical Gen 3-M folding adapter.  Also, a 9""+/- 5.56 upper, a few side charging uppers, 9mm stripped lowers similar to the Joe Bob's Spartan I have now and maybe an AR pistol in .45ACP or parts.  Could also use some factory Glock 33rd. 9mm mags in new or close to new condition.
Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  Please, no lowballers, scammers or flakes!

It has a pinned barrell and recessed cylinder. This sat in a safe most of its life.  I put 12 rounds of 38 sp and 6 rounds of 357 through it a few years ago. That's all this gun has ever fired. It's in pristine condition. Comes with the original grips which are perfect and has a target hammer and target trigger. I'm asking $950. It would be hard to find a nicer one"
