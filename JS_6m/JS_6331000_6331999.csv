Take into consideration what it costs to get into this optic, and you may find you can’t afford not to buy it. Whether you’re burning through a 3-Gun Stage, logging some range time, or holding for hair on a coyote you’ve duped into thinking you’re lunch, the Strike Eagle is up to the task. High-quality, fully multi-coated lenses deliver a clear, crisp sight picture and optimal low-light performance. A true one-power on the low end of its 6x zoom range provides quick target acquisition in close quarters scenarios. Need to engage targets at distance? Crank it up to 6x and let it rip."

The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This is a great way to use in home defense in that you can use one set of rounds for far away and once things get closer you can switch and use the other tube.

It's the nice model, not the cheap ""mossberg maverick"". It's very light weight with its black synthetic stock, which are way more durable than wood stocks. It's a beautiful shotgun and cycles smooth as butter. I got to take it to the range twice. Shot a box of bird shot and a box of buck shot. It's basically brand new. I put a picture of the action so you can see it doesn't even have any black paint worn off. I love this gun. But sometimes life gets in the way, and you need money. So it's for sale for 300 dollars. I'll throw in 50 rounds of ammo as well. I live north of Nashville near gallatin, will meet inbetween for the right deal. As far as trades go, let me see them! Worst I can say is no. Make offers, but be reasonable. Phone number is 615-766-2zero30. Name is Travis."

The scope isl a Leupold vari x 3, 3.5-10 that was sent into Leupold to have a mildot reticle as well as the custom 175 grain turrets added. Not a knock off scope, just PRE mark-4 that looks and functions exactly like a mark 4. The scope was sent into leupold by Warrior Kit in Pueblo West to confirm it isn't a fake. Turrets are one minute of angle adjustments for elevation and wind. Remington action was blueprinted  by local gunsmith B.D. Artus.( You are more than welcome to take a look at the inside of the weapon because Im sure he did a lot more than I can speak too)  The bottom metal I have yet to figure out, but it does have a three round detachable mag. Im guessing that it is also H&S Presision, but im not 100% sure.I do apologize for the lack of knowledge about this weapon as I purchased it from Arctic Shooting Supply here in Pueblo and am the second owner of it. The one thing I can attest to is this rifles accuracy.  Best group ever fired by me personally was .5 moa three round group with match grade ammo, Federal Gold Medal 175 grain BTHP. I have never had an issue keeping my group under a minute. Also, I have been able to consistently hit a man sized target at 1200 yards.   I have fired 760 rounds of the above ammo through this rifle. Whoever had the rifle bulit... didn't put a whole lot of rounds through prior to selling it. Rifle was meticulously cleaned/maintained after being fired. Due to department policy changes I cant use this for work and as much as I love it ... It deserves more than to just sit in a safe. I have decided to go in the direction of a sass type ar-10. If you have further questions or would like additional pics feel free to ask. ONLY TRADES CONSIDERED would be a Larue, JP, or Knights Armament in 308.Seven six zero 500 3659.
