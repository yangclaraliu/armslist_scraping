This was the bedroom gun. Gun has been shot less than 100 times. What is a 500C ? It's Compact. I believe they are called Bantam now. This Mossberg was bought new by me around 2006. Shows very little signs of wear as it most leaned against the wall.  Barrel length is 20 or 21 inches, depending on how you measure it. Tip of butt to trigger is 13 inches. Total length is just over 40 inches. Holds five rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber. Comes with full, modified, and improved chokes (imp is in the barrel), choke wrench, and a surefire flashlight mount that attaches to the mag tube. As I said, this is a good size for home defense or a youngster. I know you are going to offer less than whatever my asking price is so I am asking 325 but am really looking for 300 and no lower. NO LOWER AT ALL!!  It's a good basic shotgun for home defense.$325.00 Cash only no trades.

He had others he used for target practice (those went to my son), and there were several he never did fire after purchase.No shipping, cash only and please no hundreds.
