The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. .SPECIFICATIONSFinish BlackType Semi-AutomaticAction Single/DoubleCaliber 9mmBarrel Length 3.8""Capacity 15 + 1Safety AmbidextrousGrips BlackSights 3-DotWeight 1.7 lbsTo buy call or click>>>CZ P07"

The Tracker 1x24 provides clear viewing in total darkness by utilizing a built-in IR infrared illuminator; when in use the illuminator emits a pulsing frequency that is so energy efficient it creates less battery drainage and prolongs battery life. The ergonomically designed rubberized body is surprisingly lightweight and can be taken on long expeditions both easily and comfortably and is great for prolonged use with the head gear accessory. The Tracker utilizes the revolutionary Eclipse Lens Cover System which uses flip-up covers that can be easily clipped back against the body of the binoculars and rotated out of the user's viewing area while eliminating lens cap hassles. Pin holes in the lens caps allow the Tracker to be used in the daytime when the caps are closed. Also featured is a dual diopter adjustment with central focusing knob and fully multi-coated optics."

BLASERS ANSWER TO THE GROWING WOMENS MARKET. BARREL CAN BE CAMOED TO MATCH FOR A SMALL ADDITIONAL CHARGE. The R 93-system is the most successful hunting rifle system of the 20th century. It raises the bar on basic features common to all Blaser rifles. Manual cocking system Straight-pull bolt action Direct triggers Easy handling Free floating barrel Robust action and barrel finish Original Blaser saddle mount Disassembly Diversity In the eyes of the animal, the camo pattern integrates into the natural surroundings. The contour of the rifle is no longer noticeable and therefore the camoflage, perfect! For us humans, the colour strikes the eye, ensuring maximum safety during driven and social hunts. Incorporating innovations that raise the standards for quality and performance, the Blaser rifles mark the beginning of a revolution in bolt-action design. In fact, these rifles represent the first truly new concept in bolt-action rifle design since the bolt-action idea was first introduced. Foremost among its breakthrough features is its fast, smooth, straight pull bolt movement. Unlike conventional bolt actions, you operate the Blaser action by simply pulling the bolt to the rear and pushing it forward, with no lifting. Its faster, smoother and less likely to affect your aim for the next shot. Less obvious but equally remarkable is the Blaser's Radial Locking System (see details below). It's built around a radial bolt that expands 360degrees to make full, rigid contact right inside the barrel for a solid lock-up. Also contributing to the Blaser's performance are its patented sear-free trigger mechanism and completely free-floated barrel. Altogether, these design innovations result in a level of accuracy that no conventional bolt-action rifle can match. Dedicated to any single caliber, the Blaser R93 would rank among the best bolt-action rifles in the world. But the Blaser R93 rifles were engineered to allow for barrel and caliber interchangeability. Quick take-down and a replacement barrel and bolt head are all that's needed to provide maximum versatility in the Blaser R93. The technologically advanced Blaser Radial Locking System gives you five distinct benefits: 1) The bolt locks directly into the barrel, not into a receiver, so you get a full-length barrel in a rifle that's 4 inches shorter overall, 2) The frame receives minimum stress because the bolt locks directly into the barrel, making the Blaser lighter and easier to handle, 3) Radial lockup means that stress is distributed through a full 360 of contact, for greater system strength and durability, 4) Head space is precisely controlled because the bolt head locks directly into the barrel, and 5) The bolt head is free-floating, so it self-trues into a concentric position in the bore, relieving stress and assuring a higher degree of accuracy. There is no other rifle system with the versatility or pure shooting ability of the R93. Due to its revolutionary straight-pull bolt and radial lock-up, the bolt mates directly to the barrel with full 360 locking contact for superior strength and rigidity. Because the R93's bolt locks directly into the barrel, the R93's frame receives minimum stress which allows the rifle to be both lighter and shorter, so it's easy to carry and quicker handling. The trigger is sear-free, and designed so the ""creep"" is eliminated. Let-off is crisp and precise. Scope mounts directly to the barrel, so that rifles can be easily broken down and reassembled without changing point-of-impact. Barrels are cold hammer forged and are machined to accept detachable scope mounts. They are free-floated, so that atmospheric changes won't affect your point-of-aim. The R93's straight-pull bolt is an engineering marvel and includes a safety which actually cocks/decocks the firing mechanism. There's even a rubber bumper built into the magazine well to protect bullet tips from recoil damage. The list is endless. EMAIL Axeldempsey420@gmail.com."

The Pro Hunter rifle frame features a swing hammer safety that allows for easy access to the hammer spur, the speed breech quick release breech plug that can be easily removed by rotating it only 90 degrees, the Pro Hunter extractor that can be rotated left or right for easy access to the speed breech."

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN.We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

This model has no finger grooves in the grip and is quite desireable. It is also an early 2-pin gun, manufactured in 1989. The frame is in excellent condition, and the slide shows only holster wear, zero rust/corrosion. The slide has minor nicks from daily carry-it was originally a Police issued weapon. I have replaced all springs internally with factory Glock replacements, and the sale also includes a new stainless steel guide rod and recoil spring(function tested only). Sale includes one ban-era 17 round LEO marked magazine-additional OEM Glock magazines can be included for $15/each. This is a potential shooter or collector's piece. I have tested it for function and carried it on occasion, but need to whittle down my collection. Price is $350. Some trades may be accepted, but cash is preferred.Local transactions only to SC residents. I am willing to travel within 30 minutes of Greenville, SC"
