It was manufactured a couple years ago, but never worn. I bought it for home defense, but it isn't really the right size for me anyway.This body armor is made of a mixture of Honeywell Gold Shield and Spectra (UHMWPE/Dyneema). It is the highest end of body armors, with a high V50, yet lightweight and thin profile.Also includes the extra slip in trauma platesPrice is firm. I don't NEED money. Don't wanna pay 150? Fine, I'll hold onto it."

Buy It Now!! At the core of the Model 700 SPS Tactical 300 Blackout is the machined solid-steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design ensuring uniformity, strength and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 16 ½ -inch, heavy-contour clean barrel threaded to accept AAC and all 5/8 x 24 threaded flash hiders, muzzle breaks and suppressors. The tactical-style carbon steel, hammer-forged barrel is the perfect balance between handling in tight spots and delivering pinpoint accuracy. With a twist rate of one in seven inches, this rifle is optimized for accuracy. These specialty, bolt-action rifles are shipped with a thread protector installed.The rock-solid barreled action is bedded in a Hogue® OverMolded® Ghillie™ Green pillar bedded, synthetic stock with a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability. The soft-touch, sure-grip stock is extremely comfortable for extended, long range shooting and assures a positive grip in both stressful situations and inclement weather. The dual point pillar bedding guarantees a solid interface between the action and stock to help insure cold bore accuracy and prevent point-of-impact shifts. Add Remington’s X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger, designed to “break-like-glass” and set at 3 ½ pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical-like accuracy.Other key features include a drilled and tapped receiver for the addition of optics; distinctive, laser-engraved “300 AAC Blackout 1:7” roll mark; convenient hinged floorplate magazine with 4-round capacity and a non-reflective, black oxide external metal finish; and sling swivel studs.Caliber: 300 AAC BlackoutMag.

No holster wear whatsoever. Comes with 2 6 round mags, 1 of which has a polished mag plate. Also comes with pinky extension. It will come with factory slide stop, Mag release, trigger and anything else I forgot to mention. Also I have an Uncle Mikes IWB holster.
