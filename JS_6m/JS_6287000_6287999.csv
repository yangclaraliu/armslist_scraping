The rifle is a SIG SAUER M400 Carbon (Direct Impingement) in stock configuration. 
It is a 16"" .556 1/7 twist barrel with a 12.5"" Lancer carbon fiber handguard. 
The SIG lower has ambi mag release, ambi safety, and a larger bolt catch button. It also has QD mounts built into the lower on each side, just behind the safety. The lower has an adjustable tension setscrew accessible under the grip that keeps it tight with the upper. It has a magpul polymer trigger guard installed. The buffer tube is milspec and it has a decent SIG branded Adams Arms Ark Defense Sopmod Stock. Sig branded ergonomic grip of some kind. 
Trigger is a two stage Geissele Match trigger but I don't know exactly what model. 
It has magpul MBUS flip up sights.  
Total weight is 6.77lb
It came with a Lancer mag so I can either include a used Lancer mag with it or a new Gen3 Pmag if desired. 
The major components of the rifle (barrel, bolt, trigger) have seen less than 100 rounds of use. 
It currently has a flash hider on it but I can toss on an Obsidian arms muzzle brake on it if you want. 
I also can swap the 12.5"" carbon fiber out for a 16"" if desired. At that length, the flash hider just barely sticks out from the end. 
I also have some additional rail sections and a QD mount that goes on the hand guard if more attachment points are needed. Those didn't come on the rifle but we can figure something out, I am sure. 
The MSRP on the rifle is about $1,750. Street price is around $1350. Price drop to $900
Thanks for looking."

Optical clarity is superb and this scope works very well in dim light. 30 mm main body tube and Front Focal Plane, best illuminated reticle set up on the market today. Scope is in like new condition and has seen very little use, less than 15 shots and has been stored in my gunsafe. The scope is barely a year old and has all the features you could want including a zero stop, side focus, and tactical turrets.  I am just tight for cash right now and am selling it to help pay for a rifle I have on layaway.   Vortex MSRP is $899 and most places sell it for $799  Mine comes with $70 worth of options on it for 669, and you would end up with those accessories on the scope anyway, so it would cost you 799 plus 70 which is $869, so you save $200 on a virtually new scope in like new condition this way, and Vortex will still warranty the scope. And their customer service warranty is the best in the business. Vortex is now the most popular scope among the top 50 competition rifle shooters this year and you can look it up online.  IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT. What this scope has is so meny useful features that you don't get on a leupold without spending 2-3 times as much money. The magnification range, clarity, and resolutions is outstanding for shooting out to 600 yards or more.  The fine yet visible reticle will allow you to engage targets at 1,000 yards if target and tactical are on the menu.  There are 10 settings for the illuminated reticle, which is the best configuration I have ever seen. Every other click turns it off. This is so convenient! You can put it next to your favoritre setting and just make one click and there you are right where you want to be!  2.5 magnification works very well in the dense woods, as does 3.5, and that is where I set it if the illuminated reticle is turned off. There are tactical turrens for adjusting the wiendage and elevation, as well as side focus (parallax), It's got the rubber flip up lense covers on it. You can order the metal ones later for about $49 last time I checked.  Overall a great seope. It also has shims for a zero stop.  Fogproof, waterproof, great lenses and coatings. Superior customer service with a no hassle we fix it warranty. The scope is for hunting, target, and tactical. I sighted it in and hunted once to kill a blactail doe. Hunt was only one minute for me to spot a deer, make a quick stalk,and shoot the deer. Scope is in like new condition."

This gun has the hogue tamer grip to reduce recoil. This does not have the cocking hammer, which makes it ideal for pocket or purse carry. The gun also shoots 38 special ammo. About 340 rounds of misc ammo come with the gun. About one hundred-twenty-five are 38 special or 38 special +P, two hundred plus are .357(approx 100 are hollow point) One holster is the Desantis Superfly for non-printing pocket carry. The other is a single clip hybrid  IWB with leather back and kydex shell. And it also has the Ruger zipper case. I will sell the gun by itself,  but I don't want to, so that price is $435. But you can get everything for $550. (To buy the ammo and holsters on your own would run About $250). You will need to buy ammo and a holster any way, so get it now for half price. Will consider giving LCR + cash for higher end Sig p226 or p229, or 220. I'm not really wanting anything else in trade and I especially don't need hunting rifles or shotguns. ***If you have an interest in this gun, please reference what the gun is and tell me anything about how you would like to carry out the transaction.

The receiver S/N dates the gun to March 1944. It has a mix of WWII and post-WWII era parts, and they compliment each other to create a very nice shooting, and accurate, gun. Here are some highlights:Pros:- Has WRA bolt (-1 W.R.A.), which is very nice.- Has the earlier narrow-base gas cylinder with a ported gas plug. Has proper play on barrel splines, and the splines have not been peened.- Has an (unmarked) NM SA op rod (i.e. 77 op rod). Nearly new.- Has a brand new, properly finished CMP stock, and handguards, Beautiful!- Has a correct trigger housing (-12SA) and hammer (-5SA).- The gun is tight and cycles right!Cons:- Has an import-marked barrel (SA 10/53), from Blue Sky (Arlington, VA). More on this below. The muzzle wear is 5, but the bore rifling (lands and grooves) look pretty good. It shoots very good, and with reloads, I expect the barrel has a few thousand rounds of life left.- The trigger guard is milled (which is good) but the lockup pins are worn (more D-shaped than round). However, given the stock is new … this is good! The trigger group lockup is exactly as it should be and … as the wood naturally compresses … you can get a new trigger guard which will lockup tighter.About the Blue Sky Importer:M1 Garands were exported to US allies, and this gun was exported - most likely - to South Korea. Blue Sky (and others) reimported them. This creates some confusion, so to be clear: The gun is made with all USGI parts, with these notable exceptions: the stock is a CMP stock, and the gas plug is a ported, engineered part. I can substitute with a USGI ported plug, if desired (but, it won’t shoot as well).I am asking $800 firm for the gun. Here are a couple of “comparables” currently selling or sold on GB:609248865604489432"

Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing. Easy to Conceal Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.   Personal Protection Made Easy  The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.       Easy to Use and Maintain The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA."

Not many rounds through since I bought it, maybe 100. Comes with reproduction WWII holster and two magazines.  Probably worth 450, Im sure I could get 380 if I were patient, but I need cash asap so it is priced to sell!
