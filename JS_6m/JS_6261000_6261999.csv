These KS-47s are basically an AR platform that is chambered in 7.62x39, and accepts any AK magazine. Way cheaper to shoot than firing 5.56 or 223, plus much more punch! If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, check out the video on youtube (PSA KS47 -vs- CMMG Mutant).The Palmetto State Armory KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK. While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines, that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 lets the AK shooter capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR-style platform. Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver, the KS47 features an AR-style modular configuration which consists of a barreled upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. The modular configuration allows customers to have several different barrel configurations with one lower receiver, just by releasing two pins. Lower: The 7075-T6 billet lower receiver is hardcoat anodized, and accepts standard AR15 fire control groups. The extended magazine release is outside of the trigger guard for safety, which allows for an AK-style release movement, but also features oversize side paddles for fingertip release by the trigger finger. Fitted with a Ergo grip and M4-style stock, the receiver also features a standard, mil-spec diameter, 6 position, 7075 carbine buffer tube. The KS47 lower has steel reinforcements to accept AK style surplus magazines including drum-style.Upper: The KS47 hybrid upper receiver is precision machined out of billet 7075 T6 aluminum, and then hardcoat anodized for durability. While retaining the look of a standard M4 upper, the KS47 hybrid upper is designed to work with either the KS47 lower, or the standard AR47 lower. The chrome moly vanadium barrel is chambered in 7.62x39 with a 1 in 10 twist, has M4-style feed ramps, is nitride treated for accuracy and durability, and is finished off with a 5/8-24 thread A2-style compensator. The forward, assist, dust cover, charging handle, and safety are all standard AR15, as is the PSA Slim free-float rail and barrel nut.BCG: The hybrid KS47 Bolt carrier group works with either AK47 magazines or AR47 magazines, and features an extended firing pin. The carrier is made of 8620 steel, chrome lined and phosphate coated, and the chrome lined gas key is attached with grade 8 bolts and properly staked. The Bolt is made of phosphate coated 9310 steel. The KS47 Upper and Hybrid BCG are compatible with standard AR15 lowers for use with AR47-style magazines.I'm asking $900 for the rifle with one steel or PMAG 30 round magazine (buyers choice). *** Aimpoint in pics is not include with this sell, at this price."

I'm not willing to ship, only face to face.  I'm near Frankfort, so I can meet in the Lousiville, Cincinnati, and even Bowling Green and London areas if the deal is worth it.Not really looking for trades on this one, though I might accept partial trades for antique pocket pistols, an Arisaka, or a .17HMR lever action."

The occasional cleaning and tinkering with is all this amazing riffle only has done.Comes in a metal locking case, bolt lock, fully loaded magazine, box of ammo, and sights. Asking $1100 OBO - REDACTEDDon't let the color fool you..retail value is $1795 brand new without extras.The Ambush 300 Blackout is a gas-impingement semi-auto in the standard M4 configuration, including its controls. The safety, magazine release and bolt catch are all located in the standard locations. It’s listed as multi-caliber as it fires both .300 AAC Blackout and .300 Whisper ammunition, and since everything but the barrel is the same as Daniel Defense’s 5.56 rifles, the barrel can be swapped for additional calibers. It features a 16-inch cold-hammer forged barrel with a salt-bath nitride finish with 1:8-inch twist rifling.It features a two-piece Picatinny rail along the top of the receiver with indexing marks for attaching optics in the same position every time, along with three, 2.5-inch Picatinny rail sections on the front of the modular float rail for mounting lights, lasers, bipods and other accessories. The rifle is available in Mossy Oak Break Up Infinity, Mossy Oak Blaze Pink, Realtree AP and standard black, and comes with a Magpul MOE buttstock, and what Ambush calls a “shotgun inspired modular hand grip.”The hand grip is a very nice touch, and even though it is made of plastic, it provides a little bit of the wood feel of a Remington 870 to the 300 Blackout, making it more comfortable to shoot, both from support and freehand positions. As I have never really liked how an AR’s forearm felt in my support hand when firing, but never considered it a major issue for an otherwise great platform, I kind of wish all ARs had this hand grip.Other features on the 300 Blackout include some inspired by the needs of Special Forces rather than hunters, such as a threaded barrel for attaching a suppressor, with a protector on the end, and a charging handle that is more easily accessible when using optics. The Mossy Oak finish on the test model was smooth and well applied, though the deflector quickly showed signs of the finish chipping once shooting began. The 300 Blackout breaks down just like any AR-15 rifle, and comes with a single five-round PMAG magazine, which makes sense as many states limit magazine capacity for hunting. However, the included PMAG had a very tight fit, causing problems with both insertion and removal. Luckily, standard 5.56x45 mm AR magazines also work, such as the TangoDown and standard metal magazines also used during testing.As for accuracy, the Ambush 300 Blackout was excellent with multiple consecutive five-shot groups measuring under an inch with three different loads. A large part of this was due to the excellent two-stage trigger that started with just a little bit of un-resisted take-up before breaking at just over 4 pounds.Manufacturer: Ambush Firearms; Ambushfirearms.comModel: 300 BlackoutCaliber: .300 AAC BlackoutFinish: Mossy Oak Break Up Infinity (Also available in Realtree AP, Mossy Oak Blaze Pink and black)Action: gas impingement semi-autoReceiver: 7075 Mil-Spec aluminumRifling: 1:8” RH twistBarrel: 16” Cold hammer forgedMagazine: five-round PMAGSights: none, Picatinny rail for opticsTrigger: two-stage Geissele Super Semi-automatic; 4.39 lbs.Stock: Magpul MOE ButtstockWeight: 6.9 lbs.Accessories: manual, hard plastic caseSuggested Retail Price: $1,759"
