They were imported intact and were factory double mag wells. I've shot this one and it's 100% reliable and accurate as an AK gets. This version was only imported for 4 years.Rifle is wearing a very rare stamped AK underfolder that screws on just like a regular AK stock. You won't find one of these underfolders available anywhere. Also includes all the pictured standard wood to dress up your rifle anyway you want comrade.Includes 333 rounds of brass (not cheap steel) 7.62x39mm ammo and 3 magazines, one Russian bakelite, and 2 Tapcos, all 30 round capacity.FOID check on isp website is required and the transfer form will be used for the person to person transfer requirements to be met. I can complete all paperwork and provide you with a copy for your records.Cash price is firm I have no need to sell rifle. Truth is I ended up with 2 AK style guns because of multi gun trade and I only need one. I have both up for sale/trade and when one goes I'm keeping the other. Thanks for looking!"

As well, along the way the Nepalese were also given components, especially locks. These, not uncommonly, formed the basis for indigenously manufactured arms on the British pattern. Such was the case with many of the Snider Rifles in the collection. Though the stocks, barrels and hardware on some of the guns are obviously of native manufacture, locks from British Pattern 1842 and Pattern 1853 muskets and rifle-muskets will often be found on some. While three-band rifles form the preponderance of the Snider Rifles, some two-band Short Rifles and about 100 London-made sporting-style carbines used by the king’s guard have also been uncovered.This rifle is in great shape and while I have not fired it, I would have no hesitation with doing so."

These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.Sometimes performance isn’t optional.

The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.
This particular variant - affectionately nicknamed ""Jonny Boy"" - features a simulated case-hardened finish with matching camo grips. This high durability finish was developed for extensive outdoor use and is very low-maintenance."
