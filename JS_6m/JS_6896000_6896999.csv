I know this is a special buyer and I am in no hurry to sell this masterpiece. The white lines are from me editing the pic to white out serial number those lines are only in the picture not in real life on rifle. This is a private sale for a custom AK-47 centerbalananced systems bullpup cerakoted battlewarn black and gray. The pics on this beauty don't do her justice. Comes with 2 -30 round magazines and 140 rounds of ammo. Also comes with magpul iron sights as pictured. AK frame is Bulgarian military spec great quality not a cheap AK build. The Chasey is a center balanced systems bull pup. The trigger is super light and pull crisp. Cerakote was done by one of the best cerakoters in the country as you can tell by pics. The price is $1000 cash not much room for negation on this. If you know AKs and quality plus the extras and Cerakote this is a phenomenal price. I love this AK it's honesty my favorite firearm I have owned. I am only parting with it because I am a lefty and thought it would be fine for me but due to the design it is difficult for a lefty such as myself. Only out about 60 rounds down her but again it's an AK you can't go wrong. Not looking for trades please don't offer any. I will need to see a valid Arizona DL or CCW and must sign a bill of sale.

These things don't hit the market very often, and they're pretty damn cool. Amazing shooter (took her out the other day to the range), 0 failures, dead accurate, great trigger. I'm trying to slim down on my hammer fired guns, and my P229 won over this by a little bit. This is the safety/decocker model, which lets you carry it any way you want. This is the model with the slightly shorter barrel than the standard 92 series models. It has a stainless slide, great sights, an aluminum frame which makes it light, and it is probably one of the smoothest guns I've owned.For anyone who's not familiar with this series from Taurus, it (also the PT92/99) is almost an exact copy of the Beretta 92 series..and basically one of the only high quality firearms Taurus makes. I've had 3 of these copies and have never had an issue with a single one. Taurus purchased a factory from Beretta years ago, kept all of the machines, tools, and employees. For a while they made 100% copies, but after a few years they switched the safety from slide mounted, to frame mounted. A lot of people, including myself think this change is absolutely for the best. Beretta has used the frame mount a few times for their limited edition handguns and it is most definitely easier to use.Comes with one 17 round mag, and the box I got with it. Asking for $400 for this, which is much cheaper (and in better condition) than they usually go for. Cash is king, but I'm willing to consider trades. Not really looking for anything specific, so let me know what you have and we'll go from there. Least I can do is say no eh? Only things I'm not interested in: Bolt actions, shotguns, or .40's.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED, I work a lot so I won't answer phone calls, but I should reply to a text within a few minutes.Located in Northville, willing to drive a bit but nothing crazy. FTF deals only, MUST be 18+ with permit, or CPL. NO EXCEPTIONS. Asking me to sell you the firearm with no paperwork (it's actually happened too many times to count) will result in your name and number being forwarded straight to the MSP and ATF.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

The S&W Model 915 was produced from 1992-1994. The Model 915 was part of the ""Value Series"" pistols made by Smith and Wesson, and incorporated several features to cut the costs associated with manufacturing ""3rd Generation"" Smith and Wesson pistols.[1] The Model 915 was made with only one safety/decocker lever (left side) in order to save costs. The Model 915 was made with all-metal parts, while the follow-on Model 910 substituted a plastic rear sight, plastic recoil guide rod, and plastic magazine release button to further save on manufacturing expenses.[2] The earlier Model 915 also reportedly has a lug on the barrel and a corresponding cut in the slide for tighter lock up. The later 910 has no lug on the barrel, nor a slide cut, reportedly affecting its inherent accuracy compared to the earlier 915. Both models have a reputation as reliable and robust.[3] The Model 915 was sold with a 15 shot double-stack magazine.  Magazines for the 915 are the same overall design as those used in the 59XX-series pistols and are interchangeable.[4]"

Bayonet and the lug removed. Bore shiny and rifling is crisp. Shot perfect, as fast as I could pull the trigger. Wood stock was junk so I put a new $100.00 Tapco stock and magazine on it better than a month ago. Took rifle back out for the first time to range today and it isn't kicking out the spent brass all of the time with the new Tapco stock. Sometimes it cycled fine and other times I had to eject the brass by hand. I don't know why a different stock would cause that. Maybe it has build up in the valve, I never cleaned it after the last trip out with it. Maybe the stock has it in a bind.  I'm not going to fool with it. I've got 2 jobs and I'm working on getting a house and just started a engine swap in my work truck. Too much to do to give a rifle my time. Ran great before, has great bore and crowning. Exterior metal has some spots here and there, stock is brand new. First $200 bucks takes it. Slick little build with the bayonet lug gone- ran great before. May just need a cleaning.I'm not going to drive anywhere nor negotiate at all on price. I'm not giving it away, I suspect nothing is wrong with it. I put a cheap red dot on it, never sighted it in.I will have it in Burlington with me tomorrow and can take a lunch and meet if you come to me.Have 200 cash if you email me please."

Completely original and innovative, the Nova Pump incorporates its polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics, such as distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and fore-end in place of conventional checkering, complement the Nova’s innovative engineering.
With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova will handle anything from target loads to 3½"" magnums. To help dampen the recoil of today’s super-heavy magnum loads, the Nova 12-gauge is specially designed to accept a Benelli recoil reducer.
Advantage® Max-4 HD™, the Benelli Nova is the most versatile pump-action shotgun ever made — and just when everyone thought the pump gun couldn’t be improved.
Benelli’s Nova is truly a 21st Century pump shotgun. In a revolutionary shotgun manufacturing process, corrosion-proof polymer is over-molded on a skeleton framework to form the one-piece receiver and buttstock. The lightweight polymer stock also provides plenty of room for mounting an optional 14 oz. recoil reducer.This has only had 1/2 box of rounds through it and functions beautifully.Sale price includes the firearm (gun only, no case) and transfer fees (transfer fees apply to direct, local sales only). Buyer is responsible for $6.00 background check fee and taxes if applicable.Shipping is available to an FFL of your choice within legal states - contact us for shipping rate and to arrange payment.Please have your dealer email us a copy of their FFL License. Make sure you check how much their transfer fee is as you will be responsible for this when you pick-up the firearm. Trade-ins are welcome."

I've included a couple of through the lens images. These were taken with my phone. The red 'notch' you see is inside the eye piece and is there to tell you the on-board IR illumination is on. Also, note, this is the ghost model. The actual image is more blue/gray vs green. These images weren't color corrected. One item of note, the serial number sticker is gone.

But it might be a little older not sure. I'll call smith company and ask in a couple days.   Anyway. The gun comes with just the gun. No box or papers.  It locked up great and timing is excellent. Can't think of any negatives.  Look for any trades.  Harder to get .22s top of list
