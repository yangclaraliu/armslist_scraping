These guys are the best in the business. What they did: CGW uses USA Made precision parts, music wire springs, and heat treated pins; very few OEM parts are retained.   We install our hammer, Short Reset System (SRS), determine the correct CGW precision DA roller, and top it off with a CZ trigger modified with a single-action over-travel stop. Expect 100% reliable ignition, even with DA pulls of 8 – 9 lbs. OEM parts are rough, many times display deep tool marks, and simply do not tighten internal clearances sufficiently to deliver a crisp, smooth, “ball-bearing” like action.   CGW hard parts carry a lifetime warranty. They also installed competition sights. Trigger pull was measured at 3.2lbs. This is a sweet shooting gun that I've put about $1000 into. I'm more interested in trading than I am in actually selling it. Only interested in 9mm handguns. Text for fastest response: REDACTED."

So, Please check the market.  Look around at GB etc.  Post something you are going to sell.  One fellow said after listing it he had changed his mind.  Don't waste everyones time listing the thing unless you absolutely want to sell it at a fair market value.  Most of all, drop the attitude when someone informs you you are $75 bucks over what we can buy a new one for.  Don't get mad at legitimate buyers just because you paid too much and they are now the bearer of bad news.  And thank you to all of the sellers who post reasonable prices and have a great attitude as well.I have had dozens and dozens of responses saying thank you for the post.  I appreciate the responses.  One reader brought up a real point I thought worth mentioning.  When you sell it please close down the post.  He was right on target.  Thanks to everyone for the positive feedback."

Look, just because you bought your Sig, Glock, or whatever at Joes massive retail shop and paid too much does not mean anyone wants to pay more than retail and absorb your loss.  And if you added a bunch of add ons you probably won't get what you want for the item adding in the upgrades.  Gotta be real here.  Doesn't matter how much chrome you add to an Ultra Glide the price is still the same on the market.  Most times people don't even want those upgrades so now it is worth less.  Unless they are good optics or laser etc.  Upgraded mag catches, etc. is what I am referring to.  So, Please check the market.  Look around at GB etc.  Post something you are going to sell.  One fellow said after listing it he had changed his mind.  Don't waste everyones time listing the thing if you absolutely want to sell it at a fair market value.  Most of all, drop the attitude when someone informs you you are $75 bucks over what we can buy a new one for.  Don't get mad at legitimate buyers just because you paid too much and they are now the bearer of bad news.  And thank you to all of the sellers who post reasonable prices and have a great attitude as well."

So, Please check the market.  Look around at GB etc.  Post something you are going to sell.  One fellow said after listing it he had changed his mind.  Don't waste everyones time listing the thing if you absolutely want to sell it at a fair market value.  Most of all, drop the attitude when someone informs you you are $75 bucks over what we can buy a new one for.  Don't get mad at legitimate buyers just because you paid too much and they are now the bearer of bad news.  And thank you to all of the sellers who post reasonable prices and have a great attitude as well."

So, Please check the market.  Look around at GB etc.  Post something you are going to sell.  One fellow said after listing it he had changed his mind.  Don't waste everyones time listing the thing if you absolutely want to sell it at a fair market value.  Most of all, drop the attitude when someone informs you you are $75 bucks over what we can buy a new one for.  Don't get mad at legitimate buyers just because you paid too much and they are now the bearer of bad news.  And thank you to all of the sellers who post reasonable prices and have a great attitude as well."

I am not interested in any trades.  The price is firm. No, I do not give out my phone number. The pistol is nice but a cell phone picture is not going to show that, come see it in person. I do have about 15 boxes of ammo available at $15.00 per box, cheaper than WalMart . You may buy as much or as little of the ammo as you wish. I will ship, my FFL dealer charges $35.00."
