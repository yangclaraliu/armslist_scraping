There are two kinds of 30 Cal. carbines … . One that loses its value over time ( a commercially made rifle ), and one that is an investment….that is, it will at least HOLD its value, and likely INCREASE in value over time. ( a genuine U.S Carbine .Caliber 30 M1 rifle , made during WWII). You DO get what you pay for
As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot…. Very controllable, with plenty of punch .  Just as important, you can find parts for it if something needs to be replaced ( not always true with a commercially made rifle ).   
The rifles that I have listed from my collection, are all investment quality USGI rifles .  You decide what will be best for you in the long run…"

This ammunition is manufactured in the USA using .308 diameter Flat Point heavy poly-metal coated ultra-hard lead-antimony core projectiles.These bullets are precision die cast with the top quality alloy followed by a thick polymer coating and a full resizing to ensure top accuracy and quality.
We use once-fired military/police brass which is acid washed and processed to SAAMI specifications and electromagnetically inspected to ensure safe internal tolerances. We use a high end Camdex 223 rifle case processor then our proprietary trim/cut off machine to very accurately reform the casings to 300 BLK.
In our loading process we only use the top quality SMP powders and ATK primers. Powder is dropped to +/- 0.1 grain accuracy to ensure the highest performance. Cartridges are loaded with H110, A1680, or similar proper powder to cycle AR-15 actions. Every single round is hand-inspected and loaded one by one to the tightest specifications."

This gun features a ""Kerr"" style percussion ball tamper bar and a 2 piece construction of the barrel unit and frame unit which are held together by a ""wedge"" or key, like a Colt revolver/ This design is much cheaper to produce as it eliminates the machining including boring and rifling with limited access. It also causes the cylinder pin access through the under barrel lug to become redundant as the cylinder is easily removed after separating the two major units."
