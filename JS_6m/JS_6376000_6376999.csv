Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with, too many projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, the gain in velocity was not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago or so and just sat in the safe.  The only one I could find currently listed was a new one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration, which I think is a bit high.  I do have a Hogue or Blackhawk grip and/or Magpul MOE stock I can add, if wanted, just let me know.
$1,400 in cash.  I think it was well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and cash or???  If wanting to trade, just let me know what you have and the overall deal and I will consider.
No scammers and must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

Also removes the notorious ""Glock bump"" caused by the trigger bar hitting the connector, which makes the shooter apply extra force to get over the bump, typically moving the pistol off target.

The slim design of the G42 fits the hands of any shooter; specifically it gives shooters with smaller hands a comfortable option like they've never seen before. Glock's smallest pistol uses the same Safe Action System found in all Glock pistols, is backed by more than 25 years of engineering excellence. In addition you get one ""Pierce Grip +1 grip extension""                                      Cerekote Gun Coating in PRISION PINK And trigger upgrade by ""GHOST - trigger connector for G42/G43:    Just because you carry a compact pistol doesn't mean you have to accept a stiff, rough trigger pull. These replacements for your Glock 42//43's factory trigger connector improve the entire trigger pull by shortening the overall pull, eliminating over-travel, and providing a faster reset. Reduces pull weight by approximately 3 lbs.,  giving a smoother, lighter pull. Also removes the notorious ""Glock bump"" caused by the trigger bar hitting the connector, which makes the shooter apply extra force to get over the bump, typically moving the pistol off target. Edge is a drop-in replacement for factory part.Pro requires minor fitting (instructions included) to get the cleanest, smoothest release possible."

Other than the new barrel and  semi-auto receiver,  all parts on this rifle are  genuine  Communist era Bulgarian military productionInterordnance/Royal Tiger  imported a few of these rifles several years ago, and the owner of the company, Uli Wiegand, kept 2 of the nicest for his personal collection, which I later bought from him.  I just sold one of them, and this is the best looking of the 2 - this one has the nicest looking wood including a desirable Bulgarian laminated handguard. It also still has the original Bulgarian military trigger parts set (hammer, disconnector, trigger, and hammer retarder) instead of the U.S. made ""Tapco G2"" trigger group that the original trigger parts in most imported AK rifles are replaced with.Since the Bulgarian Arsenal SLR series rifles are banned by name in California,  the ISD Bulgaria  BSR-74D is the only Euro factory production Bulgarian AK-74 that is legal in California.  As stated above, this is made from original Warsaw Pact era Comblock military parts,  not the soft, crappy, out of spec,  ""U.S. Made"" junk parts (like bolts, carriers, and trunnions) used in some AKs that are being assembled here.This rifle is new in the box, unfired, and in excellent original condition.  PHOTOS:  I have more photos I can email to anyone interested who asks for them.  The magazine shown in the photos is NOT included with the rifle and is NOT for sale.   The  Bulgarian green canvas web sling is included with the rifle.  It also comes with a cleaning kit - it looks  to me like an East German kit, but it's what both of these rifles I got came with from IO/Royal TigerPrice is $1,100 firm + shipping.PAYMENT:  The only payment  that will be accepted is CASH or U.S. POSTAL MONEY ORDER.  NOTHING ELSE!!!!!I am not interested in any trades, as I am only selling it to raise funds to help pay some emergency medical bills for the private, in-home, dog rescue/shelter/sanctuary my daughter and I run.SCAMMER THIEVES:  PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MINE.  I KNOW ALL YOUR SLEAZY LITTLE CRIMINAL CON GAMES, WILL REPORT YOU TO THE ATF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION, AND AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED YOU CAN STICK THOSE BOGUS FRAUDULENT PHONY FORGED BANK CASHIER'S CHECKS IN YOUR BUTT AND LIGHT THEM ON FIRE.If anyone wants to do a Private Party Transfer (I will remove the grip and give it to buyer separately to make the rifle legally ""featureless"")  this can be done ONLY at Brass and Bass in Murrieta, as they are the only FFL in this area I know of that is currently doing transfers on ""featureless""  semi-auto rifle that use a detachable magazine.I CAN NOT AND WILL NOT TRAVEL ANY FURTHER THAN THIS.  If buyer has an FFL  who understands the law and is willing to do a transfer on a  legal featureless magazine fed semi-auto rifle, I will ship at buyers expense."

Extremely reliable and accurate. The ergonomics on the 75 series are amazing, just feels great in the hand. The Omega trigger system is very smooth and has a real nice and light single action pull. I can't say enough good things about this gun and just CZ guns in general. I hate to part with it, just looking for something new to try out.For more info or pics email or text at REDACTED"

All control can be used on either side and the bullets eject straight down by the butt of the stock. It is incredibly lightweight and rugged and has a 4 pound trigger pull, unlike the Tavor's extremely tiring 10+ pound trigger pull. In my personal opinion, this bullpup beats the tavor our in every way, but that is just one man's opinion. In side by side reviews of both guns being used on a course, there is no definitive winner but the RDB DOES cost a couple hundred bucks less and can be used ambidextrously without casings flying in your face. (NOT INCLUDED) angled foregrip, lantac dragon, windowed Pmag, and OPTIC.The first pisture is my personal RDB and the second picture is my wifes and THE ACTUAL rifle you will be gettingMy price is $1,250 FIRM for this BRAND NEW rifle. I will NOT accept lower offers, I am NOT interested in trades, cash only. Lowballers will be ignored.I'm sorry, but I don't care if you ""think"" you found a better deal online. The only online Store that still has these in stock is Kentucky Gun Co. and they have it for $1,441 OTD so i'm BEATING their price by OVER $160, plus no Form 4473 hassle for you. Auction websites ""Say"" they are less but then when you look at the ""Buy it now"" price it's much higher. Plus they ALWAYS post it at the ""CASH PRICE"" so if you use ANY OTHER payment method, the price raises exponentially. AND, people time and time again fail to take into consdieration that all those auction vendors charge tax (if they are in Texas), a 3-4% credit card fee, $30-$50 shipping, and you STILL have to pay your FFL fee!!!Don't message me saying that you found a better price. I truly DO NOT care. BUY IT... if you really did. Message me at REDACTED I am located in San Antonio but will be in houston tomorrow around noon for a few hours. We can meet somewhere around I-10 and Sam houston tollway intersection. PRICE IS $1,250 FIRM!!!Buyer MUST have a valid TXDL and must NOT be a felon. Bill of Sale will be filled out."

It has a Vortex Crossfire II 4-12x40 scope on it with parrelex adjustment. You can find more info about those on Amazon/Vortex website. Sighted in at 100 yards. It is their black plastic stock underneath, I just wrapped it in Camo Wrap, which you could unwrap easily if you wanted. It does not stick to the gun, just itself. Has a blind mag that holds 3 plus 1 in the chamber. Excellent trigger, if I remember correctly it's the X mark pro trigger. Very light and crisp, better than some Timneys triggers I've used. Sling included as well.I also have a few boxes of 95 grain Hornady super performance ammo that can go with it.
