Czech Small Arms designed the .380 Sa vz. 61 to shoot SAAMI spec (American manufactured) ammunition (unlike the original 'Cold War' manufactured 7.65mm Browning vz. 61 that was developed using C.I.P. standards). CzechPoint has tested the .380 AUTO vz. 61s with a variety of ammunition and found common 'off the shelf' ammunition to exhibit outstanding reliability (examples: Federal, Winchester, American Eagle, etc). The original Sa vz. 61 submachine gun (machine pistol) was designed in the late 1950´s in Czechoslovakia and was intended for use with reconnaissance units, tank crews, Special Forces, and for security forces of the Ministry of Interior. The vz. 61 was developed to fulfill a specific need: a firearm that could be worn like a pistol (in a holster) and capable of full automatic fire. The 7.65mm Br. Sa vz.61 Pistol utilizes steel magazines and are drop free while the .380 AUTO Sa vz. 61 Pistol uses polycarbonate, TARFLON IR2500, and the magazines do not drop free from the lower receiver. Magazines purposely fit snug in the lower receiver for positive contact. Two 2nd generation waffle pattern magazines are included with the pistol. The design of the Sa vz. 61 was unique in its time. It uses the following common operational features found on a submachine gun: an unlocked bolt, magazine inserted into the bottom of the receiver (outside of the pistol grip) and a folding stock. These common features are combined with the following characteristics not usually found in submachine guns: extraordinary small size, fires from a closed bolt, and uses a rate reducer to slow full automatic fire. ATTENTION MARYLAND RESIDENTS: ALL PURCHASERS IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THEIR OWN MARYLAND APPROVED GUN LOCK. CZECHPOINT DOES NOT PROVIDE GUN LOCKS. Important Notes: * Our vz. 61 Pistol is a semi-automatic pistol and is not allowed by US law to have a folding stock unless the proper paperwork is completed and approved by the BATFE (all NFA rules apply). * The .380 AUTO vz. 61 Pistol does have drilled and tapped holes in the lower frame for attaching the folding stock mounting plate. * vz. 61 Pistols are assembled with original surplus parts that have seen military service. Czech Small Arms handpicks the best condition surplus parts from parts on hand and refnishes these parts. With that said, please keep in mind that these are used parts and they may exhibit dings and/or scratches under the new finish. * The vz. 61 design incorporates cocking knobs that slide against the upper receiver. For this reason, you WILL see scratches in the upper receiver paint when handcycling and/or shooting the pistol. The .380 Auto Sa vz. 61 Pistol includes the following: Hard case, two 20 rd magazines, holster, magazine pouch, bore brush and paper manual..Sa vz. 61 Pistol cal. 9 mm Br. technical specificationsCaliber .380 ACPBarrel length 115 mmOverall length 273 mmWidth of the weapon 45 mmHeight of the pistol with 20 rd magazine 185 mmWeight of the pistol without magazine 1.29 kgWeight of the pistol with full 20 rd magazine 1.53 kgWeight of the empty 20 rd magazine 0.05 kgWeight of the full 20 rd magazine 0.28 kgTo buy direct call or Click>>>VZ 61"

Because it was. - Designed to minimize creep and stacking the P-10Âs trigger breaks at a clean 4-4.5 lbs and rebounds with a short positive reset meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. - Like all CZ pistols the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ÂCÂ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07 meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.To buy Call or click>>>FDE CZ P10

This unit was stationed somewhere in Afghanistan and then flown back to Fort Bragg, NC. These cabinets were specifically used to store the Knights Armament M110 Semi Automatic Sniper System (M110 SASS). The US Army is replacing the M110 with a modified version of the G-28 from Heckler and Koch and has removed extra M110 storage cases no longer being used to make space. I recently completed a trip back down to Fort Bragg, NC to pick these up and bring them back to Virginia Beach, VA. They are in amazing shape. They have scratches from being moved around from plane to armory but NO RUST, NO DENTS, and NO BROKEN PIECES. Everything is in complete operational order. Many of you have seen me post various types of these cabinets but I have never had the M110 variant until now. Here are some great features:- All SpaceSaver UWR units meet both OPNAVINST 5530.13C and AR190-11 security requirements.- Fully welded construction with durable powder coating. - Cabinets can be ganged from the top, bottom, sides, or rear of other cabinets.- Bi-Fold retractable doors that prevent blocking aisles or neighboring racks and maximizes efficiency of the issuance of the weapons and gear. - Secure construction incorporating perforated doors, sides and back of cabinet to ensure visibility of items inside at all times. Great for doing inventory checks.- Retractable locking bars built inside of doors exceed military requirements for arms security of conventional arms, ammunitions and explosives. - All accessories that come into contact with the weapons are either powder-coated, vinyl dipped, rubber or thermoplastic-coated, or made from polymers to ensure that weapons are safe from damage in transportation. - This variant specifically includes an adjustable rifle butt stock holder. Made for aerial flight and transportation, it holds the rear of the rifle firmly in place. The butt plates are made out of plastic and will not scratch firearms. To adjust, just spin a wingnut and slide the holder on the track. - This variant specifically includes an adjustable rifle barrel holder that holds the barrel of the rifle in the rifle rack and keeps it from falling either direction. Heavy duty and is completely encased in vinyl and rubber to ensure your firearms are not scratched. This is adjustable as well, using a screwdriver, back the bolt out of the rack holder and the entire rifle barrel holder slides about 3-4"" up or down for different barrel heights. - (1) M110 42.5""W x 61.5""H x 16""D Has room above rifle rack to put plate carriers, shelves, ect. - (4) M110 42.5""W x 45""H x 16""D Can be double stacked to save room.The item manifest that I received with cabinets shows that these cost between $1200-$1890 depending on configuration. I am listing the (1) 62"" cabinet for $420 and the (4) 45"" size cabinet for $380. I travel quite often and will deliver these directly to you for FREE. 50 Miles from 23462 is usually my limit however depending on quantity I can make further distances work. Thank you all and message me with any questions you have. Possible Trades: Glock 19. I will add cash on my end.

In addition, the lighter, polymer body frame has new updates for improved handling and accuracy. The internal transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear, an important safety feature. The exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions. An extended ejector rod allows for positive extraction of fired cases. Like all standard Judge revolvers, the Public Defender Polymer fires .45 Long Colt rounds and 2-2/"" .410 Bore shotgun shells interchangeably.    Fires .45 LC & .410 Bore Interchangeably    Lightweight Polymer Frame    Extended Ejector Rod    Ribbed Rubber Grip    Red Fiber-Optic Front Sight"

Otherwise, FTF for cash between Boston and Worcester ideally at Mass Firearms.  Must have MA LTC.  All laws will be followed.  use the link to reply.  I will check email at least once daily and reply.

Patton, Jr. According to page 1511 of Fjestad’s “The Blue Book of Gun Values”, 26th Edition, Springfield Armory began limited production of the modern M1 Garand in 2002. The new receivers use original USGI parts that have been refinished.When loaded with a bullet that expands, tumbles, or fragments in tissue, this cartridge is capable of high terminal performance… Although very similar to the military 7.62×51mm NATO specifications, the .308 cartridge is not identical, and there are special considerations that may apply when mixing these cartridges with 7.62×51mm NATO.  This one has a relined .308 Winchester barrel that is in great shape. The rifle sits in a Nice hardwood stock and has a great metal finish. So now you can get one of the greatest military rifles ever made chambered in a great military cartridge. Here are some basics on the .308 from Wikipedia: “The .308 Winchester is a rimless, bottlenecked, rifle cartridge and is the commercial cartridge from which the 7.62×51mm NATO round was derived. The .308 Winchester was introduced in 1952, two years prior to the NATO adoption of the 7.62×51mm NATO T65. Can be shipped to your location."

Model: KGP 68A. Serial Number: 101151. Year of Manufacture: Modern. Caliber: .380 ACP (9mm Kurtz) Action Type: Single Action Semi-Auto Pistol with Detachable Magazine. Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked ""Kal 9 Kurz / .380"". The left side of the frame is marked ""109950 Erma-Werke Mod. KGP 68 A"". There is an Erma emblem atop the toggle, please see pictures. The right side of the barrel is marked ""LA DISTR. New York"". The right side of the frame is marked ""Reg. Patents Made in Germany"". Barrel Length: 3 ½” Sights / Optics: The front sight is a dovetail set blade. The rear sight is a notch in the rear toggle. Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are checkered plastic with a left side thumb rest. The checkering shows little or no wear. Excellent overall condition. Type of Finish: Black Alloy and Blue. Finish Originality: Factory Original. Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp. There is no erosion in the bore. Overall Condition: This handgun retains about 98% of its metal finish. There is some wear on the top of the barrel. This appears to be holster wear. Otherwise, this gun shows only light use. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear. Overall, this handgun rates excellent condition. Mechanics: This gun has been fired only a handful of times in the past 25 years. It's been kept clean and stored free of any dust or debris. Box, Paperwork & Accessories: A factory magazine is included. Our Assessment: These are great little Luger throw-backs and perhaps the coolest carry guns there are. You get Luger styling's, PPK sizing and in the caliber of a Colt Mustang. That is literally best of all three worlds. For everyone that has always wanted to carry a Luger, but didn't find it practical, here's the best thing out there for you."

Patton, Jr. According to page 1511 of Fjestad’s “The Blue Book of Gun Values”, 26th Edition, Springfield Armory began limited production of the modern M1 Garand in 2002. The new receivers use original USGI parts that have been refinished.When loaded with a bullet that expands, tumbles, or fragments in tissue, this cartridge is capable of high terminal performance… Although very similar to the military 7.62×51mm NATO specifications, the .308 cartridge is not identical, and there are special considerations that may apply when mixing these cartridges with 7.62×51mm NATO.  This one has a relined .308 Winchester barrel that is in great shape. The rifle sits in a Nice hardwood stock and has a great metal finish. So now you can get one of the greatest military rifles ever made chambered in a great military cartridge. Here are some basics on the .308 from Wikipedia: “The .308 Winchester is a rimless, bottlenecked, rifle cartridge and is the commercial cartridge from which the 7.62×51mm NATO round was derived. The .308 Winchester was introduced in 1952, two years prior to the NATO adoption of the 7.62×51mm NATO T65."

This gun is awesome for beginners or to teach children to properly use a rifle safely, economically, and accurately. Also good for the budget conscious law abiding citizen who seeks to defend themselves and loved ones in the worst case scenario/shtf/wrol situation. Will only meet in a visible, public location.

It's a righteous firearm, but just like anything its give in take, one hell of a conversation starter and most people never seen or shot one. The round is like 500 or magnum 50 ae, is the best way for me to describe it. 9 rounds will fit in a 3rd mag of 556, it does use standard AR mags NO special mag is required and some parts or accessories are also compatible with it, just not BCG buffer etc.Am not looking for anything specific, but top of my list would be a M14 308 but not deal breaker. Just as long as it's equal trade, NO crap like Jennings high point or any firearm that takes a lot of work to make suitable for the firing range. If you have an idea just shoit the worst I could say is no.  I would like to even trade a rock island 45 somwthing else or trade plus cash. Thanks for looking and good luck."
