There are dozens of different ammunition choices with this pistol, anywhere from hollow points to high penetration rounds, all of which move at over 2000fps. This particular pistol has custom stippling on the grip as well as the slide, to ensure that you always maintain positive control of your modern day Mjolnir and are able to power stroke your slide hard enough to give Chris Costa a stroke. I love this pistol, I just need something that I can more practically carry, without spending additional money. It's had well under 500 rounds through it. I also have 1060 rounds of SS197 sporting rounds, if you want to buy fuel to keep your new nugget popper running. $1,200 for the pistol, or $1,600 for the pistol and ammo. That's roughly $18/box for the ammo, which is super cheap."

It has just been sitting in my safe collecting dust over the past year or so and I thought that it was a good time to part ways as i am trying to make room for other firearms. The only OEM parts left in it are the bolt and the lower receiver. Below are a list of modifications made to the rifle:- E.R. Shaw bull barrel (https://www.midwayusa.com/product/305251/er-shaw-barrel-ruger-10-22-22-long-rifle-920-diameter-1-in-16-twist-18-blue)- Volquartsen High Performance trigger kit with hammer and auto bolt release (https://www.midwayusa.com/product/716391/volquartsen-high-performance-action-parts-kit-plus-ruger-10-22)- Hogue stock (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H6P6BU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)- 20 MOA rail (https://www.amazon.com/Ruger-10-22-Picatinny-Scope-Mount/dp/B004VIANPE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=REDACTED&sr=8-1&keywords=10%2F22+20+moa+rail)- BSA Sweet 22 6-18x40 scope with a honeycomb sunshade- Harris 6-9 inch bipod (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TTT1WK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)With this setup, i was easily able to ping steel targets out to 300 yards (i haven't had a chance to try further). The trigger is super crisp and I set the overtravel screw on the trigger so that right after the trigger breaks, it stops, allowing you to nearly rapid fire this rifle (just for kicks).I am also including eight 10-round magazines with this and there are two sets of three that are hooked together with the tri-mag adapter (https://www.midwayusa.com/product/197535/alangator-trimag-triple-magazine-coupler-ruger-10-22-polymer-black)If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.Thanks!JustinCell: REDACTED (I prefer texts.

I have about 220 rounds through it. Come with 3, 18 rounds magazines. Here is a description of the pistol. This new generation CZ 75 SP-01 pistol especially adapted according to suggestions from Law Enforcement, Military and Police communities worldwide with an additional input from Team CZ shooters Angus Hobdell and Adam Tyc. The CZ 75 SP-01 SHADOW features: New style sights consisting of fiber optic front and Competition Style rear promote faster and more accurate target acquisition. Shadow is fitted with a newly redesigned hammer originating from the CZ 75 Champion. This hammer is slightly wider and has modified sear engagement for smoother release and more positive ignition. 85 Combat style slide without firing pin block helps to smooth the trigger pull and improve distance of trigger reset. 85 Combat Style trigger with over travel adjustment helps to remove excess rear ward trigger movement. Higher cuts beneath the trigger guard and beavertail enable a higher grip on the gun, which helps to reduce felt recoil and muzzle flip. Lighter recoil and main springs originating from original CZ 75 Specifications help to create a smoother more consistent action. Safeties as found on the CZ 75 SA are fitted as standard; these provide a larger surface area for better positioning of the thumb. Extended Magazine release allows for ease of reach and more positive ejection of magazine under stressful situations. Fully beveled magazine well, substantially improves speed and ease of reloading. Pistol is supplied with three 18 round magazines and rubber grips. This new generation of CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow pistol is designed for Law Enforcement, Military service, Self-defense, General Range Use and Competition.

Comes with 3 10 round magazines. This pistol has a polymer frame with an integral Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail, a reversible magazine release button, ambidextrous slide stop, and interchangeable backstraps for the perfect fit. It utilizes a quick defense trigger, matte finish Tenifer-coated slide and barrel for corrosion resistance. It has two drop safeties as well as a firing pin block. The PPQ M2 SD .22 has a 4.6"" threaded barrel.If this ad is up, the gun is still for sale. I am not interested in shipping the gun. OH buyers only please.
