Thanks for looking and hopefully one of ya'll will pick up this awesome shotgun! I love shooting it but I dont shoot it enough to justify keeping it when I would prefer the $$"

ABSOLUTELY NO EXPRESS OR WINGMASTER, ETC MODELS. I am looking for a tactical or police surplus, etc model.
Needs to be in good condition, Less rounds through it the better. If it comes with upgraded funiture, I'd really just prefer a magpul stock and foreend. 
If you have ammunition you'd like to get rid of, I will purchase 12GA 00-Buck or Tactical buckshot. 
Looking to spend around 400 for a stock base gun, I will go higher if you have aftermarket accessories that I like (Magpul stock mainly) and or ammunition.
 
I am located in Bellevue Washington, I'd like to meet at Low Price Guns which is in Northup way for the FFL transfer. I will pay for the transfer fee. I chose this place as it is close to me, and I have a bit of difficulty currently in terms of transportation (no car), therefore I cannot travel far to say... Everett or Tacoma to meet you.
 
Thank you for reading this post! Again, please no wingmaster or express shotguns. I'm having this as a home defense gun and not as a hunting shotgun.

Only rounds through this gun were at the factory so everything is brand new. I'm only looking to see what offers I could get since it's not exactly what I was looking for. This means I'm open to all offers, but bear in mind that this pistol is in perfect condition and I need to be firm on its value.The gun is all metal and has the ""urban grey"" finish from the factory. It also has a 5""+ threaded barrel (with thread protector), raised tritium night sights (suppressor sights), two magazines (18 rounds each), and everything that came with it in the box (including the box itself). The trigger is very smooth all around. Single action is very light and crisp. Double is reasonable especially when you have it loaded while carrying.  Comes with the parts necessary to switch between having a decocker (currently installed) or a manual safety without tools. With this gun, I will include a box or Hornady critical duty JHP and some other jhp ammo as well (75 rounds or so). What I'm looking for is another pistol better suited for my needs. You can make a cash, trade, or cash+trade offer and I will consider it. I also have a Kimber Ultra Ten II if you might be interested in both of them then we can work something out.I'm a big fan of 1911s and tactical pistols. Not into AR pistols or anything like that though. I'm long for something like an FNX or FNP 45, Glock 41 or 21, 1911, P220, etc. I'm also open to cash offers. Also, my trade/sell value is the same only because it has barely even been out of the box and never shot. Let me know if you have any questions or offers. Thank you."

Where have all the Fox 20ga. Graded guns gone? If you have been following internet sales of Fox shotguns, especially 20ga. guns, you will have noticed 2 things; there are way fewer being offered for sale and the price has risen dramatically. There are less than a handful of graded 20ga. guns in any condition being offered for sale. An average A Grade Fox 20 gauge will exceed $5000 in value by next year, mark my words. This fine little Philly Fox, sn 201569 made in 1920, is in high factory original condition…condition that you just don’t find anymore. If you have been considering a Fox A Grade in 20 gauge, now is the time. Ansley H. Fox came out with what most believe to be the best proportioned 20ga. gun made in America late in 1912. The first full year of production was 1913 and the serial number range began at 200,000 When you consider that there were only 3400 graded 20ga. Fox guns ever made, IN ALL GRADES, you understand why they are so hard to find. This fine Fox is one of 2000 Philly A Grade 20ga. guns ever made, likely less than 1700 left intact in the world! A few years back you could cruise the internet or a good collector gun show and have at least a dozen choices of A Grade or better 20 ga. guns to choose from. For the last 2 years I have been searching for good Fox small bores for my clients and they are gone! The shooting public caught on to the delightful weight and balance of the A.H. Fox 20 bore, bought them all up, and they aren't selling them. Here we have an all original A Grade with 98% case color and blue, nice clean factory wood, good shooting dimensions with 14 1/8” LOP to the factory butt plate, mirror bores, perfect screws; basically everything you would want in a high condition, hard to find Fox. You can buy this little Fox, shoot it for years, and sell it for more than you paid for it. You just can’t beat that! Thanks for looking."

Built around our newest 18” Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel. The V7 Pro comes standard with the new MFR XS 15.0 M-LOK rail, which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. An uninterrupted Picatinny rail on top and M-LOK attachment points ensure plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allow for the maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The long 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and it prevents over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnifed optics. The newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb. A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset. Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle-length gas system, this allows for shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue. The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip."

It comes with a railed handguard and a Scorpion breaching muzzle. The RAS-12 uses a piston operating system, and features a monolithic 12 gauge bolt carrier. The manual of arms is identical to the AR platform, including field-stripping.  Unlike other box magazine-fed 12GA semi-auto shotguns, the RAS 12 features an auto bolt hold open, straight insert magazines, and is easy to load and charge on a closed bolt."
