This one is Flat Dark Earth in color. It can be mounted in seconds to allows you to feel the thrill of full auto fire while remaining 100% legal. You can control the rate of fire from semi auto to short bursts to dumping a magazine. These are great fun if you have not tried one but I will warn you up front.... stock up on ammo....

$560 in cash or a little better in trade.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? this makes it a lot easier when considering.Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others, trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles, depending on value as I can build nice ones pretty cheap right now.
Folding brace and nice trigger/parts to fit a Sig P556.
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18"".
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus, AR15 and AR10's, AK type with 10"" barrel and folding brace, Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" model only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal, depending on value.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308, other similar 1-6x and 1-4x with nice clear glass, true 1x magnification, QD mounts are a plus, not interested in retail prices, I can buy online any time.Must be legal to own a firearm in TX."

The durable, injection-molded Matrix line is lightweight, comfortable, and nearly maintenance free while remaining fast in action, concealable, and easy on the budget! Like all Galco paddle holsters, the M5X locks solidly on the belt while still remaining easy to attach and remove. The M5X securely positions the handgun at the beltline with a moderate butt-forward angle, enhancing concealability yet maintaining ease and speed of draw. Twin tension units allow the user to micro-adjust the feel of the draw while retaining a proper level of firearm retention. Unlike many other harsh, mechanical-looking plastic holsters, the Matrix resembles a hand-molded Galco leather holster. The M5X paddle fits belts up to 1 3/4"". Made for semiautomatic pistols the M5X is available in right and left hand designs in black finish.Galco M5X440: M5X Matrix - Right Hand - Black Springfield Xd 9/40 Service 4"""

By using a caliber exchange kit the p320 can be changed from a full size handgun to a compact handgun to a subcompact handgun or any combinations of the three. You can also change it from a .40 s&w to a 9mm 357 Sig etc. The grip can also be fully changed instead of most handguns which only have backstraps the p320 can go from a large grip subcompact to a small grip full size.

(This one's too big for her.) I know the sigma's trigger gets a lot of flack in the firearms world and after firing this weapon once, I could see why so I got that taken care of by having the sear polished and replacing the main spring. The trigger is about 6-6.5 lbs instead of the stock 8.5 lbs and it pulls much smoother. For an entry level S&W, it's a great gun. Extremely accurate, feels good, has very little recoil, and looks good too. As you can see in the photos, this pistol is scratch free. There are almost no signs of use anywhere on the gun. It includes the hard plastic, lined case, G-Code IWB holster (shown in photo) and a second magazine. Serious inquiries only, local, cash and CCP or Purchase Permit holders only. I will ask for a copy of permit and ID for my records however, they will remain in my possession for CYA purposes."

Crisp 4-6 lb trigger pull, Bottom ejection, Fleece lined case, Instruction booklet, This is a flawless shotgun – 98%++.Price is $695 + $25 to offset ground shipping. Must ship to a FFL.I bought this gun in 1978 so my wife could join me in Nebraska pheasant hunting with our Irish Setter. To better fit my wife, the stock was professionally shortened by ¾”, making the present Length of Pull (LOP) to be 13 ½” from the trigger to the mid-back end of the recoil pad. This length was also comfortable for me as a 6-footer. It shoulders very quickly. Well, the dog kept running off and the wife really didn’t like hunting. So the gun was unused and protected in a fleece-lined case. It wasn’t fired more than a dozen times in all these years.For fast moving game or targets, holding the trigger down allows the gun to fire the instant a new round is cycled into the chamber without requiring the trigger to be released, a process known as slamfire. Otherwise, the model 37 operates in the same way as other pump-action shotguns. Rifled and field barrels are readily available."
