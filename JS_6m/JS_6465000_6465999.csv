They have a real cult following  and are starting to escalate in price.  Smith and Wesson had so much demand for them, that they have even re-released them onto the market again.  But with many re-interductions they are never quite what the originals are.  While the new ones are nice, they come eqipped with the ever ugly turn key saftey hole, blacked out trigger and hammer, and site ramp. Also they have a 4.25"" barrel.   They're are just not of the era that led to the venerable 686.  The 66-2 was only made 4 years.

The SMR MK8 is one of the first rails available to utilize the Magpul M-LOK technology. These rails are designed to give the user full modularity while maintaining a strong and rigid platform. Maximum venting at the lower 45° quadrants create maximum heat dissipation and also dramatically reduces the rail's overall weight. Utilizing Magpul's M-LOK technology at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, as well as the upper 45° quadrants. The SMR MK8 is both versatile and modular, allowing the user to tailor their platform to his or her unique needs. The SMR MK8 also features Geissele's proprietary 2"" long barrel nut. This increases the surface contact where the rail interfaces with the receiver and creates a platform that can be trusted to be straight and true the entire length of the free float rail. This increases accuracy and zero repeatability during disassembly and reassembly when performing maintenance. Bundled with a low-profile Geissele Super Gas Block, a $59 value, the SMR MK8 is not only feature packed, but it is also value packed."

To do that, I've decided to sell my Springfield 1903 Sporter .30-06. Originally used to take down deer, I can't say that it has seen much use lately. Just a case of too many guns and not enough time to shoot.
I was drawn to this particular gun because of the beautiful two-tone stock. It stands out among similar types of conversions. The bottom of the stock is sort of square, not round like most, so it shoots great off sand bags or other flat surfaces. I like how it feels in my hand.
Also important, the barrel length on this one remains the original 24"". Most people cut this down to 21"" when they make a sporter, but I like the extra velocity and accuracy you get with the 24"" barrel. It also has a nice White Line Pachmayr recoil pad.
The gun has been drilled for scope mounts and is ready for you to add your rings and scope! The gun does have a few knicks and dings in the finish, but still very nice overall! The serial number dates the 1903 to 1922.
The bolt is stamped with an R in two places. One is a regular R, and the other is a stylized R (fatter legs). One on the bolt, and one on the underside of the bolt handle. I'm thinking it is an early Remington bolt? Also, the barrel is highly polished, so most barrel markings are gone. However, you can make out ""8 22"". It would have been 8-22, but the dash has been polished out. Most of the 8 remains and 22 is clearly visible. This dates the barrel to 1922 and the serial number to 1922. I measured the barrel diameter at the crown as .3025"". This would be a 2.5 on a wear indicator.
I bet this gun would look nice sitting in your gun safe, or out in the field taking game!Cash only.  No trades.  Can meet in Fleming County or surrounding area (Bath, Rowan, Mason, Montgomery, etc.).  No haggling over price when meeting to conduct the transaction.  We will agree on price in advance and you will be able to inspect the item to make sure it is suitable and conduct the transaction.  Since this is a rifle, I can only conduct the transaction with a resident of KY who is legally able to purchase a rifle (18 and older).  You may be asked to produce ID to verify (please don't be offended, its just CYA)."
