It is constructed with a modular rail system that allows for the easy mounting of ancillary devices, fires from a closed bolt, has a collapsible buttstock, and is easily field-stripped without the need for any special tools. The straight-line construction, coupled with the low recoil of 9mm ammunition, provides highly accurate fire with less muzzle climb, especially in full automatic fire. Less recoil also facilitates ease of training and improves accuracy. The effective range of the Colt AR6951 is 100 meters.

Chambered for the .22LR cartridge, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.To Buy click>>>Heritage Rough RIder .22 6.5"""

Atop the barrel is a Picatinny rail for use with a multitude of optics as the rail allows mounting (with proper adapter) everything from unmagnified red-dot sights to variable-power glass scopes. This one has a very nice 4X16 50mm illuminated Mil-Dot reticle in green or red. It also has a custom Boyds Barracuda Forest Camo stock on it. This is the nicest stock I have ever felt on a rifle. The factory black floated stock comes with it. Also included is the box and factory stock 5 round magazine and an an extra 10 round magazine. I have over $500 in this rifle and again have never shot it. $375.  Free shipping to your FFL."

Serial #732 of 1915 Guns made. In Metal Ammo can box with every bit of paperwork. The slide has been racked once by me to assure clear when I got it new. First two photos are high quality Beretta stock photos, last one is a real picture of the real pistol I have. This fine pistol is unfired and unmolested! This single-action-only steel 92 has a frame-mounted safety and has the years 1915 and 2015 engraved in Roman numerals on either side of the Brigadier-style slide. The same numerals are featured around the medallion logo in the center of the premium-wood grip panels. The pistol, magazines, cleaning rod, and safety lock are contained in an ammo-can-style Beretta box, which also sports the anniversary dates. The Original Beretta 1915 Only a month after Italy entered the First World War on the side of the allies, Beretta patented the Model 1915, which was immediately adopted by the Italian military. The 92 Centennial tastefully imitates some of these features while also showcasing the very best of what Beretta has achieved in the intervening century. Must Ship to an FFL, I am not an FFL, so they must take shipments from Non-FFLs or buyer must pay the extra $50 for my FFL to ship. Ohio residents can pick up at my office, only, in New Albany, with proper Ohio ID/CCW license. Thanks for looking!"

I have everything that comes with this gun including: All front sights, barrel wrench, recoil spring tool, crappy cable lock, TWO TEN ROUND MAGS, all manual and warranty stuff. I have put about 200 rounds of CCI mini mags through it and there is some wear on the gun from normal use. The hammer is missing some paint from being cocked by the slide and the underslide of the slide is missing some metal were it rubs on the trigger bar ears. I called Smith and Wesson (US contact for Walther) and they have informed me this is normal wear and will not affect the function of the gun. I have pictures of these flaws so you can see them before we meet (trust me they are minor). Other than that the gun feeds MiniMags very reliably. This gun is listed right now for $280 on Bud's. I am selling for $250. I will also consider trades for a SW MP22, Ruger MK3/4, Ruger SR22. I can add cash if needed.Contact me through arms list."

The slide-in-frame design provides better recoil control than many semi-autos and the ergonomic grip and controls make carrying and handling more comfortable. The P-01 9mm variant was designed for law-enforcement and military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. The components of the P-01 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01, with no individual fitting required. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use."

Comes with 3 total Mags and item in picutes is actual firearm for sale. The HK45 is full-sized like the Universal Self-loading Pistol (USP) but with ergonomic styling like the P2000. The HK45 adds front end grip serrations on the slide, a Picatinny rail, and an O-ring polygonal barrel for increased accuracy and more consistent lock-up of the slide and barrel during cycling. HK's unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces recoil by as much as 30%, and the polymer frame with a textured ergonomic grip allows the pistol to sit lower into the web of the hand, contributing to recoil management and greater control of the weapon. This pistol features interchangeable backstraps, 3-dot sights, and an extended ambidextrous slide release. The HK45 has ambidextrous controls, enabling the control lever to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol (additional parts required); for true ambidextrous use, a control lever can be mounted on each side of the pistol.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 URG is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel. Daniel Defense upper receiver groups come complete with bolt carrier group and charging handle.

Instead of a wood stock it is a black synthetic Monte Carlo stock. Has a few light scratches on the barrel and gas tube like every other SKS but overall nice finish. No rust or pitting. Usually it's harder to come across a Romanian than a Norinco or Yugo. The Yugos are unnecessarily heavy without chrome lined barrels as well...not a fan of Yugos. You could say they're ""rare"".The rifling is strong and its a straight shooter. It is chamber in 7.62x39 which is deer legal on private land. 7.62x39 is also very plentiful and cheap for what it is. Shoots the same round as the AK and just as, if not MORE, reliable than the AK for almost half the price. There are plenty of aftermarket stocks available as well as many other accessories.Can send more pics as I can only upload 1 onto Armslist."

JHP.  This ammo comes 50 rounds to the box.  It has been properly stored in a climate controlled environment.  I don't recall when I bought it exactly, but my best guess is about 8-10 years ago.  This ammo is priced to sell at $20 per box, less than $0.50 per round.  The cheapest that I've found it on the internet is $0.71 per round.  You will not find it cheaper anywhere, and remember when comparing that I'm selling 50 round boxes, and most of what I see on the shelves now are 20 round boxes.  I also have 1 partial box of Black Hills .380 ACP, 90 gr. JHP and 1 full box of Winchester 85 gr. Silver Tip Hollow Point that if you decide to buy all of the above 8 boxes I'll throw those in free.  I'm selling this because I no longer own anything chambered in .380 ACP and have no plans to in the future.  The price is already low, so I'm not looking for lower offers.  The boxes in the picture are random boxes that I had piled up on a shelf.  Most of the boxes were in a sealed ammo can, and I've checked each box to insure that there are no quality isses and that they are fulll."
