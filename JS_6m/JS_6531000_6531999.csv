The barrel is 24 inches long, and the overall weight is approximately 7-1/2 pounds.  The stock is high-grade walnut with one or two very minor rack blemishes, which will easily be removed by polishing.  The lock plate bears “London Armoury” markings, as did the originals; the top of the barrel is marked for the manufacturer, Euroarms of America.  Supplied with the rifle are 119 cast “Minie” projectiles weighing 515 grains.  The proper charge for this gun is 60 grains FFg powder.  It is rifled and can be shot with the Minie bullets or patched round balls.  It uses a musket-size percussion cap; the nipple seat has been re-threaded to take a 5/16”x24TPI  nipple.  A nipple protector/safety cap cover is attached to the trigger guard by a brass chain. 
it is in near-new condition; I am selling because my eyes can no longer use the open sights effectively, but I have been able to consistently ring a 6” gong at 100 yards, even so.  The bore is bright, clean, and shiny.  Not shown in the picture is a wooden muzzle tompion, which will be included.
This rifle is legally an “antique” under the definitions in Federal law, and completely exempt from ALL provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968. I WILL SELL ONLY THROUGH A FACE-TO-FACE SALE FOR CASH.  NO MONEY ORDERS, NO CHECKS, CASH AND CARRY."

It also comes with really nice Glock Night Sights, on front and rear, that are bright and hold light really well! So you know, these sights are brighter than the standard Trijicons that I have on another Glock, but not quite as bright as a new set of Trijicon HD's that I just put on my G43, so these are definitely nice sights!  It also has a grip plug and comes with 2 mags and the case.  1 of the mags has a standard Pearce pinky extension on it and the other has the Pearce +1 extension so that mag will hold 11 rounds.  Asking $600 obo.  Text is best..........417-818-6one66"

It features a three position selector that allows the user to switch from Mode 1 for Safe, Mode 2 for traditional Semiautomatic Mode, or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode, the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by simply moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. * Easy to install. No custom fitting.* Better trigger pull. 4.5 pounds, +-.5 pound* The release phase now has a positive reset.* New design eliminates backup disconnector. * Stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow.* Works in most AR application: AR10 (308 WIN), AR15, MPX, etc.* Works in our F17 series in .17 WSM WITHOUT modification.* Works on .22LR uppers WITHOUT modification.* Works on 9mm uppers WITHOUT modification."
