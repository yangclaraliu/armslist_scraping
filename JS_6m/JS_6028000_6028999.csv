Just do an internet search for Moultrie D-333 for more information.The camera case has a strap that allows it to be strapped to any vertical object like a tree or post. If you are worried about leaving it out in the woods use the integrated attachment points that allow you to chain and padlock the camera for security. In addition, you can program the camera so that even if it does get ripped off it will be useless to the thief without your password to start the camera or reprogram it.Most recently we used the camera here at our house to discover that the scat left in our flower beds is from the nightly visit by a family of racoons. I've got a short video of the racoons that I captured instead of still shots once we figured out who our visitors were. This camera retails for over $100 on the clearance shelf at Cabela's. But you'd have to pay $74.99 extra for the auxiliary power Camera Battery Box that provides a long-lasting, rechargeable external power source that will extend the field life of the camera while standing up to the elements. That's a value of over $175 after sales tax and I'll include a $15 SD card with 16GB memory. The battery box does not come with a charger, but can easily be charged with any 2 amp 12v car/atv/tractor charger. The battery holds a charge well and I've had the camera record a full 10 days of night, motion activated shots between charges. If you don't want to use the auxiliary battery, the internal battery has lasted 3 nights for motion activated shots. Cash sale. We'll meet somewhere neutral here in Wichita."

The rifle dates back to 1974, and is pre-Remington, pre-safety, with the JM stamp. Condition is ""good"", for a rifle that's over 40 years old and has clearly been used, with some visible wear and scuffs on the walnut stocks and a patch of light bluing wear on the upper barrel area, but it's nothing really major. Some folks might consider the stock a good canidate for a refinish job, but there are no cracks or major dings, so I just looked at it as a little honest wear, mostly some scuffs in the varnish on the buttstock that you can see in the pics. But overall it is solid and clean, mechanically and internally, with a crisp bore and crown.If you're reading this you already know these are particularly desirable and much less common than the standard 336's, so, no, I ain't selling it for $350 like any other 336.It has see-thru rings and a Tasco scope, but the scope is an early Japanese-made model, which were of considerably higher quality than later ones made in China (though even those seem to function just fine). The scope works great, and the glass is surprisingly clear for a budget scope, there's no need to replace it with another scope for a sub-200yd deer shot.I got this in a trade a while back with a local guy I've known for decades, it functions perfectly, and is dialed in. I'm not dying to get rid of it, I'm just bored and considering some new toy, you know how that goes.I don't really have any particular trade interests other than pistols chambered in 9mm or 38, but you never know, and I'll respond politely to any serious offer. Worst I can say is ""no thanks"".Trader must be legal to own firearms, and be a Georgia resident, over age 18. As always, I'll show my DL and Ga carry permit.Thanks for looking......"

It has all of the tools and hardware to mount various heights (absolute countess, lower 1/3,and more).With a simple web search, you will find that this optic is built to last a lifetime. Quality and durability are comparable to similar Aimpoint optics at less than half the cost. Plus Vortex offers their VIP warranty, which means they'll repair or replace their products with no questions asked, and it transfers from person to person with no receipt or card to fill out. It's probably the best warranty you can get today.The lowest price I can find for this optic is $199.99, plus shipping and tax. I decided to buy a long range scope, so I'm letting this one go for $125.00."
