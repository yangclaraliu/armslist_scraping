Comes with standard top cover and optic specific top cover (currently on the rifle). Optic is a new Primary Arms microdot that hasn't even been zeroed yet. With the optic specific mount you get a 1/3 cowitness with the iron sights which is nice.

The Paracord wrapped around the stock is not glued on. Untie the knot and it'll come off. Also comes with the bayonet and yes, the rifle has the bayonet lug.

When CZ was moving from the original 75 to the 75B, the transitional models were basically 75Bs without the firing pin block and a very, very nice trigger. So, the advantages of the ""pre-B"" but it takes ""B"" parts and magazines, which are far cheaper and easier to find.I replaced the original worn barrel bushing with a Cajun Gunworks precision bushing ($60), and replaced all of the springs with new factory weight springs. The original plastic grips were also badly chipped, so I put on new factory CZ rubber grip panels.The front sight is factory, with fresh paint in the contrast markings, and the read sight has been replaced with a CGW red dot mount($50), and fitted with a Vortex Viper red dot ($180). I still have the factory steel rear sight, which I will be including with the gun.I was originally going to cerakote it (and you can too, I recommend Gun Envy here in Columbus - fantastic work and good prices), but decided to leave it as a ""sleeper"" with the original finish. It's exceptionally accurate, and feeds reliably from factory mags, Mec-Gar replacements (it does come with a brand new Mec-Gar), and also a few cheap Turkish clone magazines one of my buddies has.I may take cash for the right offer, but much prefer a trade. No long guns, bows, black powder, etc - I'm looking for a Sig other than the SP2022, preferably a P228, but I'm open to other Sigs or other interesting handguns. 9mm, please!"

Building on the lauded sub-machine gun platform that first hit the US civilian market in pistol form in 2015, the Carbine has a 16.2? barrel fitted with either a compensating muzzle brake or a faux suppressor built specifically for CZ-USA by SilencerCo.Fit with the factory's folding adjustable stock, the Carbine features a number of US-made parts to make it fully 922(r) compliant. One of the nicest features of the firearm is the updated designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor.Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Specifications:- Trigger Mechanism: SA- Caliber: 9mm Luger - Barrel Length: 16.20"" (Faux Suppressor)- Capacity: 20 Rounds- Magazine Type: Double Stack Polymer- Frame: Fiber Reinforced Polymer- Grips: Polymer, Adjustable for Reach to Trigger - Sights: Low Profile Fully Adjustable Aperture and Post, 4 Rear Aperture Sizes - Barrel: Cold Hammer Forged, Muzzle Threaded 1/2x28 - Safety: Ambidextrous Thumb- Length: 34 3/4""- Weight: 6.10 lbs CASH PRCE LISTED.

Also has cleaning kit, Maintenance kit, bullet catch tray. From what I can tell, the only thing I don't have and can't seem to find is the primer follower and maybe a spring for the powder measure. $11 for the two on Dillon's website. I added up all the pieces and then subtracted 20% to arrive at my price. The 3rd pic shows a price of 833, but i forgot the second set of dies which are $66 which makes it an even 892 after subtracting the $8 primer rod.  Ill toss in a reloading manual as well.Also has the no BS Dillon guarantee.
