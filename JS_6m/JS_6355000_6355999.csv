It is becoming hard and harder to find them in good condtion. I would like to consider this gun in really good condtion. It is NOT like new out of the box, I have shot this gun mulitple times but have always taken amazing care of it. I give it an extesive cleaning after every time I shoot it as I do all of my guns. Everything you see in the first picture will come with the gun. I have four mags two 10 round mags and two 17 round mags. Also the rail on the front does come off with just an allen wrench. If you have any questions that I did not answer above please feel free to text me. I am also willing to send more pictures if you would like. I also know what this gun is worth in the condition that it is in so no low balls or trades that arent worth about the same. My cell number is REDACTED"

I was not happy with the upper to lower fit so I returned it to Palmetto State Armory as a warranty issue. It took a punch and mallet to remove the takedown and pivot pins because they were excessively tight. The issue has been resolved and the rifle is in process of being shipped back to me now. I expect it back within the week. That being said...I have a brand new PSA KS47 rifle for sale. I have never fired it but PSA has put 15 test rounds through it. The rifle is an AR-15 style 7.62x39 that takes AK-47 magazines. In my research, they work best with Magpul Pmags and I'll include two. My rifle has the M-Lok rail and Magpul MOE grip and stock. It also has a custom engraved 7.62x39mm ejection port cover. The optic is a Primary Arms 1-6x24 ACSS with the 7.62x39/.300blk BDC reticle. It has Butler Creek covers and a 3D printed magnification throw lever. The optic mount is an American Defense AD-RECON and is brand new. I have the boxes for the rifle, scope, and scope mount. The pic shows the rifle with an AAC muzzle brake, NiB trigger, and an aftermarket charging handle. They are not included. The rifle will have an A2 flash hider, and a mil spec trigger and charging handle. I'll sell the package for $950. The base rifle alone sells for $999 with mil spec furniture. I'll also split it up and sell the rifle with two Pmags for $700 and the scope/mount package for $350. No trades, I need the cash for another endeavor.Buyer needs to possess a valid concealed carry permit or be willing to do a transfer at a local FFL dealer. Those are my requirements, no exceptions.

( fair value to me is if your gun is in similiar condition and new sells for about the same as mine that is a fair trade, I expect to get 50% of what I paid for extras.) So basically if your gun sells new for about $550 and it is mint that's fair, if it sells new for $450 then I would expect $100 cash on top.  i am talking average online pricing not msrp. make an offer. If you want ammo with let me know, if you plan to add cash let me know how much, if you expect cash on top say so. Thanks"

20 Shot string over chrony. with 18grn JSB.

Mid Pressure around = 910fps
Highest Speed = 925 fps

Selling in 600 bulk only. $200.00Winchester Varmint High Velocity ammunition was developed as a fast, extremely accurate line for varmint and predator hunters. Loaded with clean burning powder and premium, trusted bullets that deliver explosive expansion. Varmint HE ammunition delivers excellent terminal performance producing quick, humane kills. The revolutionary 17 Winchester Super Magnum is the fastest, most innovative rimfire cartridge ever developed. Based off of a 27 caliber power fastener blank, this cartridge produces centerfire velocities and energy in a more cost-efficient rimfire package. Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The flat base creates in-flight stability for long-range shooting. Hornady's swaging process creates precise formation of the core around the tip of the bullet, creating a build-up of energy which contributes to its phenomenal performance.

The invoice also lists three other orders for the same commemorative rifle also with special serial numbers for Ed Rensi #14 - the then President and CEO of McDonalds Restaurants (and Sam's brother), Ray Majka #15 - A competition shooter and instructor at the Remington Shooting School, and Morgan Freman #75 - driver of Remington's NASCAR #75 car. Each rifle was hand fitted and assembled by a custom gunsmith, believed to be Hatfield, using ""old style"" techniques and few were made during the short production span. A great looking modern flintlock that would catch the eye of every passerby and has an interesting lineage as well."

The price is $335. $35 for shipping via USPS, to wherever your 01 FFL is, or your C&R address; and of course $300 for the rifle. About the rifle, lets talk about the rifle. It DOES have a small hairline-crack, in the rear, right-hand tang. I've personally shot this rifle myself, and put 40 rounds through it, in the time I have owned it (I've shot both Privi soft-points and S&B Match ammo through it, I take care of my firearms and don't run poor ammo through them). This rifle has a very good bore, the finish is shiny and there are no signs of pitting that I can personally see. The rifling is sharp. The receiver is a New England Westinghouse one. I installed a new firing-pin spring from Howling Raven, and the bolt-action is smooth and workable as a result. Despite some obvious signs of use on the stock, and some honest wear on the gun overall, this rifle would be an excellent addition to your collection and affordable at that. Please, do go on classicfirearms, and try to find this rifle! It's out of stock on their website! This is the best deal you will get for an M39 rifle on the internet, overall. I will entertain trades that are C&R eligible. I am firm on price. I have a current and valid 03 FFL (C&R), so I can ship this rifle."
