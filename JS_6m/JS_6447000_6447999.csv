Some states have enacted laws that restrict common features, including a pistol grip and adjustable stock. Somehow they believe that these features make firearms more dangerous. For law abiding citizens that own these weapons, it could mean confiscation and possibly criminal prosecution. The FRS-15 Rifle Stock is designed help law abiding citizens keep their firearms in compliance with these laws. Replacing the pistol grip and adjustable stock with the FRS-15 rifle stock, effectively eliminates these two prohibited characteristics while preserving all of the weapons functionality. It took nearly two years of research and development for the FRS-15 Rifle Stock to reach its current form. It is an excellent blend of form and function. Shooters of all types will appreciate the feel of its traditional hunting rifle style curved grasp and solid shouldering. With multiple sling hard points and adjustable cheek rise, (optional) the FRS-15 can be easily configured for hunting, plinking, tactical training, or competition shooting."""

I purchased this gun new from a local retailer in December 2014. The PK380 is not just good looking. It is small and good looking. That makes the PK380 excellent for concealed carry. Its small grip is ideal for shooters with small hands. The slide is easy to operate, making it a good choice for women. The light weight goes unnoticed in a pocket or purse.

After deciding I wanted to cerakote some of my firearms it didnt take much research to find out there wasn't much of an option in the area for application and any of the options online are crazy high priced. Since I already had a setup for powder coating I figured I would set out to apply cerakote myself. After a couple grand invested and far too much time later here we are. After doing many of mine and many for friends and family Ive started doing it on the side as I can apply for a much lower price than the other guys. Ive posted some of my recent work, the 1911 and ak are in the very popular custom blend of burnt bronze and graphite black while the smith is coated in robins egg blue. Cerakote is by far the worlds leading gun coating option and offers many benefits past corrosion resistence and appearance. It can be applied to polymer, wood, and metal and really anything that I can get my hands on to blast and bake. I fully blast, soak and bake according to factory specifications. I use #120 AO media, acetone baths, and my ovens are 24""x28""x70"". Im running a Dessicant air dryer system to ensure satisfactory application. Im located in Abingdon so you'll have to arrange to bring your firearm to me or Ill do local pickup as Im in JC area twice a week. Email me on here for pricing and further questions as Im sure you'll have plenty.Sig , 1911 , ak , ar , pistols , rifles , glock , ruger , smith"

The slide is very easily racked having the factory dual spring recoil setup. It is a very accurate pistol being more accurate than I can shoot. With the dual springs recoil is very slight but still somewhat noticable due to size of pistol.

After deciding I wanted to cerakote some of my firearms it didnt take much research to find out there wasn't much of an option in the area for application and any of the options online are crazy high priced. Since I already had a setup for powder coating I figured I would set out to apply cerakote myself. After a couple grand invested and far too much time later here we are. After doing many of mine and many for friends and family Ive started doing it on the side as I can apply for a much lower price than the other guys. Ive posted some of my recent work, the 1911 and ak are in the very popular custom blend of burnt bronze and graphite black while the smith is coated in robins egg blue. Cerakote is by far the worlds leading gun coating option and offers many benefits past corrosion resistence and appearance. It can be applied to polymer, wood, and metal and really anything that I can get my hands on to blast and bake. I fully blast, soak and bake according to factory specifications. I use #120 AO media, acetone baths, and my ovens are 24""x28""x70"". Im running a Dessicant air dryer system to ensure satisfactory application. Im located in Abingdon so you'll have to arrange to bring your firearm to me or Ill do local pickup as Im down towards JC twice a week. Email me on here for pricing and further questions as Im sure you'll have plenty.Sig , 1911 , ak , ar , pistols , rifles , glock , ruger , smith"
