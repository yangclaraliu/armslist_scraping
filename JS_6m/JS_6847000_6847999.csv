The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.  This rifle is finished in Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™.

This machine has been mechanically maintained with genuine Honda OEM mechanical parts and regular oil and filter changes.  Never sunk in the mud / drowned under water, or wrecked.  The frame is in perfect condition, and there are no fluid leaks from the motor or mechanics.
Many new parts recently installed: drive sprocket and cover, drive chain, tension pad and rear axle sprocket replacement; the rear end was rebuilt with fresh bearings, grease and seals; a new skid plate and rear brake disc and pads were installed; the mono-shock was replaced; the front wheel bearings were cleaned and freshly repacked; the brake fluid was drained and fresh fluid put in; the carburetor was stripped down and soaked in engine block cleaner, the jets were port wire gauged and blown clear before reassembly; a new switch cluster was installed; new rear aftermarket body plastic was installed; rear and then front racks were added.
The gas tank is currently removed to be acid-flushed (done last fall once, needs a second flush and wash) and the sealer applied to the interior surface; The liquid tank liner and new gas cock/tank filter to do the job is included.
I am also including a helmet with 3/4 flip visor, gas tank saddlebags, Honda owners’ service manual, a spare grip, and some older parts like an air filter for high-dust riding, the last drive chain for spare links, and some other miscellaneous items.
Cash or certified cashier’s check only, absolutely no personal checks.  $1,000 OBO, NO TRADES.
Disclaimer:  This TRX might be considered a ‘small’ engine size to some, but it is not small on power, especially off the start.  It has a manually clutched five speed transmission (and reverse) with ‘throw your ass off the rear’ acceleration, and I would not recommend it for younger or lesser experienced riders."

Never carried, but fits perfectly inside a front pocket of your jeans, Comes with FLUSH 6+1 and EXTENDED 8+1 Magazines, the original box, and pistol manual/lock. I also upgraded the crappy E2 grips for Sig Sauer Black and Gray Piranha grips ( Added $61 +Shipping to my cost).This is a weapon I purchased NEW a little over a year ago, and before a costom holster I had ordered for pocket carry was delivered, I had already gotten used to my P224 SAS, in .40 S&W (just a little larger and thicker than the P290RS), so this one just sits in the safe. It is perfectly accurate, I've found, out to 20 + feet; the Siglight night sights are bright as newThe condition is PERFECT, with not even the hint of a smiley on the barrel!Sorry, no trades will be considered...I will ship to an FFL 2nd Day Air (buyer pays)...figure 3 pounds from 33618...probably $30-$40$375 FTF cash in the Tampa area, must have Florida DL, and sign receipts. If shipping, Post Office Money Order for both our protection.Please include an email address for more pics, in better detail. My email is:  signessmonster (at) gmail (dot)comThanks for looking!"
