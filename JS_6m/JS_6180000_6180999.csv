You know who you are, and you know you want this pistol. You know that 10mm is the most powerful standard auto pistol round (without getting ridiculous like a desert eagle) - and that it's the perfect gun for hiking in Idaho. You love the idea of taking 15 rounds of hard cast 200gr. deep penetrating high speed lead into the back country with flawless Glock reliability- and it all weighs less than that 44 mag revolver you've been packing.You may not have realized this can double as a great gun to carry once you're back in civilization. Load it up with 135gr. hollow points and now you're prepared for anything a night on the town throws your way. Since this gun comes with 3 magazines you'll also be ready for a couple reloads.I'm including a couple of holsters that you can wear inside or outside the waisteband, as well as the magazine loader that came with the gun.This is a 3rd Gen Glock 20 SF- the SF means the grip is cut out to give you a higher and tighter grip to better control the recoil. I've taken off those annoying front finger grooves for you and scalloped the trigger guard, again to allow you to get high up on the gun.Your new pistol has just been broken in- it has about 300-400 rounds through it. The trigger is set up with a NY1 spring and the 3.5lbs connector- giving you a smooth clean breaking trigger like a great double action revolver. I have the original parts as well if you want it back to stock.Price reduced after a sale fell through! Contact me quickly- this will sell fast. You can email me or message at 339-3080"

Blacklist Industries Ultra Match barrels are some of the most precise match grade barrels in the industry.  Precision Machined from certified 416R stainless steel bar stock for superior strength and durability. Critical manufacturing tolerances, multiple quality-control checks, and an advanced broach rifling process allows us to guarantee the exact same accuracy from each and every barrel while also achieving greater accuracy over a stock barrel.
 
Eight column flutes are added at safe depths which provide a custom look and finish to the barrels. Our barrels also feature a recessed crown at the muzzle. The recessed crown preserves the barrels accuracy by preventing the very edge of the rifling from being exposed or damaged in any way that can affect the dynamics of the bullet.
 
Our fully supported match chamber is compatible with all bullet materials and reduces the risk of dangerous pressure spikes that are common in most stock barrels. This is a replacement/drop in barrel, no gunsmithing required!
 
Compatible: Generations 1 - 4
Material: 416R Stainless Steel
Twist: 1/10
Drop in: Yes
Thread size: 1/2 x 28 w/ GX-1 Thread Protector
Rifling: Pulled Broach
