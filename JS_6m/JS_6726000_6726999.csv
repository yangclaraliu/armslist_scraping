The pistol has basically never left its box except to put on the pearl white grips ( i still have the original grips ). The firearm has never been shot. I'm looking to get $900 based on what I've seen them going for lately due to how hard they are to find. After the grips and the total amount it cost me it may be pretty much what i spent on it haha.  If you have any questions or would like to make an offer please feel free to contact me at any time. I would also possibly be interested in a trade for a NEW glock 26, it'd be a plus if it were a gen4 (wishful thinking) haha."
