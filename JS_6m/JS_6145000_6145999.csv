Only trades I may be interested in are ELCAN Specter DR, Sig Legion p229 357, FNX tactical, and night vision PVS-14.Description: The SIX8™ weapons are short-stroke, gas-piston operated rifles chambered in the 6.8x43mm SPC cartridge. This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.Until now, a major drawback of using the 6.8 cartridge in an M4 style weapon has been the lack of reliable magazines. So, when we designed the SIX8™ family of weapons, we started with the magazine. Partnering with Magpul®, the leader in polymer magazine engineering, we designed the first polymer 6.8 magazine. Building upon the magazine, we designed the SIX8™ platform for maximum reliability and improved ergonomics. The upper and lower receivers are designed to accommodate the slightly larger polymer magazine and to perfect the feed geometry for the 6.8 cartridge. In addition, we have prompted Federal Ammunition to develop new lines of affordably priced, high performance 6.8 ammunition for commercial, law enforcement and military applications.As with the IC family, the weapons in the new SIX8™ family are fully ambidextrous and equally suited to right- or left-handed operators. The SIX8™ rifles are based on the familiar Stoner M4/AR15/M16 architecture, but they have been optimized specifically for use with the 6.8 cartridge.The new SIX8™ family combines the ultimate in ergonomic user-friendly rifles with the outstanding mid-range 6.8 cartridge."

Only used at local gun range for practice, my guess is about 200 rounds, maybe 250. After time she just never really liked and became comfortable with the gun. We also had a full size Taurus and since it had less recoil because of weight, she always preferred shooting it. She finally asked me this week if we could just sell it. (I can't believe I am selling the Sig and keeping the Taurus LOL). The gun was just recently checked by a family friend who is a Certified Sig Armorer, I always wanted it perfectly safe for her. He did a full take down, put it back together and said it's good to go!! It's had less than 50 rounds through it since his take down.Please 21+ TN DL and a valid CCW.

A total of over 6.5 million M1 carbines of various models were manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II. Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies : the largest producer was the Inland division of General Motors, but many others were made by contractors as diverse as IBM, the Underwood Typewriter Company, and the Rock-Ola jukebox company.Features:Caliber: 9MMCapacity: 10+1Barrel Length: 18""Finish: Matte Blue Barrel, Woof FurnitureAction: Semi-AutomaticSights: Front-M1 standard fixed metal sight, Rear-M1 standard metal sight adjustable in elevation and windageSafety: Standard M1 trigger block"

The outcome is a firearm with superior suppression capability and enhanced reliability with both supersonic and subsonic loads A two-position gas block makes the transition from subsonic to supersonic as fast as flipping the lever. Changing between 300BLK and 5.56 NATO is as simple as swapping barrels and magazines in a matter of minutes. Converting to 7.62x39mm simply requires barrel, magazine, as well as an additional bolt change. Each SIG MCX features an aluminum KeyMod handguard, AR-style lower controls and utilizes standard STANAG magazines. A revolutionary recoil system does not require a buffer tube, allowing the side-folding Pistol Stabilizing Brace. A picatinny top rail allows for the mounting of lights or optics. Removable SIG SAUER iron sights come standard. The aluminum forend allows for rail sections to be added where they are needed, permitting the attachment of accessories. The lower receiver offers familiar AR-style controls. Completely ambidextrous controls include the safety, magazine release and charging handle.  The First True Mission-Adaptable Weapon System Engineered from the ground up to be short, light, and silenced, the SIG MCX features an innovative auto-regulating or two position, short-stroke gas piston operating system. And users can change barrels, calibers, stocks, and handguards in the field.  Side-Folding Pistol Stabilizing Brace This revolutionary brace offers maximum flexibility and improved single-handed shooting performance.  User-Changeable Barrel with 3-Prong Flash Hider Choose from 16-inch 5.56 NATO, 300BLK and 7.62x39 barrels offering in-field adaptability. Reducing your signature, a 3-prong flash hider comes standard.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL Rules and Regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy it online at www.copsgunshop.net."

Hi Power. Take a true classic to the range.     When it was introduced early in the 20th century, the Browning Hi Power 9mm pistol was a revelation. It offered the perfect balance of handling, size and firepower, with an impressive 13-round magazine capacity. Over the years, the Hi Power has aged gracefully and continues to have a loyal following among those “in the know.” Whether you are a novice or a seasoned shooter, you will appreciate the fine craftsmanship and function of these classic pistols, the sure heft of the machined steel frame and slide, and their natural pointability.           Even with the double-column magazine, the grip is narrow to neatly accommodate nearly every hand size, and the single-action trigger provides a smooth, consistent pull. As reliable, accurate and easy to shoot as ever. Sure, there are many, many  other full-size 9mm pistols on the market that are made to meet many different requirements. But in the end, every true firearm enthusiast should have a Hi Power in their collection. Having and shooting the best just means something.     A legend you can rely on.         The Browning Hi Power is one of the most revered pistols of all time. This ground-breaking firearm was originally designed by John M. Browning and perfected in the years following his death by Fabrique Nationale’s prolific designer, Dieudonne Saive. The Hi Power has proven itself around the world in the hands of law enforcement, military, special operations forces and law abiding citizens.

The barrel on my revolver is too long for my tastes.Also, would consider trading the revolver plus my 44 specific reloading stuff (hand primer, lee loading dies, remainder of my cast bullets (about 300 coated 240gr LSWC from lucky13) and all of my brass) for the right 357 magnum revolver. This gun has been carried in the field and has some holster wear, but still shoots great and has no rust."
