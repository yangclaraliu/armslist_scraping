On this particular one for sale, I have extended pins installed. They are hard to get in and out. I use a punch or small screw driver to push them out.I do have an anderson lower with the same lpk but with the daniel defense brown stock and grip if someone preferred that over the polyme ati lower.

I sighted it in myself. The price is set at 450 due to the quality of the woodwork and the overall quality of the rifle. Feel free to bargin.

I believe it to be a Type 38. Serial # 55275. It still has a clear chrysanthemum on the breach. This is not an original stock. The left side of the stock is somewhat discolored. The bore is fair to good condition. This is part of an estate and not 100% sure of it's firing condition but does seem to cycle ok.This gun will ship Fedex Ground for a flat rate of $35 and an FFL is required. If this is a local sale then the FFL transfer is free-no charge- done by me. A $25 savings. Feel free to ask questions. More pictures are available upon request.

I can tell you I have maybe 200 rounds thru it, and using the recommended ammo I haven't had any failures of any kind. The kit is complete and I never used any of the cleaning components.

LOCAL FACE-TO-FACE cash transactions only! I will not ship nor ask that you send me money.

Instructions say the following ammo works best: CCI Mini Mags (40 grain round nose not hollow points), Remington Golden Bullets 550/525 round bonus pack, CCI Blazers with the letter ""C"" head stamp, not the letter ""F"". 

NOT RECOMMENDED: CCI Mini Mag Hollow Points, any Winchester ammo, Federal Ammo, Remington Thunderbolts, CCI Stinger, hyper velocity ammo

Note: Remington Golden Bullets work quite well, however you will get more light stikes and inconsistent loads than with the other recommended ammo."

I have around $1,500. That number can go down or slightly up depending on what is included. Your gun must be in good-excellent condition.
I would like a Benelli M4 and a Benelli M4 only, I do not want an M1, 2 or 3 or any other semi automatic shotguns, unless your deal is absolutely spectacular. 
I would prefer the adjustable stock. I will pay a bit more if you have the extended magazine tube, but stock is acceptable if you don't have that. 
I would also really prefer a bit of ammunition to be included.
I do not want anything painted. Cerakoted is ok, but rattlecan spray paint is not. 
 
The only method of payment would be cash. We would be meeting at a mutually agreeable public space (That allows firearms, such as a range). I am rather limited transportation wise. I am in Bellevue so you may need to travel a bit. Of course, if you are traveling farther than a reasonable distance of say 30 or so minutes, I will compensate you for your gas money.
