It has the Tula factory star on the left side of the receiver. Apparently the previous owner refinished the stock, judge for yourself. There is also a chip at the bottom heel of the buttstock where it meets the buttplate, just cosmetic and in no way affects the stock's integrity. Not all matching (dust cover doesn't match and stock does not have number).I will take trade offers (No handguns though).

This rifle is outfitted with the adams Arms Piston System, a Fabrique Nationale (FN) Barrel and comes complete with 1 thirty round magazine.  The Fabrique Nationale Barrel: Barrel is marked FNMI MP 5.56 NATO 1/7.  This Barrel is a standard 20"" government profile barrel with a 1 in 7 twist. This profile is an excellent choice for the heavier 62 and 77 grain bullets and a good all-around choice for other weights.   The Adams Arms Piston System: A short stroke free floating piston system. Is Self-Cleaning. Carbon and gases are expelled forward, away from operator. Corrosive resistant coating processes. Harmonics are not transferred into the barrel. Adjustable gas settings for various applications. Doesn't vent directly to atmospheric pressure; this eliminates flash signature and supersonic crack which is optimal for night vision and suppressed fire.

This firearm may only be shipped to a licensed dealer. This item may not be legal in your state. Please know the laws of your state.

Rifle is in mint condition, maybe 50 rounds fired. Original box is included with everything that came with a new rifle. 10 round Mossberg magazine include and this rifle with accept standard AR magazines.
I will trade with or without the scope and rings. It is a Nikon BuckMasters 6-18X40 Side Focus Matte with BDC reticle, Model 6473. It is also like new and includes the factory box. It was put on this rifle new and hasn’t been on anything else.
As far as the value; that’s up to you. Here is a link to what it would cost today from Buds. Use that information however you like.
(won't let me insert tags here, but its $526 Cash price)
Here is a link from Midway where I ordered the scope. It isn’t available anymore, but that’s about the same as what I spent.
(won't let me insert tags here, but its $309)
This rifle and scope is in absolutely perfect condition. I’m just ready to trade some guns. Here is what I’m interested in...Smith & Wesson K or L frame revolvers in .357Mag. 686, 19, 66, etc. Not really interested in J-frames unless it’s a stainless .357Mag.
PCP Air Rifles. I been kicking this idea around. But if you offer a trade it has to include a set-up ready to shoot, so it must include a pump or bottle.
Micro pistols… maybe if you have something interesting. I’d like to stay away from .380 but haven’t ruled them out.
Not interested in Black Powder, Pump shotguns, archery, or anything in rough condition.
Money can go either way. If we trade firearms I require ID showing you are a Tennessee Resident 21 or over and a signed bill of sale (I will provide). I’m in the Murfreesboro/Shelbyville area.
I will also be putting up a Kahr MK40 and an S&W M&P40C Leo version, both in mint condition as soon as I get the pics and descriptions together."
